Prior research demonstrates that coparenting is susceptible to developmental transitions that bring about changes in family roles and relationships. However, longitudinal research on coparenting during later phases of family life, when family circumstances and offspring\u2019s adolescent development pose new sets of challenges for mothers and fathers, is far more limited. The goal of this dissertation was to explore questions about how changes in coparenting are linked to adolescent development, and the dynamic links with individual adjustment, family processes, and the broader social and cultural context in which families are embedded. Multiple methods were used to examine longitudinal changes in coparenting in separate ethnic-homogenous samples of two-parent families with adolescent offspring. \n \tThe goal of the first study was to chart the trajectory of coparenting satisfaction as a function of marital duration in155 two-parent African American families, and to examine the links between marital characteristics and changes in coparenting satisfaction over time. Multilevel growth curve models revealed an inverted-U quadratic pattern of change in coparenting satisfaction across the first two decades of marriage for both mothers and fathers, but this effect was qualified by youth age, such that the quadratic pattern was evident in families with older but not younger offspring. Increases in marital love were linked to increases in coparenting satisfaction, increases in marital conflict were associated with declines in coparenting satisfaction, and these links were stronger for fathers than to mothers.\n \tUsing the same sample of two-parent African American families, study two described changes in coparenting satisfaction as a function of offspring age, and examined the role of sociocultural stressors (economic strain, racial discrimination) and supports (socio-economic resources, religiosity) for coparenting satisfaction over time. Multilevel growth curve analyses revealed that changes in coparenting satisfaction differed for mothers and fathers: Mothers were less satisfied on average but showed no change over time whereas fathers experienced a linear decline, becoming less satisfied with coparenting over the course of youth\u2019s adolescent development. Findings were generally consistent with hypotheses that stressors were negatively linked and religiosity was positively related to coparenting satisfaction. Findings for racial discrimination and income differed by parent and highlighted gender dynamics within couple relationships.\n \tStudy three examined two dimensions of coparenting in two-parent European American families of adolescents -- shared decision-making and shared time with offspring -- and assessed the bidirectional associations between dimensions of coparenting and boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 risky behaviors and depressive symptoms across four time points (six years) of adolescent development. Across adolescence, parents of boys made more decisions together than parents of girls, and shared triadic time occurred relatively infrequently for all families. Parents\u2019 shared decision-making was linked to fewer risky behavior problems for boys one year later, and boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 risky behavior problems were linked to lower shared decision-making one year later; there were no significant links between shared decision making and depressive symptoms. Coparents\u2019 shared time with offspring was bidirectionally related to both risky behaviors and depressive symptoms, and these links were present earlier in adolescence for girls\u2019 than for boys.\n \tThese studies confirm that evaluations of coparenting are susceptible to changes that coincide with offspring\u2019s adolescence, and results elucidated some of the family and sociocultural factors that contribute to mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 coparenting satisfaction. Findings also suggest that dimensions of coparenting practices had distinct implications for boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 adjustment at different points in adolescence. Discussions center on coparenting as a fundamental family systems dynamic and suggest future directions for research on coparenting during adolescence.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1810], "author_name_tesi": "Riina, Elizabeth Marie-Blanche", "last_name_ssi": "Riina", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie-Blanche", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Mc Hale", "Susan Marie Mc Hale", "J Douglas Coatsworth", "Michael J Rovine", "Alysia Blandon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Mc Hale, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Marie Mc Hale, Committee Chair", "J Douglas Coatsworth, Committee Member", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member", "Alysia Blandon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coparenting", "family systems", "adolescence", "development"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Planar Antenna Arrays for Correlation Direction Finding Systems for use on Mobile  Platforms", "id": "16222", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8192", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Radio direction finding systems estimate the \\emph{direction-of-arrival} of electromagnetic signals.

Specifically, the use of wet-layup and pre-preg unidirectional CFRP laminas in single-layer and two-layer circuit-analog absorbers were studied. The basic layup of the single-layer absorber used a unidirectional CFRP sheet, a closed cell vinyl foam spacer, and a ground plane. The two-layer absorber added an additional foam spacer and unidirectional CFRP sheet. In order to properly use the unidirectional CFRP, the complex apparent permittivity and surface-impedance properties were characterized as a function of polarization with respect to the fiber orientation using a free-space materials characterization system operating from 4 - 18 GHz. Transmission-line models as well as full-wave models used the characterization data to model the performance of prototype absorbers. The surface-impedance properties were used in the transmission-line models as this technique provided insights into the absorber performance based on circuit concepts. The prototype absorbers were measured in a reconfigurable test fixture such that cured sandwich constructions did not have to be fabricated to study various areal-weight unidirectional CFRP sheets. The maximum-absorption configurations for the single-layer cases were found to be dependent on the polarization with respect to fiber orientation. In the two-layer configurations, an optimization scheme was used to properly select the fiber orientation of each layer to create desired absorption profiles. In summary, the anisotropic surface-impedance properties of unidirectional CFRP sheets were found to be extremely useful for the development of circuit-analog absorbers.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16393], "author_name_tesi": "Riley, Elliot Jay", "last_name_ssi": "Riley", "middle_name_ssi": "Jay", "first_name_ssi": "Elliot", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Timothy Joseph Kane", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Kevin L Koudela", "Erik Henry Lenzing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ram Mohan Narayanan, Dissertation Advisor", "Ram Mohan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Committee Member", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member", "Kevin L Koudela, Outside Member", "Erik Henry Lenzing, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Circuit-analog absorbers", "Unidirectional carbon fiber", "Radar-absorbing structures"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Development of a Correlation for Nucleate Boiling Heat Flux on a Hemispherical Downward Facing Surface", "id": "14213", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7347", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new physics-based heat transfer correlation has been developed that can be used to predict the local variation of the nucleate boiling heat flux on a downward facing heating surface.  It is widely known that the heat transfer mechanism of nucleate boiling involves the growth and departure of vapor bubbles on a heated surface.  When the vapor bubbles have grown to their mature size, they depart from the heating surface, agitating the surrounding fluid.  This bubble agitation results in strong turbulent mixing of the fluid.  For the case of an upward facing surface, the nucleate boiling heat flux has been determined using the single-phase turbulent heat transfer correlation.  The correlation relates the Nusselt number to the Reynolds number and Prandtl number.  Through the use of proper velocity and length scales, Rohsenow (1952) developed a correlation to predict the nucleate boiling heat flux on an upward facing surface.  The resulting correlation relates the nucleate boiling heat flux to the wall superheat and fluid properties and a correlation coefficient.\nFor the case of downward facing boiling on a hemispherical surface, however, the Rohsenow correlation cannot be applied.  Due to the surface orientation, buoyancy effects have a significant impact on the behavior of the flow and heat transfer.  The heating surface causes the fluid in close proximity to increase in temperature, lowering the density of the fluid.  When the liquid begins to vaporize, the density of the resulting vapor is several orders of magnitude less than the surrounding liquid, resulting in strong buoyancy forces that entrain the liquid upward.  The downward facing surface hinders this upward motion of vapor bubbles, causing them to have to take an alternative upward route.  If the surface is inclined, the bubbles will flow along the heating surface which develops into a two-phase boundary layer flow.  When the surface is completely horizontally downward facing, the bubbles cannot flow along the surface, forming a vapor blanket from which bubbles shear off.\nThe Rohsenow correlation relates the nucleate boiling heat flux to only wall superheat and fluid properties.  Local variation does not appear in the correlation because the nucleate boiling heat flux conditions are equivalent at all locations of an upward facing surface.  On a downward facing hemispherical surface, however, local variation plays a significant role in the nucleate boiling heat flux.  At the bottom of the hemispherical surface, the buoyancy force presses the vapor bubbles against the surface.  As the local coordinate along the surface is increased, the buoyancy forces have an increasing impact on the flow characteristics and, thus, the heat flux.\nThe present study has successfully captured the local buoyancy effects and local variation of the nucleate boiling heat flux on a downward facing surface.  The correlation predicts the nucleate boiling heat flux based on the wall superheat, fluid properties, and, most importantly, local variation along the heating surface.  Similar to the Rohsenow correlation, the correlation for the present study is derived from a bubble-induced flow mixing Nusselt number correlation.  The length and velocity scales are chosen based on a scale analysis of the momentum and energy equations for a buoyancy-driven boundary layer flow.  The correlation coefficient is calculated based on the particular flow geometry under consideration.  For this study, the correlation coefficients are calculated for the AP600 and Korea Next-Generation Reactor (KNGR) nuclear reactors.  The new correlation successfully predicts the nucleate boiling heat flux for a downward facing surface.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7314], "author_name_tesi": "Riley, Michael Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Riley", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nucleate Boiling", "Critical Heat Flux", "Pool Boiling", "Heat Transfer", "Buoyancy Driven Flow", "Buoyancy Driven Heat Transfer"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Spacer Grid Induced Heat Transfer Enhancement In A Rod Bundle Under Reflood Conditions", "id": "24952", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10880", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new correlation has been developed in this work that accurately models and predicts the effects of both the upstream and downstream spacer grids on single-phase heat transfer. When the steam flow encounters a spacer grid, it must restructure in order to get around the spacer grid straps. In addition, the spacer grids cause a sudden contraction and expansion of the flow. This causes the turbulence in the flow to increase at the spacer grid that subsequently decays downstream. Since the flow is a continuum, there cannot be any discontinuities. In other words, the spacer grid effect also occurs upstream of the spacer grid. The single-phase upstream-downstream spacer grid heat transfer enhancement model developed in the present study accurately predicts both the downstream and upstream effects of a spacer grid on the heat transfer enhancement.\nSimilar spacer grid effects occur in two-phase flow, under the DFFB regime with the addition of a second-stage effect occurring downstream of a wet spacer grid. The second-stage enhancement occurs approximately ten diameters downstream of the trailing edge of the spacer grid, as observed experimentally. Due to the high relative velocity between the vapor and the liquid film on the spacer grid, liquid ligaments are being sheared off of the spacer grid and subsequently break up into liquid droplets. The flow must restructure itself in order to get around the droplets, similar to flow restructuring around spacer grid straps. In this work, a theoretical model is developed that describes the underlying physics behind the second-stage heat transfer enhancement observed downstream of a wet spacer grid.\nThe large break loss of coolant accident (LOCA) is a hypothetical design basis scenario that must be addressed as part of nuclear power plant licensing. This particular accident scenario is analyzed in order to ensure that the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) is sufficient to prevent fuel rod cladding temperatures from exceeding the regulatory limit of 1478 K (2200 degrees F). The core operating power is generally dependent on the large break LOCA analysis. During a LOCA, the fuel rods become uncovered and the temperature could increase rapidly. Without sufficient cooling, the fuel rods and other materials in the reactor, collectively known as the corium, could melt and relocate to the bottom of the reactor vessel. If this were to happen, the corium could potentially breach the vessel, resulting in a catastrophic nuclear accident.\nIn order to effectively terminate the progression of the accident in the event of a LOCA, the rod bundle is flooded with coolant to ensure that the temperature of the fuel rods and other materials does not rise above acceptable limits. This calls for an accurate prediction of the thermal hydraulics during reflood transients such that nuclear reactors can be safely designed and operated.\nAt the beginning of reflood, the rod bundle is cooled by single-phase steam convection. As more coolant is injected into the rod bundle, cooling becomes dominated by film boiling. Depending on the rate of coolant injection, three film boiling regimes may exist: dispersed flow film boiling (DFFB), inverted annular film boiling (IAFB), and inverted slug film boiling (ISFB). DFFB typically occurs under low flooding rates and is characterized by the flow of a continuous vapor with dispersed liquid droplets. IAFB typically occurs under high flooding rates and is characterized by the flow of a continuous liquid core surrounded by the flow of a continuous vapor near the wall. ISFB typically occurs under high flooding rate conditions as well, but occurs downstream of IAFB when the continuous liquid core has broken up, as a result of hydrodynamic instability, into large liquid slugs.\nFuel assemblies consist of an array of fuel rods and a thimble tube that contain control rods that can shut down the reactor when inserted. The rod bundles are structurally maintained by several spacer grids, along with the top and bottom nozzles of the assemblies. The spacer grids have been found to have significant effects on flow in a rod bundle during a LOCA. The present work focuses on single-phase steam cooling and the effects that spacer grids have on the thermal hydraulics of single-phase flow and heat transfer. It is important to understand and accurately model single-phase flow and heat transfer to provide a basis for understanding and modeling two-phase heat transfer.\nThe models developed in this work can be implemented into safety analysis codes to more accurately predict the thermal hydraulics behavior of reflood transients. The models can also be used as a basis for the understanding and development of two-phase heat transfer models.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10473], "author_name_tesi": "Riley, Michael Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Riley", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Timothy Miller", "Dr Stephen Bajorek", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Cengiz Camci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung, Dissertation Advisor", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Chair", "Timothy Miller, Committee Chair", "Dr Stephen Bajorek, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Reflood", "Dispersed Flow Film Boiling", "Spacer Grid", "Heat Transfer Enhancement", "Two-Phase Flow", "Loss of Coolant Accident"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PREPARATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SOURCES FOR ULTRA-HIGH RESOLUTION MICROCALORIMETER ALPHA SPECTROMETRY", "id": "9663", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2708", "abstract_tesi": "The determination of actinide isotopes in nuclear forensic samples is critical for assessing the provenance of nuclear material. Current techniques used for nuclear forensics to gain isotopic information are slow and labor intensive, requiring extensive radiochemical separations and purification prior to analysis by mass spectrometry. Due to this limitation, a new ultra-high resolution alpha particle detection system is being jointly developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This new system uses a microcalorimeter detector, and is capable of performing an isotopic analysis in fraction of time compared to old techniques. The preparation of the high-quality thin layer sample sources has been one of the major challenges associated with the routine used of this new detector system. This manuscript details the development and characterization of the new sample preparation methods required to produce uniform thin layer sources required to realize the full potential of microcalorimeter alpha spectrometry. \n\nAlpha particle emitting sources were prepared using an electrodeposition method optimized for preparing the 4.76 mm diameter sources required for the microcalorimeter alpha spectrometer at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The microcalorimeter is an ultra-high resolution detector has nearly an order of magnitude resolution improvement over the conventional silicon based alpha spectrometry, which facilitates the simultaneous determination of multiple isotopes which cannot be individually resolved using traditional silicon detector based alpha spectrometry methods. The resolution of the microcalorimeter, estimated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM), ranged from 1.00 to 2.5 keV, and represents a 75 to 88% improvement in resolution over a silicon alpha detector system. This improvement in resolution makes possible the determination of forensically important actinide signature radionuclides, for example Pu-239 and Pu-240, that cannot be resolved using silicon detector. The microcalorimeter resolution was, however, extremely sensitive to the quality of the sample. Samples which were contaminated with trace impurities produced degraded microcalorimeter spectra. Column ion-exchange chromatography was used to clean the stock actinide sample solution from any contaminants, and demonstrate improved resolution. \n\nThe quality and uniformity of sample source surfaces was investigated using two surface characterization techniques; fission track analysis (FTA) and secondary electron microscopy (SEM). FTA was performed using a 1.0 MW TRIGA nuclear reactor at Penn State as a neutron source to induce fission reaction in U-233 samples. The results from fission track analysis showed that the actinide was distributed uniformly when electrodeposited on a titanium substrate. Based on the absence of any fission tracks forming star pattern, which indicates the agglomeration of actinides, and the number of individual fission tracks produced, clusters of actinides were less than approximately 100 nm in size. SEM images of electrodeposited sources showed the formation of approximately 100 nm size spherical particles on the surface.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2703], "author_name_tesi": "Rim, Jung Ho", "last_name_ssi": "Rim", "middle_name_ssi": "Ho", "first_name_ssi": "Jung", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu", "Kenan Unlu", "Stephen La Mont", "Jack Brenizer Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu, Thesis Advisor", "Kenan Unlu, Thesis Advisor", "Stephen La Mont, Thesis Advisor", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["microcalorimeter", "alpha spectrometry", "fission track", "SEM", "actinide"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development of Novel Method for Rapid Extract of Radionuclides from Solution Using Polymer Ligand Film", "id": "19976", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9353", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Accurate and fast determination of the activity of radionuclides in a sample is critical for nuclear forensics and emergency response. Radioanalytical techniques are well established for radionuclides measurement, however, they are slow and labor intensive, requiring extensive radiochemical separations and purification prior to analysis. With these limitations of current methods, there is great interest for a new technique to rapidly process samples. This dissertation describes a new analyte extraction medium called Polymer Ligand Film (PLF) developed to rapidly extract radionuclides. Polymer Ligand Film is a polymer medium with ligands incorporated in its matrix that selectively and rapidly extract analytes from a solution. The main focus of the new technique is to shorten and simplify the procedure necessary to chemically isolate radionuclides for determination by alpha spectrometry or beta counting. \nFive different ligands were tested for plutonium extraction: bis(2-ethylhexyl) methanediphosphonic acid (H2DEH[MDP]), di(2-ethyl hexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP), trialkyl methylammonium chloride (Aliquat-336), 4,4'(5')-di-t-butylcyclohexano 18-crown-6 (DtBuCH18C6), and 2-ethylhexyl 2-ethylhexylphosphonic acid (HEH[EHP]). The ligands that were effective for plutonium extraction further studied for uranium extraction. The two ligands, H2DEH[MDP] and HDEHP, which showed effectiveness in plutonium extraction were extensively studied. The extraction of strontium was exclusively studied with DtBuCH18C6. This particular ligand was effective for strontium separation in resin bead form. However, in PLF form, the ligand became completely ineffective for strontium extraction. \nThe plutonium recovery by PLFs has shown dependency on nitric acid concentration and ligand to total mass ratio. H2DEH[MDP] PLFs performed best with 1:10 and 1:20 ratio PLFs. 50.44% and 47.61% of plutonium were extracted on the surface of PLFs with 1M nitric acid for 1:10 and 1:20 PLF, respectively. HDEHP PLF provided the best combination of alpha spectroscopy resolution and plutonium recovery with 1:5 PLF when used with 0.1M nitric acid. The overall analyte recovery was lower than electrodeposited samples, which typically has recovery above 80%. However, PLF is designed to be a rapid field deployable screening technique and consistency is more important than recovery. PLFs were also tested using blind quality control samples and the activities were accurately measured. It is important to point out that PLFs were consistently susceptible to analytes penetrating and depositing below the surface. The internal radiation within the body of PLF is mostly contained and did not cause excessive self-attenuation and peak broadening in alpha spectroscopy. The analyte penetration issue was beneficial in the destructive analysis. The extra plutonium contained in the PLF body gave additional signal in the analysis. Plutonium was successfully back-extracted from PLF and procedures were established for isotopic analysis by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). H2DEH[MDP] PLFs showed few advantages over HDEHP PLFs. H2DEH[MDP] PLFs showed better sample recovery consistency than HDEHP. The sample to sample variation in plutonium recovery was comparable to variation observed with electrodeposited samples. H2DEH[MDP] PLF was also capable of co-extracting or selectively extracting plutonium over uranium depending on the PLF composition. With 1:5 H2DEH[MDP] PLF, about 23% of plutonium and 20% uranium were co-extracted. On the other hand, both 1:10 and 1:20 PLFs were preferably extracting plutonium over uranium at the same condition.\nH2DEH[MDP] PLF was tested with environmental samples to fully understand the capabilities and limitations of the PLF in relevant environments. The extraction system was very effective in extracting plutonium from environmental water collected from Mortandad Canyon at Los Alamos National Laboratory with minimal sample processing. Soil samples were tougher to process than the water samples. Analytes were first leached from the soil matrixes using nitric acid before processing with PLF. This approach had a limitation in extracting plutonium using PLF. The soil samples from Mortandad Canyon, which are about 1% iron by weight, were effectively processed with the PLF system. Only 5.11x10-3% of iron from soil was leached using 1M nitric acid. The Rocky Flats soils with higher iron content (2.6%) were unsuccessfully processed with PLF for plutonium extraction. The leached solutions from the soil with higher iron concentration had dark reddish color, which indicates a presence of large concentration of iron. The large amount of iron in leached solution interfered and rendered PLF ineffective for analyte extraction. No detectable activities were measured from Rocky Flats samples processed with PLFs.\nEven with certain limitations of the PLF extraction system, this technique was able to considerably decrease the sample analysis time. The entire environmental sample was analyzed within one to two days. The decrease in time can be attributed to the fact that PLF is replacing column chromatography and electrodeposition with a single step for preparing alpha spectrometry samples. The two-step process of column chromatography and electrodeposition takes a couple days to a week to complete depending on the sample. The decrease in time and the simplified procedure make this technique a unique solution for application to nuclear forensics and emergency response. A large number of samples can be quickly analyzed and selective samples can be further analyzed with more sensitive techniques based on the initial data. A procedure was established to perform TIMS analysis and plutonium isotopics were measured in a number of PLF samples. The deployment of a PLF system as a screening method will greatly reduce a total analysis time required to gain meaningful isotopic data for the nuclear forensics application.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9155], "author_name_tesi": "Rim, Jung Ho", "last_name_ssi": "Rim", "middle_name_ssi": "Ho", "first_name_ssi": "Jung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Igor Jovanovic", "Danny Glynn Sykes", "Dominic S Peterson", "Stephen La Mont"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu, Committee Chair", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member", "Igor Jovanovic, Committee Member", "Danny Glynn Sykes, Committee Member", "Dominic S Peterson, Special Member", "Stephen La Mont, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PLF", "Actinide", "Plutonium", "Uranium", "Environmental", "Extraction", "H2DEH[MDP]", "HDEHP", "Separation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Hybrid human-computing distributed sense-making:  Extending the SOA paradigm for dynamic adjudication and optimization of human and computer roles", "id": "19303", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9288", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In many evolving systems, inputs can be derived from both human observations and physical sensors.

Additionally, it provides a prototype system implementation and a simulation experiment to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed techniques.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9094], "author_name_tesi": "Rimland, Jeffrey C", "last_name_ssi": "Rimland", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David J Hall", "David J Hall", "Michael Mc Neese", "Guoray Cai", "Mark Edward Ballora", "Stephen Shaffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David J Hall, Dissertation Advisor", "David J Hall, Committee Chair", "Michael Mc Neese, Committee Member", "Guoray Cai, Committee Member", "Mark Edward Ballora, Committee Member", "Stephen Shaffer, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Information fusion", "Complex event processing", "Sonification"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on U.S. Water Rights Markets: Price Efficiency, Welfare Gains, and Institutions", "id": "14691rzr143", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14691", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is composed of three essays that analyze different issues concerning water markets in the U.S. The first essay investigates whether water rights markets in the U.S. are efficient, and compares them to other natural resource markets.

These instruments were developed around new advances in analogue to digital (ADC) conversion called flexible resolution.  Unlike the traditional ADC architecture, which interleaves multiple 8-bit ADCs to achieve higher resolution, the digitizers used within this manuscript allows multiple high-resolution ADCs to be applied to the input channels in different time-interleaved and parallel combinations to boost either the sampling rate or the resolution.  The result is instrumentation capable of changing resolution (8-14 bit), which helps to increase the signal-to-noise ratio by more than an order of magnitude.  For each instrument, the spectral and temporal range is explored with an emphasis on the sensitivity and collection time. The detection limit of both nanosecond instruments was calculated to be 10-5 O.D.\nExample materials were studied on both nanosecond instruments to show their capability in real-world applications with systems such as P3HT:PCBM, CN-MEH-PPV and TIPS-pentacene. The mid-IR instrument provided some of most sensitivity spectra ever recorded in the mid-IR, such as alkyne stretches measuring < 100 \u03bcO.D. in TIPS-pentacene films on a nanosecond timescale. The ability to record such data within a reasonable time frame makes possible for significantly lower energy densities to be used in studying organic electronic materials. \nOur ultrafast laser system was expanded to perform visible pump\u2015visible pump spectroscopy and our preexisting visible pump\u2015mid-IR pump was redesigned with new technologies such as remote connectivity. All of the instrument\u2019s programming was redone using MATLAB\u2015streamlining our data collection and analysis. Important advances were made in terms of data acquisition time and statistical filtering using the new software as well. The redesigned system allowed us to start exploring perylene diimide solutions for unique vibrational modes due to excimer formation. Lastly, these advances have opened the door to developing a new kind of ultrafast technique termed pump-push-probe, which allows for photophysics to be studied on functioning organic electronic devices. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12720], "author_name_tesi": "Rimshaw, Adam ", "last_name_ssi": "Rimshaw", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John B Asbury", "John B Asbury", "Mark Maroncelli", "Benjamin James Lear", "Enrique Daniel Gomez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John B Asbury, Dissertation Advisor", "John B Asbury, Committee Chair", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ultrafast Spectroscopy", "Nanosecond Spectroscopy", "Organic Photovoltaics", "Organic Solar Cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Development in Dialogic Teaching Skills: A Micro-Analytic Case Study of a Pre-Service ITA", "id": "9929", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1761", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As universities have come to depend increasingly on international, non-native English-speaking graduate students to teach many of the undergraduate courses, they have created International Teaching Assistant (ITA) programs in order to provide ITAs with the cultural, pedagogical, and linguistic skills needed to instruct in an American university setting. While research has contributed much to the discovery of linguistic factors affecting ITA effectiveness and has argued for greater attention to pedagogy and cultural training in ITA courses, few studies have investigated what the development of these pedagogical skills actually looks like in training, or traced the changes ITAs make in order to become more recognizably teacher-like. This has left a rather large gap in the literature between the design phase of ITA training programs and their actual practices in the classroom.\n\nThis dissertation investigates what pedagogical skills one pre-service ITA develops in one particular practice during a semester-long training course. The practice of interest is the dialogic lecture, which is a particular kind of interactive lecture that seeks to engage or \u2018dialogue with\u2019 the students in discussion during class time. The corpus of analyzed data is comprised of four instances of one pre-service ITA\u2019s participation in the practice of dialogic teaching for a total of 29 minutes of interaction collected over a period of 8 weeks. In the study, I utilize a framework of language socialization in tandem with a theoretically compatible framework of language use, interactional competence (IC). The IC framework is interested in the description of interactive practices and the resources individuals utilize to participate in them. Using primarily conversation analysis (CA), I investigate two components of the IC framework (i.e. action sequencing and participant frameworks) in order to capture the dynamic unfolding of the specific practice of the dialogic lecture, as well has how the patterns of participants\u2019 participation in this practice changes over time.\n\nThe analysis of the component of action sequencing showed several changes in the ways the ITA structured and performed the sequences in the dialogic lecture. First, the ITA became more attentive to the importance of establishing and maintaining engagement and rapport with his students during both the opening and closing sections of the lecture through attention to verbal greetings, leave takings, eye contact, and body positioning. He also became more explicit in the discourse markers and announcements used to signal transitions between sections of the lecture, indicating increasing awareness of the importance of organizational markers to lecture clarity. Lastly, he showed an increasing repertoire of verbal leave taking phrases. In terms of development in participant frameworks, changes were found in the ITA\u2019s orientation to the roles of teacher versus student three different areas: (1) increases in the use of classroom-specific language, (2) leave-taking practices, and (3) spatial and non-verbal orientation to the \u201cteacher\u201d space. These changes provide evidence of the ITA becoming more recognizably teacher-like over the course of the semester. \n\nThis study contributes to the literature in several areas. First, it presents evidence of how development can be traced longitudinally using CA, thereby expanding the methods of inquiry one can use to study learning. Second, it illustrates how we can expand the object of analysis of what is learned in terms of interactional resources. Third, it shows how using a framework of IC expands what we know about how identity is locally constructed and displayed in interaction. Finally, it informs ITA educators by demonstrating how institutional constraints can affect dialogicality and by adding interactional competence to the areas in which ITAs are evaluated, thus shifting the discourse from one of ITA \u201cdeficits\u201d to one of ITAs as skilled interlocutors who manage the resources they do have with their interlocutors in dynamic ways.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1747], "author_name_tesi": "Rine, Emily F.", "last_name_ssi": "Rine", "middle_name_ssi": "F.", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Kelly Hall", "Kelly M Hall", "Steve L Thorne", "Dr Paula Golombek", "Meredith Christine Doran", "Dr Johannes Wagner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Kelly Hall, Dissertation Advisor", "Kelly M Hall, Committee Chair", "Steve L Thorne, Committee Member", "Dr Paula Golombek, Committee Member", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Member", "Dr Johannes Wagner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ITA", "International Teaching Assistant", "conversation analysis", "interactional competence", "language socialization"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Associations Between Feeding Mode and Hair Manganese Concentrations in Infants", "id": "14449", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7376", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tManganese (Mn) is an essential nutrient, required for growth, development, and health.  However, at toxic levels Mn has been shown to lead to cognitive and behavioral deficits in infants and children.  Mn toxicity from environmental exposures such as air and water has been associated with decreased intelligence quotient (IQ), externalizing and internalizing behaviors, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.  Infant formulas are highly concentrated sources of Mn, containing as much as 50-80 times the amount of Mn as human breast milk.  Despite the extreme differences in Mn concentration between infant formula and breast milk, formula has not been well studied as a source of exposure to Mn.  The present study investigated Mn status in formula fed and breastfed infants to determine the deposition of Mn from dietary sources in hair. \n\tInfants 3-6 months of age and their mothers were recruited from State College, Pennsylvania, and the surrounding area.  Infants were either predominantly breastfed (n=34) or predominantly formula fed (n=19).  Hair samples were collected from mothers and infants, and were analyzed for Mn, arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb).  Mothers provided tap water samples from home, which were analyzed for Mn, As, Cd, and Pb.  Infant formula samples were also collected for infants who were formula fed, and were analyzed for Mn.  \n\tInfant and maternal hair concentrations were within normal ranges for Mn, As, and Cd.  Infants had slightly elevated Pb as measured in hair (mean: 6.22 \u00b5g/g), but mothers did not (mean: 0.34 \u00b5g/g).  Tap water samples were not elevated in Mn, As, Cd, or Pb compared to acceptable limits, though Pb concentration was significantly higher in tap water samples from breastfed infants than from formula fed infants (means: 1.77 vs. 0.82 \u00b5g/g, respectively).  Infants who were breastfed did not differ in hair Mn concentrations from infants who were formula fed.  Salient predictors of maternal hair Mn concentrations included water Mn concentration, employment status, and education.  Maternal hair Mn concentration and infant hair As concentration were significant predictors of infant hair Mn concentration in the fully adjusted regression model.  The present findings suggest that ingestion may not be an important exposure mechanism for Mn toxicity in infants compared to environmental exposures.

This research focuses on how scale has been theorized in analyses of institutions and governance.  While discussions of institutions have focused on regulatory networks, related processes, and the mutual constitution and evolution of economic, cultural, and political practices, previous studies have conceptualized institutions as regional or localized manifestations of regulation rather than as outcomes of strategic interactions at and among particular scales.  Similarly, there has been little discussion of scale and its role in forms of collective action undertaken by state and non-state actors.   This study contributes to this literature, then, by demonstrating how scale is used by social actors to mediate and restructure power relations.  The study also provides an alternative conceptualization of the state and civil society, one that emphasizes complex relations within and between them, rather than simple oppositions.  In the study, scale is used to describe the multiple forms of social activity imagined and produced in ways that assume, require, refer to, or seek particular geographical relationships.  In describing the role of scale in structuring social activity, I draw attention to how social actors use multiple senses of scale in fluid, overlapping, and sometimes even contradictory ways.  This perspective recognizes the agency of institutions and groups who strategically draw on geographical relationships to create particular political or social outcomes, whether quantifying the extent or significance of a phenomenon in areal terms, facilitating the coordination of local, regional, and supra-regional resources, or seizing opportunities at territorialized juridical levels of the state.  The conception of scale in this manner has parallels with social ecology, inasmuch as scale links contextual factors such as community, environment, and public policy with collective action and behavioral change.  \n\nIn this dissertation I approach scale from an organizational perspective with respect to collective action to address my primary question: what is the significance of scale in the strategies pursued by governance coalitions?  I define governance coalitions as alliances between multiple sectors and between politically recognized levels of jurisdiction.  Their primary function is to facilitate interaction between policy and mobilization networks, while simultaneously coordinating the implementation of targeted action.  The characteristics of governance coalitions include the reflexive participation of independent groups, despite the existence of mixed motives and competing interests.  In using the case of the Pennsylvania Advocates for Nutrition and Activity, or PANA, I describe the role of scale in collective action between policy networks and community mobilization focused on obesity prevention.  To situate the case study within methodological discussions of scale, I chose qualitative inquiry as the preferred approach to draw connections between theoretical constructs and empirical data.  Key data sources included participant observations of coalition activities over four years, coalition documents and promotional materials, and key informant interviews with coalition members.  In this study, I argue for the relevance of scale in analyses of governance coalitions for two separate, but related, reasons. First, governance coalitions are a contemporary expression of collective action aimed at changing political and social behavior.  Second, a study of these cooperative mechanisms reveals more dynamic relationships between the state and civil society groups than has been recognized in previous studies.  In both instances, scalar discourses play a critical role in structuring the social activity of organizational networks, leading to changes in institutional and social relations.  The evidence presented in the study reveals that governance coalitions purposefully and strategically construct scale to mobilize limited resources across space and time, to create a collective identity among different interests, and to seize openings in the polity.  I present a formal typological framework of scale to demonstrate the use of scalar representations to structure the issues and agendas of social actors in ways that facilitate collective action in response to the constraints and affordances available.  However, the results of this research also expose important tensions in contemporary governance coalitions.  One such tension is based on whether this form of collective action represents a marketization of social change or simply the socialization of marketing; another is whether they achieve political outcomes through an alignment with elites, or whether they simply are an alignment of elites.  The first paradox focuses on the use of marketing approaches to collective action, and is revealed by the particular characteristics of PANA.  The second paradox highlights the tensions that exist between different sectors and levels of coordination and mobilization, pointing to larger theoretical implications for state and civil society relations.  While governance coalitions provide a potential mechanism to address social problems through democratic participation and decision-making, they are equally constrained by the encroachment of market forces in public policy discussions and structural inequalities that limit access to resources and the public sphere.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4505], "author_name_tesi": "Rios, Michael ", "last_name_ssi": "Rios", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Mc Carthy", "Chris Benner", "Melissa Wright", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "James David Plumb"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Mc Carthy, Committee Chair", "Chris Benner, Committee Member", "Melissa Wright, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member", "James David Plumb, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["scale", "governance", "coalitions", "collective action", "obesity"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "MULTIPLE SOURCING FOR DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SUPPLY CHAINS ", "id": "11945", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6597", "abstract_tesi": "Tactical operations and theater distribution in military supply chains play an important role in the success of a mission.

These events are believed to be initiated by \u2018classic\u2019 parent lightning discharges, when they escape upward from cloud tops. The present study builds upon a previously introduced lightning model that combines the hypotheses of equipotentiality and overall charge neutrality of the lightning channel with the fractal approach allowing to describe the stochasticity and branching of the discharge [<i>Riousset</i>, 2006]. The lightning model has been validated by comparison of the simulated lightning discharge with lightning mapping observations made by the New Mexico Tech Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) during a thunderstorm on July 31, 1999. This validation allows us to confidently apply the model to investigation of the conditions for the initiation of jet discharges, which represents one of the key goals of the research of this dissertation.</br>\n</br>\nAlthough the various types of intracloud and cloud-to-ground lightning are reasonably well understood, the cause and nature of upward discharges remains a subject of active research. Based on the idea first expressed by <i>Petrov and Petrova</i> [1999] that jets could be the extension of classic lightning discharges initiated within the cloud boundaries, this dissertation demonstrates the fundamental physical similarities between the various kinds of electrical discharges known to occur in the thundercloud. In collaboration with colleagues at New Mexico Tech, a combination of observational and modeling results is reported and indicates two principal ways in which upward discharges can be produced. The modeling indicates that blue jets occur as a result of electrical breakdown between the upper storm charge and screening charge attracted to the cloud top; they are predicted to occur 5\u201310 s or less after a cloud-to-ground or intracloud discharge produces a sudden charge imbalance in the storm. A new observation is also presented of an upward discharge that supports this basic mechanism. Gigantic jets are indicated to begin as a normal intracloud discharge between dominant midlevel charge and a screening-depleted upper level charge that continues to propagate out the top of the storm. Observational support for this mechanism comes from similarity with \u2018bolt-from-the-blue\u2019 discharges and from data on the polarity of gigantic jets. Upward discharges are analogous to cloud-to-ground lightning and their explanation provides a unifying view of how lightning escapes from a thundercloud.</br>\n</br>\nHow charge imbalances form in the thundercloud has been first suggested by <i>Wilson</i> [1921], but their impact on the initiation and early stages of development of blue and gigantic jets has not been addressed in the refereed literature. To address this question, a two-dimensional axisymmetric model of charge relaxation in the conducting atmosphere is developed. It is used in conjunction with the lightning model to demonstrate how realistic cloud electrodynamics leads to the development of blue and gigantic jets. This model accounts for the time-dependent conduction currents and screening charges formed under the influence of the thundercloud charge sources. Particular attention is given to numerical modeling of the screening charges near the cloud boundaries. The results demonstrate the important role of the screening charges in local enhancement of the electric field and/or reduction of net charge in the upper levels of the thundercloud. This model shows that the accumulation of screening charges near the thundercloud top produces a charge configuration leading to the initiation of blue jets, and the effective mixing of these charges with the upper thundercloud charge may lead to the formation of gigantic jets. </br>\n</br>\nThe visual appearance of the observed jet discharges indicates that these events may be associated with significant heating of the air in the regions of atmosphere near cloud tops through which they propagate. Many of the small-scale features observed in jets can be interpreted in terms of streamers, which are needle-shaped filaments of ionization embedded in originally cold (~300 K) air. After appropriate scaling with air density, these features are fully analogous to those that initiate spark discharges in relatively short (several cm) gaps at near-ground pressure. Thus, we develop a model of the streamer-to-spark transition to study this transition from cold, weakly ionized plasma to thermalized spark at various altitudes (or equivalently, ambient air densities) in the Earth atmosphere. The model is a fully one-dimensional (1-D) axisymmetric, axially invariant thermodynamics model coupled to a zero-dimensional (0-D) chemical kinetics scheme. In this dissertation, the model is applied to study the scaling properties of air heating in streamer channels under conditions of constant electric field. The model results on characteristic heating times &#964;<sub>br</sub> appear to be in excellent agreement with the available laboratory measurements conducted in short discharge gaps at ground and near-ground pressures. The results demonstrate a significant acceleration of the heating at lower air densities, with effective heating times appearing to scale closer to 1/<i>N</i> than to 1/<i>N</i><sup>2</sup> predicted on the basis of simple similarity laws for Joule heating, where <i>N</i> is the ambient air density. This acceleration is attributed to strong reduction in electron losses owing to three-body attachment and electron\u2013ion recombination with reduction of air pressure. The results also indicate that at low ambient air densities, the channel conductivity and the air temperature increase very rapidly in comparison with the gas dynamic expansion time (i.e., &#964;<sub>br</sub>&#8804;<i>r</i><sub>s</sub>/<i>c</i><sub>s</sub>, where <i>r</i><sub>s</sub> is the streamer channel radius and <i>c</i><sub>s</sub> is speed of sound). Thus both constant-density and constant-pressure approximations to channel dynamics commonly used in previous studies at ground pressure lead to nearly identical streamer-to-spark transition times.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2526], "author_name_tesi": "Riousset, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Andr\u00e9", "last_name_ssi": "Riousset", "middle_name_ssi": "Andr\u00e9", "first_name_ssi": "J\u00e9r\u00e9my", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko", "Victor P Pasko", "John David Mathews", "Hampton Nelson Shirer", "Douglas Henry Werner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko, Dissertation Advisor", "Victor P Pasko, Committee Chair", "John David Mathews, Committee Member", "Hampton Nelson Shirer, Committee Member", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transient luminous event", "gigantic jet", "blue jet", "streamer-to-spark transition", "streamer-to-leader transition", "spark", "arc", "leader", "streamer", "plasma", "lightning", "storm", "thundercloud"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Transverse Mechanical Properties of Unidirectionally Reinforced Hybrid Fiber Composites", "id": "18980", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9143", "abstract_tesi": "Fiber reinforced polymer composites have much versatility in structural design on account of their wide range of elastic and strength properties as functions of direction.

Much experimental characterization and theoretical modeling on the mechanical properties of hybrid fiber composites in the fiber direction can be found in the literature.  Theoretical models for the mechanical properties of hybrid composites transverse to the fiber direction can be found in the literature, but no experimental data has been published.   The objective of the current investigation is therefore to manufacture unidirectional carbon and E-glass hybrid fiber composites by a filament winding process, characterize the elastic modulus and strength of beam specimens tested transversely to the fibers, and assess the capability of available analytical models and the finite element method to capture the trends in the elastic modulus as a function of the proportion of the comingled carbon and E-glass fiber in the composite.

With time, cities change and adapt. Each city is based on a dominant urban model. Each model is in turn based on a system of exceptions and exclusions. The dominant urban actors  in the city utilize the Heterotopias to segregate those objects, activities and individuals that are considered taboo in order to maintain the \u201cpurity\u201d and stability of the dominant urban model. A Heterotopia is that physical realized space which houses the exceptions to the dominant city model. Heterotopias help maintain the city\u2019s stability as a self-organizing system. These places provide shifting sites of reflection and distance within the system that increases the city\u2019s capacity to change and adapt over time. A better understanding of modern heterotopias therefore is essential to a better understanding of how cities change and adapt over time. Present literature is lacking in addressing the means by which the dominant urban actors exert control on the heterotopias in order to maintain the urban system in its present form. This research proposes that dominant urban actors utilize control mechanisms to control the heterotopias and maintain the \u201cpurity\u201d of the urban system. \nHeterotopias are of three formal types; Heterotopias of Crisis; Heterotopias of Deviance; and Heterotopias of Illusion. The literature is largely centered on historical examples of heterotopias and therefore fails to address modern examples of heterotopias other than modern Heterotopias of Illusion. This thesis offers another narrative that of a modern heterotopia in a utopic, planned city. \nThis thesis examines the relationship between time and heterotopias based on the case of the informal markets (apni mandis) in Chandigarh, India. This research utilizes the grounded theory methodology based on logical argumentation to reveal that in a highly planned city like Chandigarh, the unplanned informal markets act as Heterotopias of Deviance. These heterotopias of deviance are further being controlled by a Temporal Control Mechanism; Time is the control mechanism, which is employed to maintain the stability of the city. However, with the growth of the city, there is evidence that with time the heterotopia itself will disappear in its present form due to the lack of space within the masterplan of the city. \n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5895], "author_name_tesi": "Rishi, Susmita ", "last_name_ssi": "Rishi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Susmita", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter John Aeschbacher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter John Aeschbacher, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Shane David Grahame", "heterotopias", "cities change", "control mechanisms"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Pathways from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi: The role of STAMs and atlastins in ER and Golgi morphogenesis", "id": "7949", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4777", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology and proper ER export of proteins are pivotal for cellular activity, and disruption in ER function has been implicated in several diseases.  This thesis focuses on the functional effects of STAMs (signal transducing adaptor molecules) and atlastins on ER morphology and protein export.  STAMs are multi-domain adaptor proteins previously shown to localize to endosomes and function in cellular signaling and receptor degradation, whereas atlastin 1-3 comprise a family of large, oligomeric, integral membrane GTPases.  Surprisingly, I have found that STAMs are additionally localized to ER exit sites (ERES), the areas of protein export from ER.  Additionally, I have shown that STAMs co-immunoprecipitate with ERES proteins as well as components of the COPII complex, coat proteins responsible for vesicle budding from ERES, suggesting that STAMs act as ER scaffold to bring together COPII proteins at ERES.  Overexpression of STAMs block ER protein export by displacing COPII proteins to the cytosol, resulting in a loss of Golgi structure.  Depletion of either STAM isoform clusters ERES, giving rise to a highly condensed Golgi and clustered endosomes.  I further demonstrated that STAMs are involved in reformation of the Golgi after disruption by pharmacological means.  This result, in conjunction with results from VSVG trafficking assays, show that STAMs are important in the organization of ERES proteins.  Additionally, I have found that atlastins have profound effects on ER.  Atlastins were identified in the ER, as well as associated along microtubules (MTs).  I have shown a clear inhibition of Golgi-targeted membranes migrating to the MT organizing center upon depletion of atlastin-2 or atlastin-3; however, protein export as assessed using VSVG assays is not blocked.  Moreover, atlastin dominant-negative mutants results in a drastic change in ER morphology, displaying a more elongated, tubular pattern.  These atlastin phenotypes suggest a function of atlastin on cytoskeletal structures that support the ER.  Thus, both STAMs and atlastins clearly have significant effects on the ER and the ability of the ER to function properly, as well as maintenance of Golgi morphology.  These findings provide substantial insights into the cellular mechanisms that guide protein trafficking and will enhance our understanding of dysfunction present in several diseases.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4755], "author_name_tesi": "Rismanchi, Neggy ", "last_name_ssi": "Rismanchi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Neggy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson", "Dr Craig Blackstone", "Robert J Milner", "Dr Kyle Krady", "Ian Alexander Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson, Committee Chair", "Dr Craig Blackstone, Committee Member", "Robert J Milner, Committee Member", "Dr Kyle Krady, Committee Member", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["STAMs", "atlastin", "ER exit sites", "COPII complex", "Golgi morphology", "trafficking"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Reconstructing Jerusalem: Persian Period Prophetic Perspectives", "id": "18975", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9008", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study identifies and examines the earliest layers of archaeological and textual evidence concerning the reconstruction of Jerusalem in the Achaemenid Persian Period (550 \u2013 330 BCE) to illuminate the historical and ideological processes by which the city regained its prominence after its destruction in 587 BCE. The centrality and importance of Jerusalem within Yahwism was not a given at the time. In fact, a multi-centric and international religion appeared to be developing in the aftermath of the conquest of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. In light of the destruction of the city in 587 BCE, the study first presents the development and history of the physical site with particular attention to indications of its socio-political status. Data from over a hundred years of archaeological excavations is presented and interpreted, revealing a slow process of recovery with evidence for administrative consolidation in the late fifth century and a more stable, urban population emerging in the fourth century. In four subsequent exegetical chapters, an ideological and cultural-historical approach to early restoration era prophetic texts is used to situate historically and explicate the way in which their authors and tradents addressed encumbrances to reconstruction. The chapters focus on Isaiah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi and show how the authors and tradents, employing native and imperial traditions, reaffirm, promote, and even mandate Jerusalem as the sacred center of Yahwistic life and cult, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the developing Torah that did not explicitly identify Jerusalem as this sacred center.

While lynching frequency peaked one hundred years ago, these horrific events of vigilante justice still influence the culture and mythology of the South.  Researchers have tried to understand lynchings by asking three types of questions concentrating on: 1) the causes of lynchings, 2) the characteristics of lynchings, and 3) the consequences of lynchings.  This dissertation contributes to each of these research lines, respectively, by addressing: the spatial effects of lynching events (Study 1), determinants of violence used during lynching events (Study 2), and the effect of lynching events on contemporary far-right groups (Study 3).  Each of these studies employs a new lynching dataset on events in Georgia, 1882-1926, based on newspaper articles from The Atlanta Constitution. \n\nStudy 1 delves into the causes of lynchings.  One of the best-known lynching studies presents the counter-intuitive finding that lynchings display negative spatial effects (Tolnay, Deane, and Beck 1996).  In other words, a lynching in one county made lynchings in nearby counties less likely to occur.  This result is inconsistent with other literature on the spread of violence, which suggests violence leads to more violence.  The question guiding Study 1, then, is: Do lynchings really have negative spatial effects, or were these previous findings an artifact of the data used, the method employed, the time periods analyzed, or the variables considered?  In addition to using the data derived from The Atlanta Constitution, Study 1 also analyzes data from the Historical American Lynching dataset and controls for variables derived from historical censuses.\n\nContrary to prior lynching research, Study 1 finds lynching events in Georgia to have generally positive spatial effects.  A lynching in one county made lynchings in nearby counties more likely to occur.  This positive spatial effect is particularly prominent at the turn of the century, during the peak of lynching event frequency in Georgia.  This effect is apparent in global spatial analyses, which have been done before, and local spatial analyses, which have not been previously used in connection with lynchings.  By identifying positive spatial effects of lynchings in Georgia, Study 1 qualifies past lynching research on the causes of lynching events.\n\nStudy 2 explores the characteristics of lynchings.  Due to limitations with prior datasets, little quantitative research has examined the violence used during lynching events.  The two studies that do exist both suggest that larger mobs, in relation to the number of victims, commit higher-atrocity lynchings as a result of the deindividuation of mob members (Mullen 1986; Leader, Mullen and Abrams 2007).  But the samples used in these analyses are small and may not be generalizable.  Further, recent literature calls the deindividuation perspective into question, instead supporting the idea that situational norms affect collective violence.  Addressing both methods and theory, Study 2 uses The Atlanta Constitution data to ask: What features of lynching events predict the atrocity and types of violence used by the lynch mob?\n\nThe atrocity and types of violence used in nearby lynching events turn out to be some of the strongest predictors of the atrocity and types of violence used in a particular lynching event.  Study 2 suggests the characteristics of lynching events established situational norms that were transmitted over space to other, nearby events.  Large mob size also is associated with more atrocious lynchings and public-spectacle acts, like hangings and burnings.  Overall, Study 2 provides additional evidence for the spatial influence of lynching events.\n\nStudy 3 shifts away from the past to examine the contemporary consequences of lynchings.  Research finds past lynchings to predict a number of modern phenomena, including state-level white supremacist group activity (Durso and Jacobs 2013).  But the distribution of past lynchings is not even throughout each state.  Also, questions of generalizability arise from the far-right literature, in that it is unclear how hate groups and patriot groups are similar or different.  Study 3 asks: Do historical lynchings have county-level effects on contemporary far-right groups, and are are all far-right groups the same?  Using The Atlanta Constitution data, this study also incorporates data from the Census, the American Community Survey, and the CQ Voting and Elections Collection, in addition to coding civil rights era KKK data from the Committee on Un-American Activities and contemporary far-right group data from the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Report.\n\nPast lynchings do seem to predict contemporary far-right group activity at the county level.  Upon closer examination, lynchings predict hate group activity but not patriot group activity.  Study 3 finds important differences between hate groups and patriot groups.  Among these differences, hate groups respond more to traditional demographic threat while patriot groups respond more to contemporary demographic and political threat.  Interestingly, prior levels of recent white supremacist group activity predict white supremacist groups, suggesting these types of groups are more stable over time than previously imagined.  In regard to lynching events, Study 3 shows that the past can influence current events.\n\nThe three studies advance issues of historical data collection, spatial methods, social learning theory, collective violence, and far-right groups.  In addition to moving various literatures forward, the dissertation has implications for contemporary law enforcement in their efforts to keep the peace.  For example, if violence spreads across space as Study 1 contends, then police in neighboring jurisdictions need to anticipate, prepare for, and prevent crime in their own jurisdictions.  While the focus of the dissertation is on lynchings in Georgia, the potential impact is wide-ranging.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11791], "author_name_tesi": "Ritchey, Andrew Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Ritchey", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback", "Richard Barry Ruback", "Stephen Augustus Matthews", "Derek Allen Kreager", "James A Piazza"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Barry Ruback, Committee Chair", "Stephen Augustus Matthews, Committee Member", "Derek Allen Kreager, Committee Member", "James A Piazza, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lynching", "Georgia", "spatial effects", "atrocity", "collective violence", "far-right", "hate groups"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ENERGETICS OF A SINGLE-CELL THUNDERSTORM\n", "id": "8945", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3849", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A nonlinear moist compressible numerical model is used to simulate deep moist convection generated by a prescribed localized warm bubble.

The study used Bandura's theoretical framework, in that the instrument would use the self-efficacy construct to explore the beliefs of prospective elementary science teachers with regards to science teaching and learning to diverse learners:  specifically the two dimensions of self-efficacy beliefs defined by Bandura (1977): personal self-efficacy and outcome expectancy.  A seven step plan was designed and followed in the process of developing the instrument, which was titled the Self-Efficacy Beliefs about Equitable Science Teaching or SEBEST.  Diverse learners as recognized by Science for All Americans  (1989) are \"those who in the past who have largely been bypassed in science and mathematics education: ethnic and language minorities and girls\" (p. xviii).  That definition was extended by this researcher to include children from low socioeconomic backgrounds based on the research by Gomez and Tabachnick (1992).\n\tFirst, the researcher defined the self-efficacy construct to be measured and a content matrix for the instrument that identifies the two dimensions of self-efficacy: personal self-efficacy and outcome expectancy and the four diverse learner groups: ethnic, gender, language minorities and socioeconomic status.  Second, one hundred ninety-five draft Likert type items, modeled after those composing the STEBI A (Riggs, 1988) and STEBI-B (Enochs & Riggs, 1990) were prepared with at least six representatives for each cell in the content matrix.  Third, the draft items were reviewed independently for clarity and comprehension by ten graduate students in science education.  Fourth, a panel composed of eight faculty members representing science education, multicultural education, and self-efficacy research independently judged the content validity of the revised items.\n\tFifth, the 48 remaining items were organized as a draft SEBEST instrument.  The draft instrument was administered to 226 prospective elementary teachers in the Elementary-Kindergarten Education Program (EK ED) at Penn State in the Fall of 1998.  The item analysis was performed with the following goal:\n\tWhat is the most reliable and valid combination of items to compose the \tSEBEST for the purposes of assessing prospective elementary teachers self-\tefficacy beliefs for teaching science to diverse learners, and the two \tdimensions of self-efficacy:  personal self-efficacy and outcome expectancy?\nSixth, using the results from factor analyses, Coefficient Alpha, and Chi-Square a 34 item instrument was found to achieve the greatest balance across the construct validity, reliability and item balance with the content matrix.  The 34 item SEBEST was found to load purely on four factors across the content matrix thus providing evidence construct validity.  The Coefficient Alpha reliability for the 34 item SEBEST was .90 and .82 for the PSE sub-scale and .78 for the OE sub-scale. A Chi-Square test (X2 =  2.71, df  = 7, p > .05) was used to confirm that the 34 items were balanced across the Personal Self-Efficacy/Outcome Expectancy and Ethnicity/Language Minority/Gender/Socioeconomic Status/ dimensions of the content matrix.\n\tIn the seventh step the SEBEST was to administered to 102 prospective elementary teachers in the Elementary-Kindergarten Education Program (EK ED) and 23 prospective elementary teachers in the Urban Early and Middle Childhood Education Program (URBED) at Penn State at mid-term, in the Spring of 1999, and administered again to the EK ED prospective elementary teachers at the end of the semester, to gather further information regarding the construct validity and reliability, particularly test-retest reliability.  The reliability for the of the SEBEST for the URBED student teachers was .90 for the entire instrument, .81 for the PSE sub-scale and .88 for the OE sub-scale. The reliability for the SEBEST for the EK ED group was .88 for the entire instrument, .83 for the PSE sub-scale and .85 for the OE sub-scale.  ANOVA was performed on mid-semester data to determine if the SEBEST could differentiate between prospective teachers prepared to teach diverse populations (i.e., the URBED sample) and those in a contemporary teacher education program that appeared not to have a particular emphasis on teaching diverse populations (i.e., the EK ED sample).  The ANOVA results showed no difference between the two groups.  While this finding did not provide further evidence of construct validity, it did not distract from the instrument's construct validity.  The non-significant ANOVA results were attributed to no difference in self-efficacy beliefs between the two samples, due to the EK ED program having diversity elements throughout the program.  Also, one or both samples could have had inflated self-efficacy perceptions regarding science teaching and learning for diverse learners.  \n\tTest-retest reliability was calculated by applying a Person-Product-Moment to the EK ED data collected at mid-semester and at the end of the semester.  SEBEST test-retest reliability was .70.  The PSE sub-scale test-retest reliability was .70 and the OE sub-scale test-retest reliability was .67.\n\tBased on the standardized development procedures used and the associated evidence, the SEBEST appears to be a content and construct valid instrument, with high internal reliability and moderate test-retest reliability qualities, for use with prospective elementary teachers to assess self-efficacy beliefs for teaching and learning science for diverse learners.  Further study of the instruments construct validity is recommended.  Norming the SEBEST may provide some insights concerning the test-retest results and will provide additional information on the SEBEST that will be useful to users.  Additionally, development of a form of the SEBEST for practicing elementary teachers should be pursued.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2881], "author_name_tesi": "Ritter, Jennifer Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Ritter", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas M Dana", "Peter A Rubba Jr.", "Jeanne Brady", "Rustum Roy", "Carla Zembal Saul"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas M Dana, Committee Chair", "Peter A Rubba Jr., Committee Member", "Jeanne Brady, Committee Member", "Rustum Roy, Committee Member", "Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Science Education", "Outcome Expectancy", "Personal Self-Efficacy", "Riggs", "Diverse Learners", "Self-Efficacy", "Prospective Teachers", "Bandura", "Enochs"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Survival of Acid-adapted Escherichia coli O157:H7 and non-O157:H7 Shiga Toxin-Producing E. coli (STEC) During Processing of Dry, Fermented Sausages", "id": "14849mxr444", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14849", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Escherichia coli O157:H7 was first recognized as a human pathogen following outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis in the early 1980s. Due to the infectious dose of E. coli O157:H7, the severity of the disease, and the possibility of lifelong sequalae, the U. S. Department of Agriculture-Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) declared it as an adulterant in raw ground beef in 1994. In 2012, non-O157:H7 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) serogroups (O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145) also were declared adulterants in raw beef products by USDA-FSIS. Until recently, the majority of the research done on interventions used to control STEC has been done on E. coli O157:H7. However, recent research suggests that some non-O157:H7 STEC may be more resistant to some interventions than E. coli O157:H7. The purpose of this study was to assess the differences in survival between E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157:H7 STEC when exposed to acid adaptation, followed by various stressors typically encountered during processing of dry, fermented sausages (DFS), including fermentation, lowered water activity (aw), and long-term, vacuum packaged storage (VPS). \nExperiments were conducted in vitro and in situ by exposing STEC to low pH, low water activity, and/or desiccation. In a series of in vitro experiments, control (non-acid adapted) and acid-adapted STEC cocktails were exposed to modified TSB (lowered pH and lowered aw; 24\u00b0C for 4 days), subjected to desiccation on paper disks, and evaluated for survival. In situ experiments were carried out in modified ground beef slurries (with lowered pH and lowered aw; 24\u00b0C for 4 days). Finally, acid-adapted E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157:H7 STEC were evaluated for survival throughout processing of DFS, including fermentation, drying, and long-term VPS. \nResults from the first in vitro experiments showed that populations of the control non-O157:H7 STEC serogroups O45, O103, O111 and O121 were significantly different from populations of E. coli O157:H7,and non-O157:H7 STEC serogroups O26 and O145. In contrast, when STEC serogroups were acid-adapted, all populations of non-O157 STEC were significantly different from populations of E. coli O157:H7. There were no significant differences between control (non-adapted) and acid-adapted cells between any individual serogroup. Reduction rates for all serogroups demonstrate that they not only survived well in acidified TSB, but also were able to grow over time, albeit minimally.  Results from the second in vitro experiment, TSB with modified water activity (aw=0.88 or 0.78), demonstrate that there was no significant difference between E. coli O157:H7 and any of the non-O157:H7 STEC, regardless of acid-adaptation. In a third in vitro experiment, exposure to desiccation on dry discs, there was no significant difference in survival between E. coli O157:H7 and the non-O157:H7 STEC, regardless of acid-adaptation. Results from an in situ experiment, acidified ground beef slurries, indicated that all non-O157:H7 STEC behaved similarly to E. coli O157:H7, with the exception of O145 STEC which had a higher reduction than O157:H7. There were no significant differences in ground beef slurries with modified water activity. These results suggest than non-O157:H7 STEC behave similarly to E. coli O157:H7 when exposed to laboratory stress conditions of low pH (pH 4.5) and low water activity (0.88 or 0.78). These results are in agreement with other researchers;  interventions that work on O157:H7 are likely to work on non-O157:H7 STEC.\nExperiments conducted with DFS processing demonstrated that the highest overall reductions in non-O157:H7 STEC was observed for E. coli O26 (2.66 log10 CFU/g), while the lowest were observed for E. coli O111 (2.29 log10 CFU/g) following fermentation, drying, and long-term VPS. All serogroups demonstrated total reductions >2.0 log10 CFU/g and there was no significant difference between the log reduction rates of non-O157:H7 STEC, when compared to E. coli O157:H7. These results suggest that non-O157:H7 STEC survival during the production of a DFS was comparable to E. coli O157:H7 and that all tested STEC serogroups are able to survive DFS processing. Overall, results also suggest that acid-adaptation had minimal or no significant effect on the survival of any of the tested serogroups. Moreover, results suggest that interventions that work for E. coli O157:H7 will be equally effective against non-O157 STEC. These results could be useful to regulatory agencies by providing the science needed to make recommendations and/or regulations to mitigate the risk of non-O157:H7 STEC in the food industry. Additionally, these results may be of use to researchers and/or quality control personnel seeking to validate interventions and processes to ensure the safety of dry fermented sausage products for the consuming public.

How insects are able to adapt to their host plants and how plants can resist or tolerate insects are questions of much importance for evolutionary biology, ecology, physiology, insect behavior, agriculture, food security, and science in general. For example, plants are capable of inducing defenses against insects after detecting insect specific cues. Insects on the other hand might suppress these defenses by releasing molecules present in secretions like saliva. Currently, there is limited information on the saliva composition of chewing insect herbivores and how it might affect plant defenses. The main objectives of this study were to 1. Characterize the saliva of the generalist insect pest, the cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) and 2. Identify the changes in the composition of insect saliva driven by two of its host plants - cabbage and tomato as compared to artificial diet. These objectives were approached using both transcriptomic (RNAseq) and proteomic techniques (iTraq). A transcriptome of 14,037 genes and a proteome of 434 proteins were established. Feeding on different host plant diets resulted in substantial remodeling of the gland transcriptomes and proteomes, with 4,501 transcripts and 63 proteins significantly differentially expressed across the three treatment groups. Gene expression profiles were most similar between cabbage and artificial diet, which corresponded to the two diets on which larvae perform best. Within these libraries, several interesting enzymes were identified that may play an important role in the cabbage looper\u2019s ability to establish on different hosts. Some of these enzymes that were further analyzed are a catalase and three potential myrosinases. Catalase activity was confirmed in the labial glands of the cabbage looper. It was also determined that catalase plays a role in detoxification by reducing the activity of peroxidases as well as herbivore offense by suppressing the induction of trypsin protease inhibitor in tomato. The myrosinase genes identified were differentially expressed in several tissues of the cabbage looper and under different diets.\niii\niv However, they appear to be broad-spectrum glucosidases rather than specific myrosinases.\nFinally, as part of the INTAD dual degree, the alternative use of water containing methyl isothiocyanate - a defensive secondary compound in the famine shrub Hanza (Boscia senegalensis), was investigated. Hanza waste water has a significant effect on seed germination of several plants and could potentially be used for weed management in small farms of West Africa. This is an example of the study of plant defensive compounds for the use in applied research.

I investigate the controls on ice stream location using geophyscial and remote sensing techniques. I find water flow at the base of the ice is, in part, controlled by enhanced firn densification and surface elevation changes in areas of high stress. The basal conditions across the ice stream are very heterogeneous, with variable water content and till thickness (Chapters 2, 3).

In particular, each of these practices affects the soil-dwelling arthropod assemblage in a particular way by influencing the microenvironment at the soil surface, with potential consequences for predatory and pest arthropods. To better understand the effects of conservation agriculture practices on local arthropod assemblages, biological control potential, and crop damage, here I compare two North American conservation agriculture cropping systems: a soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and corn (Zea mays L.) rotation grown under organic management in central Pennsylvania, U.S.A, and a rotation of corn and wheat in central Mexico. In both systems, primary inversion tillage was reduced compared to conventional practices for the area. In Pennsylvania, the cash crops were no-till planted into a rolled cover crop mulch of either hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) and triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) planted together preceding corn, or cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) preceding soybean. Additionally, in Pennsylvania, the cover crops were managed by a roller-crimper at three dates (early, middle, or late) relative to standard dates for the area to allow for cash crop planting. In Mexico, the cash crops were planted into the previous years\u2019 crop residue, which was cut and left in the field after harvest. \n\nIn both systems, we measured arthropod activity-density by pitfall trap, biological control potential (predation) by implementing sentinel traps baited with live waxworms (Galleria mellonella F.), density of herbivorous arthropods at the soil surface, and damage by herbivorous invertebrates to the cash crops. Predatory arthropods in particular were affected by the conservation agriculture practices in both systems, with the type of residue affecting the activity-density, diversity, and function of particular predators, including ground and tiger beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in Pennsylvania, and ants in Mexico (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Predation rates were relatively high in both systems, with differences within systems depending on year, crop, and residue. Herbivore density and plant damage also depended on crop, but lower herbivore density correlated with higher predator activity-density in Pennsylvania. Likewise, certain types of crop damage, in particular cutting by lepidopteran larva, decreased with increased activity-densities of predatory arthropods. In Pennsylvania in particular, certain practices had a stronger influence on results than others; for instance, predatory arthropod activity-density was significantly greater in corn planted into a rolled mat of hairy vetch-triticale as compared to soybean planted into a rolled mat of cereal rye. In contrast, shallow high residue cultivation in corn and soybean was not a strong factor influencing the local arthropod assemblage at the time we sampled in Pennsylvania. The comparison of these two systems allows for an opportunity to understand the complexities of conservation agriculture and the potential for this system to conserve and augment predatory arthropods while contributing to pest control in low-input agricultural systems in North America. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11617], "author_name_tesi": "Rivers, Ariel N", "last_name_ssi": "Rivers", "middle_name_ssi": "N", "first_name_ssi": "Ariel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Ellen Barbercheck", "Edwin George Rajotte", "John Frazier Tooker", "William Curran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Ellen Barbercheck, Dissertation Advisor", "Edwin George Rajotte, Committee Member", "John Frazier Tooker, Committee Member", "William Curran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cover crops", "arthropods", "organic agriculture", "conservation agriculture", "biological control", "Mexico", "reduced tillage", "corn"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Cognitive Control of Memory and Motor Responses:\nan Examination of the Neural Correlates of Active Inhibition\n", "id": "23468", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10587", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Active inhibition includes both response inhibition (the suppression of prepotent motor response) and memory inhibition (the suppression of either encoding or retrieval). While the majority of behavioral research has considered them to be a single process, neuroimaging research suggests otherwise. Despite conflicting findings, there have been no attempts to investigate the degree to which active inhibition might be mediated by two separate networks. The current study directly compared the neural networks that mediate both response and memory inhibition through the use of fMRI and connectivity analyses. Direct comparisons within and between types of inhibition focused on differences in the neural network supporting each type of inhibitory process. Specifically, retrieval inhibition relied primarily on activation of the parietal lobes, compared to encoding inhibition, which relied on activation of the superior and middle prefrontal gyrus. These results indicate that the forgetting of information through suppression of retrieval processes can be accomplished through the diversion of attentional processes, while forgetting through the stopping of encoding relies on active inhibition. With respect to response inhibition, stopping recruited greater activation of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) than did response withholding, which was mediated by activation of the middle and superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Thus, while it appears that the IFG supports direct inhibition, rather than attentional control, it may only do so when a strongly prepotent response must be inhibited. Comparisons between types of inhibition revealed that response inhibition recruits increased activation in the middle and IFG, while memory inhibition recruits increased activation of the SFG. Thus, in addition to finding evidence that separate regions of the brain support these types of inhibition, these prefrontal differences also provide evidence that it is more difficult to recruit inhibitory mechanisms in support of memory inhibition than response inhibition. Finally, resting state connectivity analyses reveal that the left IFG, which supports response inhibition, exhibits greater intrinsic connectivity with the motor cortex, while the right SFG, which supports memory inhibition, exhibits greater connectivity with regions responsible for encoding and retrieval (i.e. medial temporal lobe). Taken together, these results provide evidence for separate memory and response inhibition processes, the former supported by the SFG and the latter supported by the IFG.

Signal transduction pathways are crucial in the regulation of many cellular interactions during the growth and patterning of such organisms. The Wingless (Wg) signal transduction pathway is essential for many developmental processes during Drosophila embryogenesis. Wg is a member of the Wnt family of conserved signaling glycoproteins, and it is required for the segmentation of the embryonic epidermis, specification of cardiac and somatic muscle precursors, and patterning of the embryonic midgut. In addition, during the larval stages, Wg is involved in wing, leg, and eye imaginal disc growth and patterning. The ultimate objective of the Wg signal transduction pathway is the cytoplasmic stabilization and subsequent nuclear translocation of the Armadillo (Arm) protein. Inside the nucleus, Arm functions as a transcriptional activator to activate Wg target genes. In the absence of Wg, Arm is rapidly phosphorylated and targeted for degradation by a collection of proteins that comprise the \u201cdestruction complex\u201d. The serine/threonine kinase Zeste-White 3 (Zw3), a negative regulator of the Wg signaling pathway, is a component of this destruction complex. The work presented in this thesis expands our understanding of the role that Wg signaling plays in the specification of the somatic musculature. An additional aim of this thesis is to add insight into the role of the N-terminus of Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK), the vertebrate homologue of Zw3. Wg is required for the specification of the muscle progenitor cells expressing the muscle identity genes S59 and nautilus (nau). To address whether this specification is mediated by the canonical Wg pathway, reciprocal gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments were performed. In addition, an examination into the relationship between the Wg and Notch (N) signaling pathways in the specification of muscle founder and fusion-competent cells was conducted. The results demonstrate that Wg and N act reciprocally in mediating a binary decision between muscle founder and fusion-competent cell fates in the somatic mesoderm. Zw3 and GSK-3\u00e2 are very closely related serine/threonine kinases that serve as essential negative regulators of Wg/Wnt signaling. In addition to their structural similarity, they share functional similarity as well since GSK-3\u00e2, but not the related GSK-3\u00e1, can rescue a zw3 mutant embryo. One hypothesis that is tested is that the difference in regulation between GSK-3\u00e2/\u00e1 is due to differences found in their amino terminal region, which is the region that is required for pseudosubstrate inhibition. Various isoforms of Zw3, which have either the entire unique amino terminus deleted, the N-terminus replaced with that of GSK-3\u00e2 or replaced with that of GSK-3\u00e1, were created and tested, utilizing in vivo assays, to determine differences in activity. The results suggest that unlike GSK regulation, Wg-mediated Zw3 inactivation does not depend on pseudosubstrate binding in vivo. Surprisingly, the N-terminus of GSK-3\u00e2 was less active than the N-terminus of GSK-3\u00e1 in Drosophila.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2305], "author_name_tesi": "Rizkalla, Hany Waheeb", "last_name_ssi": "Rizkalla", "middle_name_ssi": "Waheeb", "first_name_ssi": "Hany", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Esther Siegfried", "David Scott Gilmour", "Richard W Ordway", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Esther Siegfried, Committee Chair", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["somatic mesoderm", "signal transduction", "Wnt", "Wingless signaling", "Drosophila melanogaster", "myogenesis", "cell specification", "founder cell", "Zeste white 3", "GSK-3"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Multi-Level Acceptance and Commitment to Technology Change in Governmental Agencies", "id": "6459", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6167", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study presented two models of technology implementation set within the context of the multiple-agency SAP database unification endeavor initiated by the state of Pennsylvania.

Despite the concern, there are but a few empirical studies that examine how students\u2019 academic majors, their educational experiences inside and outside the classrooms, and their perceptions of their knowledge and abilities influence their career and graduate education plans. This study utilized a nationally representative dataset collected for the Prototype to Production: Processes and Conditions for Preparing the Engineer of 2020 (P2P) study (NSF-EEC Award No. 0550608).  This study used survey responses from 5,239 engineering students in 212 engineering programs from 31 four-year engineering schools to  explore the post-graduation plans of the U.S. engineering students, specifically addressing the research question: do individual students\u2019 pre-college characteristics, academic program experiences, and self-assessments of their engineering abilities influence their post-graduation plans?  Six potential responses regarding students\u2019 post-graduation plans from the P2P student survey were explored in this study: 1) Be self-employed in engineering; 2) Be a practicing engineer; 3) Work in engineering management or sales; 4) Work outside engineering; 5) Be in engineering graduate school for academic career; and 6) Be in engineering graduate school for professional career. Because these outcome measures use an ordered scale (from definitely won\u2019t to definitely will), the analysis used a multinomial logistic regression model.  \n\nBased on the conceptual framework adapted from Terenzini and Reason (2005), the analyses examined students\u2019 post-graduation plans as a function of students\u2019 academic program experiences after controlling for pre-college characteristics that research has shown influence the odds of having the outcomes and experiences to begin with (gender, race/ethnicity, and academic preparedness).  The study also explored how students\u2019 self-assessments of their engineering domain knowledge and skills influenced their post-graduation plans after controlling for student pre-college characteristics and academic program experiences. \n\nA key finding of the study is that engineering students\u2019 post-graduation plans appear to be complex and tentative decisions.  Seniors consider multiple career options, which are not limited to work or study in the field of engineering, as they near graduation. This study also found that there are multiple factors that seem to influence engineering students\u2019 post-graduation plans to stay in the field of engineering.  Students\u2019 engineering career and graduate school plans were positively influenced by: gender (with men\u2019s odds higher than women\u2019s); greater curricular emphases on core engineering thinking and professional skills in engineering programs; more active and collaborative learning experiences in the classroom; more active engagement in student organizations for women and underrepresented minority students; and higher self-assessments of fundamental and design skills.  On the other hand, students\u2019 plans for graduate study or work outside engineering were positively influenced by: class year standing (with seniors\u2019 odds higher than sophomores\u2019); majoring in General Engineering (compared to the reference group of Mechanical Engineering); greater curricular emphasis on professional values in engineering programs; more active engagement in student organizations for women and URMs; and higher self-assessment of contextual competence.  Being active in engineering clubs for women and URMs, appears to influence both engineering and non-engineering career options.  Thus, simply offering co-curricular opportunities may not be enough to promote persistence in engineering fields. \n\nThese findings have a number of implications for practice, policy, theory-building, and future research.  Most policies focused on enlarging the engineering pipeline are motivated by a desire to increase the quality and diversity of the engineering workforce, but there has been little empirical study of the section of the pipeline between undergraduate education and the engineering workforce.  Advocates of diversifying the workforce will be concerned with the finding that women students are two times less likely than men to plan to enter engineering career and graduate school path.  Although most previous research focuses on why women students do not persist or graduate in engineering programs, more research is needed to understand why women who plan to complete an engineering degree then choose a career outside of their field.  This study found there was little difference between underrepresented minority and White students in terms of their post-graduation plans, which might be because this study could not examine the race/ethnicity groups separately due to insufficient sample sizes. Agencies such as the National Science Foundation might respond by funding research to develop and analyze large-scale and nationally representative data sets on engineering graduates that would permit researchers to examine post-graduation plans and outcomes for specific racial/ethnic groups.\n \nIn terms of implications for practice, this study suggests that the engineering programs should provide diverse curricula, instructional, and co-curricular experiences that contribute to students\u2019 learning and satisfaction, and thus encourage them to remain on the engineering workforce pathway.  Engineering curricula should integrate technical and contextual issues by stressing problem-solving in real-world contexts to attract engineering students, especially women. Engineering programs also should link curricular and co-curricular opportunities that stress the connections between design, innovation, creativity, interdisciplinary, and professional skills since this content is associated with plans to stay in the engineering workforce or attend an engineering graduate program.  \n\nEngineering programs or institutions should also encourage and assist engineering faculty members to learn new instructional methods. Opportunities and incentives for professional development activities may promote greater use of instructional practices that actively engage students in their learning.  The findings from this study suggest that engineering programs should encourage students to participate in diverse co-curricular programs.  Engineering industries should recognize the value of students\u2019 co-curricular experiences in cultivating students\u2019 profession skills and  building students\u2019 understanding of the social and global contexts and issues that are part of the work of today\u2019s engineer.  \n\nIn addition to the policy and practical implications, this study suggests future research areas. Terenzini and Reason\u2019s conceptual model, which was modified for this study, should include the disciplinary environment within the organizational context.  Student outcomes, however, are situated not only in the context of academic programs and institutions, but also in socio-historical context.  Students\u2019 career plans are thus influenced by economic and other prevalent social and cultural conditions.  As this study shows seniors consider a broader array of career options than sophomores, possibly because they recognize job market conditions, which will shape their career pathways.  Terenzini and Reason\u2019s model should be modified to include this broader socio-historical context.   \n\nResearch on pathways from higher education to the engineering workforce is relatively new.   Although students\u2019 reports of their work and graduate study plans are the best predictors of these decisions, future studies should explore the correlation between engineering students\u2019 post-graduation plans in or outside of engineering and actual career and graduate school decisions.  Longitudinal data should be collected for this purpose and the long trajectory of engineering graduates\u2019 career pathways should be examined.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2393], "author_name_tesi": "Ro, Hyun Kyoung ", "last_name_ssi": "Ro", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyun Kyoung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa R Lattuca", "Lisa R Lattuca", "John Jesse Cheslock", "Leticia Oseguera", "Hoi Kin Suen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa R Lattuca, Dissertation Advisor", "Lisa R Lattuca, Committee Chair", "John Jesse Cheslock, Committee Member", "Leticia Oseguera, Committee Member", "Hoi Kin Suen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["engineering", "post-graduation plans", "college effects"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Essays on Entrepreneurship and Credit in Colombia", "id": "dj52w469j", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13116", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Financial development is one of the engines for economic growth. Developing economies face two challenges regarding financial development: financial inclusion and access to credit. While financial inclusion focuses on the use, access to credit focuses on the prohibitive costs or barriers to use credit, such barriers include onerous paperwork, travel distance and legal hurdles, among others. In this dissertation, we analyze the impact of use of credit on exporters and the impact of physical distance on credit flows and its impact on firms\u2019 performance. \nIn the first essay, we use Colombian manufacturing data on exports and external financing for the period 1998 \u2212 2006 to estimate the credit elasticity of exports. We use bank-firm linked data to construct a supply side instrument for a manufacturer\u2019s demand of credit, which we use to address the reverse causality between a manufacturer\u2019s export revenue and its demand for credit. We find that access to credit produces a significant increase on a manufacturer\u2019s export revenue explained by the positive effect of credit on an exporter\u2019s market reach - number of destinations. Across manufacturers the effect of credit on a manufacturer\u2019s export revenue varies by size. While medium-sized manufacturers use credit to increase their market reach, market penetration and product mix, large manufacturers only use credit to increase their market reach. When evaluating the impact of finance considering demand drivers as destination country or product characteristics, we find that external financing has greatest impact on the smallest firms.\n\tIn the second essay, we use a detailed dataset of Colombian firms and bank branches to study how information and transport costs affect firms\u2019 credit access. We also use credit flows in a cluster analysis combined with a market segmentation model to shape geographical markets, and find that high transactional and information costs tightens lending at the intensive and extensive margin in competitive markets. At firm level, we find that this relationship is stronger for smaller firms and reflects lower debt. Monitoring costs are especially high for medium-sized firms and this is reflected in a poor performance of the loan, nevertheless this effect diminishes in competitive markets. These results suggest that distance plays a stronger role for accessing to credit when soft information is more valuable.\nIn this dissertation, we study two different aspects of financial inclusion and access to credit and find evidence of differentiated impact at firm level. We confirm external financing is important to export decision but its effect persists over time for small- and medium- sized firms. Regarding access to credit, we find geographical distance is barrier to integrate markets. The limitation extends, especially, to small firms in two senses: 1) tightening credit and 2) poor loan performance.\nWe contribute to a nascent literature that exploits contract-level information.

The temperature dependence of T1 values along with the presence of minima in T1 as a function of temperature enabled correlation times and activation energies to be obtained for both the segmental motion of the polymer backbone and the hopping motion of lithium cations.  Similar activation energies for motion of both the polymer and lithium ions in the samples with lower ion content indicate that the polymer segmental motion and lithium ion hopping motion are correlated in these samples, even though lithium hopping is about ten times slower than the segmental motion.  A divergent trend is observed for correlation times and activation energies of the highest ion content sample with 100% lithium sulfonation due to the presence of ionic aggregation.    Details of the polymer and cation dynamics on the nanosecond timescale are discussed and complement the findings of X-ray scattering and Quasi Elastic Neutron Scattering experiments.\nPolymer backbone dynamics of single ion conducting poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based ionomer samples with low glass transition temperatures (Tg) have been investigated using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  Experiments detecting 13C with 1H decoupling under magic angle spinning (MAS) conditions identified the different components and relative mobilities of the polymer backbone of a suite of lithium- and sodium-containing ionomer samples with varying cation contents.  Variable temperature (203-373 K) 1H-13C cross-polarization MAS (CP-MAS) experiments also provided qualitative assessment of the differences in the motions of the polymer backbone components as a function of cation content. Each of the main backbone components (PEO spacer and isophthalate groups) exhibit distinct motions, following the trends expected for motional characteristics based on earlier Quasi Elastic Neutron Scattering and 1H spin-lattice relaxation rate measurements.  The temperature dependences of 13C linewidths were used to both qualitatively and quantitatively examine the effects of cation content on PEO mobility.  Variable contact time 1H-13C CP-MAS experiments were used to further assess the motions of the polymer backbone on the microsecond timescale.  The motion of the PEO spacer, determined from the rate of magnetization transfer from 1H to 13C nuclei, in all ionic samples becomes similar for T \u2273 1.1 Tg, indicating that the motions of the polymer backbones on the microsecond timescale become insensitive to ion interactions.  These results compliment previous findings and present an improved picture of the dependence of backbone dynamics on cation type and density in these amorphous PEO-based ionomer systems.    \n7Li PFG NMR experiments provided measurements of the self-diffusion coefficients for Li+ cations in the PEO600-y Li ionomer series over a range of temperatures.  When the Tg values are taken into account, the self-diffusion coefficients of Li+ in each sample follow a similar trendline, indicating that lithium diffusion is independent of ion concentration at any given reduced inverse temperature, Tg/T.  Ion aggregation increases Tg and slows both lithium cation diffusion and displacement, but there is no further slowing beyond the Tg effect in the PEO600-y Li ionomers samples.  The differences in activation energies obtained from diffusion measurements and relaxation times suggest that at least one additional barrier must be overcome for cations emerge from local hopping motion to macroscopic cation transport.  Using the Nernst-Einstein equation lithium diffusion coefficients were also calculated from conductivity measurements.  The differences between the diffusion measured by the two separate techniques indicate the presence of ion pairs.  The activation energy of lithium diffusion was found to be nearly identical between the PFG NMR and conductivity, suggesting that the conductivity and ionic diffusion are related to the same ionic dynamics.  As the ion content within the PEO600-y Li samples increases the relative concentration of non-conducting ion pairs decrease.  Also an increase in temperature causes a fraction of ion pairs to thermally dissociate into positive triple ions. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8083], "author_name_tesi": "Roach, David Jason", "last_name_ssi": "Roach", "middle_name_ssi": "Jason", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller", "Tom Mallouk", "Mary Beth Williams", "Evangelos Manias", "Ralph H Colby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller, Dissertation Advisor", "Tom Mallouk, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Williams, Committee Member", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Member", "Ralph H Colby, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NMR", "Polymer Electrolytes", "Single-ion Conductors", "Ionomers", "Polymer Dynamics", "Cation Dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "An Integrated Approach to a Growing Issue: The Effect of Sustainable Soil Management Systems on Maize Gene Expression", "id": "13203", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7047", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To feed a growing population, food production must increase substantially in the coming years. In order to maintain the level of food production needed to feed the world\u2019s population, yields need to improve for crops grown using sustainable soil management systems. Sustainable soil management practices such as no-tillage and cover crops expose plants to a different growing environment and different stresses than do conventional management systems. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of hairy vetch cover crop, no-tillage, nitrogen side-dress fertilizer, and their interactions on crop and soil quality and the expression of genes involved in C and N metabolism and abiotic and biotic stress response in maize. Measurements of plant and soil quality and expression level of genes involved in C and N metabolism and plant response to abiotic and biotic stress were taken throughout the growing season. Gene expression in plants was affected by soil management practices. No-tillage preserved soil and plant moisture and led to decreased expression of drought-response gene Dhn1. No-tillage, without a cover crop, led to plants that experienced more nitrogen stress and decreased expression of genes involved in N metabolism at silking stage compared with tillage. The balance of drought and nitrogen stresses in plants in no-tillage and tillage treatments led to equal final yield. Plants in the treatment with a cover crop may have experienced more insect and pathogen pressure throughout the season and this resulted in increased expression of biotic stress-response genes but did not affect final yield. The treatment with a cover crop yielded higher than the treatment without a cover crop and using hairy vetch in a no-tillage system alleviated nitrogen stress in plants. Overall, it was determined that using no-tillage and hairy vetch is a best systems approach to sustainable agriculture.

Previous results showed that the single-copy <I>P1-rr</I> (red pericarp and red cob glumes) allele has considerably less DNA methylation as compared with the six-copy, tandemly-repeated <I>P1-wr</I> (white pericarp and red cob glumes) allele. Herein, the mechanism by which the tandem repeats of <I>P1-wr</I> influence the epigenetic suppression in pericarp tissue was investigated. The disruption of a single <I>P1-wr</I> copy by a <I>Mu1</I> transposon insertion into the 5\u2019UTR induced a gain of pericarp pigmentation in the <I>P1-wr-mum6</I> allele. This gain of pericarp pigmentation was associated with DNA hypomethylation at a distal floral-organ-specific enhancer element. Interestingly, this hypomethylated state led to the expression from wild type copy(s) that were not interrupted by the transposon in the <I>P1-wr</I> mum6 allele. The correlation of copy number and silencing was further strengthened by the characterization of <I>P1-mosaic</I> (<I>P1-mm</I>) which has a <I>P1-wr</I> type gene structure but contains a reduced copy number. <I>P1-mm</I> has both a variegated pericarp pigmentation and a highly perturbed DNA methylation pattern. Interestingly, <I>P1-mm</I> was hypomethylated at the aforementioned distal enhancer and hypermethylated downstream of the transcription start site.  These opposing DNA methylation changes are envisaged to explain the unpredictable, mosaic pigmentation pattern of <I>P1-mm</I>.  Collectively, the <I>P1-wr-mum6</I> and <I>P1-mm</I> studies showed that the tandem-repeat structure of <I>P1-wr</I> is important for the epigenetic regulation that determines its tissue-specific expression.  To further understand why the presence of multiple gene copies is conducive to the suppression of <I>p1</I> in pericarp tissue we studied the dominant <I>Unstable factor for orange1</I> (<I>Ufo1</I>) mutation. The presence of <I>Ufo1</I> induces ectopic pericarp pigmentation in <I>P1-wr</I> plants by a mechanism which correlates with the partial loss of DNA methylation at <I>P1-wr</I>.  In addition to endogenous <I>P1-wr</I>, data herein suggests that <I>Ufo1</I> can also reactivate suppressed <I>p1</I> transgenes. Interestingly, although <I>Ufo1</I> has been previously characterized as unstable, its interaction with one <I>p1</I> transgene was highly penetrant and required the continued presence of <I>Ufo1</I>. To identify genes that are important for the range of <I>P1-wr Ufo1</I> expression in pericarp, we crossed a fully-penetrant <I>P1-wr Ufo1</I> stock with RNAi lines that target candidate chromatin-related genes.  We found that the Retinoblastoma-associated Protein1 (RBAP1) may function to suppress the <I>Ufo1</I> mutation leading to its variable expression patterns. Collectively, this research broadens the understanding of how tandem repeats of genes influence the epigenetic control of tissue specific expression.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4225], "author_name_tesi": "Robbins, Michael Lawrence", "last_name_ssi": "Robbins", "middle_name_ssi": "Lawrence", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Surinder Chopra", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "David Robert Huff", "Paula Mc Steen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Surinder Chopra, Committee Chair", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Member", "David Robert Huff, Committee Member", "Paula Mc Steen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transposon", "maize", "enhancer", "flavonoid", "mosaic", "DNA methylation"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Managing Service Capacity Under Uncertainty\n", "id": "7776", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6274", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation addresses the issue of capacity management in a professional services context; specifically a call center based support operation with contractually committed Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

The short term scheduling model shows that hedging against arrival rate uncertainty lowers the total cost of operation by improving the probability of SLA attainment.  It also shows that increasing the flexibility of the staffing model, by scheduling even a few part time resources, can significantly lower costs.  I also find that increasing the probability of achieving the service level goal becomes increasingly expensive.  The medium term hiring model shows that learning curve issues during start-up have a significant impact on total costs.  The cross training model shows that adding even a moderate amount of flexibility into the workforce can significantly lower costs through the dynamic reallocation of capacity.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6274], "author_name_tesi": "Robbins, Thomas R.", "last_name_ssi": "Robbins", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Terry Paul Harrison", "Susan Xu", "Douglas J Thomas", "Tom Michael Cavalier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Terry Paul Harrison, Committee Chair", "Susan Xu, Committee Member", "Douglas J Thomas, Committee Member", "Tom Michael Cavalier, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stochastic optimization", "manpower planning", "call center"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Toddler verbal skill and mother-toddler discourse as predictors of the later understanding of emotion regulation strategies in 3-year-olds\n", "id": "8960", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1030", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis investigated the role of early language development as a contributor to the development of understanding emotion regulation strategies.

This study used toddler anger expression during a challenging task as an index of toddler emotion regulation. Data were from the prospective adoption study of 361 families, the Early Growth and Development Study, at child ages 9, 18, and 27 months. Findings indicated that both timing and chronicity of adoptive mothers\u2019 depressive symptoms influenced toddler anger expression. Adoptive fathers\u2019 symptoms did not influence children directly, but instead influenced mothers\u2019 symptoms over time.

Copper is needed for the enzyme that controls the final step of denitrification, from N2O to N2. Today, only about 5-6 percent of denitrification results in release of N2O. If all denitrification stopped at N2O during the Proterozoic, the N2O flux could have been 15-20 times higher than today, producing N2O concentrations of several ppmv. CH4 concentrations may also have been elevated during this time, as has been previously suggested. A lack of dissolved O2 and sulfate in the deep ocean should have produced a high methane flux from marine sediments, as much as 10-20 times today\u2019s methane flux from land.

Within Cucurbitaceae, there is a tight association between the bacterial pathogen Erwinia tracheiphila and the required diabroticite beetle vector, Acalymma vittatum (the striped cucumber beetle).  This thesis expands on prior knowledge of this tri-trophic system by providing insights into vector competence of diabroticite beetles that exist outside of the geographic range of Erwinia tracheiphila.  Identification of a novel biological control agent, Pseudomonas fluorescens, targeting microbial gut interactions within the vector beetle to control Erwinia tracheiphila. \nTwo diabroticite beetle species were selected from regions of the United States that currently do not have the causal agent of bacterial wilt of cucurbits, Erwinia tracheiphila: the western striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma trivittatum) from California and the banded cucumber beetle (Diabrotica balteata) from Florida.  Based on ecological and phylogenetic similarities to Acalymma vittatum, Acalymma trivittatum could serve as a competent vector that would provide Erwinia tracheiphila a route into the western United States.  Likewise, if Diabrotica balteata is also a competent vector, it would provide avenues for Erwinia tracheiphila into the southern United States.  The three diabroticite species were subjected to feeding bioassays to determine transmission capabilities.  Analysis of frass through polymerase chain reaction and plate culturing demonstrated presence and viability of Erwinia tracheiphila after passage through the beetles.  While the results indicated that Acalymma trivittatum was able to transmit Erwinia tracheiphila, there was insufficient statistical power to compare its transmission efficiency relative to Acalymma vittatum.  Diabrotica balteata was also able to transmit Erwinia tracheiphila, but due to low beetle survival rates during the course of the experiment, the sample size of the surviving beetles was too small to make statistically relevant conclusions about its vector status.  \nCurrent control methods for Erwinia tracheiphila target the vector through pesticide application, but with possible geographic expansion by other vector species, an alternative strategy may be required.  The bacterial wilt of cucurbit disease cycle is maintained by Erwinia tracheiphila gut colonization of the vector beetle, effectively overwintering until the next growing season.  By disrupting Erwinia tracheiphila gut colonization, the number of infected vectors could be greatly reduced.  This has proven to be an effective biological control approach for Erwinia amylovora (the fire blight of tree fruit pathogen) using a commercially available isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens. \nIn this study, I challenged isolates of Erwinia tracheiphila with an isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf55) through in vitro plating assays and in vivo co-localization gut assays.  In vitro assays confirmed that Pseudomonas fluorescens successfully inhibited Erwinia tracheiphila growth.  Because Pseudomonas fluorescens was detected in the mid and hindguts of Acalymma vittatum (coinciding with the sites of Erwinia tracheiphila gut colonization), the in vitro assay results supported the hypothesis that Pseudomonas fluorescens could potentially inhibit Erwinia tracheiphila in vivo.  I have shown that other diabroticite beetles can successfully transmit Erwinia tracheiphila and demonstrated the potential use of Pseudomonas fluorescens as a new method of biological control for Erwinia tracheiphila.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11175], "author_name_tesi": "Roberts, Dana Catherine", "last_name_ssi": "Roberts", "middle_name_ssi": "Catherine", "first_name_ssi": "Dana", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shelby Jay Fleischer", "Jason Laurence Rasgon", "Joyce Megumi Sakamoto"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shelby Jay Fleischer, Thesis Advisor", "Jason Laurence Rasgon, Thesis Advisor", "Joyce Megumi Sakamoto, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Erwinia tracheiphila", "striped cucumber beetle", "vector", "Pseudomonas fluorescens"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "The Labors of Karl Marx: Tekhn\u00e7, Valorization, Revolution", "id": "6548", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6499", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation comprises a comprehensive re-reading of Marx\u2019s understanding of labor. In order to make sense of Marx\u2019s emphasis on labor, I argue, we must take his own productive activity seriously. Doing so obviates many of the standard objections to Marx\u2019s critique of capitalism. It does so by redirecting attention towards Marx\u2019s effort to transform his readers from isolated individuals into a revolutionary laboring multitude. \n\nI begin with an examination of \u201cconcrete labor\u201d\u2014the intentional production of useful things\u2014which reveals that this is the motor of human history for Marx because our products escape from the intentions that formed them. The materiality of production, Marx shows, confounds the idealism of intentionality. This dynamic is greatly exacerbated by capitalism, to which I turn next. The abstract logic of capitalist production is so divorced from its material effects that it threatens to utterly use up the earth and the workers on which it depends. \n\nHaving reconstructed Marx\u2019s account of labor and capital, however, only establishes the terms of the problem. The idealisms of concrete labor and capital have brought society to an impasse. In order to show how Marx confronts this impasse, I argue that we must recognize the profound self-reflexivity of Marx\u2019s writings. Marx does not just write about labor, he engages in his own form of productivity. He endeavors, though his own writing, to redirect his readers away from both traditional intentionality and capital and towards the revolutionary materiality that conditions and frustrates these idealisms. \n\nMy reading here gives special attention to Volume I of Capital, which is Marx\u2019s most elaborately developed attempt to work this transformation on his readers. I demonstrate that Marx in fact extensively modeled Capital on Dante\u2019s Inferno. Adapting the structure and purpose of Dante\u2019s poem, Marx leads us on a descent through the mystifying categories of modern economics (the idea of capitalism) in order to free us from the fear of eternal imprisonment in this modern equivalent to Hell. Overcoming this paralyzing fear is Marx\u2019s real labor.

Moreover, negative affect has received greater attention given its widespread association with psychological distress. The present research expounds these traditional paradigms by using two current models of affect as frameworks to investigate the relationship between positive and negative affect in a sample of 554 family caregivers of relatives with dementia. First, the dynamic model of affect (DMA) proposed by Zautra and colleagues, is a state-level model which suggests that occasion-specific stress influences the relationship between positive and negative affect. The DMA asserts that under conditions of stress positive and negative affect collapse into a single bipolar dimension as information-processing is simplified to negate the uncertainty created by the stressful situation. In contrast, Fredrickson\u2019s broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions is a trait-level model which asserts that positive affect broadens individuals\u2019 modes of thinking and behaving, assisting them in building personal resources. This model posits an evolutionary function of positive affect based on the accrual of resources that promoted survival among our ancestors and that enhance modern-day coping efforts. Using the DMA to represent state-level relationships between the affects, the hypothesis that positive and negative affect become inversely correlated as caregivers report higher levels of stress was examined. The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions was used as a framework to investigate the moderating role of trait-level positive affect on the relationship between occasion-specific stress and negative affect. Multi-level modeling analyses indicated support for the DMA. The subjective stressor role overload was the most salient source of stress for caregivers in its relationship to negative affect. It was also the only source of stress that altered the relationship between caregivers\u2019 levels of positive and negative affect. Caregivers with higher levels of role overload had a higher inverse relationship between the two affects; as stress levels increased negative affect also increased, driving positive emotion down. While this state-level relationship was significant, trait-level positive affect did not influence the relationship between stress and negative affect; thus the role of trait-level positive affect as a coping resource was not supported. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5700], "author_name_tesi": "Robertson, Suzanne M", "last_name_ssi": "Robertson", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Suzanne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit", "Melissa Hardy", "David Manuel Almeida", "Linda Ann Wray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Chair", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Member", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member", "Linda Ann Wray, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["positive affect", "negative affect", "caregiving", "dementia"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "OPTIMIZING STRENGTH AND FRACTURE TOUGHNESS OF A CAST TITANIUM ALLOY THROUGH HEAT TREATMENT AND MICROSTRUCTURE CONTROL\n", "id": "7485", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "56", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "   The relationship between the microstructure and tensile ductility and fracture toughness for cast Ti-5111 was determined and compared to that of hot-rolled and annealed Ti-5111.  Graphite mold cast Ti-5111 plate material was examined in the as-received condition and after six different heat treatments involving elevated temperature anneals followed by an air or furnace cool.  Three investment cast Ti-5111 plates were also examined after annealing followed by either a fan cool, air cool, or furnace cool.  All castings developed a lamellar colony microstructure consisting of aligned lamellae of alpha and beta phases.  Altering the cooling rate from the annealing temperature had the most influence on the microstructure such that plates with a slower cooling rate typically developed coarser grain boundary alpha, larger alpha colonies, thicker alpha laths, and greater volume fractions of alpha phase.   The average prior beta grain size for the graphite mold cast specimens ranged from 920 \u00b5m to 1360 \u00b5m, while that for the investment cast specimens was approximately 1750 \u00b5m.  \n   The tensile behavior of the castings was characterized by a crack initiation and propagation process where the ductility was often limited by the strain required to initiate a large crack.  The cracks formed along planar slip bands that crossed alpha colonies or in some cases, entire prior beta grains.  Thus, reducing the alpha colony size and prior beta grain size should improve the casting ductility by limiting the length of slip-induced cracks.  Due to the large grain and colony sizes present in the castings, the strength and ductility was observed to be sensitive to specimen size such that a smaller tensile diameter (i.e. 3.2 mm as compared to 12.5 mm) decreased the tensile and yield strengths due to the high fraction of large grains located on the specimen surface that can yield by predominantly single slip.  The scatter in ductility values in the smaller specimens was significantly greater as a result of fracture controlled by a crack initiation and propagation process within a single grain that comprises a large fraction of the specimen cross-section.  Thus, once a large crack initiated, minimal additional strain was required to propagate the crack.  \n   Both intrinsic and extrinsic toughening mechanisms were apparent in the fracture toughness study of the castings.  The fracture initiation toughness was enhanced by secondary cracking and significant blunting at the crack tip as evidenced by the presence of strain-induced void formation within a large process zone.  Large alpha colonies located at the transition between the fatigue pre-crack and tensile crack growth regions limited the fracture initiation toughness by promoting easy crack growth along a significant fraction of the crack front.  Thus, limiting the alpha colony size should enhance the fracture initiation toughness.  \n   The best crack propagation resistance (tearing modulus) was observed from specimens with large alpha colonies and large prior beta grains.  Enhancing the size of these features increased the surface roughness, and consequently the tearing modulus, due to greater crack deflection, crack bifurcation, and shear ligament toughening from the larger alpha colonies and prior beta grains.  Crack bridging by the ductile beta phase was also observed and should enhance the tearing modulus. When compared to the hot-rolled and annealed plate, the graphite mold castings exhibited better fracture initiation toughness and crack propagation resistance. However, the wrought plate maintained relatively good fracture initiation toughness and crack propagation resistance as a result of the continuous ductile beta matrix present in the microstructure.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [57], "author_name_tesi": "Robinson, Amy C", "last_name_ssi": "Robinson", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Albert Koss", "Christopher Mulhstein", "Paul Raymond Howell", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Ernest Czyryca"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Albert Koss, Committee Chair", "Christopher Mulhstein, Committee Chair", "Paul Raymond Howell, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Ernest Czyryca, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fracture toughness", "Ti-5111", "titanium", "cast", "mechanical behavior"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Design for Synthesis in Geovisualization", "id": "8671", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "53", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Visually-enabled analysis of geographic information with interactive geovisualization tools is increasingly common in domains like disease surveillance, crisis management, and intelligence analysis.

Individual and collaborative synthesis experiments were conducted with participants from PNNL, CIDD, and GeoVISTA to observe synthesis in a simulated real-world scenario. Analysis of experimental and interview data provides insight into the process of geovisual synthesis.

The focus of this research was the potential use of green roofs containing recycled materials as a pre-treatment device prior to rainwater harvesting for non-potable use. This project evaluated three recycled materials, crumb rubber, compost and biosolids, for their potential use in green roof media as complete or partial replacements for the current inorganic and organic components of green roof media. To be a viable green roof component the media must maintain or increase rainwater pollutant retention, compared to commercially-available green roof media, while not releasing problematic pollutants such as additional nutrients or heavy metals, e.g. the water collected afterwards would be safe enough for re-use in non-drinkable applications and/or discharge. In addition, the media must not have a substantial impact on plant growth. Two runs were performed, one without adding an E. coli spike on day two and one with the spike, to determine the impact of increased biological activity on pollutant retention in both commercial and recycled-component media. Both synthetic stormwater and the resultant effluent were collected from each media combination and were analyzed for the following parameters: Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphate, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Nitrate, Ammonia, and Dissolved Copper. After analysis, the bacteria appeared to decrease or prevent an increase in concentration the following parameters: Nitrate, Total Nitrogen, and COD.

As a result, alternative materials for bore coatings have been researched by the military; of particular interest are the interfacial properties of these thermal sprayed coatings. Thus, a valid mechanical test to characterize the bond strength and fracture energy of thermal sprayed coatings is desired. First, a finite element model of a four point bend test was developed based on empirical data found in literature. Results from the model were verified by comparing load-displacement data to the literature, but only modest agreement was achieved. Thereafter, a four point bend test was performed in-house in an attempt to verifiably measure the interfacial properties. Unfortunately, this experiment was unsuccessful, largely due to significant plastic deformation of the samples that occurred prior to delamination. Due to the limited success of the four point bend test, alternative mechanical tests to extract interfacial properties were considered. Subsequently, an indentation test was performed on thermal sprayed samples in accordance with an existing experimental technique. A c-scan was next used to measure delamination of the coating from the substrate. Finally, a finite element model of the indentation test was tuned to match the data from the experiment. The interfacial properties were therefore extracted by achieving good agreement between the data and the model.

It is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in working-aged adults.  The pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood, but the earliest symptoms include subtle visual disturbances such as color and contrast sensitivity changes, delayed dark adaptation, and difficulty seeing in low-light environments.  The earliest clinical signs of diabetic retinopathy are vascular abnormalities such as microaneurysms and edema.  There is considerable evidence suggesting that retinal neurodegeneration takes place before the onset of such vascular changes.\n\nPrevious research in our lab has established that retinal neurodegeneration is an apoptotic event, leading to retinal thinning.  Animal models of experimental diabetes have been used to determine that retinal thinning takes place preferentially in the inner retina.  The retinal ganglion cells are especially vulnerable, demonstrating the greatest loss in peripheral regions of the retina.  The current study seeks to further explore the effects of diabetes on the neuronal components of retinas from human donors and from diabetic mice.  The studies compiled here seek to test the hypotheses that early stages of diabetes lead to histologic evidence of neurodegeneration in human donor tissue, and that diabetes in the Ins2Akita mouse leads to alterations in rhodopsin content and electroretinographic output.\n\nDonor retinas from humans who had had diabetes for less than 10 years were compared with retinas from age-matched nondiabetic donors.  Comparisons were made on the basis of retinal thickness and cell counts.  Ins2Akita mice, which spontaneously develop diabetes at 4 weeks of age, were tested after being diabetic for 7 weeks.  Electroretinograms were recorded and the following waveforms were analyzed for amplitude and implicit time:  scotopic threshold response, a- and b- waves, and oscillatory potentials.\n\nResults of the human histopathology study indicate that, while there are no differences between retinal thickness measurements from diabetic vs. nondiabetic donors, the retinas from donors with short-term diabetes had fewer cells in the peripheral regions of the outer nuclear layer.  Cell counts from the cone photoreceptors were unchanged, indicating rod loss.  Studies of rod photoreceptor protein content demonstrated a decrease in rhodopsin content in diabetic mice, without a change in the protein content of other phototransduction proteins (transducin and phosphodiesterase).  ERG results from diabetic mice demonstrate reduced scotopic threshold response and delayed oscillatory potentials, compared to age-matched controls.\n\nThe findings presented here confirm that neurodegeneration takes place in the peripheral retina early in the progression of diabetes in humans.  In contrast to animal models in which the inner retina is implicated, it may be that the photoreceptors of the outer retina are the cells most vulnerable to neurodegeneration in humans with diabetes.  Diabetic mice, however, demonstrate loss of rhodopsin without concomitant photoreceptor loss.  ERG results in the Ins2Akita diabetic mice show deficits in scotopic vision and changes in oscillatory potentials similar to those seen in humans with diabetes. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6505], "author_name_tesi": "Robinson, William Foster", "last_name_ssi": "Robinson", "middle_name_ssi": "Foster", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alistair J Barber", "Alistair J Barber", "Patricia Mclaughlin", "Steven Abcouwer, Ph D", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alistair J Barber, Dissertation Advisor", "Alistair J Barber, Committee Chair", "Patricia Mclaughlin, Committee Member", "Steven Abcouwer, Ph D, Committee Member", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["diabetes", "retinopathy", "neurodegeneration", "photoreceptor", "electroretinography", "ERG", "immunohistochemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EVALUATION OF CHITINOUS MATERIALS AS A MULTIFUNCTIONAL SUBSTRATE FOR THE REMEDIATION OF MINE IMPACTED WATER\n", "id": "10238", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4599", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The generation of mine impacted waters is one of the most serious environmental problems originated by the mining industry.  For the remediation of these metal-laden and often acidic streams, several passive treatment technologies have been applied.  The success of these technologies greatly depends on the selection of the substrate.  This study evaluates the ability of crab-shell chitin (SC-20) as a multifunctional substrate for MIW treatment.  Both biologically active and abiotic tests were conducted to 1) assess the contributions of each of the components of SC-20 (chitin, proteins, and minerals) to the observed changes, and 2) compare the performance of crab-shell chitin to other commonly used materials.  \nIn biologically active microcosm tests, SC-20 demonstrated a superior performance in comparison to spent mushroom compost and sodium lactate.  The addition of SC-20 increased the pH from 3.0 \u2013 3.5 to near neutral in 2 \u2013 3 days, steadily generated alkalinity at a rate of 26.5 \u2013 40.3 mg CaCO3 /L-d, and supported the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) with a lag period of 7 \u2013 9 d and sulfate reduction rates of 11.9 \u2013 17.8 mg SO42-/L-d.  While no major changes were observed using spent mushroom compost as a sole substrate, alkalinity generation and sulfate reduction rates promoted by sodium lactate (30.3 mg CaCO3 /L-d and 24.8 mg SO42-/L-d) were comparable to those obtained with SC-20, but such changes only occurred after 27 days of incubation.  Al and Fe removal was observed with all three materials, but it was much faster with SC-20.  The latter was the only substrate able to partially remove manganese (>73%).  \nIn biologically active columns using SC-20, a hydraulic retention time of 11.2 h was enough to raise the pH from 3.5 to &#61566;7.5.  Alkalinity increased at a rate of 50 \u00b1 20 mg CaCO3/day, and lasted throughout the duration of the test (125 days or 268 pore volumes (PV)) without showing signs of exhaustion.  Metals (Al, Fe, and Mn) were completely removed for 171 PV.  Manganese and iron breakthroughs occurred after 174 and 234 PV, respectively, whereas aluminum breakthrough was never observed.  The steady generation of alkalinity in SC-20-treated systems was attributed to the dissolution of chitin-associated carbonates (mainly calcite), while the prompt onset of the SRB activity was supported by the fermentation of chitin and its associated proteins.  Results from thermodynamic geochemical modeling using PHREEQC indicate that Al removal was likely due to the precipitation of hydroxides and/or alunite (KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6).  Iron removal appeared to be driven by precipitation of ferric oxides at the beginning of the test, and by iron sulfide precipitation once the SRB became active.  The partial removal of manganese could be explained by the formation of rhodochrosite (MnCO3), although other mechanisms like sorption or precipitation of other minerals cannot be discarded.  \nAbiotic and anoxic tests were conducted to isolate the chemical and physical treatment mechanisms from those driven by biological activity, using SC-20 with different grades of purity.  In particular, the generation of alkalinity and the removal of manganese due to mineral dissolution and precipitation were evaluated and compared to those obtained using limestone in closed-system and kinetic tests.  In closed systems with a contact time of 72 h, manganese removal &#8805;95% (initial concentration = 10 mg/L) was obtained using only 5 g/L of SC-20 (raw or deproteinized); the pH was increased from 3 to 9.2-10.2; and 83-187 mg CaCO3/L of alkalinity was generated.  In contrast, 5-125 g-limestone/L only raised the pH to 7.8-8.3, leading to lower alkalinity levels (56-63 mg CaCO3/L) and poor metal removal efficiencies (&#8804;85%).  Results from kinetic tests indicated that removal of &#8805;95% of the initial Mn load by SC-20 was achieved after 48 h.  Geochemical calculations (PHREEQC) indicate that limestone-treated systems were close to equilibrium with calcite, while octacalcium phosphate (Ca4H(PO4)3) appears to be the controlling phase in systems treated with SC-20.  The removal of manganese could be attributed to the precipitation of rhodochrosite (MnCO3) and/or MnHPO4.  The faster changes observed with the two grades of SC-20 compared to limestone could be attributed to their larger surface area and their distinct composition, including phosphates and soluble organic compounds.  \nThe sorption of manganese onto the organic components of SC-20 (chitin and proteins) was evaluated using two purities of SC-20 (demineralized (chitin + proteins) and demineralized/deproteinized (\u201cpure\u201d chitin)) under different pH conditions by means of kinetic tests and sorption isotherms. The kinetics of manganese adsorption onto both types of solids was well described by the pseudo-second order model, with faster changes occurring under alkaline conditions and with \u201cpure\u201d chitin.  The equilibrium of adsorption was well described by the Langmuir model.  The maximum sorption capacity (qm) was found to depend greatly on the pH of the solution, with minimal or no sorption observed at pH <5.  At higher pH regimes, qm values ranged from 0.165 (at pH 5.4) to 0.981 (at pH 8.7) for \u201cpure\u201d chitin, and increased from 0.878 (at pH 5.2) to 5.437 (at pH 8.6) when both chitin and protein were present.  Results clearly suggest that the chitin-associated proteins offer additional sorption sites for manganese.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4566], "author_name_tesi": "Robinson Lora, Mary Ann ", "last_name_ssi": "Robinson Lora", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mary Ann", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rachel Alice Brennan", "Rachel Alice Brennan", "Brian Dempsey", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Peggy Ann Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rachel Alice Brennan, Dissertation Advisor", "Rachel Alice Brennan, Committee Chair", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Member", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["precipitation", "metal biosorption", "manganese removal", "passive treatment", "acid mine drainage", "sulfate reduction"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "The functional connectivity changes in the rat brain following acute and chronic nicotine administration", "id": "15389acr5323", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15389", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite its potential as an addictive drug, the system level effect of nicotine on the brain remains elusive.

These two FC patterns may serve as mechanisms of resilience (insula intra-connectivity) or vulnerability (insula\u2212PAG connectivity) to nicotine addiction. \n Nicotine\u2019s cognitive enhancing effects during acute exposure may underlie the rewarding effects that initiate addiction.  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of Long Evans rats  (n=30) was used to determine the relationship between acute nicotine exposure and FC changes. Drug na\u00efve rats received a tail--vein catheter and received a 1-mL/kg dose of saline or nicotine (0.4 mg/kg-mL) and were imaged in an awake imaging paradigm. Seed-based analysis and independent component analysis were used to analyze the fMRI data.  Functional connections between regions associated with chronic reward, sensory, and memory were implicated following a single acute nicotine exposure in drug-na\u00efve rats.

Oftentimes even advanced L2 speakers cannot acquire accurate pronunciation on their own (Grosser, 1997; Jilka, 1999; Munro & Derwing, 2008; Trofimovich & Baker, 2006), and their abilities tend to stabilize after a certain amount of time.  To counteract this, training in L2 pronunciation has been found effective in a number of classroom and laboratory studies (Derwing, Munro & Wiebe, 1998; Elliott, 1997; Flege, 1989; Hardison, 2004; Saito & Lyster, 2011). Many researchers recommend introducing pronunciation training into the curriculum as early in the language learning sequence as possible (e.g., Counselman, 2010; Elliott, 1995, 1997; Eskenazi, 1999; Hardison, 2004; Neufeld & Schneiderman, 1980), yet previous experimental studies have not tested the validity of these recommendations.  Most training programs are introduced in more advanced stages of L2 proficiency (e.g., Counselman, 2010; Elliott, 1995, 1997; Lord, 2008), and pronunciation instruction is still largely ignored in elementary-level classrooms. Thus the question of when to begin formal pronunciation instruction has yet to be sufficiently answered.\n\nThis dissertation addresses the above issue by directly comparing the effectiveness of pronunciation instruction at elementary and intermediate proficiency levels in order to detect the best time course for introducing pronunciation instruction in the classroom. A two-group experimental design was used, and forty-four students in four intact sections of first- and fourth-semester German courses participated in this study.  An identical eight-week pronunciation training unit was implemented as a supplement in the experimental sections of the first- and fourth-semester German language classes. Training was divided into eight modules that each focused on one segmental or prosodic aspect of the German language at a time, including lexical stress, palatal and velar fricatives ([\u00e7] and [x]), fricative and vocalized /r/, and the monophthongization of [e] and [o].  Training in both the perception and production of the targeted features was provided, and training was conducted in the first ten minutes of each class period.  At the conclusion of each module, participants in all groups completed partner recordings in which they practiced producing the target features in citation form and in free speech contexts.  Following completion of these recordings, students provided peer feedback on pronunciation for their partner.  Data come from identical pre- and posttests that were administered for both groups before and immediately after training. Pre- and posttest speech samples were rated by native German speakers for ease of comprehensibility and strength of accent.  Pre- and posttest ratings from the experimental and control groups, as well as from first- and fourth-semester students, are compared in order to gauge the effectiveness of pronunciation training in the earliest semesters of German L2 learning.\n\nResults show that first-semester students who received training were able to significantly improve their phonological perception skills, their comprehensibility, and their accent to a greater extent than both those students who did not receive training and fourth-semester students. In comparison to those same groups, first-semester students who received training were able to significantly improve their pronunciation in more of the problem areas for which they had received training. The dissertation concludes that pronunciation instruction is effective for students in their first semester of learning German, and that it may be more effective to train L2 learners in the first semesters than once they have reached more advanced stages of L2 proficiency. I argue that instruction in pronunciation should begin in the first few semesters of L2 German learning for optimal results. As such, this work provides an answer to a gap in the literature and begins to provide answers to the appropriate time course for intervention to begin for the most effective results.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9450], "author_name_tesi": "Roccamo, Ashley Lynne", "last_name_ssi": "Roccamo", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynne", "first_name_ssi": "Ashley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Carrie Neal Jackson", "Michael Travis Putnam", "Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Dr Mary O'brien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barry Richard Page Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Carrie Neal Jackson, Committee Member", "Michael Travis Putnam, Committee Member", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Committee Member", "Dr Mary O'brien, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["German", "Linguistics", "Education", "L2 Pronunciation", "Second Language Acquisition", "Phonology", "Accent"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Super-cooled Large Droplet Experimental Reproduction, Ice Shape Modeling, and Scaling Law Assessment", "id": "13819etr5040", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13819", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The simulation of icing conditions is sought for potential aircraft certification,\nand therefore test facilities that can generate conditions able to reproduce the\nice accretion phenomena are necessary. The icing conditions that aircraft endure\nare outlined in The Federal Aviation Administration regulations for airframe icing\nas described in Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 14 Part 25 Appendix C and\nPart 33 Appendix O. Multiple icing facilities exist for FAR 14 Part 25 Appendix\nC conditions, however developing facilities that can replicate super-cooled large\ndroplet (SLD) clouds and bi-modal SLD clouds (cloud with concentrations of\nAppendix C and SLD conditions often observed in flight test) related to Appendix\nO is difficult due to the shortcomings of horizontal wind tunnels when generating\nSLD particles (gravity effects on the large droplets). In the presented research effort,\nThe Adverse Environment Rotor Test State (AERTS) at Penn State is assessed\nas a low-cost alternative to horizontal wind tunnels for the reproduction of SLD\nconditions. Current ice modeling techniques are also investigated for SLD regimes,\nexisting Appendix C ice scaling techniques are evaluated in the SLD regime, and\nbi-modal SLD cloud impingement limits and ice shapes are investigated. Mentioned\nevaluation of ice accretion modeling tools is conducted via ice shape correlations\nbetween experimental result and predictions.\nFirstly, the AERTS facility was calibrated in the SLD regime. Median Volume\nDiameter (MVD) and Liquid Water Content (LWC) are the test parameters\nnecessary to calibrate for the reproduction of flight conditions. Phase Doppler\nInterferometer (PDI) data of cloud MVD was used to demonstrate that the existing\nnozzle spray system can provide relative MVD control of an SLD cloud. LWC\ncalibration is generally achieved in an icing facility utilizing a rime ice shape to\nensure freezing fractions close to unity (all encountered droplets freeze on impact\nwithout splashing or flowing aft). A rime shape in the SLD regime is unachievable\ndue to large particle splashing, and thus the effect splashing has on effective collection\nefficiency must be considered in the LWC calculation. LEWICE, the nation\u2019s\nstandard ice prediction software, contains a droplet splashing model based on low\nspeed test data (20 m/s). The LEWICE splashing model, coupled with a literature\nbased empirical LWC adjustment, necessary due to test speeds beyond the 20 m/s\nlimit, was utilized to effectively calibrate the LWC in the AERTS facility within\n16%.\nSecondly, ice shape modeling software known to be valid in Appendix C conditions\nwere assessed in the SLD regime. LEWICE, with and without an improved\nheat transfer model (known as the AERTS prediction) was compared to six (6)\nAERTS test cases, three (3) of which had literature reference shapes. Overall, the\nAERTS test cases and literature reference case shapes were similar, but differences\nin horn formation were observed. Overall, the ice prediction modeling tools were\nin agreement with the AERTS test cases, and the AERTS prediction provided\nimprovements in shape prediction when compared to LEWICE. When comparing\nthe deviation of the generated ice shapes to the prediction models, the AERTS\nprediction, on average, provided a 28.4% ice stagnation thickness prediction improvements\nand 24.1% horn angle prediction improvements to LEWICE predictions.\nThis is consistent with the prediction performance of LEWICE when including the\nheat transfer model improvements that were observed in previous, Appendix C\ncondition, research efforts.\nThirdly, ice condition scaling laws known to be valid in the Appendix C regime\nwere evaluated in SLD conditions. The modified Ruff scaling method was previously\ntested at the NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel for SLD, but investigation of the\nscaling laws in other test facilities was requested to further understand SLD scaling.\nThe results of this research, comparing six (6) scaling tests with the six (6) SLD\ntests previously mentioned, suggests that the ice scaling laws apply in the SLD\nregime as previously discussed in the literature. The mean deviation of stagnation\nthickness, horn angle, and horn protrusion of scale to reference test cases were\nobserved to be 1.60%, 4.45%, and 1.46%, respectively. Furthermore, scalability\ndid not appear to degrade despite a large range of MVD, LWC, temperature, and\nspeed tested.\nFinally, a bi-modal cloud was studied in the SLD regime. The AERTS facility\nwas modified with two independent cloud spray systems to generate a bi-modal\ncloud. In an SLD cloud, ice impingement limits are farther aft than in Appendix C\nconditions, which is of concern for de-icing system design. Therefore, impingement\nlimit behavior of bi-modal clouds often observed in nature, must be understood.\nImpingement limits are defined by collection efficiency; a function of particle\ntrajectory and thus MVD. Therefore, the impingement limit of a bi-modal SLD cloud should be that of a unimodal SLD cloud of the same MVD. To assess the\nimpingement limit trend, four (4) conditions resulting in sixteen (16) tests and fortyeight\n(48) data points were executed. The SLD impingement limit being that of the\nbi-modal cloud was observed experimentally, with a -1.58% \u00b18.44% mean deviation\nof the upper impingement limit to the LEWICE prediction of the SLD impingement\nlimit, and a -11.0% \u00b18.41% mean deviation of the lower impingement limit to the\nLEWICE prediction. When observing shape trends in the bi-modal scenario, the ice\nshape qualities transitioned from the 0% SLD to the 100% SLD shape consistently\nas SLD cloud content was increased. When comparing the deviation of four(4)\ngenerated ice shapes to the prediction models, the AERTS prediction forecast, on\naverage, 21.4% ice stagnation thickness prediction improvements, and 18.5% horn\nangle prediction improvements when compared to LEWICE prediction deviations.\nvi", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14050], "author_name_tesi": "Rocco, Edward Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Rocco", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Edward", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Palacios", "Philip J.

Stream salamanders of the family Plethodontidae can occupy small, northern Appalachian streams in large numbers and are important vertebrate components. In the Pennsylvania central Appalachians, up to seven species comprise a streambank assemblage. The northern two-lined (Eurycea b. bislineata), longtail (E. longicauda), northern spring (Gyrinophilus p. porphyriticus), and northern red (Pseudotriton r. ruber) salamanders (subfamily Plethodontinae) have aquatic egg-laying habits and extended aquatic larval stages (1-4 yr). The mountain dusky (Desmognathus ochrophaeus), northern dusky (D. f. fuscus), and Appalachian seal (D. monticola) salamanders (subfamily Desmognathinae) have terrestrial egg-laying habits and shorter larval stages (3 mo - 1.5 yr). Differences in life history and nesting habits were hypothesized to favor terrestrial nesters in acidified streams because of greater exposure to stream toxicity in more aquatic forms. Three investigations were completed, each focusing on resolving separate but related questions. The effect of acidification on stream salamander abundance and distribution was initially addressed by sampling for stream salamanders along an acid-alkaline gradient. The direct effects of stream toxicity was investigated subsequently by in situ exposure of aquatic nesters, assemblage members most likely to be affected. The hypothesized benefits of terrestrial habits and  life history were investigated in terrestrial nesters by simulating adverse nesting environments in the laboratory. Investigations subsequent to the field study were intended to compare survival of taxa that exhibited different distribution patterns but shared similar nesting habits and life histories. Assemblage response in the field (abundance, species and life stage composition) was investigated in 1997-1998 by plot-sampling for salamanders in 14 Pennsylvania Central Appalachians streams representing acid mine drainage-contaminated (AMD), episodically acidified, non-acidic, and non-acidic-high alkalinity conditions. Acidic streams favored the mountain dusky and northern spring salamanders, adult or terrestrial stages, and low abundance. The northern two-lined and northern dusky, aquatic larvae, and higher salamander abundance were favored in non-acidic streams. Ordination by correspondence analysis (CA) grouped the above taxa similarly and along the axis most highly correlated to the acid-alkaline gradient sampled. Removal, by partial canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), of variation tied to stream physical habitat failed to eliminate significant associations with water chemistry. Low abundance of the northern dusky, a terrestrial nester, and persistence of the northern spring, an aquatic nester with an extended aquatic larval stage, in acidic streams, were inconsistent with the proposed general hypothesis that survival favored terrestrial nesting and shorter aquatic larval stages. The direct effects of stream toxicity were investigated by in situ exposure of northern spring and northern two-lined salamanders in AMD-contaminated reaches where sampling had revealed low abundance. Survival, changes in body water content and total body sodium were examined as response variables in 1998 and 1999 by 19-d, 48-hr, and 12-hr in situ exposures in reaches of varying AMD-contamination. Testing of the northern spring was limited to the 48-hr exposure. Exposures were conducted in southwestern and central Pennsylvania streams using wild-caught larvae and metamorphs. Most northern two-lined larvae and metamorphs survived the 19-d (weak AMD) and 12-hr (strong AMD) exposures. Survival in the 48-hr exposure favored lower AMD-contamination, larger and older larvae, metamorphs, and northern spring larvae. The proportion of body water was lower after 19-d and 48-hr exposures, relative to controls, but increased initially during the 12-hr exposure. Total body sodium was lost in all exposures. The northern dusky and mountain dusky are both terrestrial nesters. In acidic streams, the northern dusky declined, whereas the mountain dusky persisted. Absence of an aquatic larval stage, as reported in the early literature, was hypothesized to favor survival in acidic streams. Survival in hatchlings of both species was examined in the laboratory by exposure to treatments simulating acidic, dry, and normal nesting environments. Hatchlings were collected in nests from southwestern and central Pennsylvania. Early transformation was observed in only 2 (<1%) of the original 302 northern dusky hatchlings collected and before the experiment began. Hatchling survival was lowest in acidic and dry treatments. Hatchling size and their origins also affected survival.  A single mountain dusky nest was found; all 10 hatchlings transformed within weeks of hatching and survived the 51-d exposure irrespective of container treatment.  Based on the findings of the three investigations, reduced abundance and distribution of stream salamanders is attributed to the direct effects of acidification. Persistence in acidic streams by the life-history route was possible by early transformation, the bypassing of the aquatic stage. Natural acid tolerance aided survival in one aquatic nester. The impact of stream acidification was anticipated to be considerable in stream salamanders lacking either mechanism.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2123], "author_name_tesi": "Rocco, Gian L", "last_name_ssi": "Rocco", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Gian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert P Brooks", "Dr Robert F Carline", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski", "Alan H Taylor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert P Brooks, Committee Chair", "Dr Robert F Carline, Committee Member", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski, Committee Member", "Alan H Taylor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pseudotriton", "Eurycea", "Desmognathus", "acidification", "Appalachians", "stream", "Plethodontidae", "salamander", "Gyrinophilus", "in situ"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "AN INTEGRATIVE TWO-DIMENSIONAL MODEL OF NORMAL AND PATHOLOGICAL NARCISSISM TO RECONCILE THE SCHISM BETWEEN CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND SOCIAL-PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY", "id": "11492", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4196", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The conceptualization and assessment of narcissism is inconsistent across research disciplines, leading to a criterion problem which weakens the nomological net.

Narcissism is also a widely studied personality trait in social-personality psychology.

Nevertheless, few studies have recovered evidence of jade artifact production.  This dissertation presents the results of an archaeological project in the Middle Motagua Valley, Zacapa, Guatemala, where evidence demonstrates widespread production of jade artifacts in the only positively-identified jade source for prehispanic Mesoamerica.  This field research involved archaeological survey and test excavation to document the organization of jade artifact production in the area during the Late Classic period (A.D. 600-900).  These data and subsequent technological analyses suggest that jade aritfact production took place in a variety of domestic and non-domestic, as well as elite and non-elite contexts.  This evidence runs counter to many previous models of wealth goods production, which have viewed such production as an elite-dominated activity.  Further, the data set of 9,920 jadeite artifacts represents the largest collection of jade artifact production evidence recovered to date, and provided the opportunity for a detailed analysis of the technological process of jadeite artifact production.  This study provides valuable insights into the organization of wealth goods production in ancient Mesoamerica and offers a contribution to general anthropological theories of political economy. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1845], "author_name_tesi": "Rochette, Erick Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Rochette", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Erick", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Kenneth Gale Hirth", "David Lee Webster", "George Robert Milner", "Matthew Bennett Restall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Chair", "David Lee Webster, Committee Member", "George Robert Milner, Committee Member", "Matthew Bennett Restall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Domestic Economy", "Prestige Goods", "Jade", "Archaeology", "Classic Maya", "Political Economy", "Craft Production", "Motagua Valley", "Guatemala"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Relationship Between Parent and Teacher Ratings on the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents", "id": "8747", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5567", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Best practices in the assessment of emotional/behavioral disorders suggest that behavior ratings be obtained from adults who observe children in their natural settings of home and school, such as parents and teachers. A problem arises with the interpretation of discrepancies that typically occur between parent and teacher behavior ratings. Specifically, parent and teacher ratings correlate only moderately with one another for both externalizing (overactive) and internalizing (underactive) behaviors. \n     Rating scale item content and format may be a contributing factor in the low to moderate correlations between parent and teacher ratings. Traditional behavior rating scales are typically characterized by contextually removed, inferential, and ambiguously worded items whose response format involves subjective measures of the frequency or intensity of behaviors. The Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents (ASCA;  McDermott, Marston, & Stott, 1993) teacher rating scale and accompanying parent form, the ASCA-Home version (ASCA-H; Watkins & McDermott, 2002), avoid this type of item content and response format by providing clear, observable behavioral descriptions within specific situations for which informants indicate the presence or absence of a behavior.\n     The present study examines the correlations between parent and teacher ratings for a sample of 374 kindergarten through grade eight students on the Overactivity and Underactivity scales of the ASCA and ASCA-H.

I extend right to the city literature and analysis to investigate how low-income and marginalized center city residents navigate the new political, economic and socio-cultural terrain as they accommodate or struggle to resist urban dispossession and dislocation.\n\nConsequently, the spatial move out of Beijing\u2019s center city and up into the residential spaces of high-rise buildings elicits corresponding social transformations that tend to socio-economically fragment and isolate former hutong residents from the practices and the community ties that had previously defined their everyday lives. Residents pushed out to the urban periphery often move to newer high-rise buildings\nconstructed in clusters on Beijing\u2019s urban fringe where the transportation infrastructure\nand social services (including education, child and elder care, health clinics, and hospitals) are woefully inadequate for the large and growing population in these neighborhoods.\n\nThe combined effects of the government\u2019s decentralization of fiscal responsibility\nto lower administrative units and increased privatization of residential housing complexes\nlead to a corresponding reduction in access to state-sponsored social services. The move\nup into the high-rise complexes also contributes to shifting management of care-giving\nresponsibilities within households. Whereas the previous residential spatial configurations in the hutong neighborhoods facilitated a more distributed responsibility of care giving beyond the nuclear family unit, high-rise spatial configurations create distinct socio-spatial boundaries that redefine household gendered divisions of labor and their associated spheres of public and private care and responsibility. In this study, I draw from ethnographic fieldwork conducted in 2008-2009 to show how the spatial move from hutong neighborhoods into high-rise complexes concentrates caregiving work at the scale of the nuclear family unit. Furthermore, I argue that this concentrated shift is disproportionately borne by women in contemporary Beijing.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4534], "author_name_tesi": "Rock, Melissa Yang", "last_name_ssi": "Rock", "middle_name_ssi": "Yang", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Wright", "Lorraine Dowler", "James Mc Carthy", "Christine Lee Gorby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Wright, Dissertation Advisor", "Lorraine Dowler, Committee Member", "James Mc Carthy, Committee Member", "Christine Lee Gorby, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Neoliberal governmentality", "urban redevelopment", "dispossession", "displacement", "Hutong neighborhoods", "geographies of care", "Beijing"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Classic / Postclassic Transition: The Maya of San Jeronimo II, Peten, Guatemala\n", "id": "7255", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4061", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the effects of the Classic Maya \u201cCollapse\u201d on remnant populations in the central Pet\u00e9n Lakes district of northern Guatemala.

Drawing on emerging theories of fluid racial identification, contact theory, and social network methodology, I investigate how the social networks embedded in schools influence reported friendships.  Consistent with previous literature, by utilizing exponential random graph modelling I find evidence of racial preference (homophily), where students are most likely to be friends with schoolmates of the same race beyond what we would expect by chance.  When these friendships are examined further, the specific type of racial classification scheme becomes important.  When taking into account the external appearance of one\u2019s racial category (measured by the interviewer\u2019s classification of respondents) interracial friendships become even more rare, as students are sometimes in interracial friendships by their own classification, but intra-racial friendships when using external classification.

Using the Vanderbilt Assessment of Leadership in Education (VAL-ED), this quantitative research study investigated the learning-centered leadership skills of principals in 16 selected area career and technical education schools.  The study addressed four research questions.  The study determined the extent to which (a) learning-centered leadership skills were demonstrated by career and technical education principals; (b) perceptions of leadership skills differed among  principals, supervisors, and teachers; (c) leadership skills of career and technical education principals differed from the national norm; and (d) an association existed between specific leadership skills and student achievement on the National Occupational Competency Testing Institute (NOCTI) assessment.  The results suggested that career and technical education principals demonstrated leadership to a level of proficiency similar to the national norm and that there were no significant differences between the perception of leadership skills among the principals, supervisors, and teachers.

A number of studies have investigated the connection between caffeine, primarily through coffee, and its potentially detrimental effects on cardiovascular health. The vast majority of such investigations have been focused on blood cholesterol, while other blood markers of cardiovascular disease such as fibrinogen and C-reactive protein and their relationship with caffeine has been vastly understudied. A large number of studies have reported that both fibrinogen and C-reactive protein can be useful predictors of future cardiovascular disease, but their relationship with caffeine remains unknown. Furthermore, to this date, no published studies have reported on the effects of psychological stress on these blood markers, either alone, or in combination with caffeine, and no gender differences have been reported.\nThe current study examined the effects of caffeine and psychological stress on a population particularly vulnerable to future development of cardiovascular disease, those with a parental history of hypertension. This study used a 2 (gender; 26 men, 26 women) X 2 (drug condition; 26 no caffeine, 26 3.3mg/kg caffeine) experimental design. Participants came to a initial screening session where blood was drawn for a cholesterol assessment and extensive health screening to ensure that all participants were healthy. Qualified participants then completed a 3.5 hour experimental session to examine stress reactivity to caffeine or no caffeine exposure. Blood pressure and heart rate were collected during the experimental session, as well as 3 blood samples at baseline, stress, and recovery for later assessment of cortisol, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen levels, and, for females, progesterone and estradiol to confirm luteal phase cycle status.\nFindings from this study revealed increases in fibrinogen levels in response to caffeine, but no significant CRP changes. However, significant increase in CRP levels were observed when post-hoc analyses were conducted that involved the grouping of participants into low, moderate, and high CRP risk group based on baseline CRP levels. Systolic blood pressure significantly increased in males and females in response to both the stressor and caffeine. Diastolic blood pressure and heart rate significantly increased in males and females in response to the stressor, but not in response to caffeine.

Some specific findings include that students tend to overestimate their peers\u2019 drinking and approval of drinking behaviors, and that students will consume more to match these inflated perceptions (Borsari & Carey, 2001, 2003; Perkins & Craig, 2012).  Previous research on social networks has also found that alcohol use is associated with increased popularity or status (Ennett et al., 2006; Moody et al., 2011; Reifman et al., 2006).  Relatively few studies have addressed the ways in which one\u2019s closest peers can have a positive influence.  Behavioral interventions that rely on positive peer influence have shown promising evidence in other arenas (Banyard et al., 2007; Hays et al., 2003).  \nIn order to better understand whether peer influence can be leveraged to reduce dangerous drinking and resultant harms, this study investigated three specific questions: (1) Can students recognize problem drinkers in their networks? (2) How do different measures of status correlate to drinking behaviors? and (3) What is the relationship between status and willingness to intervene or express disapproval for drinking behaviors?  The present study employed methods of social network analysis to investigate these questions quantitatively.  200 participants from 8 fraternities and sororities completed a survey instrument that assessed individual alcohol behaviors and perceptions, and asked participants to nominate specific peers as: friends, someone who is fun to be around in a party/drinking setting, someone they look up to or admire, problem drinkers, and non-problem drinkers.\nSelf-reported alcohol consequences was the strongest predictor variable for problem drinker nominations, suggesting that students perceive problem drinkers in their social networks with some level of accuracy.  With regard to status it was found that while drinks per week and self-reported alcohol consequences showed some overall positive associations with friendship and status, both had nonlinear relationships with friendship nominations, and association actually becomes negative at higher levels.  This suggests that more extreme or problematic alcohol behaviors actually have a social cost.  Participants also completed a scale of items assessing their willingness to intervene helpfully with a peer whose drinking may be causing harm to self or others.  Higher scores on this scale were predicted by self-reported use of harm reduction strategies (like deciding to limit drinking to a certain number of drinks) and having held a leadership position.\nThese findings suggest that (1) students can recognize problem drinking in their peers, (2) that drinking, especially problematic drinking, is not socially rewarded unconditionally and can be negatively related to friendship and status, and (3) that students who hold leadership positions in their organizations and students who use protective behavioral strategies while drinking are more likely to helpfully intervene with friends.  These findings suggest some promising ways forward for interventions that aim to engage students as part of the solution.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9959], "author_name_tesi": "Rodrigues, Jared William", "last_name_ssi": "Rodrigues", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Jared", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dorothy H Evensen", "Leticia Oseguera", "Janet Swim", "Scott David Gest"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dorothy H Evensen, Dissertation Advisor", "Leticia Oseguera, Committee Member", "Janet Swim, Committee Member", "Scott David Gest, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["college student drinking", "social network analysis", "fraternities and sororities", "social status", "peer influence", "college student drinking", "social network analysis", "fraternities and sororities", "social status", "peer influence"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Simulation and Optimization of Natual Gas Transportation in Pipeline Networks Using a Linearized Model", "id": "29048", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12493", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When pipelines are used to transport gas through long distances, compression stations are coupled to the system in order to regain energy that is lost during fluid flow. In order for the compression stations to work, they consume part of the fluid being transported, making of it a source of fuel. An elegant optimization problem arises from the determination of network characteristics that will minimize fuel consumption at the compression stations. This minimization problem is given by highly non-linear objective function and constraints. Furthermore, an important part of the determination of compression performance is based on the calculation of efficiency in compressors. While some authors have assumed this efficiency to be constant, others have expanded the efficiency calculations by using polynomial curves. This study introduces three methods that allow for the simulation and optimization of natural gas transportation networks: first, it is demonstrated how fuel consumption can be accounted for in a system; second, it is introduced a method for the calculation of compressor efficiency; third, a domain-constrained search procedure is implemented in order to determine how compression stations should be adjusted in order to achieve minimum fuel consumption in a given transportation network. In order to account for possible convergence difficulties, all the procedures implemented in the three methods rely on the use of the Linear-Pressure Analog model, a technique that allows for the linearization of the gas flow equations. This is concluded to be one of the main reasons why system efficiency and minimum fuel consumption can be estimated, given the fact that the Linear Analog procedure facilitates convergence and effectiveness of the methods implemented in a reliable and effective manner.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11829], "author_name_tesi": "Rodrigues De Carvalho, Romulo ", "last_name_ssi": "Rodrigues De Carvalho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Romulo", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["natural gas transportation", "compression stations", "fuel consumption", "minimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Deviant Approaches: The Experience of Relegation in the French Penal Colonies (1885-1953)", "id": "27261", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11928", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this project, I analyze archival documents concerning a group of prisoners exiled to the colonial penal territories in French Guiana and New Caledonia.

While the rel\u00e9gu\u00e9s\u2019 documents mainly attest to their specific problems regarding their families, day-to-day survival and labor, these archives I use also reveal how relegation forced this predominantly French population to endure an unwanted life in the colonies. Relegation at its best allowed the rel\u00e9gu\u00e9s to lead lives that resembled those of settlers who had willingly left for the colonies, but most of the time, the rel\u00e9gu\u00e9s underwent treatment worse than that reserved for colonized populations. I argue that this group, which legislators and prison administrators labeled \u201cincorrigible,\u201d was in fact an artificially created criminal class at the service of the political needs of the French empire, and that this incongruity was an essential factor in the subsequent inefficiency of the entire relegation regime.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11373], "author_name_tesi": "Rodriguez, Denise N", "last_name_ssi": "Rodriguez", "middle_name_ssi": "N", "first_name_ssi": "Denise", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Boittin", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "Willa Zahava Silverman", "Jonathan Paul Eburne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Boittin, Dissertation Advisor", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Committee Member", "Willa Zahava Silverman, Committee Member", "Jonathan Paul Eburne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Penal Colonies", "Relegation", "France", "Empire", "Colonization"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Economic Adaptation and the Self-Employment Experience of Nigerians in New York City", "id": "10001", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3863", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study addresses the self-employment experience of Nigerian immigrants in New York City.  Business ownership has been shown to be both a means of individual and collective socioeconomic mobility for immigrants. In addition, it offers an alternative form of employment to those unable to work in the wage labor market. Self-employed immigrants also do not compete with the native-born for jobs as they create their own and often create jobs for others as well. While most theories that explain the proclivity towards self-employment of some immigrant groups focus on the limitations that keep them from wage labor (like lack of English-speaking abilities or little education), Nigerians do not fit this profile. \n\nThis study focuses on three specific objectives: to understand the determinants of self-employment; to examine the factors that determine the structure of business-related social networks; and to understand the consequences of self-employment and of relying on different networks. I conducted fieldwork for twelve months in New York City, and collected both qualitative and quantitative data, supplemented with data from the American Community Survey.\n\nI argue that most Nigerians do not enter self-employment as an alternative to constraints they face in obtaining wage labor. Instead, it is a culturally-valued occupation that most are highly familiar with, they plan and work towards it for many years, and they are attracted by its potential for financial growth and independence. Network structure appears to be related to the original goals of the business, with some entrepreneurs gearing their businesses towards the ethnic community and others towards a broader market. Primarily Nigerian customers prove challenging for entrepreneurs. These customers, because of their close ties to the business owners, often delay payment or make enormous demands. For this reason many entrepreneurs eventually expand their customer base. Because these businesses are often located in impoverished areas, however, relying on the local neighborhood population for business also prevents the business from growing. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3837], "author_name_tesi": "Rodriguez, Leila ", "last_name_ssi": "Rodriguez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Leila", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Lyons Johnson", "Patricia Lyons Johnson", "James William Wood", "Leif Jensen", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Lyons Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Lyons Johnson, Committee Chair", "James William Wood, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["African migration", "immigrant adaptation", "immigrant entrepreneurship"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SOURCE TERM ESTIMATION USING A GENETIC ALGORITHM AND INCORPORATING SENSOR CHARACTERISTICS\n", "id": "8443", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3823", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An accidental or intentional release of hazardous chemical, biological, nuclear, or radioactive material into the atmosphere requires characterizing the source of an airborne contaminant from remote measurements of the resulting concentration field.

This work seeks to understand both the uncertainty introduced by measurements and the uncertainty introduced by approximating the model\u2019s nonlinear terms. We seek both to understand these sources of uncertainty and to incorporate that understanding throughout the scientific process for Atmospheric Transport & Dispersion (AT&D) problems. First we will examine how errors in the input wind fields may translate into AT&D model solution errors. We focus on street-level concentration plume errors that occur in building-aware AT&D models for a set of hazardous release scenarios where the release location varies relative to the building locations and city building configurations. Second, we use Source Term Estimation (STE) techniques to examine how estimates of uncertainty in measurements, e.g. the wind direction, can be used to help bound the problem. \nWe use two techniques to examine the STE problem. Using the Genetic Algorithm coupled with an AT&D model Variational (GA-Var) method we preform sensitivity analyses to achieve five goals: (1) establish adequate thresholds to filter out noise in our concentration data without decimating the signal; (2) use a robust statistical method to quantify the uncertainty in our predictions; (3) determine the best cost function for each of the variables we seek to retrieve; (4) given that real-time wind direction data are difficult to come by, determine if the GA-estimated wind direction is representative of the advecting wind; and (5) determine the robustness of the GA when a limited number of sensors are available.\nTo further examine the STE problem we use the Variational Iterative Refinement STE Algorithm (VIRSA). VIRSA is a combined modeling system that includes the Second-order Closure Integrated PUFF model, a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian Plume Model (LEPM), and its formal adjoint. While numerous approaches to the STE problem exist, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, this approach addresses STE in an operational environment where computational resources are limited and a timely solution is critical. VIRSA is an adjoint method, computationally efficient, and fast but like any gradient descent minimization its downfall is that it can fall prey to local minima in the solution space. In the work presented here we incorporate new methods to address issues related to uncertainty and using what we know about that uncertainty to reduce the tendency to find local minima rather than the global minimum. We explore approaches to map the uncertainty in our observations and link it back to the background error covariance matrix utilized by the adjoint minimization. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8194], "author_name_tesi": "Rodriguez, Luna Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Rodriguez", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Luna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George Young", "Sue Ellen Haupt", "Jenni Evans", "Jeffrey Brownson", "Dr Paul Bieringer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George Young, Dissertation Advisor", "Sue Ellen Haupt, Dissertation Advisor", "Jenni Evans, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Brownson, Committee Member", "Dr Paul Bieringer, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["uncertainty", "source term estimation", "genetic algorithm", "QUIC", "wind", "urban", "FFT07", "adjoint", "background error covariance matrix"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "USE OF PROPORTIONS AS A STRUCTURAL DESIGN TOOL IN EARLY CHRISTIAN AND EARLY MEDIEVAL CHURCHES", "id": "13373yfr5008", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13373", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study explores whether early builders, who did not have sophisticated structural analysis tools available to them, based their design and construction methods on a proportional system, i.e., intentional geometrical relationships between building elements. Where the use of proportional systems has been observed, such systems can help define the architecture of a particular period.\nThe city of Rome contains early Christian and early Medieval churches, buildings used as houses of worship in the early centuries of the Christian religion (0-1200 CE). During this time period, there were really no established rules for structural design, Vitruvius being the only written source for architectural design. Many of the early Christian churches bear the stamp of improvised architecture, in the randomness of the layout, and in the use of spolia, material ransacked from Roman monuments.\nPrimarily based on domestic Roman architecture, but in part due to the builders' limited understanding of the classical Roman orders, early Christian churches represent early experiments in the adaptation of the basilical form to the Christian liturgy. Their empirical approach suggests that a posteriori, builders followed certain guidelines based on geometrical proportions to achieve a stable construction. The aim of this research is to explore the spatial and proportional relationships between structural elements in Imperial Roman basilicas, early Christian churches, and early Medieval churches in Rome.\nThis study tests the idea of resemblance in proportionality from one church to another of the intercolumniation ratio, i.e. a ratio of intercolumniation to column diameter, in the colonnade dividing the nave from the aisles. Site measurements, existing scale drawings, and written descriptions have been used to gather data twenty four Christian churches in Rome and three basilicas, one Republican, and two Imperial, none of which have been significantly modified or\niv\nhave measurements that are available to us. A linear trend line is used to establish the geometric relationships between intercolumniation and column diameter for three types of architectural elements used in these churches: arcades, architraves, and flat arches. The results are used to identify and quantify any patterns or guidelines that might have existed to allow early Christian Roman builders to construct successful and complex buildings using simple tools and resources.\nArcades found to be used the most for intercolumniation ratios of approximately 4, architraves for smaller ratios close to 2.6, and relieving arches, as an intermediate solution, for ratios close to 3. Vitruvius\u2019 favored intercolumniation ratio for entablatures is 2.25, which is slightly lower than those observed in this study. Also there appears to be a consistency through the construction periods. Ratios persist from the observed civil Imperial basilicas through the later churches of the same system, although the civil basilicas are designed in majestic scales. Relieving arches are used in porticoes added in later centuries, with higher intercolumniation ratios, but carrying less loading. Finally, even when a guideline is not as apparent, it is evident that some buildings follow their own logic. Some cases suggest that builders, while following a rule, were testing it and experimenting with the limits of that rule.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13349], "author_name_tesi": "Rodriguez Asilis, Yamile Sandra", "last_name_ssi": "Rodriguez Asilis", "middle_name_ssi": "Sandra", "first_name_ssi": "Yamile", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Boothby", "M Kevin Parfitt", "Elizabeth Bradford Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Boothby, Thesis Advisor", "M Kevin Parfitt, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Bradford Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Early Christian churches", "Early Medieval churches", "Ealry Chriatian architecture", "Early Medieval architecture", "Proportions", "Proportions in architecture", "Proportions in structures", "Proportions in churches", "Roman churches"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY AND INCREASES OF YIELD AND THE ANTIOXIDANTS SELENIUM AND ERGOTHIONEINE IN BASIDIOMATA OF PLEUROTUS ERYNGII ", "id": "8496", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "106", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Pleurotus eryngii species complex comprises at least five varieties: eryngii, ferulae, elaeoselini, nebrodensis and tingitanus. This species is unique among the genus Pleurotus because in nature it is found in association with specific members of the Umbelliferae and Compositae families. Geographic distribution of Pleurotus eryngii is limited to subtropical regions of the Mediterranean, Central and Southern Europe, Ukraine, North Africa, East and Central Asia and Iran. Pleurotus eryngii var. eryngii and nebrodensis were domesticated in 1970 and 1987, respectively, and are now cultivated in some countries of Asia and Europe. In the United States, the var. eryngii was recently introduced with cultivation beginning in 2000. \nThe varietal status of members of P. eryngii has been widely questioned and the evolutionary relationships among them are unknown. In this research, four regions of the genome were analyzed to establish phylogenetic relationships among isolates of var. eryngii, ferulae, elaeoselini and nebrodensis. No nucleotide variation in the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region was found among the varieties eryngii, ferulae and elaeoselini although intra-isolate polymorphisms were observed in some isolates. On the other hand, allelic polymorphisms in the partial &#946;-tubulin gene were problematical in phylogenetic studies but allowed delimitation of genetic pools. Informative nucleotide variation in partial sequences of the genes coding for translation elongation factor (tef1) and RNA polymerase II (RPB2) were useful for phylogenetic analyses among the varieties. Combined data sets of tef1 and RPB2 indicated that P. eryngii is a monophyletic group. Varieties eryngii, elaeoselini and ferulae are closely related sharing a common ancestor. In all phylogenetic analyses, Pleurotus eryngii var. nebrodensis was placed in a distinct clade, clearly differentiated from the other varieties indicating that this group should be considered a distinct species. Limited nucleotide variation in the genomic regions of the varieties eryngii, ferulae and elaeoselini was indicative that P. eryngii is a taxon that recently diverged and that the speciation mechanism is a result of host adaptations rather than geographical isolation. Since distribution of var. nebrodensis is restricted to elevations of 1,200 \u2013 2000 m, altitude might also be important in its speciation.    \nA second objective of this research was to elucidate cultural practices that might be used to enhance the concentration of two important antioxidants found in mushrooms: selenium (Se) and ergothioneine (ERGO). In order to enhance Se content in basidiomata, substrates were supplemented with sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) at two levels (5 and 10 &#956;g/g). Basidiomata of one commercial isolate of P. eryngii var. eryngii linearly accumulated Se up to 4.6 and 9.3 &#956;g/g. On the other hand, ERGO concentration was enhanced in mushrooms produced on a substrate with 55% moisture content compared to the commonly used 60% in commercial cultivation. Mushrooms produced on low-moisture content substrate had ERGO concentrations up to 3.0 mg/g, while mushrooms produced on high-moisture content substrate had less than 2.3 mg/g. \n\tCommercial cultivation of P. eryngii in controlled environments usually involves a single harvest; after that, the substrate is discarded. However, on some Italian and Chinese farms, growers use a casing layer to obtain more than one break of mushrooms. A third objective of this research, therefore, was to determine yield, biological efficiency (BE) and number of mushrooms as influenced by casing and substrate supplementation. Application of a casing overlay increased total yield by 141% compared to a non-cased substrate. Supplementation of substrate with delayed release nutrient (Remo\u2019s at 4% d.w.) added at substrate fragmentation increased yield by 14% over non-supplemented substrate. When a casing overlay and nutrient supplement were used together, yields increased by 176%. These results may offer growers an opportunity to increase productivity and improve the nutritional and medicinal qualities of P. eryngii. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [107], "author_name_tesi": "Rodriguez Estrada, Alma Edith", "last_name_ssi": "Rodriguez Estrada", "middle_name_ssi": "Edith", "first_name_ssi": "Alma", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel J Royse", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco", "Charles Peter Romaine", "Gary William Moorman", "Robert Bruce Beelman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel J Royse, Committee Chair", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco, Committee Chair", "Charles Peter Romaine, Committee Member", "Gary William Moorman, Committee Member", "Robert Bruce Beelman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pleurotus eryngii", "phylogeny", "mushroom cultivation", "antioxidants", "selenium", "ergothioneine"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "DESIGN FEATURES IN COMMUNAL SPACES: IMPACT ON QUALITY AND SATISFACTION IN SOCIAL HOUSING PROJECTS", "id": "14020axr5538", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14020", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research aims to determine how architectural design features of communal spaces in social housing projects impact the perceived quality and residential satisfaction of such spaces.

What determines the behavior of oxide materials in these environments, particularly in aqueous solutions, are the protonation and adsorption reactions at their surface. Furthermore, the effect of the solid/aqueous solution interaction becomes more important when the surface area of the contacting phases is high (e.g., colloids or porous media). Surface protonation and adsorption reactions have been widely studied for a variety of oxides but mainly at room temperature (25 \u000eC) or occasionally below 100\u000eC, and studies in the hydrothermal regime are, unfortunately, scarce. A high temperature electrophoresis cell utilizing darkfield microscopy was developed in this study capable of reaching temperatures up to 260\u000eC and pressures up to 70 bar. The dark-field microscopy setup developed here allows the visualization of sub-micron and nanometer-sized particles suspended in aqueous solutions. The particle size visualization limit was found by using commercially available SiO2 particle size standards 50 \u0006 10 nm and 100 \u0006 30 nm, respectively. Utilizing the high temperature electrophoresis cell, the electrophoretic mobility of SiO2 and SnO2 was obtained as a function of pH and temperature at ionic strengths of 5 x\u0002 10^-3 and 1 x\u0002 10^-3 kg mo^-1, respectively. A new methodology was adopted that allows obtaining the electrophoretic mobility with increased accuracy from the measured electrophoretic velocity as a function of electric field strength. Zeta potentials were obtained from the measured electrophoretic mobilities by using the numerical treatment developed by O\u2019Brien and White (1978) which takes into account the particle size. Isoelectric points (IEPs) were obtained for SiO2 at 25, 100, and 150\u000eC, and for SnO2 at 25, 125, 150, 200, and 260\u000eC by fitting the obtained zeta potential data as function of pH. The IEPs experimentally obtained where in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Many semi-theoretical models rely on available experimental data for calibration, thus we have compiled and analyzed available high temperature electrophoretic data on SiO2, SnO2, ZrO2, TiO2, and Fe3O4 to calibrate semi-theotical models that predict the standard surface protonation constants of oxide materials. Two new expressions were derived, based on\nthe crystal chemistry and solvation theory approach developed by Sverjensky and Sahai (1998), dependent on the relative permittivity of the oxides, er.

Language teacher educators, university researchers, classroom teachers, and future teachers have contributed immensely to existing knowledge on how language teachers learn to teach. Researchers and practitioners have finally acknowledged that future language teachers are not \u201cempty vessels\u201d and enter teacher education programs with experiences that influence their future teaching practices. Even though these publications have made important contributions to the LTE field, there are still many research areas to work on to advance language teacher education practices. One of these areas is the role of field experiences in the education of future language teachers. \nIn the 1970s there was a strong call for the inclusion of early field experiences (EFEs) in teacher education programs that prepare future language teachers (FLT). Even though many LTE programs have responded to this request, not many research studies have been published on their role in LTE programs. To address this research gap, this dissertation presents data collected during a Pilot Early Field Experience (PEFE) specifically designed for future teachers interested in world languages teaching. John Dewey\u2019s theory of experience guided this research study, which was designed to learn whether the PEFE could be considered an educative experience in the development of FLT. For this purpose, I analyzed the data according to the ecological approach, examining field experiences in order to gather details about several aspects of the PEFE (structure, content, context, and relationships). Results suggest that the FLT shared some common experiences during the PEFE, but their individual experiences differed from each other, making it difficult to determine whether the PEFE itself was educative or not. The PEFE\u2019s ecological aspects played an important role in identifying this outcome. Therefore, before determining the educative value of a field experience it is necessary to first explore its ecological aspects. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5748], "author_name_tesi": "Rodriguez-Arroyo, Sandra ", "last_name_ssi": "Rodriguez-Arroyo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sandra", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Miryam Espinosa Dulanto", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto", "John Daniel Marshall", "Murry R Nelson", "Karen E Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Miryam Espinosa Dulanto, Dissertation Advisor", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto, Committee Chair", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member", "Murry R Nelson, Committee Member", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["teacher education", "language teacher education", "world languages", "foreign languages", "ecological approach", "field experiences", "early field experiences", "ecological approach", "Dewey"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Phenomenological Approach to Examining the Role of Risk and Protective Factors in the Lives of Gay and Bisexual Youth", "id": "15275", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7497", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Most of the research involving lesbian, gay, and bisexual adolescents (LGB) in the past 10-20 years has focused on negative issues faced by LGB adolescents, not on healthy LGB adolescent development.

This is due to many factors, one of them being the lack of innovative aerodynamic devices that can operate in the unique environment of a rotor. Research over the past 20 years has shown that in order to have a performance increase with the rotor, it must adapt, or \u201cmorph,\u201d to the changing environment around the azimuth. One method that is being researched is the use of Miniature Trailing-Edge Effectors (MiTEs) on the blades of the rotor. MiTEs are an extension of the passive high-lift device, the Gurney flap. Gurney flaps are small flat plates, between 0.5 to 5 percent chord, fitted perpendicular to the airfoil surface at or near the trailing edge of a wing or rotor blade. A MiTE is an active Gurney flap, which can be used to actively control the lift and moment distribution on a rotor blade. MiTEs also have the\nadvantage of having very low actuator loads compared to those of traditional trailing-edge flaps. Experimental and validated computational fluid dynamics research has been done on MiTEs and an unsteady aerodynamic model was created for MiTEs placed at the trailing edge. In this work, this model has been modified to account for a MiTE placed at the trailing edge up to the 85 percent chord position. This aerodynamic model has also been incorporated into a rotor performance code to predict the effect of MiTEs on rotor performance and explore their ability to extend the flight envelope of the RAH-66 Comanche. The maximum velocity of Comanche was shown to have the potential increase of 20 percent with the increased use of transonic airfoils as facilitated through the use of MiTEs on the outboard section of the rotor blades. Investigations were also made on increasing the service ceiling of the Comanche, which showed a potential improvement of 8 percent with the use of MiTEs.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5228], "author_name_tesi": "Roedts II, Robert Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Roedts II", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark David Maughmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark David Maughmer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["performance", "aerodynamics", "rotorcraft"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Gothic Goes to Town: Reading the Gothic City in Nineteenth-century American Literature.

While long established, CBM is often applied in a primitive manner using simple threshold monitoring and trending techniques. As such, there are opportunities for expanding this work using more intelligent methods which are now viable in practical settings as sensor and IT solutions decrease in cost. Mechanical systems worth monitoring include the control valve, which is used in a myriad of industries, including both commercial and military applications, and is particularly valuable in many settings. As an example, control valves are critical components in submarine subsystems, such as carbon removal units, which can require precise valve movements. In this and related applications, ensuring that movements are fully realized is crucial to the control process in question.\n\nThis thesis explores a variety of techniques for classifying valve movements with the goal of detecting two specific types of blockages in control valves. Objects with different material properties can produce vastly different dynamic responses in a control valve when blocking the valve stroke. Therefore, it is the goal of this work to detect two types of these blockages in order to cover a broad range of potential obstructive sources. To do this, seeded-fault testing is performed to simulate these behaviors with the resulting dynamic responses captured by both external sensor instrumentation and inherent control system outputs. Both data sources are used separately for analysis.\n\nClassification using these data is tested using fuzzy inference systems (FIS\u2019s), artificial neural networks (ANN) and a variety of geometric and instance-based statistical classification methods. Discriminating features are identified, extracted and subsequently input to these classifiers to test for overall accuracy. Furthermore, multiple approaches to processing these data are used, including real-time monitoring simulations and post-hoc movement analysis.

This damage ensues from any number of winter stresses, or a complex of combined stresses. Little is known about late autumn conditioning of putting green systems by application of soluble N and trinexapac-ethyl (TE) to achieve maximum plant hardiness, and prevent damage. \nA field experiment was initiated in Sept. 2009 and 2010 to determine optimal timing of late season N and TE applications, as well as the interactive and/or main effects on tissue N concentrations, spring vigor, and density of an intensively-managed PG within the Pennsylvania State University Valentine Turfgrass Research Center (University Park, PA). The experimental design comprised treatments of N (30 or 60 kg ha\u20131), trinexapac-ethyl (0, 0.088, or 0.044 + 0.044 kg ha\u20131), and four autumn application timings; in a completely-randomized, 24-plot arrangement replicated six (2009-2010) or four (2010-2011) times. Resulting turfgrass clipping yield (CY; kg ha\u20131), tissue N (g kg\u20131), and canopy density (green normalized differential vegetative index; GNDVI) were measured in March and early-April of 2010 and 2011. \nRegardless of N rate, N concentrations of post-application (late autumn) clippings were significantly higher on plots treated before the first hard frost, compared to plots treated after the first hard frost. Although plots treated later in the year contained less tissue N prior to winter, these differences were indistinguishable in spring, when tissue N concentrations were similar across all application dates. As one might expect, plots treated with the high N rate showed significantly greater tissue N in both autumn and spring, compared to plots treated with the low N rate. With regard to autumn tissue N, TE was not a significant influence. However, a difference was discerned in spring analysis, as plots previously treated by TE showed significantly greater N concentration in spring tissue.\nSpring CY decreased linearly over early to late-Fall application dates. Significant treatment interactions were observed for low vs. high N rate, as well as TE treatment. When N and TE were applied in autumn (particularly after the first hard frost), early spring growth was suppressed by residual activity of TE, even when tissue N concentrations were high. Conversely, when applications were discontinued earlier in autumn (before the first hard frost), spring growth was stimulated more so than by application of N alone. This result is likely a manifestation of post-regulation surge, commonly associated with the eventual metabolism of GA-inhibitors in TE.\n Spring GNDVI readings were directly related to autumn N rate, but a positive effect of either TE application regimen was observed at &#945; = 0.1. Regardless of application date, the high N rate resulted in significantly higher GNDVI readings than the low N rate. As mentioned, application of autumn TE also improved density in spring. Furthermore, the greatest improvement of density is realized when N and TE applications are made prior to the first hard frost, but applications made after the first hard frost also prove worthwhile.\nIn summary, spring PG tissue N, vigor, and density appear positively influenced by Fall inputs of N & TE, particularly when applied up to 15-d prior to the first hard frost. While N applied after the first hard frost still proved beneficial, the 30 kg ha\u20131 rate was as effective as the 60 kg ha\u20131 rate. Late fall N fertilizer applications to internally-drained, sand-based putting greens should not exceed 30 kg ha\u20131.\nA similar study was initiated in Oct. 2010 at the Pennsylvania State University Joseph Valentine Turfgrass Research Center in University Park, PA. A randomized split-plot design of 90 plots was established on a mature, annual bluegrass putting green. The experimental design comprised paired main plots of Phosphorus treatment or none, each containing treatments of N (0, 30 or 60 kg ha\u00ac\u00ac\u00ac\u20131), trinexapac-ethyl (TE; 0 or 0.088 kg ha\u20131), and three autumn application timings, in a completely-randomized, 15-split-plot arrangement. Resulting turfgrass canopy density (green normalized differential vegetative index; GNDVI), tissue N (g kg\u20131), and clipping yield (CY; kg ha\u20131) were measured in March and early-April of 2011.\nThe main plot effect of Phosphorus was not a significant source of variation for spring N offtake, tissue N, canopy density, or vigor. Autumn N offtake and tissue N were significantly affected by timing, treatment, and their interaction. Regarding the timing source, cumulative N offtake was greatest from plots treated earliest. The same general trend was observed of mean tissue N in autumn clippings, and was likely due to decreasing temperatures and associated decline in turfgrass assimilation rate. Spring GNDVI and vigor were significantly influenced by N rate, but not TE. While the effect of TE appears to have influenced spring vigor, the TE vs. No TE contrast was not significant at an alpha level of 0.05.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1074], "author_name_tesi": "Rogan, Chase Michael Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Rogan", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Chase", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maxim J Schlossberg", "Maxim J Schlossberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maxim J Schlossberg, Thesis Advisor", "Maxim J Schlossberg, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["density", "vigor", "Trinexapac-ethyl", "Nitrogen", "tissue N"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "BECOMING MORE \"CIVIC\" THROUGH THE STUDY OF LOCAL HISTORY\n\n", "id": "9426", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "294", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\tThe nation\u2019s recent preoccupation with reshaping academics and raising academic performance has all but overpowered a task of vital importance \u2013 educating our young people to become engaged citizens of their communities.

Fourteen months after the class, a third survey was administered.  Data collected throughout and shortly after the class included teacher and student artifacts, student and course narratives, written and spoken definitions, and interviews.  Findings from this broad set of data indicate positive results supporting the use of local history to promote civic awareness and eventual civic engagement.

A significant portion of the litter and manure produced by these birds are used as a fertilizer source for crops. Poultry litter and manure are nutrient rich, which is desirable for crop nutrient uptake, however, concern is being raised about excess nutrients entering the Chesapeake Bay (CB). Specifically, there is concern with field runoff of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) desired from the field applications of poultry manure and litter. In 2010, the United States Environmental Protection Agency introduced the CB Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL), which acts a nutrient \u201cdiet\u201d for the bay with annual allotments of 84.3 million, 5.67 million, and 2.9 billion kg of N, P, and sediment, respectfully, to help reduce excess nutrients. In order to attain these allotments, poultry producers are implementing best management practices (BMPs) to reduce potential pollution from their farms.  Unfortunately, the poultry data being cited in the TMDL is from the 2005 ASABE Standards and much of this raw data is from the 1990s. The result is that poultry producers are continuing to be penalized for inaccurate data. Additionally, due to welfare driven consumers, newer management styles are being utilized within the industry. Therefore, five field studies were implemented to measure manure nutrients and manure production from common laying pullets and hens, broiler, turkey, and broiler and layer breeder management styles. Pullet and laying hen manure P2O5 was lower than previous studies and had lower moisture. Broiler litter was lower in total-N, P2O5, and K2O compared to studies from the 1990s and litter production and P2O5 were lower in turkeys than previous literature values would indicate. Finally, broiler breeders utilized nutrients on a body weight basis more effectively than layer breeders. It is imperative these current study values are implemented into the CB TMDL so regulations are based off of accurate data for those that must adhere to these regulations.

Indeed, there is substantial variability in how persons perceive faces. Like other primates, humans are highly visual and rely on sight much more than they rely on other senses. Humans show a vast capacity for communicating via facial expressions and an incredible facility for distinguishing and remembering faces. It is also clear that our facial perceptive abilities are environmentally modified and need to be explored because we can then understand the roles of facial phenotypes and perception in in-group biases like colorism or racism. Also, by applying this research, we can promote an acceptance and appreciation of phenotypic diversity.\nI investigated specifically how people rate genomic ancestry of populations admixed with European and West African ancestry, and the relationship between a person\u2019s demographic background (e.g. education level, socioeconomic status, geographical location, racial/ethnic breakdown of family and friends, etc.), and his or her ability to estimate genomic ancestry in human faces. Additionally, I investigated whether sex differences were present among how the stimulus faces were rated, as well. I first collected demographic survey information from each participant. Then, I presented two sets of 42 photos and asked them to estimate the proportion of African ancestry in each face for one set, and categorize each face as \u201cBlack\u201d or \u201cWhite\u201d in the other set. There were 100 participants collected in Georgia and Pennsylvania. My analyses determined that, raters are better than randomly simulated ancestry estimates (p=0.0001). Also, female stimulus faces were rated significantly (p=1.6e-11) better than male stimulus faces. To test whether demographic factors determined one\u2019s ability to rate genomic ancestry, I ran a multiple regression, and individual t-tests or ANOVAs.

Observations from observing systems such as radiosondes, wind profilers, and surface stations are sparse and are widely distributed over tens to hundreds of kilometers.  Therefore the use of numerical weather prediction models is very important to determine the temperature, moisture, and wind fields.\nThe Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) uses the Pennsylvania State University (PSU)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Mesoscale Model Version 5 (MM5) to create the meteorological datasets for use as inputs into photochemical models such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) model.  However, development on the MM5 has been discontinued, and the BAAQMD is interested in transitioning to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model when it can perform as well as the MM5.  The objective of the thesis is to assist the BAAQMD to transition to the WRF modeling system by finding the optimal WRF model configuration for the Bay Area and Central Valley region for both winter and summer seasons.\nThe investigation starts by determining the optimal set of physics packages to use for the region before four dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) is applied.  The FDDA is applied throughout the model integrations to produce dynamic analyses of the meteorology for use in the atmospheric chemistry models.  The two atmospheric radiation schemes tested are the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM) and the RRTM for global climate models (RRTMG).  With the use of the better performing radiation scheme, the land surface models (LSMs), the 5-layer thermal diffusion LSM, Noah LSM, Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) LSM, and the Pleim-Xiu (PX) LSM are compared to determine the best LSM for use in the baseline configuration.  Statistical analyses are performed to compare the two radiation schemes with each other and to compare the LSMs with each other.\nWith the better radiation scheme and LSM chosen as the baseline, six experiments are conducted to compare different FDDA strategies for the winter case and three FDDA experiments are conducted for the summer case.  The FDDA strategies used are 3D and surface analysis nudging, observational nudging, and multiscale FDDA that is a combination of both analysis nudging and observational nudging within a model\u2019s nested-grid framework.\nStatistical and qualitative analyses are performed to compare the model output from the FDDA experiments with the observations, and the best experiment is then chosen.  Analyses are then created to compare the FDDA and no-FDDA experiments for three sub regions within the 4-km domain: the Bay Area, the Sacramento Valley in the northern Central Valley, and the San Joaquin Valley in the southern Central Valley.  The incoming marine flow over the Bay Area is examined, as well as the wind flows in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys.  The main surface wind flow in both valleys is studied as well as the divergence of the main surface flow during the day and the convergence during the night.  Also the upslope and downslope flow along the slopes of the mountains surrounding the Central Valley will be studied.  Statistical analysis is used to compare the FDDA and no-FDDA experiments against the assimilated data and also an independent dataset of observations that are not used for data assimilation in order to evaluate the performance of the model.  \nDuring this study, an objective method for determining the optimal radius of influence (RIN) for use during observational nudging was also explored.  Using temperature errors between the observations and the 4-km model at several observation sites correlation coefficients were calculated.  With a coefficient threshold subjectively chosen the correlation coefficients for various pairs of sites are compared with the horizontal distance between the pairs of sites.  It is shown that a correlation coefficient above 0.5 exists for a pair of observation sites that are 105 km from each other, and the highest correlation occurs at 63 km.  For the 4-km domain, the maximum RIN near the surface is defined at 100 km, and a 50-km RIN is used at the surface, similar to the 63-km error correlation length scale with the highest error correlation.\nIt is shown that both RRTM and the RRTMG schemes produce similar errors for all four meteorological fields (relative humidity, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed).  The PX LSM is best for the winter case, but no LSM is significantly better for the summer case.  The multiscale FDDA strategy produces best fit-to-observation statistics for all four fields.  There is an added value of using the special surface wind observations taken by the BAAQMD observation network.  Independent verification using withheld other special observations demonstrates the value of FDDA techniques to improve simulations between the assimilated observations.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5140], "author_name_tesi": "Rogers, Raphael Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Rogers", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Raphael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aijun Deng", "Aijun Deng"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aijun Deng, Thesis Advisor", "Aijun Deng, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["California", "Air Quality", "WRF"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Vector Meson Production and the Dipole Picture in Photon-Hadron Scattering", "id": "7120", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6145", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis extends and combines traditional methods of hadronic physics, quantum chromodynamics, and nuclear physics \nso that they may be consistently applied to particular new and interesting regimes of photon(lepton)-hadron scattering.\nHigh energy photo(lepto)-production from the deuteron offers a unique opportunity to experimentally test qualitative\naspects of the Strong interaction, and to investigate the possibility of applying perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) methods to nuclear \nphysics.

This dissertation further investigates the syntax-lexicon and syntax-discourse interfaces through a study of word order with unaccusative and unergative predicates in different focus contexts for native speakers of Baj\u00edo Mexican Spanish.\n\nThe factors that constrain subject-verb or verb-subject word order in Spanish have been the subject of previous studies (e.g. Bolinger, 1991; Delbecque, 1988; Silva-Corval\u00e1n, 1982), and the word order of intransitive verbs has recently received attention in studies using variationist approaches (e.g. Rivas, 2008; Mayoral Hern\u00e1ndez, 2006; Ocampo, 2005) and structuralist approaches (e.g. Hertel, 2000; Hertel & P\u00e9rez-Leroux, 1998; Lozano, 2003, 2006a; Montrul, 2005a, 2005b, 2006). A number of lexical and discourse-related factors have been reported to constrain the variable use of preverbal or postverbal subjects with intransitive verbs, but they are often overlooked in studies of word order, and other relevant factors, such as the \u2018Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy\u2019 (Sorace, 2000, 2004), a continuum of lexico-semantic notions underlying unaccusativity, have not been thoroughly investigated. \n\nThe purpose of this dissertation is to investigate language-internal and language-external factors that may constrain word order variation at the syntax-lexicon and syntax-discourse interfaces in Baj\u00edo Mexican Spanish. For this study, an oral production task and an acceptability judgment task were administered to native speakers of Baj\u00edo Mexican Spanish residing near Irapuato, Mexico, and the results for 29 participants were included in the analyses. The results of these tasks reveal instability at both the syntax-discourse and syntax-lexicon interfaces and show that focus type,definiteness, subject NP weight, the position of adverbial phrases, and the verb categories of the \u2018Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy\u2019 significantly favor particular word orders. Previously unnoticed verbal constructions that relate to word order are identified, and it is also suggested that cyclical migrants may influence the word order of Baj\u00edo Mexican Spanish.\n\nThis dissertation is an important addition to current research because it identifies, tests, and ranks several language-internal and language-external variables for their effects on word order at the syntax-lexicon and syntax-discourse interfaces. In addition, the Interface Vulnerability Hypothesis is shown to be relevant for native speakers of Spanish living in Mexico because more word order variation is found to occur for these speakers at the syntax-discourse interface than at the syntax-lexicon interface in the production task. The results of this study do lend support for the Interface Vulnerability Hypothesis, but also show times in which \u2018external\u2019 interfaces may show less word order variation than \u2018internal\u2019 interfaces. \n\nThis research makes a significant contribution to studies of unaccusativity in Spanish by comparing and reanalyzing the results of previous studies of unaccusativity in Spanish and by noticing parallels with historical changes and contact Spanish. This study also demonstrates that the \u2018Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy\u2019 can help to explain word order in Spanish and should be termed the \u2018Split Intransitivity Hierarchy\u2019 because of its cross-linguistic application. A \u2018cutoff point\u2019 or transition zone between unergativity and unaccusativity is found for Spanish that situates Spanish crosslinguistically as being similar to Italian, but not yet like Dutch or French. A list of twenty proposed tests for unaccusativity in Spanish is also compiled for future research.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [30], "author_name_tesi": "Roggia, Aaron B.", "last_name_ssi": "Roggia", "middle_name_ssi": "B.", "first_name_ssi": "Aaron", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Lipski", "John Lipski", "Almeida Jacqueline Toribio", "Rena Torres Cacoullos", "Carrie Neal Jackson", "Marie Gillette Speicher", "Barbara E Bullock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Lipski, Dissertation Advisor", "John Lipski, Committee Chair", "Almeida Jacqueline Toribio, Committee Chair", "Rena Torres Cacoullos, Committee Member", "Carrie Neal Jackson, Committee Member", "Marie Gillette Speicher, Committee Member", "Barbara E Bullock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Syntax-discourse Interface", "Unaccusativity", "Split-Intransitivity", "Word Order", "Spanish", "Mexican Spanish", "Syntax-lexicon Interface", "Focus"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Defect Properties of Anodic Oxide Films on Titanium and Impact of Oxygen Vacancy on Oxygen Electrode Reaction", "id": "7574", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "897", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The anodic titanium oxide film formed on titanium substrate is studied with the experimental techniques of ellipsometry, Mott-Schottky analysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the EIS modeling with the Point Defect Model (PDM), in order to characterize the defective and semiconductive structure of the oxide film and investigate the impact of the defects of the oxide barrier layer on the oxygen electrode reactions.  \nEllipsometry is used to measure the thickness of the oxide film, and the model used to analyze the thickness in ellipsometry is applied to determine the structure of the oxide film that it is single-layered.  The EIS model with the PDM is proposed to determine whether the oxygen vacancy is the major type of oxide defect.  The expression of film thickness/potential from the PDM combined with the solution to the Nernst-Plank equation is proposed to investigate the oxygen vacancy diffusion coefficient.\nThe effect of oxygen vacancies in the anodic oxide film on the kinetics of the oxygen electrode reaction has been studied by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).  Oxide films of different donor density are prepared galvano-potentiostatically at various current densities.  The semiconductive properties of the oxide films are characterized using EIS and Mott-Schottky analysis.  The film thickness is found to be almost constant, but Mott-Schottky analysis shows that the donor (oxygen vacancy) density decreased sharply with increasing oxide film formation rate (current density).  With regard to the relationships between the rates of oxygen reduction/evolution and the donor density, the results show that the rates of both the reactions are higher for passive films having higher donor densities.  Possible explanation, including enhancement of the conductivity of the film due to the vacancies facilitating charge transfer and enrichment of the reaction sites of the surface oxygen vacancies acting as catalytic sites, are discussed.  The possible mechanisms for the oxygen electrode reactions where oxygen vacancies are acting as catalytic reaction sites are proposed.  Finally, the oxygen vacancy profile and the surface oxygen vacancy concentration are provided by the advanced EIS modeling with the PDM.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [889], "author_name_tesi": "Roh, Bumwook ", "last_name_ssi": "Roh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bumwook", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald", "Howard W Pickering", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald, Committee Chair", "Howard W Pickering, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PDM", "Point Defect Model", "Titanium", "Anodic Oxide"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Ontology-based Metamodeling and Data Mining for Metal Additive Manufacturing", "id": "14774bxr948", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14774", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising technology that is revolutionalizing industry by allowing the production of almost any shape directly from a 3D model; however, metal AM processes are still not well understood. They have low repeatability as a result, and the it is inherently difficult to predict part quality. The metal AM process is also difficult to control due to the complex physical phenomena involved in metal AM part production. In metal-based AM, numerous process parameters need to be specified, and they are highly interconnected, yet their interconnections are not yet fully understood. Understanding this interconnectivity is the first step in building predictive models and process control models that will help make the process more repeatable and reliable. Ontologies can be used to conceptualize models of complex AM processes and capture diverse design and process parameters to enable standard simulation models along with graphical views using common terminology, process maps, and modeling protocols. In this thesis, we consider different process models for laser, thermal, microstructure, and mechanical properties for metal-based AM of Ti-6Al-4V and develop an AM Process Ontology from first-principles.
