This study employed COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae to develop a general simulation methodology that can quickly test various ionic wind geometries and configurations with the intent of streamlining the optimization process for ionic wind cooling.

Yet, while researchers have learned much about deliberative and rational ethical decision-making, our understanding of the nonconscious processes behind unethical behavior is limited. Contributing to this literature, then, this dissertation attempts to help answer the general question: Do nonconscious processes influence unethical behavior in the workplace and if so, how? I consider nonconscious goal activation to be an underlying cognitive mechanism that influences unethical behavior, arguing that characteristics of an organization\u2019s environment can inadvertently trigger goals that nonconsciously influence employee\u2019s unethical behavior. In particular, I hypothesize that status threats may automatically elicit a nonconscious goal to maintain status and in certain circumstances, lead to unethical behavior. In addition, I suggest two individual-level moderators -- self-monitoring and narcissism -- that may exacerbate the effect of status threats on employee unethical behavior. To test these hypotheses, I conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, participants were exposed to a supraliminal prime designed to trigger status threat and a status protection goal. In the second study, participants\u2019 status was threatened via poor performance feedback that suggested lower status membership in an upcoming group activity. After the priming manipulations, participants were provided with an opportunity to over-report their performance (and protect their status) on a final activity. Results from multiple statistical analyses did not provide support for the hypotheses.

This challenge is being addressed by exploring an emerging sintering technology called Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST), also known as Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) and Pulse Electric Current Sintering (PECS), that will be an alternative manufacturing method in producing high-density ceramic tiles in minutes instead of hours or days with a minimum rejection rate. \nThis research concentrated on utilizing FAST to produce dense SiC ceramic tiles and examine the sintering behavior of SiC with changing temperature, hold time, pressure, and heating rate. A preprocessed SiC powder with carbon and boron carbide additives and a mean particle size of 0.5 \u00b5m was used to produce the SiC ceramic tiles. The sintered ceramic tiles were then characterized for material properties. Material properties were plotted as a function of processing parameter, and optimum conditions were explored. \nSiC is an attractive light weight and structurally robust material that is resistant to high temperature and chemical reactivity. SiC parts and components are produced by compacting the powder material and sintering it together at high temperatures. SiC has been considered for a wide range of applications including high temperature gas turbines, cutting tools, thermally stable parts or coatings, chemically resistant parts or coatings, high temperature semiconductor devices, as well as others. Currently, SiC components are produced by conventional sintering processes that involve many steps including powder preparation, green sintering, and extremely long processing times which expose the material to elevated temperatures for an extended period of time. This research concentrated on circumventing the traditional processing techniques by utilizing the FAST process.\nUsing the FAST process, this research showed that it was possible to sinter SiC in minutes rather than hours, to equivalent or greater densities. There was also no processing of powder or green sintering of any kind. The sintered ceramic tiles were characterized and the results showed the relationship between several material properties and the FAST processing parameters. Understanding this relationship will make it possible to tailor the material properties to fit the needs of a given application.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5818], "author_name_tesi": "Gephart, Sean Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Gephart", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Sean", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jogender Singh", "Jogender Singh", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni", "Ivica Smid"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jogender Singh, Thesis Advisor", "Jogender Singh, Thesis Advisor", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni, Thesis Advisor", "Ivica Smid, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sintering", "SiC", "silicon carbide", "ceramic", "spark plasma sintering", "field assisted sintering technology", "SPS", "FAST"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Field Assisted Sintering of Refractory Carbide Ceramics and Fiber Reinforced Ceramic Matrix Composites", "id": "23675", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10874", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The sintering behaviors of silicon carbide (SiC) and boron carbide (B4C) based materials were investigated using an emerging sintering technology known as field assisted sintering technology (FAST), also known as spark plasma sintering (SPS) and pulse electric current sintering (PECS). Sintering by FAST utilizes high density electric current, uniaxial pressure, and relatively high heating rate compared to conventional sintering techniques.\n\nThis effort investigated issues of scaling from laboratory FAST system (25 ton capacity) to industrial FAST system (250 ton capacity),  as well as exploring the difference in sintering behavior of single phase B4C and SiC using FAST and conventional sintering techniques including hot-pressing (HP) and pressure-less sintering (PL). Materials were analyzed for mechanical and bulk properties, including characterization of density, hardness, fracture toughness, fracture (bend) strength, elastic modulus and microstructure. A parallel investigation was conducted in the development of ceramic matrix composites (CMC) using SiC powder impregnation of fiber compacts followed by FAST sintering.\n\nThe FAST technique was used to sinter several B4C and SiC materials to near theoretical density. Preliminary efforts established optimized sintering temperatures using the smaller 25 ton laboratory unit, targeting a sample size of 40 mm diameter and 8 mm thickness. Then the same B4C and SiC materials were sintered by the larger 250 ton industrial FAST system, a HP system, and PL sintering system with a targeted dense material geometry of 4\u00d74\u00d70.315 inches3 (101.6\u00d7101.6\u00d78 mm3). The resulting samples were studied to determine if the sintering dynamics and/or the resulting material properties were influenced by the sintering technique employed. This study determined that FAST sintered ceramic materials resulted in consistently higher averaged values for mechanical properties as well as smaller grain size when compared to conventionally sintered materials. While FAST sintered materials showed higher average values, in general they also showed consistently larger variation in the scattered data and consequently larger standard deviation for the resulting material properties. In addition, dynamic impact testing (V50 test) was conducted on the resulting materials and it was determined that there was no discernable correlation between observed mechanical properties of the ceramic materials and the resulting dynamic testing.\n\nAnother study was conducted on the sintering of SiC and carbon fiber reinforced SiC ceramic matrix composites (CMC) using FAST. There has been much interest recently in fabricating high strength, low porosity SiC CMC\u2019s for high temperature structural applications, but the current methods of production, namely chemical vapor infiltration (CVI), melt infiltration (MI), and polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP), are considered time consuming and involve material related shortcomings associated with their respective methodologies. In this study, SiC CMC\u2019s were produced using the 25 ton laboratory unit with a target sample size of 40 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness, as well as on the larger 250 ton industrial FAST system targeting a sample size of 101.6\u00d7101.6\u00d73 mm3 to investigate issues associated with scaling. Several sintering conditions were explored including: pressure of 35-65 MPa, temperature of 1700-1900\u00b0C, and heating rates between 50-400\u00b0C/min. The SiC fibers used in this study were coated using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with boron nitride (BN) and pyrolytic carbon to act as a barrier layer and preserve the integrity of the fibers during sintering. Then the barrier coating was coated by an outer layer of SiC to enhance the bonding between the fibers and the SiC matrix. Microstructures of the sintered samples were examined by FE-SEM. Mechanical properties including flexural strength-deflection and stress-strain were characterized using 4-point bend testing. Tensile testing was performed on the larger 101.6\u00d7101.6\u00d73 mm samples. The microstructures of samples sintered using the 25 ton laboratory FAST system showed a reduction in porosity and good adhesion between the fiber-fiber and fiber-matrix interface. The microstructures of samples sintered on the 250 ton industrial FAST system showed a reduction in porosity, but there was visible reaction of the fiber and fiber coatings with the surrounding matrix. Additionally, there was significant radial cracking of the fibers visible in the microstructures.\n\nThere is gap in the understanding of sintering behavior between laboratory and industrial scale FAST systems. The vast majority of publications on FAST sintering have been primarily focused on small sample geometries (20 mm diameter, less than 3 mm thick). A study was coordinated to investigate the thermal properties during heating and cooling using a 250 ton industrial FAST system at 900\u00b0C using B4C and SiC materials inside the graphite die assembly. The thermal properties were then compared to the resulting material properties of the identically sintered B4C and SiC to approximately 94% relative density, at a temperature of 1950\u00b0C, pressure of 45 MPa, 10 minute hold, and heated at a rate of 100\u00b0C/min. The study determined that at 900\u00b0C there were significant thermal gradients within the system for the examined materials, and that these gradients correlated well with the material property difference of the samples sintered at higher temperatures where the gradients are presumably larger due to an increase in radiative heat loss. The observed temperatures throughout the graphite were significantly different between B4C and SiC. These temperatures also correlated well with the material properties of the sintered products which showed more substantial variation for B4C when compared to SiC which was overall less affected by thermal gradients. This was attributed to the intrinsic thermal conductivity difference between the two subject materials which was manifested as thermal gradients throughout the material and graphite die assembly. Additionally, both the observed temperature gradients throughout the graphite die assembly and the difference in temperature reading between the optical pyrometer and thermocouples were significantly larger for the 250 ton FAST system than previous publications have demonstrated experimentally or via modeling of smaller laboratory scale systems. \n\nThe findings from this work showed that relative to conventional sintering methods, the FAST process demonstrated comparable or improved material and mechanical properties with a significantly shorter processing cycle. However, the results demonstrated on the 25 ton laboratory scale unit were significantly different compared to results for the same materials sintered using the 250 ton industrial scale unit. The temperature gradients observed on the 250 ton FAST unit were significantly larger than previous reports on smaller FAST units. This result showed future efforts to scale up the FAST sintering process while maintaining similar results will require careful attention to minimizing temperature gradients. This could potentially be achieved by reducing radiative heat loss during processing and/or optimizing the graphite die design and implementing heat spreaders in specific locations dependent on the host material\u2019s thermal and electrical properties as well as the sample geometry.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10467], "author_name_tesi": "Gephart, Sean Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Gephart", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Sean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jogender Singh", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni", "Ivica Smid", "Todd Palmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jogender Singh, Dissertation Advisor", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni, Committee Chair", "Ivica Smid, Committee Member", "Todd Palmer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sintering", "field assisted sintering", "fast", "spark plasma sintering", "sps", "silicon carbide", "sic", "boron carbide", "b4c", "cmc", "ceramic"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Voices and Visages: Mary Magdalene's Afterlives in Text and Art", "id": "14423cpg128", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14423", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is a feminist rhetorical recovery of Mary Magdalene\u2019s diffuse and divergent histories of reception in early Christian texts and the fine arts.

The former offers a survey of Mary Magdalene\u2019s treatment in the New Testament gospels, and argues for the necessity of a diachronic and multimodal recovery of her rhetorical histories of reception.

Chapter three offers a similar treatment of Mary\u2019s diverse rhetorics, albeit through an analysis of the apocryphal Gospel of Mary and twentieth- and twenty-first-century art.

The manuscript contains the data collected during the trial to measure migration, inflammation and biothermal capability of microchips in horses.  The main objective of this study was to characterize the inflammatory response to and measure the migration of microchips.  The other objective was to determine if the microchip can provide accurate body temperatures.  Eighteen mature Quarter Horse mares were randomly assigned to groups.  The three groups in the study were microchip (n=7), sham inserted (n=7), and control (n=4) with no insertion.  The inflammatory response was measured over a two week period.  The microchip and sham insertion did not cause a detectable increase in temperature. Algometer readings, which are used to quantify the pressure necessary to induce a pain threshold response, indicated that the microchip group required less pressure to induce a pain response than sham at 2h, 1 and 3d post insertion.  Visible swelling began 2h post insertion and resolved by 3d.  Serum amyloid A concentrations changes could not be coupled with local inflammatory reactions.

Stream temperature data collected from April through September of 2011 show that during storm events this headwater stream can exhibit a more urban-like stream temperature response. Sudden temperature increases of this magnitude may have negative impacts on the stream\u2019s ecological and biogeochemical services. There is a statistically significant difference in the stream\u2019s mean temperature response to storms during spring months versus during fall months, suggesting a seasonal relationship. The largest and most intense storms between April and June cause the largest increases in stream temperature, while the largest and most intense storms between July and September cause the largest decreases in stream temperature. \n     We investigate the physical mechanisms of the stream\u2019s response to a large storm in May to better understand the cause of the rapid temperature increases. We conclude that climatic variables in this humid climate zone during the spring months cause the precipitation temperature to be much warmer than the pre-storm stream temperature.

Most unmixing algorithms search for a set of pure pixels, called endmembers, of which all other pixels in the image are linear combinations of this set. Hence, endmember extraction is an important process in the creation of useful material abundance maps. Material abundance maps are created using a three step process: estimation of the number of materials in an image, unmixing of the image to determine the spectral signatures (endmembers) of\nthese fundamental materials, and finally, some type of constrained least squares algorithm using the recovered endmember spectra to generate the abundance maps. This thesis formally evaluates the first two steps of this process using simulated and real data. First, a common material count estimation algorithm, known as virtual dimensionality (VD), is examined. Second, three endmember extraction algorithms are evaluated: Automatic Target Generation Process (ATGP), ICA-Based Endmember Extraction Algorithm (ICA-EEA) and Vertex Component Analysis (VCA). Finally, the derivation of a constrained least squares technique is given from which the results of the first two steps are used as input to create abundance maps on real data from the AVIRIS sensor. This process serves as a means of qualitatively evaluating the efficacy of these\nalgorithms on live data from which ground truth information could not be realized. The three unmixing algorithms arise from different schools of thought. The ICA-EEA uses independent component analysis (ICA) to isolate endmembers present in a scene. Conversely, ATGP and VCA work on the principle of orthogonality in that endmembers are extracted by iteratively projecting the data orthogonally to the current span of detected endmembers. The two methods differ in how they select the next orthogonal direction. Additionally, the authors of VCA state ICA based methods cannot perform well due to the\nsum-to-one constraint in linear endmember mixing. The results of this thesis prove otherwise.

To further this goal, the air/water experiment described in the NUREG/CR-3373 report, issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC); the void distribution data in the U.S. NRC/NEA-OECD (Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) Pressurized Water Reactor Subchannel and Bundle Tests (PSBT) Benchmark Series 5 through 7 experiments, and the void distribution data in the General Electric (GE) 3x3 bundle experiments were selected.\n\nThe NUREG/CR-3373 air/water experiment was conducted at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) Jonsson Engineering Center and included a 2x2 rod bundle facility. Air was injected at the base of the rod bundle to simulate Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) flow conditions. Because CTF does not directly solve the non-condensable gas equations, these experiments were modeled with saturated steam with phase change disabled instead of air. Coupled with CTF\u2019s convergence issues at the low experimental pressures, comparable flow conditions (i.e., system pressure, water density, steam density) were not reached. However, this simulation was used to validate the qualitative void drift trends as described in Levy\u2019s model.\n\nThe PSBT experiments were conducted to support the advancement of subchannel analysis of fluid flow in rod arrays. The PSBT exercise used in this validation provided average center subchannel void content, which was then compared with the CTF simulation results. This data was used to provide validation for the void content of center subchannel types, which should provide higher than bundle average void as implied by Levy\u2019s model. These analyses provided successful validation of the void drift mechanism followed by a sensitivity study on center subchannel void with respect to various system boundary conditions and mixing options.\n\nThe GE 3x3 experiments were designed to contribute to the improvement of thermal/hydraulic (T/H) characteristics of nuclear reactor cores and were used in this validation to provide reliable void distribution data. The experimental results included equilibrium quality and mass flux. This data was then compared to CTF simulation results with various mixing options for void drift and turbulent mixing. This comparison demonstrated acceptable agreement with experimental results for each subchannel type and displayed expected trends when mixing options were altered. Additionally, sensitivity studies on individual subchannel void content were performed with respect to various mixing options.\n\nOverall, these validation and sensitivity exercises provide a sound addition to CTF\u2019s expansive validation suite. The lateral void drift mechanism as proposed by Levy implemented in CTF provides the desired and expected results.\n\nThese validation and sensitivity exercises were performed within a collaboration with CASL.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11541], "author_name_tesi": "Gergar, Marcus Stephen", "last_name_ssi": "Gergar", "middle_name_ssi": "Stephen", "first_name_ssi": "Marcus", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CTF", "void drift", "turbulent mixing", "validation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Essays on marketing's role during firm crises", "id": "14650", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7476", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research examines marketing\u2019s role during two types of firm-crises. Essay 1 investigates brand equity\u2019s role when product recalls occur, and essay 2 examines the role of marketing\u2019s influence within the firm when the firm faces the junk-crisis, i.e., when the firm\u2019s credit is downgraded to the lowest investment-grade level. Both essays contribute to the firm-crisis and the marketing-finance interface literatures and suggest that marketing has significant and, for the most part, positive performance implications for firms that face product recalls and/or the junk-crisis. Building on an assimilation-contrast framework in essay 1, I hypothesize and find that high levels of brand equity attenuate negative consumer responses in low severity recalls but augment them in high severity recalls. Thus, while brand equity seems to provide a reservoir of goodwill in the former case, it acts as a liability in the latter case. Process tests indicate that consistency and discrepancy thoughts account for the observed attenuating and augmenting effects in a manner consistent with the underlying assimilation-contrast framework. Further, building on the firm-crisis and marketing\u2019s influence within the firm literatures, essay 2 shows that marketing\u2019s influence within the firm provides significant benefits during the junk-crisis. Specifically, the empirical results suggest that marketing\u2019s influence within the firm reduces the likelihood of business-to-consumer (B2C) firms cutting their advertising spending during the junk-crisis, which has a positive impact on the firms\u2019 future credit rating trajectory. In contrast, marketing\u2019s influence does not moderate the likelihood of business-to-business (B2B) firms cutting their advertising, which does not seem to negatively affect their future credit ratings. Moreover, the empirical results show that both, B2B and B2C firms in which marketing\u2019s influence is high are significantly less likely to get downgraded to speculative grade (i.e., junk) when faced with the junk-crisis than the firms in which marketing\u2019s influence is low.

Dangerous levels of elements metallic elements include Silver (Ag), Arsenic (As), Barium (Ba), Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Mercury (Hg), Lead (Pb), and Selenium (Se). These contaminants accompany Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Sulfur (S), and Aluminum (AL).\n\t\nRecently, scientists have explored the use of plants to naturally absorb toxic substances into their growth tissues through natural absorption of nutrients from the soil in which the plants live. This phenomenon is known as Phytoremediation.  Our study focuses on phytoextraction, which is the use of plants to accumulate pollutants to remove metals or organics from the soil by concentrating them in the harvestable plant tissue parts.  We chose to study three species of biofuel crops, Camelina sativa, Miscanthus giganteus, and Panicum virgatum. Each species has different characteristics that could prove useful in this research.  Camelina sativa possesses the ability to fix nitrogen in there root zone.  Miscanthus giganteus is very hearty and has a deep root structure.  Panicum virgatum is also hearty and has long, fibrous and densely arranged roots.\n\nThe basis of our investigation is to observe the abilities of aforementioned biofuel crop species extract heavy metals to phytoremediate marginal soils affected by mining operations. To test this hypothesis we chose soil from three locations upon the land holdings of the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (EPCAMR) whose office is located in the Borough of Ashley, Luzerne County, PA. We believe that each of these species of biofuel crops will respectively show favorable removal of heavy metal contamination in each of three experimental soil types.   \n\nThis experiment shall answer the following questions:\n\n1.  Which of the three (3) biofuel crops selected [Camelina sativa, Miscanthus giganteus, or Panicum virgatum] has the ability to survive in the marginal soils affected by mining operations?\n2.  Do any of the aforementioned species thrive in such conditions?\n3.  Do any of these biofuel crops have the ability to Phytoremediate soils with high concentrations of heavy metals?\n4.  Do any of the aforementioned plant species behave as a hyper-accumulator of any of the analytes studied?\n5.  What is the feasibility of using any of these plant species to phytoremediate the experimental soils and also as a source of energy following phytoextraction?\n\nOur experiment involved growing the biofuel crops in contaminated soils under greenhouse conditions. We tested the initial and final contaminant concentrations in the sample soils after plant growth. We also tested plant tissues at the end of the experiment for contaminant concentration in the plant tissues. This would indicate the level of phytoextraction which occurred. Our experiment displayed results that indicated that the soils were indeed reclaimed through the utilization of biofuel crops to phytoextract some of the heavy metal contaminants. There were also instances where hyper-accumulation occurred. We are hopeful that these results could lead to further investigation to determine the feasibility of field stage application. Future experiments should also be conducted to determine how the environmental impact when these biofuel products are combusted.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9658], "author_name_tesi": "Gerst, Edward Albert", "last_name_ssi": "Gerst", "middle_name_ssi": "Albert", "first_name_ssi": "Edward", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Pollution Control", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sairam V Rudrabhatla"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sairam V Rudrabhatla, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Phytoremediation", "Biofuel Crops", "Camelina sativa", "Miscanthus giganeus", "Panicum virgatum", "Switchgrass", "Acid Mine Drainage"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "When Her Whole Equals Her Parts:  Seeing Women as Objects Rather than Persons\n\n", "id": "7678", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5620", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this work was to examine when and how women are sexually objectified.

Recently, efforts by the wood treating industry have been made to use SC CO2 as a replacement to more traditional methods of chemical preservative delivery. Previous studies have shown that the SC CO2 pressure treatment process is capable of impregnating solid wood materials with chemical preservatives, but concentration gradients of preservative often develop during treatment.  Widespread application of the treatment process is unlikely unless the treatment inconsistencies can be improved for greater overall treating homogeneity.  \nThe development of a computational flow model to accurately predict the internal pressure of CO2 during treatment is integral to a more consistent treatment process.  While similar models that attempt to describe the flow process have been proposed by Ward (1989) and Sahle-Demessie (1994), neither have been evaluated for accuracy.  The present study was an evaluation of those models.  More specifically, the present study evaluated the performance of a computational flow model, which was based on the viscous flow of compressible CO2 as a single phase through a porous medium at the macroscopic scale.  Flow model performance was evaluated through comparisons between predicted pressures that corresponded to internal pressure development measured with inserted sensor probes during treatment of specimens.  Pressure measurements were applied through a technique developed by Schneider (2000), which utilizes epoxy-sealed stainless steel tubes that are inserted into the wood as pressure probes. Two different wood species were investigated as treating specimens, Douglas-fir and shortleaf pine.  \nEvaluations of the computational flow model revealed that it is sensitive to input parameters that relate to both processing conditions and material properties, particularly treating temperature and wood permeability, respectively.  This sensitivity requires that the input parameters, principally permeability, be relatively accurate to evaluate the appropriateness of the phenomenological relationships of the computational flow model. Providing this stipulation, it was observed that below the region of transition from CO2 gas to supercritical fluid, the computational flow model has the potential to predict flow accurately.  However, above the transition region, the model does not fully account for the physics of the flow process, resulting in prediction inaccuracy.  \nOne potential cause for the loss of prediction accuracy in the supercritical region was attributed to a dynamic change in permeability that is likely caused by an interaction between the flowing SC CO2 and the wood material.  Furthermore, a hysteresis was observed between the pressurization and depressurization stages of treatment, which cannot be explained by the current flow model.  If greater accuracy in the computational flow model is desired, a more complex approach to the model is necessary, which would include non-constant input parameters of temperature and permeability.  Furthermore, the implications of a multi-scale methodology for the flow model were explored from a qualitative standpoint.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [611], "author_name_tesi": "Gething, Brad Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Gething", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Brad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Jack Janowiak", "John Jack Janowiak", "Nicole Robitaille Brown", "Jeffery J Morrell", "Turgay Ertekin", "Virendra Puri"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Jack Janowiak, Dissertation Advisor", "John Jack Janowiak, Committee Chair", "Nicole Robitaille Brown, Committee Member", "Jeffery J Morrell, Committee Member", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["supercritical carbon dioxide wood treatment"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Search for Planets around Red Stars", "id": "15988", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8027", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Our knowledge of planets around other stars has expanded drastically in recent years, from a handful Jupiter-mass planets orbiting Sun-like stars, to encompass a wide range of planet masses and stellar host types. In this thesis, I review the development of\nradial velocity planet searches and present results from projects focusing on the detection of planets around two classes of red stars.\n\nThe first project is part of the Penn State - Torun Planet Search (PTPS) for substellar companions to K giant stars using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). The\nresults of this work include the discovery of planetary systems around five evolved stars. These systems illustrate several of the differences between planet detection around giants and Solar-type stars, including increased masses and a lack of short period planets. One planet has a nearly six year orbit, the longest announced to date around a giant star, with an amplitude approaching the limits of detectability due to stellar \u2018jitter\u2019. Two more of these systems also show long-term radial velocity trends which are likely caused by the presence of an additional, more distant binary companion. The remaining two systems show increased radial velocity noise, typical of giant systems. Finally I show that, if the stellar jitter is caused by p-mode oscillations, the amplitude of this noise is anti-correlated with metallicity.\n\nThe second project focuses on the expansion of the current radial velocity calibration methods to a new wavelength regime. The absorption cell technique is modified to use the telluric O2 and water vapor bands found between \u223c6000-9000 A. These features have been found to be stable to \u223c10 m s\u22121 and allow access to the increased red flux of low-mass and evolved stars. I carry out a mock planet search of six early M dwarfs\nthat are known to be radial velocity stable, providing a recoverable null result. Measurements are also made of several telluric standards, to improve the characterization of the atmospheric conditions at the time of observation. Radial velocities are measured by forward modeling the observations as a combination of a best-fit model telluric spectrum and a deconvolved stellar template, convolved with a best-fit point-spread function (PSF). These measurements are tested using a small number of blocks and compared to analogous measurements made using the standard\niodine calibration. This small sample of blocks is then extrapolated to the full wavelength range, yielding a precision of \u223c20 m s\u22121 for the iodine calibration and \u223c30 m s\u22121 for telluric calibration. These relatively modest precisions may be improved in the future both by improving portions of the PSF modeling and deconvolution algorithms, and by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the observations. Nevertheless, it is reassuring to obtain relatively similar results with the two calibration methods and even with the present level of precision, telluric calibration would be able to detect a Neptune-mass planet in the habitable zone of an M dwarf.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7972], "author_name_tesi": "Gettel, Sara Jeanne", "last_name_ssi": "Gettel", "middle_name_ssi": "Jeanne", "first_name_ssi": "Sara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexander Wolszczan", "Lawrence William Ramsey", "John David Mathews", "Mercedes Richards", "Kevin Luhman", "Jason Wright"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexander Wolszczan, Dissertation Advisor", "Lawrence William Ramsey, Committee Member", "John David Mathews, Committee Member", "Mercedes Richards, Committee Member", "Kevin Luhman, Committee Member", "Jason Wright, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["elanet detection", "evolved stars", "radial velocity", "telluric line", "calibration"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Sonotrode development for High Intensity Ultrasound and its effect on the Dynamic Flow of a Lyophobic Solution ", "id": "14181", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7378", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High intensity ultrasound is being used in various applications in industry, such as healthcare, food science, mechanical cleaning, etc. It has proven to be a truly diverse approach that has not yet been explored for all of its uses.

Stable lyophobic emulsions are difficult to create; they become even more difficult when the fluids are placed in a dynamic scenario in which energy is already causing motion. High intensity focused ultrasound can be proven to be an efficient method of creating a lyophobic emulsion. The ultrasound is transmitted from the piezoelectric material to the fluid through a resonant body called a sonotrode. The understanding of how to best process such emulsions in-flow is herein advanced through the use of theory, simulation, and experiments.\nTwo applications for the benefits of lyophobic emulsions will be discussed.

Adequate age estimates can be produced for children and young adults, but such estimates for most of adulthood remain elusive. This four-phase dissertation is a large-scale proof-of-concept that accurate and precise age estimates can be produced for all of adulthood without the two most widely used skeletal indicators\u2014the pubic symphysis and auricular surface. This work builds on over two decades of research by an international research team and an existing age-estimation method called Transition Analysis (TA). In Phase 1, more than 200 trait variants were investigated to identify and refine a set of age-informative features throughout the skeleton, and primary reference data were collected from four collections of modern, known-age North American skeletons (N=1010). In Phase 2, a simplified procedure based on existing TA was developed to produce age estimates from Phase 1 reference data. In Phase 3, standard age-estimation methods and new TA were applied to additional known-age samples\u2014one modern and one historical. In both samples, the estimates produced by new TA have similar accuracy to traditional methods, but the ranges are, on average, half as wide and show essentially no systematic point estimate bias. In Phase 4, traditional methods and new TA were applied to two Danish archaeological samples. Comparing the Phase 3 and 4 samples reveals that each traditional method produces a characteristic pattern of adult mortality that is practically independent of the age distribution of the sample. Thus, all mortality profiles generated for past populations using traditional techniques should be viewed with critical skepticism. In contrast, new TA produces mortality distributions that more closely approximate reality, including details that could not be detected using traditional techniques. This dissertation, in conjunction with a larger NIJ-funded research project using the same approach for geographically diverse modern populations, provides every indication that the new TA procedure may become the new gold standard for adult age estimation.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13735], "author_name_tesi": "Getz, Sara Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Getz", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Sara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George R.

To this end, Penn State developed and administers the American English Oral Communication Proficiency Test (AEOCPT), and the general purpose of this dissertation is to validate the AEOCPT.  I focus on three components of the AEOCPT. The first component (Scoring Rubric) consists of eight indicators that operationalize a four factor framework of language knowledge. Although this language knowledge framework is an accepted framework for ITA tests in general, this dissertation is the first attempt to empirically confirm it (RQ1). The second component (Placement decisions) is currently made by adding up the scores of the eight indicators across the four performance tasks. This summative score communicates placement into one of four classes. However, this score cannot be used to empirically confirm that students are best placed into four classes or identify the strengths and weaknesses that group them together (RQ2). The final component (Performance Tasks) is assumed by ITA administrators to elicit similar rubric scores. However, Instructors believe that the four performance tasks are not equally salient to informing English ability in the American classroom (RQ3). The dataset that I used to answer the three research questions consists of the results from 498 ITA candidates that took the test between the 2012 Summer and 2014 Fall semesters. The results from the Confirmatory Factor Analysis show that the four factor language knowledge model (RQ1) has acceptable fit to the dataset (Using Global and Componential Fit statistics). In addition, the four factor model better fits the dataset than alternative models of language knowledge. The results from Latent Class Analysis show that a three class model for placement decisions better fits the dataset than a four class model (RQ2). The results also show that the four tasks contribute unique information to understanding candidates\u2019 most probable placements (RQ3).

Examples include several health care, safety and security situations, where acting early or late can both result in substantial costs or losses. These decisions are dynamic and are mostly made under uncertainty. This type of decision relates to and contrasts with discrete decisions, which have been studied extensively in terms of people's systematic deviations from utility-maximizing norms, or in other words, biases.\n \nIn this dissertation, a game is introduced as a platform to study timing decisions. Impatience induced by delays is investigated as a bias affecting timing decisions, and is successfully manipulated and moderated. Seven experiments are presented. The first experiment (N=73) suggested that a tendency to act early affects timing decisions. This experiment also indicated that the relative importance of the effects of impatience and risk propensity on such decisions changes based on proficiency in tasks and task duration. The second experiment (N=123) confirmed existence of an impatience bias. The third experiment (N=701) showed that impatience induced by delays: (1) affects timing decisions in the subsequent tasks, (2) increases a tendency to receive information faster, only for a few seconds, with cost and no gains, and (3) reduces subsequent task satisfaction. Furthermore, impatience is successfully manipulated and significantly moderated using fast countdowns. Experiment 4 (N=304) showed that the mechanism behind this impatience moderation is altered time perception, and presented trade-offs between delay perception and delay recall. Experiment 5 (N=538) investigated a wider range of feedback speeds, replicated the results of Experiments 2 and 3, and provided insights and trade-offs for user interface design. Experiments 6 (N=113) and 7 (N=294) investigated how actions that save one's time by making others wait, i.e., impatience acts, are perceived, and asked whether people are sensitive to the total cost, taking both number of people involved in the scenarios and the imposed time cost into account. Results showed that people are rationally sensitive to group sizes, but total cost is perceived differently depending on existing norms for the scenario. \n\nFurthermore, gender differences in expression of impatience and implications for user interface design are discussed, and the results suggested that impatience may reduce as people get older. These findings are valuable as they contribute to understanding human biases and decision-making, and provide insights on how to properly design feedback for user interfaces.

While the absolute value of the embodied energy of OPC appears to be small, considering the large global consumption and production of OPC (annual world production of cement is 109 tons [2]) the negative environmental impact of OPC becomes evident. Therefore, many researchers have focused on development of Portland cement substitutes to produce a binder with a lower environmental impact. Alkali-activated binders, such as alkali-activated slag or fly ash (AAS or AAF) have shown to be promising alternative materials in fitting this purpose and can provide similar mechanical and fresh properties to portland cement. Slag and fly ash are industrial by-products, and their utilization in concrete, besides the added environmental values, will result in a more durable concrete in most aggressive environments compared to ordinary portland cement (OPC) [3]. Use of alkali activated slag binder and its potential to replace portland cement requires improvement in the knowledge of the durability aspects of this material. Carbonation of alkali-activated slag concrete is known to be higher than ordinary portland cement and can influence the long-term performance (durability) of this binder. Nevertheless, there are limited numbers of research focused on this issue. \nCarbonation is an important consideration in concrete durability, since it can promote corrosion of embedded reinforcement and disintegration of concrete matrix. The goal of this study is to investigate the mechanism of AAS carbonation in order to provide the means needed to develop a high performance and durable AAS concrete. \nIt was found that the effect of carbonation depends to a large extent on the type of the activator. Carbonation rate of sodium silicate-activated slag was almost twice the carbonation rate of sodium hydroxide-activated slag (sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide are two commonly used alkaline activators). Additionally, while carbonated sodium silicate activated slag lost half of its strength during carbonation, the compressive strength of sodium hydroxide activated slag did not decrease after accelerated carbonation. The results were consistent with the observations in microanalysis techniques. When sodium hydroxide was used as the activator, carbonation products (calcite crystals) formed densely in the binder. For sodium silicate activated slag, deposition of crystalline calcium carbonate due to carbonation was not significant. The results also showed that natural carbonation in air softens AAS binder and leads to a higher shrinkage for AAS paste.\nUtilizing an NDT method to monitor carbonation progress in OPC and AAS, it was observed that microcracks develop during carbonation of AAS binder caused by C-A-S-H decalcification. The results showed that nonlinearity of sodium hydroxide activated slag uniformly increased by 90% during carbonation. For sodium silicate activated slag nonlinearity increased monotonically by 85% until carbonation reached its half, after which, the internal damage was beyond micro- damage measurement range of the implemented NDT method. In OPC, carbonation decreased the nonlinearity by 38% overall, due to transformation of portlandite to calcium carbonate.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15438], "author_name_tesi": "Ghahramani, Sara ", "last_name_ssi": "Ghahramani", "first_name_ssi": "Sara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aleksandra Z Radlinska", "Aleksandra Z Radlinska", "Farshad Rajabipour", "Parisa Shokouhi", "Zuleima T Karpyn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aleksandra Z Radlinska, Dissertation Advisor", "Aleksandra Z Radlinska, Committee Chair", "Farshad Rajabipour, Committee Member", "Parisa Shokouhi, Committee Member", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["alkali-activated slag", "AAS", "carbonation", "non-destructive testing", "NDT", "shrinkage", "mortar durability"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF ALGORITHMS FOR ROBUST ONLINE OPTIMAL PERIODIC CONTROL IN THE PRESENCE OF PLANT PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY", "id": "14620mug198", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14620", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation furnishes a framework addressing the challenges of designing online algorithms for optimal periodic control (OPC). The proposed framework aims to expand the use of the OPC discipline, moving beyond the traditional offline optimization of periodic control trajectories for plants with known dynamics, and instead focusing on the online and stable periodic optimal control of plants whose dynamics are not fully known a priori. More specifically, the design objective of this online framework is to discover, achieve, and maintain the best cyclic performance level of a given engineering system, despite the potential open-loop instabilities of the underlying dynamics and unknown plant model parameters.\n\nThis dissertation is motivated by the exciting applications of the OPC theory in nature and engineering. This research area has been studied for nearly 6 decades. The literature has developed mathematical tests for properness: a condition under which there is a periodic trajectory that in average outperforms the best equilibrium point of a given dynamic system. Necessary and sufficient conditions have also been developed to analyze the optimality of a candidate periodic trajectory. Furthermore, researchers have proposed direct and indirect algorithms for the numerical computation of the OPC problem solutions. However, a common limitation of the existing OPC research lies in the fact that traditional OPC has been applied to the offline optimization of trajectories for systems with known dynamics. This stands in contrast both to the goal of this dissertation and to several examples of OPC practices that are observed in nature.\n\nThis dissertation seeks to address the above limitations by proposing an adaptive framework that enables engineering systems to achieve robust online periodic optimal control. The steps leading to the development of the online framework are illustrated/validated on an insect flight model, a benchmark drug delivery application problem from the OPC literature, and a vehicle suspension example. The first two of these application problems are known to benefit from OPC, while the oscillatory behavior is enforced on the last application through a periodic road roughness profile. The work of this dissertation builds on established techniques in control theory including variational calculus methods, direct optimal control, indirect adaptive control, Floquet stability, Lyapunov stability, and feedback linearization. However, it combines these tools in a manner that will result in a novel framework for achieving robust online periodic optimality.\n\nThe development of algorithms in this dissertation follows a progressive trend towards the end framework. This is also reflected through the organization of the dissertation as explained below. \n\nChapter 2 introduces a properness test from the OPC literature to determine whether periodic operations can offer any advantage over the best steady-state performance. The application of this tool is demonstrated on a flapping flight model of the fruit fly.\n\nChapter 3 incorporates variational calculus methods to discover the structure of the solution trajectory of the periodic drug delivery application, once OPC properness is established. Also, a discretization approach based on the discovered structure is shown to reduce the computational requirements of solving the OPC problem offline.\n\t\nChapter 4 develops an adaptive controller to achieve online OPC for the drug delivery application in the presence of unknown plant parameters. This controller is dependent on the innate open-loop stability of the drug absorption dynamics and the local convergence of the closed loop scheme is shown using Floquet analysis.\n\t\nChapter 5 designs a novel adaptive tracking algorithm grounded in principles of feedback linearization theory. A Lyapunov stability analysis establishes global convergence to a target trajectory dependent on unknown plant parameters. A numerical active vehicle suspension example is employed to showcase the performance of the algorithm.\n\t\nChapter 6 finally presents the online OPC framework of this dissertation with the adaptive tracking controller of Chapter 5 incorporated at its heart. The performance of the closed-loop scheme is demonstrated on the benchmark drug delivery application.\n\nThe proposed online OPC framework (i) provides an online estimate of the uncertain plant parameters, (ii) efficiently solves for and employs a family of precalculated optimal periodic solutions indexed by the plant parameter estimates, and (iii) offers an input adaptation mechanism which enables asymptotic and stable tracking of a dynamically-changing target trajectory constructed from this family of optimal solutions. These tasks collectively are shown to enable stable and global convergence of the closed loop system towards its optimal periodic path.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15859], "author_name_tesi": "Ghanaatpishe, Mohammad ", "last_name_ssi": "Ghanaatpishe", "first_name_ssi": "Mohammad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Karen Ann Thole", "Christopher Rahn", "Bo Cheng", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hosam Kadry Fathy, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Bo Cheng, Committee Member", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adaptive Control", "Drug Delivery", "Insect Flight", "Optimal Periodic Control", "Optimization", "Estimation", "Tracking"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "STUDY OF CERCHAR ABRASIVITY INDEX AND POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS \nFOR MORE CONSISTENT MEASUREMENT OF ROCK ABRASION\n\n\n", "id": "11029", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "500", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tool wear is an important parameter in mechanized tunneling and is highly affected by rock abrasiveness. There are numerous tests to identify the rock abrasivity. One of the widely used rock abrasion tests is the Cerchar abrasion index (CAI). This test is used for estimation of bit life and wear in various mining and tunneling applications. The test is simple and can be considered for field applications.  However, there are some discrepancies in the test results related to the equipment used, surface condition of rock samples, operator skills, and procedures used in measurement of worn out surface (wear flat). \nThis study discusses the background of the test, reviews the testing parameters and their impact on testing as noted in previous studies, and examines the impact of the different parameters on Cerchar testing. Seven rock types ranging from abrasive to non-abrasive were in the testing program. Pins with different hardness were used on rough and sawn surfaces of the selected rock samples. Geomechanical properties of these samples were also measured. Cerchar values of different pins were compared and formulas offered by some researchers for conversion of the CAI measurements between pins of various hardness were found to be satisfactory. It was confirmed that the rough samples have higher Cerchar values as compared to sawn-cut samples. Good correlation between the Cerchar value and the Compressive strength and equivalent quartz content in rough samples were achieved.  Tests were performed on three rock types with different speeds and the results proved that the test speed does not change the results significantly.  \nBy using various loads on the pin, it was concluded that the applied load linearly affects the Cerchar value. Meanwhile to mitigate the issue of operator sensitivity and errors associated with measurement of the worn out surface, a new method for measuring the tip loss, which was already developed by NTNU, was used. This method uses the side view of the pin to measure the tip loss. It was proved that this method can decrease the operator sensitivity of the measurements. \nA new device was introduced in an attempt to address some of the shortcomings of the Cerchar test. The test involves use of a 90-degree cone pin on a sample that is placed on a lace.  The rotation of the lace allows for control of the length of the scratch, whereas the arrangement of the tool allows for varying the amount of load placed on the tip.  Some preliminary tests were performed on seven rock types and initial results do not show a good correlation with Cerchar measurements. Another set of tests were performed on sawn quartzite with varying applied loads and test durations. It was concluded that applied load is linearly correlated with the tip loss. As in soft rocks, the pin tends to penetrate into the rock. It is more reasonable not to apply higher loads on the pin to prevent excessive penetration and possibly failure of the sample. The results also proved that the wear mainly occurs in the first few rotations and therefore a long test duration is not needed.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [497], "author_name_tesi": "Ghasemi, Amirreza ", "last_name_ssi": "Ghasemi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amirreza", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamal Rostami", "Jamal Rostami"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamal Rostami, Thesis Advisor", "Jamal Rostami, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["excavation", "rock", "cerchar", "abrasivity", "abrasion", "tunnel"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Geothermal Energy Harvesting through Pile Foundations \u2013 Analysis-based Prediction and Performance Assessment", "id": "25664", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11123", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Seasonal variation of ground temperature is insignificant below a shallow depth, usually couple of meters, from the ground surface and thus pile foundations are good candidates for harvesting geothermal energy through heat exchange with ground. Such piles are commonly known as geothermal piles, heat exchanger piles or energy piles. The great potential of environmental, social and economic benefits of utilizing shallow geothermal energy has made the use of geothermal piles quite popular in different parts of the world. The aim of this study is to assess and quantify the potential of heat exchange through geothermal piles with a view to promote efficient design of pile-anchored geothermal energy harvesting systems. Research objective is achieved through development of numerical models that employ finite difference solution scheme and simulate pile-soil heat exchange with different levels of accuracy. Developed models are validated through comparison of model predictions using available analytical solutions under idealized conditions, field test data reported in literature and data recorded during thermomechanical tests on model geothermal pile installed in dry and saturated sand.\n\tAn annular cylinder heat source model, which simulates heat transport by the fluid circulating through tubes embedded in heat exchanger piles, is developed as a first modeling attempt.   Results obtained from analyses using this model demonstrate that the use of a constant heat flux along the entire length of a heat exchanger pile may significantly misinterpret thermal response of the pile-soil system. The annular cylinder model considers one limb of the embedded heat exchanger element (i.e., circulation tube) and thus, can provide only approximate solution for real-life scenarios. Simultaneous heat transfer from both branches of an embedded U-shaped circulation tube is modeled next. Finite difference analysis (FDA) results are used to develop closed-form equations that can be used in calculation of power output from geothermal piles with a single U-shaped circulation tube. Parameter sensitivity study and advanced first order second moment (AFOSM) reliability analysis are performed to determine the hierarchy of different input variables in order of their relative impacts on heat transfer performance.\n\tThe first two generations of models developed as part of this research consider heat transport (advection) by the circulation fluid and heat conduction in pile and soil surrounding it. While the model considering both branches of U-shaped circulation tube can predict field and laboratory test data with reasonable accuracy, some discrepancies were observed for predictions of heat transfer in saturated soil. Comparison of data recorded during instrumented laboratory tests on model geothermal pile installed in dry and saturated sand also indicated that heat convection through thermally-induced pore fluid flow within a saturated medium may further facilitate heat exchange through geothermal piles. This feature is incorporated in the developed pile-soil heat exchange model by coupling heat energy balance and Navier Stokes equations that considers a Boussinesq buoyancy term. Results indicate that thermal operation of geothermal piles alters pore fluid density, buoyant flow occurs (even under hydrostatic condition) within saturated soil in the vicinity of heat exchanger piles, and thermally induced pore water flow (under saturated condition) facilitates pile-soil heat exchange. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10689], "author_name_tesi": "Ghasemi Fare, Omid ", "last_name_ssi": "Ghasemi Fare", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Omid", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Prasenjit Basu", "Dr Prasenjit Basu", "Derek Elsworth", "Tong Qiu", "Dr Swagata Banerjee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Prasenjit Basu, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Prasenjit Basu, Committee Chair", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Tong Qiu, Committee Member", "Dr Swagata Banerjee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heat transfer; geothermal energy; heat exchangers; numerical ana"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "ECONOMIC AND PHOSPHORUS-RELATED EFFECTS OF PRECISION FEEDING AND FORAGE MANAGEMENT MODELED AT FARM AND WATERSHED SCALES:\nCANNONSVILLE RESERVIOR WATERSHED, NY \n\n\n", "id": "7544", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3848", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soil phosphorus (P) build-up in the New York Cannonsville Reservoir Watershed (CRW) and, in turn, the poor water quality of the reservoir, is largely due to more P being imported to farms as feed and fertilizer than exported in milk and other products.

In this study, a model-based evaluation of PFM was performed at two management levels, farm- and watershed-level planning.\n\nFor two CRW dairy-farms, Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM) simulation of reduced dietary-P integrated with increased grass-forage productivity and use in the diet resulted in reductions of farm P imbalances (78-100%) and soluble P losses (18%). Also, a decrease in feed supplement purchase was achieved, thus increasing farm profitability. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulation for the same strategy also demonstrated appreciable decrease in soil P (7-8%) during the growing season, thereby indicating increased soil P removal by the improved grass-forage.

Similar approaches can be applied to dairy farms throughout the northeastern U.S. where implementation of PFM-strategies are of interest.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3822], "author_name_tesi": "Ghebremichael, Lula T", "last_name_ssi": "Ghebremichael", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Lula", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Michael Hamlett", "William J Gburek", "Clarence Alan Rotz", "Tamie L Veith", "Albert R Jarrett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Michael Hamlett, Committee Chair", "William J Gburek, Committee Member", "Clarence Alan Rotz, Committee Member", "Tamie L Veith, Committee Member", "Albert R Jarrett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["land use mangement", "forage managment", "phosphorus loss", "IFSM", "SWAT", "precision feeding", "simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Hormone-Behavior Correlates among Male and Female Psychopathic Participants:  Relationship to Gray's Model of Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Systems", "id": "6816", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4115", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study aimed to identify the role of hormonal substrates in relation to Gray\u2019s (1987) model of the behavioral inhibition (BIS) and activation (BAS) systems\u2014constructs proposed to serve a role in the etiology and/or maintenance of psychopathy.  Meta-analytic studies have identified a positive relationship between testosterone and aggressive, antisocial, deviant types of behaviors, whereas cortisol has been associated with stress and anxiety. Additionally, a few studies have found reduced cortisol among antisocial, aggressive men.  Given that the BIS is associated with inhibited and anxious responding, and the BAS with reward-seeking, impulsive, and sometimes antisocial behaviors, this study proposed that hormones such as cortisol and testosterone, respectively, may significantly correlate with BIS and BAS-driven responses in differentiating psychopaths and nonpsychopaths\u2014a finding that would have important implications for future intervention research and for understanding the nature of this disorder.  No study to date has assessed the correlates of both hormones with an experimental measure of BIS and BAS-functioning among male and female psychopathic individuals as this study has done.  \n\nUtilizing the Iowa gambling task, a behavioral measure commonly used to elicit BIS/BAS activity in response to mixed punishment and reward contingencies, this study\u2019s findings both corroborated and extended previous findings.  Both male and female psychopathic analogues as compared to nonpsychopathic analogues responded to the task by utilizing high-risk, disadvantageous decisions.  These findings support the notion that psychopathic individuals exhibit low punishment and high reward sensitivity, consistent with Newman\u2019s (1987) response modulation deficit model.  Although some of the predicted hormone-behavior relationships were not obtained, exploratory post-hoc analyses revealed unexpected moderating relationships between gender and hormone levels in predicting differential BIS-BAS motivated behaviors.   Testosterone (post-task only) moderated the relationship between gender and performance on the gambling task, such that males with the highest testosterone levels during the task made significantly better decisions than males with low testosterone levels.  Females with low testosterone levels exhibited significantly better performance than those with high testosterone levels. Additionally, basal cortisol levels also moderated the relationship between gender and task performance.  Specifically, females with low basal cortisol levels made significantly more advantageous decisions as compared to males with low basal cortisol levels, such that low cortisol levels optimized female performance, but dampered male performance.

Even with a 30 percent annual rate of technical change, meeting the entire transport sector diesel demand by algal biodiesel would be a formidable task without a continuation of government subsidies for biodiesel. Model results indicate that the current subsidy of about $42 per barrel of oil equivalent increases the production of algal biodiesel up to 80 percent relative to a scenario in which the subsidy is eliminated. Model results also indicate that the competitiveness of algal biodiesel with petro-diesel is hampered by the current high marginal cost of algal biodiesel. The average total cost of algal biodiesel was found by 2030 to range between $41 and $50 per barrel for price taker model and $31 to $70 per barrel for price maker model given an annual rate of Hicks-Neutral technical change of 30 percent.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4770], "author_name_tesi": "Ghimire, Narishwar ", "last_name_ssi": "Ghimire", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Narishwar", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Gerard Abler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Gerard Abler, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Demand and Supply", "Algal Biodiesel", "Technical Change", "Marginal Costs"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF THE RHEOLOGICAL AND SWELLING PROPERTIES OF SYNTHETIC ALKALI SILICATE GELS IN ORDER TO PREDICT THEIR BEHAVIOR IN ASR DAMAGED CONCRETE", "id": "14066axg402", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14066", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Alkali\u2013silica reaction (ASR) is a major concrete durability concern that is responsible for the deterioration of concrete infrastructure in the world.  The resultant of the reaction between the cement alkali hydroxides and the metastable silicates in the aggregates is a hygroscopic and expansive alkali\u2013silicate gel (referred to as ASR gel in this document).  The swelling behavior of ASR gels determines the extent of damage to concrete structures and, as such, mitigation of ASR relies on understanding these gels and finding ways to prevent them either from formation, or from swelling after formation.  This dissertation focuses on the synthesis and characterization of ASR gels with wide ranges of compositions similar to what has been reported for the filed ASR gels in the literature.  The experimental work consisted of three phases as follow.\nPhase I: Investigation of rheology, chemistry and physics of ASR gels produced through sol\u2013method.  Inspired from the existing literature, two sol\u2013gel methods have been developed for the synthesis of ASR gels.  The rheological (primarily gelation time, yield stress, and equilibrium stress), chemical (pore solution pH, pore solution composition, osmotic pressure, solid phase composition, stoichiometry of gelation reactions) and physical (evaporable water, solid content, etc.) properties of synthetic ASR gels have been extensively investigated in this phase.  Ca/Si, Na/Si and K/Si, and water content were considered as the main chemical composition variables.  In order to investigate the suppressing effects of lithium on the swelling properties of ASR gels, the gels were added with lithium in a part of the experimental program. The results strongly suggested that Ca/Si has a positive effect on the yield stress of the gels and their rate of gelation.  Na/Si was found to have a decreasing effect on the yield stress and gelation rate (especially at low Ca/Si levels).  K/Si and Li/Si had second\u2013order (i.e., polynomial) effects on the yield stress of the gels, causing a significant drop in this parameter followed by some increase as they approached their upper values.  Na/Si and K/Si were both found contribute to the osmotic potential of the ASR gels, while increase in Ca/Si generally led to a drop in this parameter.  The presence of all components (Ca, Na, and K) were found to contribute to the pH of the gels\u2019 pore solution, and Ca/Si and Na/Si showed a synergistic effect on this parameter.  Lithium, on the other hand, was found to be able to drop the OH- concentration of the pore solution by a factor of five in the case of high\u2013sodium gels, which could partially explain its ASR mitigating effect.\nPhase II: Investigation of the free and restrained swelling behavior, hydrophilic potential and viscoelastic properties of ASR gels produced through the \u201cpaste method\u201d.  20 gel compositions were selected (using the central composite design method) with Ca/Si, Na/Si and K/Si molar ratios varying in the ranges (0.05\u20130.5), (0.1\u20131.0) and (0.0\u20130.3), respectively.  The gels were produced by batching appropriate amounts of certain precursors containing different chemical components.  After curing, the gels were tested for the abovementioned parameters using some innovative test methods as explained in the relevant chapters.  The results suggest that increasing the alkali content (Na/Si and K/Si) in ASR gels resulted in an increase in the gels\u2019 free swelling and water absorption, and a reduction in the equilibrium relative humidity (ERH).  However, no significant effect was found for Ca/Si with respect to the ERH.  Ca/Si was found to have a multi\u2013episode effect on the swelling and water absorption properties of the gels.  An increase in Ca/Si up to 0.18 led to a considerable reduction in the swelling strain, followed by a slight increasing effect as it approached 0.4.  Further increase in Ca/Si resulted in complete elimination of swelling strain.  While Na/Si and K/Si could constantly increase the free swelling strain, their excessive presence was found to have a softening effect on the gels\u2019 structure, leading to a drop in their swelling pressure.  Finally, all gels were found to show viscoelastic behavior that could be best explained via Burger\u2019s model.  The elastic and viscous components have been measured for each gel and related to their composition using regression.\nPhase III: An Extended Chemical Index Model to Predict the Fly Ash Dosage Necessary for Mitigating Alkali-Silica Reaction in Concrete.  In order to have an applied and ready\u2013to\u2013implement contribution to the realm of alkali\u2013silica reaction, a predictive statistical model was developed that determines the optimum fly ash dosage for ASR mitigation depending on the acceptable risk of ASR and structure\u2019s importance. The model uses the oxide compositions of portland cement and fly ash, as well as the reactivity of the aggregates.  Seventy-six experimental data points (published in the last two decades across the U.S. and Canada) on CPT expansion results for plain portland cement and fly ash-blended concrete mixtures were used to develop and evaluate the model. The model was found to be capable of predicting CPT expansion of concrete incorporating both class F and class C fly ash and reactive aggregates within ASTM C1293 precision criteria.  It allows for the use of a wider range of fly ashes compared to what is currently being prescribed by the standards for use in concrete susceptible to ASR.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13896], "author_name_tesi": "Gholizadeh Vayghan, Asghar ", "last_name_ssi": "Gholizadeh Vayghan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Asghar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farshad Rajabipour", "Farshad Rajabipour", "William D.

The environmental target is of the safety-first type, which requires probabilistic control of emissions. One market is built around the trading ratio, which defines the substitution rate between stochastic and deterministic pollution, and is modeled on existing markets for water quality trading. The other market is built\naround a new definition of the traded commodity as a multi-attribute good, where the attributes supply information to the market on the environmental risks associated with stochastic pollution. The latter market is found to out-perform the trading ratio market in its ability to satisfy the safety-first environmental target at least cost. This result comes about because polluters are able to directly price risk in the latter market. In the former market risk is not a factor in the trading decision and can only be controlled under highly restrictive conditions.\n\nIn my third essay I report results from an economic experiment where the two markets developed in the previous essay are compared in a testbed that captures important features of existing markets for water quality trading. In the interests of tractability these features were abstracted from in the previous theoretical analysis. One feature is that of oligopsony and the second feature is that of a discrete trading environment where polluters generate credits by implementing one of a small set of emission-reducing technologies. The experimental results indicate that the market with multi-attribute goods generates a superior environmental outcome to the trading ratio market. Furthermore, the average cost of pollution control is lower in the former market. Market power is independent of the type of market institution, but I do find that large buyers have more market power than small buyers. Finally, I find that sellers of credits learn to resist market power as they gain experience, but at the cost of market efficiency since their resistance causes a fall in the number of trades. Overall, the results support the\nthesis of the second essay, that the market with multi-attribute goods generates better\nenvironmental outcomes than the trading ratio market.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2074], "author_name_tesi": "Ghosh, Gaurav Somenath", "last_name_ssi": "Ghosh", "middle_name_ssi": "Somenath", "first_name_ssi": "Gaurav", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle", "James Samuel Shortle", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica", "Edward C Jaenicke", "Richard C Ready"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle, Dissertation Advisor", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Chair", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Member", "Richard C Ready, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spatial Econometrics", "Emissions Trading", "Experimental Economics", "Pollution Control", "Hedonics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Promoting Formal Financial Services Access Through Mobile Banking: The Ugandan Case\n", "id": "11940", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2455", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mobile Banking has been touted as revolutionary in the developing world with its capacity to extend financial services access to the unbanked.

The essays address issues in the economics of environmental investments under uncertainty, adaptation to climate change, and information in environmental management.  The unifying theme across the three essays is environmental decision-making under uncertainty.  \n\t\nThe first essay examines the value of information from integrated sampling of the economy and the environment for nonpoint pollution management.  Ideally, the regulator ought to be able to set different levels of the pollution control instrument for polluters based on their productivity and pollution types. The deficit of information on productivity and pollution types of the polluter\u2019s forces regulators to select uniform control instruments that do not minimize the abatement costs of pollution.  Essay 1 tests and finds, in context of a particular watershed, that there is value of information in integrated sampling procedures of the environment and the economy.  Information obtained from integrated sampling does result in more efficient pollution control policies.   \nThe second essay looks at the economics of adaptation to climate change.  Specifically, the essay examines the Submerged Aquatic Vegetation restoration program of the Chesapeake Bay as a problem of optimal investment decision-making in ecological projects under climate change.  The essay highlights the importance of considering climate change as a possible stressor in ecosystem management and restoration strategies. \n\nThe final essay addresses the optimal timing of investments in adaptation measure to climate change as part of the adaptation policy design; specifically it addresses the question of when to invest resources in adaptation measures. The timing question is important, but neglected in the literature.  The presence of uncertainty, irreversibility, and adjustment costs that characterize adaptation problem complicates the analysis of optimal timing of adaptation measures. The essay examines how these elements influence timing decisions of adaptation measures and determines conditions under which immediate investment in adaptation is justified.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3562], "author_name_tesi": "Ghosh, Koel ", "last_name_ssi": "Ghosh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Koel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle", "Ann N Fisher", "Stephan J Goetz", "Stephen L Rathbun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle, Committee Chair", "Ann N Fisher, Committee Member", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Member", "Stephen L Rathbun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adaptation", "climate change", "expected value of information", "spatial statistics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Role of Transcription Factors in Pausing RNA Polymerase II in Drosophila.", "id": "11692", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5518", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Promoter proximal pausing of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) occurs on thousands of genes in animal cells. This pausing often correlates with rapid induction of genes, but direct tests of the relationship between pausing and induction rates are lacking. Hsp70 and hsp26 in Drosophila are rapidly induced by heat shock. Contrary to current expectations, depletion of NELF, a key factor in setting up the paused Pol II, disrupted pausing but did not interfere with rapid induction. Instead, depletion of NELF delayed the time when these genes shut off during recovery from heat shock. Further analyses showed that NELF-depletion delayed the dissociation of HSF from hsp70 and hsp26, and a similar delay was observed when CBP was depleted from cells. CBP has been reported to associate with Pol II, and acetylation of HSF by CBP has been implicated in dissociating HSF from heat shock genes. I propose that NELF-mediated pausing allows Pol II to direct CBP-mediated acetylation of HSF, thus causing HSF to dissociate from the gene. Activators are typically viewed as controlling Pol II transcription. My results reveal a reciprocal relationship in which the pausing of Pol II by NELF influences the interaction of the activator.\n We have also observed that pausing on hsp70 can be shifted towards the transcription start site (TSS) in a cell free system by reducing the nucleotide concentration. To analyze whether the elongation rate of the Pol II affected where Pol II paused in vivo, permanganate footprinting of the salivary glands of wild type and a slow Pol II mutant polymerase was performed. My results showed that there is an upstream shift of the slower moving Pol II. This revealed that the location of NELF mediated pause is dictated by the rate of elongation, which in turn may result from the kinetic competition between the rate of elongation and the rate of binding by negative regulators. \nNELF also influences the expression of many genes, wherein depleting NELF down-regulated as well as up-regulated the expression of these target genes. Here I have compared using permanganate genomic mapping the effect of NELF depletion on Pol II pausing at NELF target genes in Drosophila salivary glands and tissue culture cells. This study demonstrated that Drosophila salivary glands can be used as a model tissue for investigating effects of factors regulating paused Pol II.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5509], "author_name_tesi": "Ghosh, Saikat Kumar Bijoy", "last_name_ssi": "Ghosh", "middle_name_ssi": "Bijoy", "first_name_ssi": "Saikat Kumar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Gilmour", "David Scott Gilmour", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "B Tracy Nixon", "Yanming Wang", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Andrew Thomas Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Scott Gilmour, Dissertation Advisor", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Chair", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Drosophila", "Transcription shut-off", "NELF", "HSF", "pausing", "heat shock recovery"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Novel Equation-of-state To Model Microemulsion Phase Behavior For Enhanced Oil Recovery Applications", "id": "27489", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12030", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Surfactant-polymer (SP) floods have significant potential to recover waterflood residual oil in shallow oil reservoirs.  A thorough understanding of surfactant-oil-brine phase behavior is critical to the design of chemical EOR floods. While considerable progress has been made in developing surfactants and polymers that increase the potential of a chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project, very little progress has been made to predict phase behavior as a function of formulation variables such as pressure, temperature, and oil equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN).  The empirical Hand\u2019s plot is still used today to model the microemulsion phase behavior with little predictive capability as these and other formulation variables change.  Such models could lead to incorrect recovery predictions and improper flood designs. Reservoir crudes also contain acidic components (primarily naphthenic acids), which undergo neutralization to form soaps in the presence of alkali. The generated soaps perform synergistically with injected synthetic surfactants to mobilize waterflood residual oil in what is termed alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) flooding.  The addition of alkali, however, complicates the measurement and prediction of the microemulsion phase behavior that forms with acidic crudes.  \n\tIn this dissertation, we account for pressure changes in the hydrophilic-lipophilic difference (HLD) equation. This new HLD equation is coupled with the net-average curvature (NAC) model to predict phase volumes, solubilization ratios, and microemulsion phase transitions (Winsor II-, III, and II+).  This dissertation presents the first modified HLD-NAC model to predict microemulsion phase behavior for live crudes, including optimal solubilization ratio and the salinity width of the three-phase Winsor III region at different temperatures and pressures.  This new equation-of-state-like model could significantly aid the design and forecast of chemical floods where key variables change dynamically, and in screening of potential candidate reservoirs for chemical EOR. The modified HLD-NAC model is also extended here for ASP flooding.  We use an empirical equation to calculate the acid distribution coefficient from the molecular structure of the soap.  Key HLD-NAC parameters like optimum salinities and optimum solubilization ratios are calculated from soap mole fraction weighted equations.  The model is tuned to data from phase behavior experiments with real crudes to demonstrate the procedure.  We also examine the ability of the new model to predict fish plots and activity charts that show the evolution of the three-phase region. The modified HLD-NAC equations are then made dimensionless to develop important microemulsion phase behavior relationships and for use in tuning the new model to measured data.  Key dimensionless groups that govern phase behavior and their effects are identified and analyzed.\n\tA new correlation was developed to predict optimum solubilization ratios at different temperatures, pressures and oil EACN with an average relative error of 10.55%.  The prediction of optimum salinities with the modified HLD approach resulted in average relative errors of 2.35%.  We also present a robust method to precisely determine optimum salinities and optimum solubilization ratios from salinity scan data with average relative errors of 1.17% and 2.44% for the published data examined. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11461], "author_name_tesi": "Ghosh, Soumyadeep ", "last_name_ssi": "Ghosh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soumyadeep", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns", "Luis F Ayala H", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns, Dissertation Advisor", "Luis F Ayala H, Committee Member", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Member", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microemulsion", "Phase Behavior", "Enhanced oil recovery"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Modeling, Mechanics and Physiology of the Esophagus and Lower Sphincter\n\n\n", "id": "6489", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5643", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The process of deglutition includes a series of coordinated neuro-muscular interactions that produce bolus transport and mixing along the human gastrointestinal tract. In this thesis, we use a combination of mathematical modeling and physiological data analysis to study the mechanics and macrophysiology underlying antegrade and retrograde bolus transport through the esophagus and the esophago-gastric segment (EGS). Specifically, we analyze normal and abnormal antegrade transport (a) through the esophageal body, (b) across the EGS associated with swallowing, and (c) EGS opening and retrograde flow of gastric fluid associated with gastro-esophageal reflux.\n\tThe manometrically measured pressure wave, which is associated with peristaltic muscle contraction in the esophagus, consistently displays a trough called the transition zone (TZ) in the neighborhood of the aortic arch. A previous computer model study suggested that the TZ is associated with distinct upper and lower contraction waves that must be coordinated spatially and temporally for successful bolus transport. Through a study of concurrent high resolution manometry and fluoroscopy, we demonstrate that the existence of two distinct contraction waves above and below the esophageal TZ, with a well-defined jump between them, comprises normal neuromuscular physiology. The space-time structure of pressure surrounding the jump shows that the TZ is a region of segmental contraction. In a patient group with higher bolus retention (2.18 ml vs. 0.20 ml), the separation between the two contraction waves was nearly twice as large as normal controls (6.00 cm vs. 3.32 cm), with significantly weaker muscle squeeze pressure in the TZ. We conclude that pathological bolus retention in the aortic arch region of the esophagus is related to an adverse modulation of the neurophysiology that controls the coordination between upper and lower esophageal contraction waves, resulting in inefficient bolus transport.\n\tNext, we studied the mechanics of esophageal emptying from a \"distal bolus cavity\" across the hiatal canal of the EGS to the stomach in normal subjects, and its modulation after fundoplication. Temporal changes in geometry of the distal bolus cavity and hiatal canal and cavity driving pressure were quantified. These data were combined with mathematical models of esophageal emptying and muscle tension driving trans-hiatal flow. All esophageal emptying events post fundoplication were incomplete (51% retention). Whereas there was no significant difference in the period of emptying between controls and patients, average emptying rates were 40% lower in the post-fundoplication group. The mathematical model predicted three distinct phases during esophageal emptying. A rapid increase in muscle tone and driving pressure forced normal hiatal opening. In the post-fundoplication group, a severe impairment of cavity muscle tone resulted in causing deficient hiatal opening and flow and consistent bolus retention.\nIn the final phase of our study, we developed a solid-fluid interaction model of gastro-esophageal reflux in which a model of esophageal tension is combined with a lubrication-theory-based fluid flow model to study the mechano-physiology of EGS opening and reflux. The external sphincter tone associated with the crural diaphragm is modeled as external pressure. Passive elastic tension associated with both internal and external muscle components are modeled through stress-strain constitutive relationships. Viscoelasticity is added through an ad-hoc damping term. We find that gastric pressure plays a crucial role in the initiation of opening of a relaxed EGS, and that both stiffness of the EGS and gastric pressure are important determinants of the degree of opening. We demarcate the reflux/no-reflux barrier associated with a weakened EGS and conclude that reduced stiffness of the EGS is a potentially important aspect of reflux disease. Model results predict that the probability of reflux is much higher when the basal lumen radius is only 1 mm > normal, suggesting that abnormally high resting luminal distension leads to more frequent reflux, and may underlie much gastroesophageal reflux disease, especially with hiatal hernia.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5640], "author_name_tesi": "Ghosh, Sudip Kumar", "last_name_ssi": "Ghosh", "middle_name_ssi": "Kumar", "first_name_ssi": "Sudip", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Gordon Brasseur", "Peter J Kahrilas", "Francesco Costanzo", "James S Ultman", "Richard C Benson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Gordon Brasseur, Committee Chair", "Peter J Kahrilas, Committee Member", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Member", "James S Ultman, Committee Member", "Richard C Benson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fundoplication surgery", "esophageal transition zone", "acid reflux disease", "hiatal hernia", "mathematical modeling", "fluid-structure interaction", "muscle mechanics", "lubrication theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Genome-wide studies of transcriptional responses in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)\n", "id": "17596", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7768", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cells are known to respond to changing environmental conditions by regulating the expression of genes. Regulation of transcription itself is a complicated process. It involves contributions from various cellular activators and repressors towards enhancing the accessibility of an otherwise repressive chromatin to the transcription factors and RNA Pol II for transcription initiation. Till date, a lot of expression studies have been done using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a model organism to investigate the role of different environmental conditions on cellular expression. Such studies have led to the identification of the environmental stress response (ESR) genes which consists of a common group of genes that are either up-regulated or down-regulated in response to a variety of environmental conditions. In addition to the ESR, the conditions also trigger stress-specific responses. \n\nExpression studies provide valuable information in terms of which genes are expressed or repressed. But attempts to actually dissect how similar or varied the roles of transcription factors (specially assembly of the pre-initiation complex-PIC) in response to diverse conditions are, have not been made.  Thus with that objective in mind the question I have tried to address in this thesis is when the genome is re-programmed by two different stress conditions does it use similar or varied PIC assembly pathways. Using moderate resolution tiling arrays (ChIP-chip) I mapped occupancy changes of factors involved in different stages of PIC assembly in response to DNA damage and heat shock. Surprisingly I found that heat shock inducible genes recruited both TFIID and SAGA co-activator pathways simultaneously. Whereas MMS inducible genes recruit SAGA first, followed by TFIID, suggesting a sequential pathway. Thus although both the conditions recruited both SAGA and TFIID, the timing of the implementation of those complexes varied which could be primarily due to the differences in the kinetics/dynamics of the two stress conditions.\n\n Amongst all the classes of genes in yeast, RP (ribosomal protein) genes are known to be the most highly regulated. They are also the group of genes that get down regulated in unison in response to environmental changes. S. cerevisiae has 137 RP genes that encode for 78 ribosomal proteins. 59 out of these 78 are encoded by duplicate genes (paralogs), which are virtually identical. Given the coordinate regulation of RP genes in response to growth conditions the question I addressed in my thesis is how redundant is the transcriptional regulation of the RP paralogs. In particular, I examined the binding of seven known RP gene regulators  (Ifh1, Fhl1, Hmo1, Sfp1, Rap1, Gcn4, Abf1) and Crt1 (novel regulator of RP genes) using ChIP-exo.  My results suggest that RP paralogs bind the factors differentially and most of these factors track together as a huge complex at RP promoters (localized around -200 to -400 bp upstream of TSS) except for Crt1 which is more localized in the coding region of RP genes. Interestingly, Crt1 was found to play a role in down-regulation of the RP genes. Additionally majority of the factors were found to have multiple binding sites (>4) in the RP genes that could play a role in cooperative binding or release from the RP genes, for coordinate regulation in response to growth cues. \n\nTaken together, the work in this thesis has made some initial attempts in dissecting the PIC assembly pathways in response to different stress conditions. It also instigates the concept of a large multi-subunit complex working at the RP genes along with the differential binding of factors at its paralogous pairs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7700], "author_name_tesi": "Ghosh, Sujana ", "last_name_ssi": "Ghosh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sujana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Joseph C.

Volatile aroma release from food emulsions is governed by both thermodynamics of binding of aroma molecules to different food constituents and the kinetics of its transport within different regions of food. Lipids, being a large reservoir of aroma compounds, significantly influence aroma release from food emulsions and these effects have been well documented. However, most of these studies involve liquid lipid and effects of fat crystallization on the aroma release properties have been largely ignored. \n\nThe major difficulty faced in the comparison of the interactions of aroma compounds with solid and with liquid fats is that there is always a temperature or composition change required to initiate crystallization which might itself affect the binding properties of the system.   However, by varying the temperature history of an emulsified lipid it was possible to compare aroma interactions of supercooled liquid droplets with those of crystalline droplets at the same temperature and with the same composition.\n\nThe first objective of this study was to understand the thermodynamics of aroma-solid fat interaction in oil-in-water emulsions. The partitioning of a mixture of aroma compounds (ethyl butanoate, ethyl pentanoate, ethyl heptanoate and ethyl octanoate) to model n-eicosane-in-water emulsions stabilized with sodium caseinate was studied by static headspace gas chromatography.  The binding of aroma compounds by the liquid droplets was modeled in terms of the bulk oil-gas and water-gas partition coefficients and the volume fraction of the phases.  However, aroma binding by solid droplets depended on the specific surface area of the droplets suggesting a surface-binding mechanism and an effective surface binding coefficient was defined for each aroma compounds as the ratio of aqueous to interfacial concentration.  This value was constant up to a critical point after which it increased dramatically as the droplets bound much more volatiles.  The increase coincided with an apparent dissolution of the solid droplets in the adsorbed volatile (as measured by a decrease in the measured melting enthalpy).  Using the surface binding coefficient and bulk partition coefficients it was possible to model the aroma binding by solid droplets in emulsion.\n\nThe results from eicosane emulsion were also compared with triglyceride emulsions prepared with hydrogenated palm stearin (HPS) and Salatrim\u00ae (Short And Long chain Acyl TRIglyceride Molecules). For all aroma compounds, equilibrium aroma release from solid droplet emulsions was significantly higher than that for liquid droplet emulsions. It was found that while the partitioning of volatile aroma compounds from emulsion does not depend on the type of liquid oil used, the interactions between solid fat droplets and aroma compounds are significantly influenced by the nature of the crystalline fat. Notably, partitioning into the headspace was much lower for emulsions with solid triglyceride droplets than that for solid alkane droplets.\n\nThe second objective of this work was to investigate the kinetics of aroma release from solid fat and liquid oil in emulsion droplets. Emulsions (eicosane or HPS) were mixed with a mixture of aroma compounds and transferred to a model mouth.  The glass vessel was sealed and the emulsion was allowed 15 s for the aroma compounds to release into the headspace before a nitrogen flow was used to sweep the headspace out of the container and into a mass spectrometer detector. The change in aroma concentration in the headspace was plotted with time and it was found that with the start of gas flow the aroma concentration increases sharply to a maximum value and thereafter decreases as the rate that aroma compounds are swept out of the glass vessel is exceeded by the rate at which it is released into the gas phase by the emulsion. The rate of release from solid fat droplets was higher than that from liquid oil droplets emulsions. For emulsions with solid fat droplets rate of release decreased with droplet size, particularly for higher molecular weight aroma compounds and release from solid HPS was slower than solid eicosane.  By manipulating the aroma content, the initial aroma release profile of the solid droplet emulsion can be matched to that of a liquid droplet emulsion with higher aroma content with resulting considerable savings of these food ingredients. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6056], "author_name_tesi": "Ghosh, Supratim ", "last_name_ssi": "Ghosh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Supratim", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Neil Coupland", "Devin G Peterson", "Robert F Roberts", "Gregory Ray Ziegler", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Neil Coupland, Committee Chair", "Devin G Peterson, Committee Chair", "Robert F Roberts, Committee Member", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aroma Release", "Fat Crystallization", "Emulsion"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Teams and games for distributed consensus.", "id": "18723", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8715", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The problem of synthesizing linear dynamic feedback controllers which achieve distributed fi\fnite-time consensus for networks of multiple agents described by fi\fxed connectivity graphs is considered.

An approach, developed by Weisz (1967) to understand diffusion in heterogeneous materials, was used to elucidate the mechanism of moisture migration through chocolate-flavored coatings.  \n\tIn chocolate-flavored coatings, the sucrose and cocoa powder particles are embedded in the continuous fat phase. It was hypothesized that the unsteady-state diffusivity of moisture through the coatings could be estimated from the diffusivity of water through the continuous fat phase and the partition coefficient of moisture between the hydrophilic particles and the fat phase.  Therefore, to predict moisture diffusivity through a chocolate-flavored coating, the moisture sorption isotherms for all the constituents of the coating and the diffusion coefficient through the fat phase are required.\n\tThe moisture adsorption isotherms for sugar, cocoa powder, coconut oil, and coconut oil + 0.5% lecithin were obtained by equilibration over saturated salt solutions.  It was found that up to an aw of 0.85, cocoa powder adsorbed more moisture than any other component.  The presence of lecithin increased the moisture adsorption capacity of oil.  The moisture adsorption isotherm for a coating made with 70% coconut oil + 0.5% lecithin and 30% sugar was also determined.  The equilibrium moisture content, for this coating, at each water activity level was higher than the individual constituents, i.e., sugar or coconut oil + 0.5% lecithin.  One possible reason for this observation is that there is a layer of moisture present between the surface of the sugar particles and the polar regions of lecithin.\n\tThe diffusion coefficient, of moisture diffusing through fat, was obtained by time-lag experiments.  The predicted diffusion coefficient through a coating containing fat and varying amounts of sucrose and cocoa powder were determined.  Experiments were conducted with coatings containing different amounts of sucrose and cocoa powder to validate the model.  For coatings containing just coconut oil and cocoa powder, the diffusion of moisture in the dispersed phase, i.e. cocoa powder, occurred through the cocoa powder particle.  When lecithin was added, the water molecules diffused through the cocoa powder particles as well as along their surfaces.  When coatings contained sucrose and lecithin and the water activity was 0.85, the sucrose molecules dissolved in the migrating moisture and were transported to surface, where upon evaporation of the water sucrose crystals were deposited.  With diffusion of moisture there were structural changes that altered the diffusivity of moisture through the coating.  The structural changes occurred because the sucrose particles dissolved in the migrating moisture and cocoa powder particles swelled in the presence of moisture.\n\tThe effect of sucrose, cocoa powder, emulsifier, fat type, and storage environment on the water vapor permeability (WVP) of a chocolate-flavored coating was also studied.  In addition, optical microscope images of cocoa powder and SEM images of the structure of two different coatings were obtained.  A coating containing more than 20% cocoa powder (w/w) significantly increased the WVP; a coating containing 60% sucrose significantly decreased the WVP.  There was an increase in the WVP with an increase in the absolute value of the relative humidity across the film.  The increase in WVP at higher absolute humidity was caused due to structural changes in the coatings.  The WVP of fat based films decreased with an increase in the solid fat content (SFC)\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6453], "author_name_tesi": "Ghosh, Vikramaditya ", "last_name_ssi": "Ghosh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vikramaditya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "Gregory Ray Ziegler", "John Neil Coupland", "John L Duda", "John D Floros"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Committee Chair", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Committee Chair", "John Neil Coupland, Committee Member", "John L Duda, Committee Member", "John D Floros, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["diffusion", "heterogeneous media", "mass transfer", "water vapor permeability"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Investigations of Thorium Based Fuel to Improve Actinide Burning Rate in S-PRISM Reactor\n", "id": "9160", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6066", "abstract_tesi": "In this project a comprehensive study was performed with a state-of-the-art multi-physics code system to examine the technical issues of a thorium-based matrix with fast reactors.

As long as neutrons only lose energy they are \"slowing down\". The loss of energy by the neutrons is the dominant energy exchange mechanism for very fast (and hence very energetic) neutrons. In the past this fact led to the use of approximations in which the gain of energy by the neutron in collisions with the fuel lattice atoms or other materials, such as surrounding moderator, was assumed negligible in the energy range above thermal. This assumption was demonstrated to be inaccurate and unacceptable when scattering resonances are present at intermediate energies (the lower energy domain within the slowing down range).  The purpose of this thesis is to contribute a method that allows the relaxation of the incorrect assumption.  Namely, a method is developed that accounts for up-scattering by heavy nuclides in the resonance energy range.\n\nA multigroup formulation for the exact neutron elastic scattering kernel, taking into account up-scattering events, has been developed and verified. The formulation has been applied to elastic scattering cross section data of heavy nuclides for a very fine energy group structure and then supplied to a deterministic lattice physics code demonstrating its effects. Such resonance treatment provides a more accurate representation of the interaction between neutrons and nuclei and results in more realistic and higher fidelity neutron fluxes that reflect the effect of the temperature of the lattice. The correct accounting for the lattice effects influences the estimated values for the probability of neutron absorption and scattering, which in turn determine the core reactivity and consequent burnup characteristics. \n\nThe slowing down process is important in thermal reactors because it results in the neutrons entering the thermal energy range in which the majority of fission events occur. Correctly modeling the slowing down and hence slowing down source into the thermal energy range and consequently allowing the correct modeling of the thermal energy neutron fluxes (or the correct thermal range portion of the spectrum) is paramount to the correct prediction of criticality and safety features, such as the Doppler Effect. These artifacts are important for all thermal spectrum reactors. Correctly accounting for the elastic scattering has led to the recognition of a previous 10% under prediction of the Doppler coefficient for light water reactor lattices of UO2 and MOX fuels and as much as a 211 pcm difference in reactivity. Likewise, the use of the lattice thermal physics-corrected data leads to a -11.22% correction in the flux at 600K and -14.27% at 900K.  This effect is expected to be greater at higher temperatures, and, hence, particularly important for high temperature reactors. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9000], "author_name_tesi": "Ghrayeb, Shadi ", "last_name_ssi": "Ghrayeb", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shadi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Samuel H Levine", "Jorge O Sofo", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Dr Abderrafi M Ougouag"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Dissertation Advisor", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Chair", "Maria Nikolova Avramova, Committee Member", "Samuel H Levine, Committee Member", "Jorge O Sofo, Committee Member", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Member", "Dr Abderrafi M Ougouag, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermal neutron elastic resonance scattering moment DRAGON deter"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DETECTION AND EVALUATION OF COMMUNITY STRUCTURES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS\n\n", "id": "12603", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "66", "abstract_tesi": "In today's world, social media networks capture interactions among people through comments on blogs, posts and feeds. The public availability of these networks has allowed researchers and businesses alike to delve more into these preferences so as to extract communities which clearly define their formation. In social networks, people tend to have more than one preference over different products which makes it difficult to put them in a single community. Although community detection has been well applied to social networks, not much work has been done in detecting overlapping communities within these networks. In this paper we describe an algorithm which applies a game theoretic approach to graph clustering to determine overlapping communities within complex networks and also show how a parallel implementation of the algorithm can be used to detect communities in lesser time than its previous implementations. Further we run the algorithm on various social networks to detect overlapping communities and propose a method to analyze them once they are determined. We conclude by providing impetus on the running time of this algorithm and expressing the need for faster algorithms to detect and analyze social media networks.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [67], "author_name_tesi": "Ghurye, Akshay Dattatraya", "last_name_ssi": "Ghurye", "middle_name_ssi": "Dattatraya", "first_name_ssi": "Akshay", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara", "Soundar R.

This work is performed in organizations by human analysts. These analysts monitor cyber-security sensors to develop and maintain situation awareness (SA) of both normal and abnormal activities that occur on the network. Additionally, analysts remediate compromised computers and attempt to configure networks securely to ensure that known vulnerabilities cannot be exploited. \n\nResearch and development of new fusion algorithms and visual interface, both in academia and in industry, have the objective of increasing cyber-security situation awareness. However, it is uncommon for developers to assess the actual impact on a human analyst\u2019s performance, situational knowledge, perceived effectiveness or perceived workload.

We hypothesized that slow-release urea supplementation would alleviate the previously observed negative effect of lower ruminal N availability on total-tract fiber digestibility. We also hypothesized that supplementation of RPMet and specifically RPHis may increase dry matter intake (DMI), milk yield, and milk protein yield (MPY). Sixty lactating Holstein cows were used in a 10-wk randomized complete block-design trial. Cows were fed a covariate diet for 2 wk (i.e., baseline period during which all cows are fed the same diet) and then assigned to one of the following treatments: MP-adequate diet (AMP), MP-deficient diet (DMP), DMP supplemented with slow-release urea (DMPU), DMPU supplemented with RPMet (DMPUM), and DMPUM supplemented with RPHis (DMPUMH). The DMP diet did not affect DMI, yields of milk, and milk components, despite a reduction in nutrient digestibility, compared to AMP. Urinary N and urea-N excretions were decreased by DMP, compared to AMP. Cows fed DMP had higher plasma concentration of 3-methylhistidine and gained less body weight (BW) compared to AMP and cows fed DMPU, DMPUM, and DMPUMH. Addition of slow-release urea to the DMP diet increased urinary urea-N excretion. Supplementation of RPMet increased plasma Met concentration but had no effect on milk production or composition. The DMPUMH increased DMI, milk true protein concentration and yield, and decreased milk fat concentration, compared to DMPUM. These results were in line with a previous study from A. N. Hristov\u2019s laboratory and suggested that His may have a positive effect on feed intake and milk production and composition in dairy cows fed MP-deficient diets.\nThe objective of the second experiment was to evaluate the effects of supplementing a reduced-protein diet [deficient in MP, based on NRC (2001)] with RPMet, rumen-protected Lys (RPLys), and RPHis, individually or combined, on the performance of lactating dairy cows. We hypothesized that supplementation of (1) RPHis may improve DMI, milk yield, and MPY; (2) RPMet, RPLys, or both may increase milk protein content and MPY; and (3) a combination of the 3 RPAA (Met, Lys, His) may further increase milk yield and MPY. The experiment was a 9-wk randomized complete block design with 72 Holstein cows. Following a 2-wk covariate period, cows were assigned to 1 of the following 6 treatments: MP-adequate diet (MPA), MP-deficient diet (MPD), MPD supplemented with RPMet (MPDM); (4) MPD supplemented with RPLys (MPDL); (5) MPD supplemented with RPHis (MPDH); and (6) MPD supplemented with RPMet, RPLys, and RPHis (MPDMLH). The MPD diet decreased DMI, yields of milk and milk components (fat, protein, lactose), energy-corrected milk (ECM), and feed efficiency, compared to MPA. Cows fed MPD had lower milk and plasma urea N and higher milk N efficiency compared to cows fed MPA. Supplementation of MPD with RPLys increased milk protein content. Addition of RPHis increased DMI and milk protein concentration. Supplementation of the 3 RPAA increased yields of milk fat, protein, and ECM and ECM feed efficiency. Cows fed MPD had lower blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration than cows fed MPA. Overall, data from this study confirmed our previous findings and suggested that His stimulates DMI and the combination of the 3 RPAA (Met, Lys, and His) has the potential to improve milk and milk component yields in dairy cows fed MP-deficient diets.\nThe objective of the third experiment was to investigate the effects of feeding a His-deficient diet on lactational performance and the endogenous His-reserves of dairy cows. We hypothesized that feeding a His-deficient diet may decrease DMI, yields of milk and/or milk components, BW gain, N efficiency, and the endogenous His-reserves (i.e., blood Hb and muscle His-dipeptides). Supplementation of the His-deficient diet with RPHis may alleviate these effects in dairy cows. The study was a 10-wk randomized complete block design with 24 Holstein cows. After a 2-wk covariate period, cows were assigned to a His-adequate diet (HAD) and His-deficient diet (HDD). At the end of the 10-wk experiment, HDD was supplemented with RPHis for an additional 9 d. The HDD diet decreased DMI, yields of milk, protein and lactose, ECM, and milk and plasma urea N, compared to HAD. Total-tract apparent digestibility of dry and organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber, and excretion of urinary N and urea N were decreased by HDD, compared to HAD. Concentrations of muscle His, plasma His and blood Hb were decreased by HDD compared to HAD, suggesting a supply of His from the endogenous reserves. The 9-d supplementation of HDD with RPHis increased DMI and ECM yield, compared to HDD. These results confirmed the findings of the two previous experiments that low dietary His supply impair DMI and yields of milk and milk protein in dairy cows. Supplementation of such diets with RPHis has the potential to reverse these effects.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12155], "author_name_tesi": "Giallongo, Fabio ", "last_name_ssi": "Giallongo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fabio", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexander N.

He poses it as a challenge to both egoism and altruism. If egoism motivates my response to another in need, then I never really depart from concern for my being. By contrast, altruism threatens the loss of my identity if it means the outright denial of myself for another. If I seek to maintain some sense of myself through my altruism, it is far from clear how I can motivate a denial of myself without at once affirming myself. Thus altruism does not resolve the problem raised by egoism but simply affirms my egoism. Egoism and altruism, then, are only apparently alternatives. They are built on the same model of personal identity, in which what the I gives to another returns to it. Such an economic exchange never departs from concern for my being. \n\nLevinas proposes in its place an account of identity in which the self is for another. That this is Levinas\u2019 central concern becomes clear in his second major work, Otherwise than Being, which is largely neglected by commentators who tend to confine themselves to his first, Totality and Infinity. One major consequence of my approach is that it establishes the basis on which Levinas breaks from a symmetrical account of justice in which all must be treated equally. That account maintains a model of identity built on self-reference and return to self, not self for another. Levinas\u2019 notion of justice preserves the ethical asymmetry he sees in the ethical relation.\n\nTwo pillars frame my reading. First is Levinas\u2019 engagement with anti-Semitic racism. Many commentators have neglected his early critique of the failed political responses of liberalism and Marxist communitarianism to Hitlerism and racial eugenics. From these critiques identity emerges as the problem and key that drives his ethics. I show how Levinas further refines his account of identity with Husserl\u2019s transcendental subjectivity and Heidegger\u2019s Dasein in mind. Second is Derrida\u2019s reading of Levinas\u2019 thought. His \u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d (1964) presents Levinas with certain philosophical challenges, which I read and explain through Husserl\u2019s phenomenology. This in part drives a change in Levinas\u2019 ethical language, argument, and exposition from his first to his second major work. Part of my challenge to commentators is that I place the largely ignored Otherwise than Being into dialogue with Totality and Infinity by showing how the former responds to Derrida. The task is to show how Levinas retrieves his earlier concerns about racism and identity and adapts them to reply to Derrida in Otherwise than Being.

The following questions were addressed in this study: What types of interactions do experienced teachers use most frequently and perceive as effective in the elementary music classroom? How do music teachers\u2019 sentiments (feelings) and norms (rules and expectations) affect the way they perceive interactions with students? How do music teachers perceive the effectiveness of planned musical interactions as compared to spontaneous musical interactions? Who do experienced teachers perceive as being the most frequently responsible for instigating and prolonging interactions during music class? Do observed classroom interactions with students reflect experienced teachers\u2019 perceptions of interactions?\nDescriptive data were collected in two phases. In Phase One, experienced elementary music teachers in Pennsylvania were surveyed about their perceptions of effective interactions in the elementary music classroom. In Phase Two, a sub-sample of three music teachers were each observed during an elementary music class. Following observations, the teachers were interviewed to reflect on their experiences teaching elementary music and to provide explanations about the teachers\u2019 perceptions of their interactions with students that may not have been answered through their responses to the questionnaire. \nResults indicated a preference for verbal interactions with students both when initiating instruction and when following through with reinforcement. Additional findings revealed that teachers felt positively about music classes and indicated students frequently met their expectations for both musical achievement and behavior. Teachers\u2019 expectations for music class had a strong influence on the way they planned for music learning interactions as well as the way they interacted with students in the moment. The teachers interviewed had high musical expectations for their classes, but felt this was communicated in a positive way. Although planned and spontaneous music learning interactions were both deemed effective, interviews revealed a strong preference for being consistent with their plans. Teachers perceived themselves as the most frequent initiators of both musical and non-musical interactions in class: a finding supported by observations and interviews of the three sub-sample participants. Finally, teachers\u2019 perceptions of classroom events as reported on the questionnaire were not entirely accurate when compared to observed classroom events.

Yet, this conformational plasticity often precludes the characterization of IDPs by traditional structural biology techniques. Advances in NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and small angle X-ray scattering presented here have enabled rigorous mechanistic studies of disordered proteins and regions, as exemplified by our investigation into the effects of multi-site phosphorylation on the structure and function of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II large subunit (CTD). We identify phosphorylation sites in the Drosophila melanogaster CTD that are targeted by the Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (DmP-TEFb). We show that phosphorylation occurs primarily at Ser5 residues and that Tyr1 is necessary this specificity. Importantly, we demonstrate that Ser5 phosphorylation induces highly sequence-specific conformational switches in the CTD, which tune the apparent activity of CTD-interacting factors, using the CTD phosphatase Ssu72-Symplekin as an example. These studies highlight how regulation of IDPs can be mediated through cryptic sequence features and establish a foundation for elucidating the molecular basis of CTD regulation.

The treatment of lung cancer often begins with the identification of a suspect region of interest (ROI) in multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) chest scans. Such suspicious ROIs may be lymph nodes, masses, infiltrates, or\nsolitary pulmonary nodules. The state-of-the-art process for assessing the ROIs involves off-line procedure planning in the three-dimensional (3D) MDCT image followed by videobronchoscopy. Unfortunately, the current bronchoscopic planning practice is a tedious, error-prone process, requiring significant effort by the physician. These difficulties have prompted physicians to call for automated solutions for the planning and guidance of bronchoscopic procedures.\n\nThis thesis presents the first complete approach for automatically planning bronchoscopic procedures.  In this paradigm, the only interaction required by the physician is the selection of ROI locations.  To find safe, appropriate routes to the ROIs, the planning methodologies account for physical, device, and anatomical constraints. The planning calculations are computationally efficient, fit smoothly within the clinical work flow, and produce routes that enable effective bronchoscopy.\n\nBecause our planning methods rely upon accurate patient-specific airway-tree models derived from the MDCT chest scan to find appropriate bronchoscopic routes through the airway tree, this thesis also presents improvements to the organ model that help enable effective route planning. We present methods to better segment the airway tree from the MDCT image and quantitatively measure the airway cross sections to determine the locations within the airway tree that are accessible by a videobronchoscope of a given diameter. A key improvement, which has allowed physicians to perform peripheral bronchoscopic\nprocedures deeper into the anatomy than ever before, is a new airway-tree surface-definition method. These polygonal airway surfaces are vital in the creation of image-based reports and in the live guidance of bronchoscopy to convey the patient's anatomy to the physician.\n\nResults demonstrate the efficacy of the planning systems and airway-tree model improvements.  Our automated planning data, when incorporated into a\nbronchoscopic guidance system, increased the effectiveness of peripheral bronchoscopic procedures in a phantom study. The performance of\nbronchoscopists of varying levels of experience increased from 43% under the standard practice, to 94% when following the routes of this thesis to ROIs within the phantom.\n\nOur planning and airway-tree model data has also been used in live human procedures. In this study, we demonstrate that the entire planning process,\nincluding the complete definition of the airway-tree model, can be completed in under 15 minutes, on average.  Using the planning and airway-tree model data of this thesis in image-based reports and in live bronchoscopic\nguidance, physicians have been able to reliably reach peripheral ROIs located deeper within the patient's anatomy than those reached using the best previously-existing manual planning practices.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2610], "author_name_tesi": "Gibbs, Jason David", "last_name_ssi": "Gibbs", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Evan Higgins", "Zhiwen Liu", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano", "Robert T Collins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Evan Higgins, Committee Chair", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano, Committee Member", "Robert T Collins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["image processing", "image-guided surgery", "virtual endoscopy", "bronchoscopy", "route planning"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Psychometric Indicators of Eating Behavior and Risk Factors Associated with Physiological Adaptations to the Female Athlete Triad in Exercising Women", "id": "18292", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8796", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Female Athlete Triad (Triad) is a syndrome of interrelated conditions (low energy availability (EA), menstrual disturbances (MD), and low bone mineral density (BMD)) that exist along a continuum from healthy to pathological clinical sequelae. The objectives of this dissertation were: (1) to examine the association between psychometric indicators of disordered eating behavior (high drive for thinness (DT) and dietary cognitive restraint (DR)) and physiological adaptations to chronic energy deficiency/low EA and MD in exercising women,  (2) to examine the changes in psychometric indicators of disordered eating behavior (DR, DT, body dissatisfaction (BD), and bulimia scores) during a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of increased energy intake in women with exercise-associated menstrual disturbances (EAMD) and exercising controls with EAMD and ovulatory cycles, and (3) to determine the risk for low BMD in association with individual and combined Triad risk factors. In Study One, we demonstrated that exercising women with high DT exhibited signs of chronic energy deficiency (suppressed resting energy expenditure (REE) controlled for lean body mass and ratio of measured REE compared to predicted REE) and a greater frequency of severe MD (oligo/amenorrhea) compared to women with normal DT. In Study Two, we demonstrated that exercising women with high DR had a lower EA and a greater frequency of subclinical/clinical MD than women with normal DR. However, there was no difference in frequency of low EA between groups. In Study Three, we demonstrated that refeeding did not exacerbate DR or have adverse effects on DT, BD, and bulimia scores in women with EAMD during a 6 month RCT. In Study Four, we showed a cumulative effect of Triad risk factors on BMD in a large sample of exercising women.  In conclusion, we demonstrated: (i) associations between high DT/DR and physiological adaptations to Triad disorders (MD and chronic energy deficiency/low EA) in exercising women, (ii) an RCT of increased energy intake combined with psychological and nutritional monitoring may have favorable outcomes for eating behavior, weight gain, and REE in exercising women with EAMD, and (iii) that exercising women with multiple Triad risk factors presented with a higher risk for low BMD.

High-pressure air, known as purge flow, is taken from the compressor and introduced beneath the platform to prevent the hot gas in the main gas path from entering into these cavities. It is desirable to minimize the amount of purge flow required to seal the cavities as it reduces engine output. To reduce purge requirements, a geometric feature called a rim seal is installed below the platform between the stationary and rotating airfoil rows. A rim seal consists of a series of overlaps that hot gas must negotiate in order to enter beneath the platform. Advances in rim seal design require spatially-resolved measurements in and around the seal to identify the mechanisms through which conditions in the main gas path affect hot gas ingress.\n\tThe current research presents spatially resolved measurements of ingress levels, endwall temperatures, and flowfields in and around a state of the art rim seal design in a linear cascade. Flowfield measurements show that the vane passage vortex and high velocities in the outer portions of the seal, called the trench region, reduce the cooling effect of the purge flow on the downstream blade endwall. High turbulence levels in the trench region thoroughly mix the purge flow and hot gas from the mainstream, resulting in minimal gradients in the endwall and thermal field. Steady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) predictions fail to capture this mixing and as a result over estimate sealing effectiveness.\n\tThe impact of the main gas path pressure field on hot gas ingress was studied by using an upstream vane row and bluff bodies downstream of the trench to model the pressure distortion of a rotating blade. Adding the bluff bodies introduced more hot gas into the trench and the seal. A parametric study of seal geometry showed that extending the axial overlap at the seal exit improved sealing and endwall cooling. Flowfield measurements indicated that the flow structures that caused hot gas to enter the baseline seal were mitigated by this modification. As a result, the purge flow entered the trench more uniformly and remained closer to the blade endwall. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11268], "author_name_tesi": "Gibson, Jeffrey Reed", "last_name_ssi": "Gibson", "middle_name_ssi": "Reed", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole", "Karen Ann Thole", "John Michael Cimbala", "Stephen P Lynch", "Robert Francis Kunz", "Daniel Connell Haworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Chair", "John Michael Cimbala, Committee Member", "Stephen P Lynch, Committee Member", "Robert Francis Kunz, Special Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rim Seal", "Hot Gas Ingress", "Cavity", "Flow field", "Sealing Effectiveness"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "FRACTAL ANALYSIS OF SOIL AGGREGATE STRUCTURES AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH ORGANIC CARBON", "id": "6578", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2965", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-12-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Between 1850 and 1998, the atmospheric carbon stock increased by about 174 Gt C, or 30%.  Recent investigations suggest that soils could sequester as much as 30% of this excess carbon.  One possible mechanism of soil carbon sequestration is the development of small soil aggregates (microaggregates) within larger aggregates, meaning that hierarchical soil structure may provide clues about the nature of soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics.  In this context, fractal theory is useful.  Specifically, a soil can be considered a fractal object whose pores obey a number-size power law (solid mass fractal) or whose particles and pores each obey number-size power laws (pore-solid fractal, or PSF).  In the first part of this study, soil aggregates (~3 mm in size) from the Hunter Rotation Experiment (HRE) at Rock Springs, PA were analyzed with computed tomography (CT) to obtain images of the undisturbed aggregate structures.  Objectives were to 1) compare the PSF and solid mass fractal models in representing aggregate structures, and 2) assess the sensitivity of derived fractal parameters to 2-D or 3-D image analysis.  Results showed that the solid mass fractal parameters were most reliable, and that fractal dimensions obtained from 2-D images were comparable to their 3-D counterparts.  This analytical approach was extended to aggregates of three different size classes, but no single fractal model could account for the trends observed in either of two soil types from the HRE.  In an effort to expand on the potential applications of the PSF model, a modified PSF model was created, accounting for SOM explicitly over time.  Out of many possible formulations, this model was developed because of its compatibility with our understanding of microaggregate formation.  Subsequent tests of the modified PSF model were successful, although few constraints exist for the input parameters.  If the model is accurate, it underscores the significance of the fractal parameter b, low values of which were associated with increased soil carbon storage.

The data set consisted of 108,633 first through fifth lactation records from 45,464 cows for yield, somatic cell score, days open, and productive life. Approximately half of the records also had observations for 18 linear type traits and 41,074 had observations for milking speed. Heritabilities and correlations amongst yield, fitness, and type traits were evaluated with 3-trait models in ASREML with fixed effects for lactation, age, and herd-calving cluster, and random effects for animal, permanent environment, and residual. The heritabilities of milk, fat, and protein yield were 0.30, 0.20, and 0.20, respectively. The heritabilities of productive life, days open, SCS, and milking speed were 0.11, 0.03, 0.12, and 0.26, respectively. Milk, fat, and protein yield had strong positive correlations with productive life (0.67 to 0.71), days open and SCS had strong negative correlations with productive life (-0.69 and -0.60, respectively), and milking speed had a positive correlation with productive life (0.26). All three yield traits were slightly unfavorably correlated with days open, but there was little relationship found between yield traits and SCS or milking speed. Correlations of body traits with yield and fitness traits tended to be small, though dairy form was positively correlated with yield (0.31 to 0.40) and negatively correlated with days open (0.36 to 0.67). Of the feet and leg traits, mobility was most favorably correlated with yield (0.26 to 0.27) and productive life (0.50). For udder traits, yield traits were positively correlated with rear udder height and rear udder width, ranging from 0.19 to 0.48, and negatively correlated with udder depth and fore udder attachment, ranging from -0.04 to -0.40. However, udder depth and fore udder attachment were more favorably correlated with SCS (-0.26 and -0.14, respectively) than rear udder height and rear udder width (-0.02 and 0.18, respectively). Productive life was most strongly correlated with fore udder attachment, rear udder width, udder depth, and rear udder height (0.44, 0.40, 0.35, and 0.33, respectively). Due to the importance of the relationship between udder traits with yield and fitness traits, an additional analysis was performed using the same data set to create an \u201cudder efficiency\u201d trait for Brown Swiss cows using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The DEA assigned units, individual cows in this case, with an efficiency measure ranging from 0 to 1 based on their ability to minimize inputs and maximize outputs relative to other cows in the same herd. The sole input was the inverse of milking speed and the outputs were defined as milk, fat, and protein yield, and the inverse of somatic cell score. The most efficient cows would be those that milked quickly and produced large volumes of milk, fat, and protein with a low somatic cell score. The 40,960 udder efficiency records were derived and evaluated using 3-trait ASREML models as previously described. The heritability of udder efficiency was estimated to be 0.23 \u00b1 0.0133. Genetic correlations with udder efficiency were positive and moderate for yield traits (0.40 to 0.42), favorable with SCS (-0.21), and strongly positive for milking speed (0.86). Udder efficiency was also strongly correlated with productive life (0.69). Of the udder traits, rear udder height (0.30), teat length (-0.28), fore udder attachment (0.25), and rear udder attachment (0.21) were most favorably correlated to udder efficiency. The correlation of udder depth with udder efficiency was 0.16. Based on these findings, DEA could be a useful and novel method for evaluating udder efficiency, helping to identify traits that enable selection for mastitis resistance without compromising yield.

Excessive char/ash deposition in convective coolers causes reduction in the heat transfer, both in the radiative (slagging) section and in the low-temperature convective (fouling) heating section. This can lead to unplanned shutdowns and result in an increased cost of electricity generation. CFD models for entrained flow gasification have used the average bulk coal composition to simulate slagging and ash deposition with a narrow particle size distribution (PSD). However, the variations in mineral (inorganic) and macerals (organic) components in coal have led to particles with a variation in their inorganic and organic composition after grinding as governed by their Particle Size Distribution (PSD) and mineral liberation kinetics. As a result, each particle in a PSD of coal exhibits differences in its conversion, particle trajectory within the gasifier, fragmentation, swelling, and slagging probability depending on the gasifier conditions (such as the temperature, coal to oxygen ratio, and swirling capacity of the coal injector). \nGiven the heterogeneous behavior of char particles within a gasifier, the main objective of this work was to determine boundary conditions of char particle adhering and/or rebounding from the refractory wall or a layer of previously adhered particles. In the past, viscosity models based on the influence of ash composition have been used as the method to characterize sticking. It is well documented that carbon contributes to the non-wettability of particles. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that viscosity models would not be adequate to accurately predict the adhesion behavior of char. Certain particle wall impact models have incorporated surface tension which can account the contributions of the carbon content to the adhesive properties of a char particle. These particle wall impact models also predict the coefficient of restitution (COR) which is the ratio of the rebound velocity to the impacting velocity (which is a necessary boundary condition for Discrete Phase Models). However, particle-wall impact models do not use actual geometries of char particles and motion of char particles due to gasifier operating conditions. This work attempts to include the surface geometry and rotation of the particles. \nTo meet the objectives of this work, the general methodology used for this work involved (1) determining the likelihood of particle becoming entrapped, (2) assessing the limitations of particle-wall impact models for the COR through cold flow experiments in order to adapt them to the non-ideal conditions (surface and particle geometry) within a gasifier, (3) determining how to account for the influence of the carbon and the ash composition in the determination of the sticking probability of size fractions and specific gravities within a PSD and within the scope of particle wall impact models, and (4) using a methodology that quantifies the sticking probability (albeit a criterion or parameter) to predict the partitioning of a PSD into slag and flyash based on the proximate analysis.\nIn this study, through sensitivity analysis the scenario for particle becoming entrapped within a slag layer was ruled out. Cold flow educator experiments were performed to measure the COR. Results showed a variation in the coefficient of restitution as a function of rebound angle due rotation of particles from the educator prior to impact.   The particles were then simply dropped in \u201cdrop\u201d experiments (without educator) to determine the influence of sphericity on particle rotation and therefore, the coefficient of restitution.  The results showed that in addition to surface irregularities, the particle shape and orientation of the particle prior to impacting the target surface contributed to this variation of the coefficient of restitution as a function of rebounding angle. Oblique particle impact measurements and images suggested the possibility of particles simultaneously rolling and sliding due to non-sphericity. \nCalculations also showed that the COR due to viscoelasticity is most sensitive. Therefore, the critical velocity was derived from a viscoelastic particle wall impact model based upon the yield strength and a variable termed the plastic loss factor. However, by setting the plastic loss factor equal to the COR, trivial solutions were obtained in the derivation of critical velocities where the COR had to equal zero in order for the particle to stick. Therefore, the damping ratio was set to a value of 1 to indicate critical damping while the COR was set to zero to independently solve for the plastic loss factor. By solving for the plastic loss factor, critical velocities were determined for particles in each specific gravity and size fraction used in this study. An alternative \u201crules based method\u201d based upon the contact angle and the temperature of critical velocity was also used to determine a sticking probability. With the exception of some of the larger size fractions, there was a better agreement between the sticking probabilities based on the critical velocities and the sticking probabilities calculated using the \u201crules-based-criteria\u201d than the \u201crules-based-criteria\u201d and the conventional model (in which only the temperature of critical velocity was used). Capture efficiencies of these particles were calculated using sticking probabilities and impact efficiencies. The range of values of the capture efficiencies determined through the rules-based-criteria were similar to the range of values reported in previous experimental work concerning ash and char deposition. \nConventional viscosity models only predicted a significant variation in the adhesion between particles of different specific gravities not particle sizes. By using the \u201crules-based-criteria\u201d, the influence of the particle size fractions was also discerned in addition to that of the specific gravities within the PSD. With the influence of unburnt carbon accounted for, the particles from \u201clighter\u201d specific gravity fractions (SG1 and SG2) among the largest size fractions contributed the most to the flyash whereas, the \u201cheavier\u201d specific gravity fractions (with the exception of SG4, SF1) contributed the most to the slag. Therefore, by reducing the largest size fractions and increasing the smallest size fractions, syngas increased incrementally, flyash decreased incrementally, and slag increased marginally.\n\tThis work has identified the importance of characterizing particle orientation due to rotational motion in all three Cartesian coordinates prior to impact in addition to characterizing simultaneous sliding and rotation in oblique impact for non-spherical particles. A sticking probability based on the critical velocity was developed to provide consistency between CFD models and an industrial friendly model to predict partitioning of slag and flyash. Based on the results of this model developed in this work, flyash was shown to be reduced by reducing the average particle size. In summary, the connection between the physics of char particles impacting the wall of a gasifier and their ash as well as carbon composition has been comprehensively investigated in this study. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9310], "author_name_tesi": "Gibson, La ", "last_name_ssi": "Gibson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "La", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Dr Yaw Yeboah", "Robert John Santoro", "Derek Elsworth", "Dr Lawrence Shadle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Chair", "Dr Yaw Yeboah, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Dr Lawrence Shadle, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coefficient of Restitution", "Gasification", "Critical Velocity", "Population Model", "Ash Deposition", "Sticking Probability"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Bereaved Daughters: Social Support, Turning Points, and Maintaining a Connection in Computer-mediated Communication", "id": "15094", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7467", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this study was to examine bereavement communication of motherless daughters on a weblog called \u201cMomless Daughter.\u201d I analyzed the blog in order to find the types of social support that are requested and provided, how daughters maintain a connection with their deceased mothers, and what turning points seemed salient to bereaved daughters.

Data for this analysis come  from the evaluation of the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families program (CCMHSCF) and the Area Resource File (ARF).  Our results suggest that among boys with attention problems, blacks and Hispanics were roughly 15 percent less likely to receive medication than whites (p<.001).  Among girls with attention problems, blacks were 12 percent less likely than whites to receive medication (p<.05).\nThe second and third studies examine sources of variation in inpatient care for youth with mental health and substance abuse problems using the Medicaid claims data from the Tennessee Impact Study.  The second study uses a Bayesian cross-classified multilevel model to examine determinants of inpatient length of stay.  Our results suggest that about 4 percent of the variation in LOS is explained at the patient-level while 42 percent is explained at the facility-level. These analyses also demonstrate that having a cross-classified data structure rather than a completely nested data structure improve the precision of our patient-level variance estimate by 84 percent.  The third study uses an multilevel event history model to examine determinants of receipt of follow-up services following discharge from an inpatient stay.  Our results suggest that relative to youth with mental health problems, the hazard of receiving aftercare services was 26 percent lower for youth with substance abuse problems.  Relatively little (9%) of the variation in aftercare services was determined at the facility level, and 16 percent was explained by patient and family characteristics.

UUVs are vehicles designed to execute specific tasks in an underwater environment, come in many shapes and sizes and are adaptable to many different applications. With the growing use of UUVs across the oil and gas industry, scientific ocean exploration, subsurface archeology, department of homeland security, and several branches of the military, planning a mission for a UUV, allocating tasks to individual vehicles, and re-planning certain objectives during a mission are all critical activities. Inefficiencies in any of these stages can hinder mission success. Even with current trends moving towards using multiple vehicles of different types (i.e., heterogeneous vehicles), problems encountered during mission planning and re-planning can be compounded. The research presented in this thesis is a step towards alleviating these problems by offering a set of tools to aid personnel during the mission planning and mission execution phases. These tools include a high-level UUV mission programming language (MPL), a supporting graphical interface, and a set of automated mission planning tools. The high-level MPL offers multi-vehicle support for groups of cooperating heterogeneous UUVs and the graphical interface allows personnel who are not familiar with the MPL to specify a mission without writing source code. The automated mission planning tools offer both single and multiple objective approaches for a group of heterogeneous UUVs utilizing heuristic, linear programming, and genetic based methods. Due to the harsh and unpredictable nature of UUV missions, there is also a dynamic mission re-planning tool that reassigns UUV tasks (either the tasks of a failed UUV or new tasks that arise) to other vehicles during mission execution. The end goal is to automate the process of both the mission planning phase and the mission re-planning phase. This will allow personnel to focus on the overall mission objective rather than worry about burdensome details such as assigning specific tasks to vehicles and the coordination of multiple vehicles, thus providing better utilization of vehicle resources and increase overall mission efficiency.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2025], "author_name_tesi": "Giger, Gary Fred", "last_name_ssi": "Giger", "middle_name_ssi": "Fred", "first_name_ssi": "Gary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Padma Raghavan", "David J Cannon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Dissertation Advisor", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "David J Cannon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Genetic Algorithms", "Multi-Objective", "unmanned vehicles", "UUV", "mission planning"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Ecology, habitat use, and winter thermal dynamics of snowshoe hares in Pennsylvania", "id": "28352", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12394", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Differences in biotic and abiotic characteristics can lead to geographic variation in the ecology of species and populations.

Home range overlap occurred frequently and I did not find that hares temporally partitioned their home ranges to minimize interaction with nearby hares. Also I trapped three snowshoe hares that exhibited uncharacteristic brown winter coat coloration, indicating potential differences in the winter molt patterns or color morphs.\nUsing locations collected from GPS collars I examined snowshoe hare seasonal habitat use at the stand-level and at fine-scale microhabitats. I determined that during both summer and winter hares preferred areas of mature scrub oak or conifers and avoided open habitats. At the population level, hares preferred areas with dense understory vegetation and high canopy coverage, although I found substantial individual variability in habitat preferences. My research highlights the importance of incorporating multiple scales of analysis into habitat use studies, as well as accounting for individual variation in habitat preferences. \nFinally, I investigated geographic differences in snowshoe hares\u2019 responses to winter temperatures by comparing winter pelage characteristics and heat production between hares in Pennsylvania and the Yukon, as well as investigated the influence of temperature on resting spot selection and movement rates. I found that hares from Pennsylvania had shorter and less dense winter coats than hares from the Yukon and that the Pennsylvania population had less visible white in their winter coats. Hares in the Pennsylvania population also produced less heat than the Yukon population, indicating a lower metabolic rate. Snowshoe hares did not select for resting spots that offered them thermal advantages, but selected locations providing visual obstruction from predators. Movement rates were associated with ambient temperature, with the lowest hourly movements occurs at the extreme high (>4 \u00baC) and low (<-10 \u00baC) ends of the temperature range. Results of this research support the suggestion that snowshoe hares have the ability to adapt to local climatic conditions via their pelage characteristics, metabolism and behavior.  \n Overall snowshoes hares in Pennsylvania exhibited differences in body condition, survival, home range sizes, winter pelage characteristics, and heat production than previously studied populations at northern latitudes, highlighting the importance of understanding southern populations in order to better describe range-wide patterns. In the face of potential changes in climate and habitat quality, recognizing potential range-wide variation in population dynamics will be critical for managing this species, as well as other species with large geographic ranges, in the future.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11762], "author_name_tesi": "Gigliotti, Laura Christine", "last_name_ssi": "Gigliotti", "middle_name_ssi": "Christine", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["snowshoe hare", "Pennsylvania", "body condition", "survival", "home range", "habitat use", "adaptation", "movement"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE RESPONSE OF REGENERATION TO OVERSTORY RETENTION IN HARVESTED MIXED-OAK STANDS\n\n", "id": "10376", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1037", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Long-term overstory retention after harvesting can affect regeneration development in harvested stands. The level of overstory retention influences the regeneration species composition and may decrease its growth and vigor through shade and resource competition. Retaining overstory trees in harvested stands may represent foregone economic opportunities, but serves other objectives, such as aesthetic, biodiversity, and wildlife habitat values. Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Conservation and Natural Resources developed and employs guidelines for long-term overstory retention in even-aged regeneration harvests. The individual selection and spatial arrangement of reserve trees is determined by each timber harvest prescription and typically does not produce a uniform distribution of overstory residuals. Because of this variability, regeneration growth may be differentially affected by the level of surrounding overstory retention. In this study, I examined the development of oak species, red maple, black birch, blackgum, and sassafras regeneration under a gradient of local residual overstory basal areas in 29 mixed-oak stands for the first six growing seasons after harvest. Three measures of regeneration development were used: height growth of the tallest 10% of regeneration per sample plot, change in aggregate plot height, and average height growth of the dominant seedlings in a plot. Additional variables influencing regeneration development were included: site, initial condition of regeneration, and percentage cover of other vegetation. Linear regression models were used to determine the significance of residual basal area and other variables on species-specific regeneration development. Overstory retention had a minimal negative influence on the development of most non-oak species and was not the most important factor limiting the development of most oak species. With moderate levels of overstory retention in harvested stands, oak regeneration may benefit from their intermediate shade tolerance if suitable site and initial conditions are met. However, regeneration development of most species was most influenced by site conditions and the condition of regeneration after harvest. I also found that the growth of residual red oaks and chestnut oaks increased after harvest, suggesting that even slow growing trees respond to the release from harvest. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1027], "author_name_tesi": "Gilbert, Carrie Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Gilbert", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Carrie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kim C Steiner", "Kim C Steiner", "Eric Zenner", "James Craig Finley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kim C Steiner, Thesis Advisor", "Kim C Steiner, Thesis Advisor", "Eric Zenner, Thesis Advisor", "James Craig Finley, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["overstory retention", "pennsylvania forests", "oak regeneration"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Collaboration in Information Technology within the Committee on Institutional Cooperation\n", "id": "17438", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8374", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study is motivated by the increased scholarly interest in collaboration within higher education, as well as the specific rise of Information Technology (IT) collaboration as an organizational strategy. Existing research on IT collaborations has left several openings for additional work, namely, an investigation of the factors that IT leaders consider when deciding to pursue a collaboration, the relative weight that is placed on costs and benefits, and whether these calculations have changed based on the altered nature of higher education since the economic crisis of 2008.\n\nThis dissertation is a case study focused on Information Technology collaboration within an existing academic consortium: the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC). Specifically, this study explores attitudes and practices related to institutional collaboration among Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and other IT leaders within the consortium to determine why collaboration is\u2014or is not\u2014pursued, what happens when a collaboration begins, and how collaboration is viewed by CIOs. Using semi-structured interviews and participant questionnaires, this study sought to answer three primary research questions:\n\n1.\tHow do IT leaders view the idea of collaboration?\n2.\tTo what extent and with whom have institutions pursued inter- or intra-institutional collaborations?\n3.\tHow and why do IT leaders make decisions about whether or not to engage in collaborative activities?\n\nOverall, it does not appear that any one factor determines whether and how IT leaders collaborate on either an intra- or inter-institutional basis. Rather, there is a complex decision making process occurring that is not fully clear. The level of interest in collaboration, the perceived benefits of it, and the actual instances discussed differed widely amongst participants. This study presents a conceptual framework for understanding the primary factors IT leaders identified as influencing their decision making about collaboration. The Information Technology Collaboration Framework (ITCF) is a visual representation of the potential influence of factors IT leaders consider when making decisions about engagement in an intra- or inter-institutional collaboration. Additionally, rather than supporting a rational model conception of collaboration leveraged in past work, the findings indicate that decision making for IT leaders in the study is a matter of individual context and perspective more appropriate to a situated decision making approach. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8290], "author_name_tesi": "Gilbert, Claire Krendl", "last_name_ssi": "Gilbert", "middle_name_ssi": "Krendl", "first_name_ssi": "Claire", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kimberly Griffin", "Kimberly Griffing", "John Thomas Harwood", "Dorothy H Evensen", "Aaron Wachhaus", "Roger Lewis Geiger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kimberly Griffin, Dissertation Advisor", "Kimberly Griffing, Committee Chair", "John Thomas Harwood, Committee Member", "Dorothy H Evensen, Committee Member", "Aaron Wachhaus, Committee Member", "Roger Lewis Geiger, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Collaboration", "Information Technology", "Higher Education", "Case Study"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Stimulation Rate on the Elicited Stapedius Response in Cochlear Implants\n", "id": "8734", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1546", "abstract_tesi": "Several weeks post-surgery, cochlear implant recipients must undergo diagnostic tests to determine an appropriate dynamic range for the device. With FDA approval for children as young as 12 months eligible as recipients, objective measures are essential for establishing the upper and lower limits of perceived sound intensity. The electrical stapedius reflex (ESR), measured by impedance changes in the eardrum, has been shown to have a strong correlation with user-defined maximum acceptable loudness thresholds. Unfortunately, the widespread application of the ESR to implant fitting and assessment has been limited in part due to undetectable reflexes, the cumbersome nature of the test, and difficulty in obtaining reliable responses in active young children. We propose an alternative technique to circumvent some of these limitations based on stapedius muscle electromyogram (stEMG) recordings.\n\nThis study uses our previously developed rat animal model for obtaining and evaluating the stEMG elicited by cochlear implants. Tungsten bipolar microwire electrodes were placed near the stapedius, and stEMG potentials (up to 500 &#956;V peak) were obtained and analyzed to characterize threshold and latency properties. Of particular focus was the influence of stimulation rate on the stapedius response in rats (N=6) implanted with cochlear implants. A noticeable decrease in threshold occurred for each rise in rate up to 1000 pps at which point the threshold current required for stapedius contraction remained the same for subsequent increases (up to 4000 pps). Signal decay for rates greater than 250 pps hint at short-term neural adaptation. Response latency decreased monotonically over all rates evaluated.\n\nThe results offer important insight into the temporal integration of, and adaptation to, electrical stimulation in the auditory pathway through objective electrophysiological measures. These findings could be used to develop more effective diagnostic algorithms to identify stapedius response thresholds in children. Future studies aim to directly compare tympanic impedance changes to stEMG activity, as well as recording the responses with implant telemetry to establish a new means for more efficient fitting of cochlear implants.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1530], "author_name_tesi": "Gilbert, Daniel Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Gilbert", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ryan S Clement"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ryan S Clement, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["neural interfacing", "cochlear implants", "objective fitting", "stapedius"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Analogues of Stanley's Theorem and Elder's Theorem in Odd Partitions and Distinct Partitions", "id": "13749", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7132", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis derives a number of partition identities in the sets of odd partitions and distinct partitions, while at the same time providing a comprehensive account of the results from unrestricted partitions that motivate this work.  The key ideas of this thesis are introduced in Chapter 1, and the remaining three chapters are divided into two parts.\n\nChapters 2 and 3 are an exposition of known identities in the set of traditional, unrestricted integer partitions. Chapter 2 presents the numerous direct proofs given in the 1970's and 1980's for the results known as Stanley's Theorem, Elder's Theorem, and Solomon's Corollary. Chapter 3 highlights how these results were actually established by Nathan Fine well over a decade prior to any other proof; and we see how Fine's work, which is much more general than any other approach, was more prolific than any of the other methods.\n\nIn Chapter 4, we establish analogues of the previously mentioned identities in the sets of odd partitions and distinct partitions. The primary result is that the partial sums of the total number of times j appears in distinct partitions of 1,\u2026, n - 1, and n is equal to the number of parts which appear at least j times in the odd partitions of n, n \u2013 1,\u2026, n - j + 1. This result is verified both combinatorially and with generating functions, demonstrating once again that odd partitions and distinct partitions are closely related. A second theorem establishes that the number of times an odd part j appears in the odd partitions of n is equal to the number of parts that occur at least j times in the odd partitions of n and n - j. Both of these results lead to a number of corollaries.\n\nAppendix A provides a gentle introduction to the theory of integer partitions and will be useful for those who wish to reacquaint themselves with the subject matter.

The design of the study was descriptive and correlational in nature. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods were used. A combined reliability coefficient of alpha = .76 was obtained through the use of a pilot study conducted during two 4-H community club meetings. Five panelists, with expertise in various areas of youth development and survey instrument development, reviewed the questionnaire to establish face and content validity. Using a purposive sampling procedure, a survey questionnaire was distributed to all (N=214) 4-H members attending the 2008 Pennsylvania 4-H State Leadership Conference. Responses were received from 86 members for a response rate of 40%. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the factors that affected the 4-H members&#8223; involvement. Traditional qualitative research methodologies were used to collect and triangulate data. The researcher used documented methods of transferability (thick description and purposive sample) and credibility (triangulation and peer debriefing) to establish trustworthiness. Qualitative data was collected from three open-ended questions that were included at the conclusion of each section. The responses from the open-ended questions were analyzed and categorized. The emergent themes were then reported and conclusions were drawn on the implications of the results. The data was then triangulated by comparing the qualitative data to the relative quantitative data.\nThe major findings of the study were as follows: 1) Youth are more influenced to join 4-H, by parents and 4-H leaders than by siblings and friends; 2) The top five reasons why youth at the 4-H State Leadership Conference joined 4-H are; because I wanted to work with animals, because it [4-H] looked like a fun organization, because I was interested in the projects offered, to develop leadership skills, and to become a leader; 3) The Pennsylvania 4-H members that\nattended the State Leadership Conference are experiencing challenging tasks and responsibilities often or very often within their respective clubs; 4) Many 4-H members are heavily involved in extracurricular activities at school, hold a job, or are simply needed to help take care of their families and therefore lack the extra time to participate in 4-H activities; 5) A 4-H members&#8223; participation is influenced by different factors from one 4-H curricular area to the next; 6) Lack of sufficient information about 4-H activities limits 4-H member&#8223;s participation; 7) The cost of participating in certain 4-H events or activities limits some 4-H members&#8223; ability to be involved; 8) Parents who were former 4-H members highly influence their children to be involved in 4-H; 9) The younger the members were when they joined 4-H the more likely they are to become involved in activities above the club level; 10) The younger the individuals are when they enrolled in 4-H the more likely they were to have been influenced by their siblings and their family&#8223;s involvement in 4-H; 11) Serving as a club officer allows 4-H members to lead others and plan 4-H activities; 12) Members whose parents were 4-H alumnus, tended to be more influenced by their parents and more likely to be involved with community service projects. Recommendations include the completion of a similar study using a stratified random sample of Pennsylvania 4-H members, ages 13-18, to allow for more generalizations to be made about the Pennsylvania 4-H membership. Additionally, a study to determine why youth drop out of 4-H between the ages of thirteen and eighteen should also be completed. Following the completion of the studies, recruitment/retention guides should be created that outline techniques of recruitment/retention. The recruitment/retention guides should then be distributed to Pennsylvania 4-H extension educators and local 4-H leaders to assist in recruiting and retaining teenage 4-H members.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [667], "author_name_tesi": "Gill, Bart Eugene", "last_name_ssi": "Gill", "middle_name_ssi": "Eugene", "first_name_ssi": "Bart", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Ewing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Ewing, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["4-H"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Newton-Krylov Methods for the Solution of the k-Eigenvalue Problem in Multigroup Neutronics Calculations\n\n", "id": "10162", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1391", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this work we propose using Newton's method, specifically the inexact Newton-GMRES formulation, to solve the k-eigenvalue problem in both transport and diffusion neutronics problems. This is achieved by choosing a nonlinear function whose roots are the eigenpairs of the k-eigenvalue calculation and then using Newton's method to solve the nonlinear system. The flexibility resulting from the use of a Krylov subspace method to solve the linear Newton step can be further extended via the use of the Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) approximation, which requires no knowledge of the system's Jacobian; instead only the ability to evaluate the system residual is necessary. This makes it possible to avoid the computational and memory costs associated with the construction and storage of the Jacobian, resulting in an efficient solution algorithm. Writing the k-eigenvalue problem as a nonlinear function yields a number of formulations, all of which all have the desired roots.\n\nFor the diffusion approximation, the nonlinear function is written in the form of the generalized eigenvalue problem and a set of preconditioners is developed and applied to the GMRES iterations that are used to solve the linearized Newton problem. Most of the developed methods can be implemented as either Newton-Krylov (NK) methods, where the Jacobian-vector product is formed using the explicitly constructed Jacobian, or via the JFNK approximation, where a finite-difference perturbation is used to approximate the Jacobian-vector product. One particularly effective preconditioning option comprises the use of the standard power iteration to precondition the GMRES iteration on either the right or the left. Preconditioning on the left, denoted JFNK(PI), results in a modified nonlinear system whose implementation only requires the ability to perform a single traditional outer iteration, making this approach relatively simple to wrap around an existing diffusion theory k-eigenvalue problem solver. Other preconditioning options, such as the Incomplete Cholesky decomposition of the within-group diffusion matrix, are also considered.\n\nSimilar methods were developed for transport theory, cast using an operator notation that greatly simplifies their presentation. All of the nonlinear functions developed are written in terms of a generic fixed-point iteration, with a number of specific fixed-point formulations considered. Each fixed-point scheme represents a viable k-eigenvalue problem solution method, with two of the techniques corresponding to traditionally used iterative schemes. The new methods developed can also be wrapped around existing software in most instances, simplifying the implementation process. Ultimately it is seen that the most effective of the Newton formulations in transport theory is wrapped around a k-eigenvalue formulation that is a very special instance of traditional methods: no upscattering iterations are performed, only one inner iteration completed per outer, using source iteration with the previous outer iterate as the initial guess. This results in a fixed-point iteration that collapses the three possible iteration levels (outer iterations, upscattering iterations, inner iterations) into a single level of iteration. While this formulation of the k-eigenvalue problem converges very slowly if solved as a traditional fixed-point iteration, when coupled with Newton's method it results in very inexpensive Jacobian-vector products.\n\nIn the Newton approach an extra degree of freedom is introduced by including the eigenvalue as an unknown, meaning an additional relation is necessary to close the system. In the diffusion theory case a normalization condition on the eigenvector was generally used, however in transport theory a number of so-called constraint relations were considered. These fall into two categories: normalization relations and eigenvalue update formulations. It was observed that the most effective of these constraint relations is the fission-rate eigenvalue update, derived directly from the eigenvalue update formula traditionally used to solve the k-eigenvalue problem.\n\nNumerical results, including measured performance quantified in number of iterations and execution time, were generated for suites of benchmark problems using the various Newton's Method formulations for the k-eigenvalue problem in both transport and diffusion theories. These results showed that the choice of the perturbation parameter in the JFNK approximation has very little impact on the calculation while the choice of GMRES stopping criterion significantly affects the total cost of the calculation. The size of the GMRES subspace and the maximum number of restarts permitted were also seen to play an important role in the cost of a calculation. While the diffusion formulations showed little sensitivity to the initial guess of the Newton iterations, the transport formulations were seen to potentially diverge or converge to a non-fundamental mode if a poor initial guess was used. This behavior was avoided by performing a single traditional fixed-point iteration prior to initializing Newton's method.\n\nOverall, the numerical results showed that the Newton formulation of the k-eigenvalue problem in diffusion theory is competitive with the Chebyshev accelerated power iteration, with the JFNK(PI) formulation generally resulting in quicker execution times. The transport results showed that a number of the Newton formulations developed result in methods that are significantly less computationally expensive than traditional techniques. Results for the well-known C5G7-MOX benchmark problem demonstrate that the Newton approach reduces by a factor of 5 the total number of sweeps necessary to converge the point-wise fission source error to 10E-4. The numerical results generated in this work show that the Newton approach is superior to existing techniques for both transport and diffusion calculations. Furthermore the  newly developed methods have been formulated in such a way that they can be implemented as wrappers around existing code sections, requiring little access and modification to existing code, where the computational kernel  is typically some variation of a traditional outer iteration. Based on these results, it is plausible that more advanced (via numerical optimization and acceleration techniques) implementations of these approaches could prove to be more efficient than the methods currently used to solve the k-eigenvalue problem in production-level software.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1380], "author_name_tesi": "Gill, Daniel Fury", "last_name_ssi": "Gill", "middle_name_ssi": "Fury", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yousry Azmy", "Yousry Azmy", "Seungjin Kim", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov", "Robert I Grove", "Brian Aviles"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yousry Azmy, Dissertation Advisor", "Yousry Azmy, Committee Chair", "Seungjin Kim, Committee Chair", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov, Committee Member", "Robert I Grove, Committee Member", "Brian Aviles, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["JFNK", "Criticality", "Neutron transport", "eigenvalue"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Essays on the Causal Analysis of Strategic Marketing Actions", "id": "14069msg226", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14069", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In my dissertation, I empirically study managerially relevant questions pertaining to strategic marketing actions using causal econometric framework and observational or quasi experimental data.

Furthermore, membrane geometry has recently been shown to regulate biological activity and determines the final cellular localization of some proteins. The aim of this thesis is to provide structural and molecular insights into the mechanism governing membrane geometry induction and recognition.\nSpoVM is a small peptide that was recently found to recognize and preferentially localize to the slightly curved outer surface of the forespore (diameter of curvature, R, ~1 \u03bcm) during Bacillus subtilis spore development. However, little was known about how this was accomplished. We determined that the SpoVM molecule adopted an atypical amphipathic helical structure in bilayer-like bicelles and that the helix is deeply embedded into the membrane. Our study challenges the current accepted model, which is based on circular dichroism and biochemical data, and provides structural support that SpoVM uses a new molecular mechanism to sense small membrane curvature.\nRecent studies have linked protein intracellular trafficking to human diseases. In Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD), a type I membrane protein referred to as LR11 (SorLA) is a key regulator of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) trafficking. LR11 diverts APP away from amyloidogenic processing to A\u03b2 peptides. The accumulation of A\u03b2 in the brain is generally accepted as the primary cause of AD. We discovered a membrane proximal amphipathic \u03b1-helix in LR11 C-terminal domain and, moreover, this helix deforms the membrane mimic liposomes.

Data were drawn from the Gender & HIV Study, a longitudinal study of college students. Students completed surveys during their first, second, and third semesters at college. At Time 1 (N = 434), participants\u2019 ages ranged from 17.5 to 19.8 years (M = 18.5; SD = 0.4; 52% female). Thirty two percent identified as African American, 29% as Latino American, and 39% as European American. The first paper examined body size perceptions, and demonstrated the importance of weight status, gender, and ethnicity in these perceptions. Contrary to popular belief, women did not tend to see their size as larger than independent observers did. In the second paper, open-ended questions, coded for content, were used to assess participants\u2019 perceptions of messages about physical appearance from family, peers, school, and media. The most common messages they perceived related to the importance/non-importance of appearance, positive remarks about their appearance, and the association between attractiveness and success. Women perceived more frequent and more negative messages than did men. Additionally, the family was perceived to convey more health-focused messages, whereas the media was perceived to convey more superficial messages about appearance. The third paper takes a longitudinal approach to understanding body image development across the college transition. Results indicated relative stability in most aspects of body image. However, women (but not men) became more satisfied with their overall appearance, in spite of a slight increase in their body size. There were no ethnic differences in body image development. Gendered personality traits emerged as predictors of body image development, although associations were fairly small. Taken together, findings indicate that emerging adult women experience greater body image disturbance than do men. However, women do feel more positive about their appearance as they progress through college. The relatively few ethnic differences suggest that sharing a common ecological context during this time may promote more similar views of appearance among students from different ethnic backgrounds. Implications for future work on body image in emerging adulthood are discussed within each paper.     \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4245], "author_name_tesi": "Gillen, Meghan M.", "last_name_ssi": "Gillen", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Meghan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eva Sharon Lefkowitz", "Leann L Birch", "Linda L Caldwell", "Eric Loken", "Susan Marie Mc Hale"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eva Sharon Lefkowitz, Committee Chair", "Leann L Birch, Committee Member", "Linda L Caldwell, Committee Member", "Eric Loken, Committee Member", "Susan Marie Mc Hale, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["college students", "emerging adulthood", "body image"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "\"You Never Undo that Promise to Yourself\": Identities and agency in an anti-bias, interactive theatrical troupe\n", "id": "11678", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5569", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\tIdentity, self, or voice are not fixed once-and-for-all, not static achievements, but are always in play, in process of becoming, in being achieved, broken, slipping apart, and being reconstructed as several and multiple \u2013 sometimes coherent and sometimes in contradiction.

It first establishes the need for anti-bias work in the schools, and then examines the ethical pedagogical work of an exceptional African-American teacher, the founder and mentor of the Tolerance Troupe to address it.  Second, it looks at the students' Troupe experience as it shapes student-actors and Troupe alumni's stances and self-making through a community of practice, shaping identities, choices, and discourses.  Last, it seeks to reveal ways this theatrical experience teaches and how and what its student-actors learn.  I suggest that student awareness deepens from improvisation and practice at identification with multiple roles, as the actors create opportunities to see the constructedness of bias, of identities, and of rationalizations associated with these narratives and behaviors, turning theatrical play into an avenue of agency and hope. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5560], "author_name_tesi": "Gilman, Sharlene Elinor", "last_name_ssi": "Gilman", "middle_name_ssi": "Elinor", "first_name_ssi": "Sharlene", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick Willard Shannon", "Patrick Willard Shannon", "Gail Louise Boldt", "Jamie Myers", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick Willard Shannon, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Chair", "Gail Louise Boldt, Committee Member", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["African American teachers", "Boal", "activist theatre", "performing arts", "tolerance", "adolescent identity", "anti-bullying activism", "bullying", "secondary performing arts", "adolescent leadership"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "How serotonin system alterations influence emotion- and cognition-related behaviors", "id": "19039", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9077", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation describes research aimed at understanding how changes in brain serotonin neurotransmission influence the expression of emotion- and cognition-related behavior in mice. The serotonin-depleting effects of a novel serotonin synthesis inhibitor, PEPA, were studied in adult and postnatal mice. The effects of PEPA were compared to those resulting from administration of PCPA, which has been in use since the 1960s. Reductions in serotonin were induced during the early postnatal period in mice constitutively deficient in serotonin transporter (SERT) expression. Decreased brain serotonin levels resulting from exposure to PEPA, but not PCPA, from P4-P21 normalized increased adult anxiety-related behavior in female mice constitutively lacking SERT, presumably by reversing elevated extracellular serotonin levels during this key developmental period. Postnatal PEPA vs. PCPA had a number of other differential effects on adult social behavior and spatial learning and memory. In addition, the interactions between kappa opioid receptor (\u03baOR) activation and differential SERT expression on dysphoria in adult mice was investigated. Dysphoria is a core component of mood disorders, in which changes in serotonin neurotransmission have been implicated. Conditioned place aversion to a \u03baOR agonist was observed in mice lacking SERT, calling into question the requisite nature of SERT in mechanisms of kappa-mediated dysphoria. Throughout this dissertation research, drug doses and behavioral testing conditions were investigated to characterize and to improve methodologies. Investigations building on the foundation provided by this research will provide information on the roles of serotonin during developmental periods as they pertain to the expression of emotion- and cognition-related behaviors. Future studies will also be aimed at understanding how the serotonin system influences, and is modulated by, the \u03baOR system to influence anxiety- and mood-related behavior.

A powerful approach to examining the neural basis of memory is electrophysiological recording of neural activity during the learning process.  The experiments in this dissertation use single-site and multi-site electrophysiological recordings to examine neuronal activity during trace fear classical conditioning.  Trace fear conditioning is a hippocampus-dependent task that requires a subject to associate a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) and an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) that are separated by several seconds.  The first two studies in this dissertation examine single neuron activity in two important learning structures during trace fear conditioning.  These studies show that neurons in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) exhibit patterns of activity specific to learning and that the activity in each site may serve distinct but complementary roles in the acquisition of trace fear conditioning.  The complementary activity in these sites suggests that these structures interact to encode a memory.  Chapter 4 examines the field activity of populations of neurons simultaneously in the hippocampus and mPFC during trace fear conditioning.  Chapter 4 also examines activity in the amygdala, a third important site in this learning network.  These multi-site recordings show that the hippocampus and mPFC exhibit coordinated activity throughout training and that the hippocampus and amygdala exhibit coordinated activity late in training.  Using various electrophysiological recording approaches, this dissertation suggests that the hippocampus, mPFC, and amygdala coordinate during different phases of the learning process to encode the CS-US association.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4301], "author_name_tesi": "Gilmartin, Marieke Rene", "last_name_ssi": "Gilmartin", "middle_name_ssi": "Rene", "first_name_ssi": "Marieke", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Mc Echron", "Kevin Douglas Alloway", "Barry R Dworkin", "Patricia Sue Grigson", "Ralph Norgren", "Xiaorui Tang", "Qing X Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Mc Echron, Committee Chair", "Kevin Douglas Alloway, Committee Member", "Barry R Dworkin, Committee Member", "Patricia Sue Grigson, Committee Member", "Ralph Norgren, Committee Member", "Xiaorui Tang, Committee Member", "Qing X Yang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["medial prefrontal cortex", "hippocampus", "heart rate conditioning", "single neuron recording", "amygdala"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Signal Processing Applications to Electrophysiology of Continuous Dopaminergic Stimulation Therapy in Preclinical Parkinson's Disease Models", "id": "13877", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7084", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately four million people worldwide and is characterized by progressive motor and non-motor disability and loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra.  Pharmacological therapy has traditionally been the most common treatment for PD, although it usually loses effectiveness and causes motor complications within 5 to 10 years.  Newer therapies such as cell transplantation hold promise for better long-term treatment of PD, although some problems in early clinical transplant trials have underscored that more research is needed before cell transplantation becomes a widespread treatment for PD.  \nThis dissertation investigates the electrophysiological correlates of dopaminergic cell transplant therapy in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned hemiparkinsonian (HP) rats and compares these effects to those of levodopa in HP rats and in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treated monkeys. Novel signal processing applications of multiscale autoregressive with exogenous input (MS-ARX) modeling and transfer entropy are developed to more accurately measure the connectivity changes between the cortical electroencephalogram and the subthalamic nucleus local field potentials in normal, HP, and grafted animals. Additionally a new principal component analysis (PCA)-based sleep-scoring method is described and validated.\nFive primary results are described.  First, intermittent levodopa administration does not normalize PD basal ganglia burst firing, whereas graft-provided continuous dopaminergic stimulation in the basal ganglia does normalize it.  Second, non-synapsing basal ganglia grafts provide the same electrophysiological normalization as synapsing basal ganglia grafts.  Third, transfer entropy is a more sensitive non-linear measure of connectivity between the cortex and the basal ganglia in parkinsonism; and MS-ARX modeling is useful for the study of basal ganglia dysfunction. Fourth, PCA sleep scoring is a useful tool for general sleep analysis, and confirms sleep structure differences between normal and HP rats. Fifth, awake chronic recordings from transplanted HP rats show that striatal dopaminergic grafts partially normalize the aberrant HP subthalamic LFP coherence abnormalities and the cortico-subthalamic transfer entropy.\nThese results indicate that basal ganglia dopaminergic cell grafts can provide unique electrophysiological normalization, that a new plasticity model is needed to explain basal ganglia PD pathophysiology, and that basal ganglia grafts are worth investigating further as a PD treatment with good potential to provide symptomatic relief while avoiding drug-induced side effects.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7076], "author_name_tesi": "Gilmour, Timothy ", "last_name_ssi": "Gilmour", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thyagarajan Subramanian", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Thomas Wichmann", "David Carl Swanson", "Vishal Monga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thyagarajan Subramanian, Dissertation Advisor", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Chair", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Member", "Thomas Wichmann, Special Member", "David Carl Swanson, Committee Member", "Vishal Monga, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Parkinson's Disease", "Cell Transplantation", "Signal Processing", "Transfer Entropy", "FVM", "RPE", "Levodopa", "6-OHDA", "Bursts"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Multiple-context assessment of suicidal ideation, depression, and substance use among African American adolescents\n\n\n", "id": "7798", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6156", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Studies have shown that depression, substance use, and suicidality are highly correlated, and suicidal ideation has been found to be predictive of later suicide attempts and completions.

A purposive cluster sampling design was used to select 611 ninth grade students from each of three selected zoned high schools in a mid-size city.

First, the point prevalence of significant depressive symptoms as measured by the study was almost twice the national prevalence as reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Secondly, the results indicated that the multidimensional measure of suicidal ideation had higher predictive validity than the single-item measure and that a higher proportion of ideators were identified by the multiple-item measure than the single-item measure.  Also, depressive symptoms were predicted by gender, community rewards for prosocial involvement, and attachment to neighborhood.  \nThis work contributes to the body of information regarding African American adolescent mental health in particular.

Neonate survival rates are influenced by maternal care, site-specific differences, and are generally characterized by year-to-year variation. Sources of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fawn mortality across North America include predation, natural causes (excluding predation), and both direct and indirect human-caused mortality. The relative frequency of these causes indicates which sources most affect neonate survival and can be easily compared among studies. We used a meta-analysis approach to elucidate spatial patterns in fawn survival at a landscape-scale across North America. However, comparing survival rates across time is not possible when confounded by spatial variation. Therefore, we investigated how fawn survival varied across time by conducting a neonate survival study in central Pennsylvania to compare a current estimate of neonate survival to previous estimates for central Pennsylvania in 2000\u20132001. Furthermore, because pre-weaned neonates (<3 months of age) are entirely dependent upon maternal care, maternal behaviors can explain variation in neonate survival rates from year-to-year. The cost, size, and weight of current bio-logging technologies (e.g. global positioning system (GPS) collars) often limit their ability to monitor mother-offspring behavior, even for large herbivores. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the performance of a behavioral monitoring bio-logger and detail temporally dynamic patterns of maternal behaviors in white-tailed deer. \n We conducted a meta-analysis of white-tailed deer fawn survival to identify patterns in survival and cause-specific mortality related to landscape characteristics, predator communities, and deer population density. We used fawn survival and cause-specific mortality data from 29 populations in 16 states across North America from studies that reported a survival rate to 3\u20136 months of age, sample sizes, landscape descriptions, and cause-specific mortality. We modeled the relationship of fawn survival to percentage of agricultural land cover and deer density. We detected fawn survival increased as the percentage of agricultural land cover increased. We classified cause-specific mortality as human-caused, natural (excluding predation), and predation according to agriculturally dominated, forested, and mixed (i.e., approximately equal parts agriculture and forest) landscapes. Predation was the greatest source of mortality in all three landscape types. Mixed landscapes had greater proportions of human-caused mortalities, and less mortality due to predators, when compared to forested landscapes but not when compared to agricultural landscapes. The proportion of natural deaths was similar among mixed, forested, and agricultural landscapes even though overall mortality rates differed. We failed to detect any relationship between fawn survival and deer density. \nSince 2000\u20132001, surveillance of wildlife populations suggest varying densities of deer, black bear, and coyote populations across Pennsylvania. We assessed differences in current estimates of white-tailed deer neonate survival rates and cause-specific mortality from 2015 to 2016 in central Pennsylvania to estimations reported during 2000\u20132001. We collared neonates in 2015\u20132016 and monitored survival until 34-weeks of age, mortality, or transmitter failure. We captured 55 neonates in north-central Pennsylvania and 43 neonates in central Pennsylvania. At 26 weeks after capture current fawn survival was 0.504 (95% CI = 0.337 \u2013 0.621) in an 88% forested landscape in northcentral Pennsylvania and 0.708 (95% CI = 0.569\u20130.848) in central Pennsylvania that contained approximately 15% more agricultural land cover. In 2000, 26-week survival estimates were 0.456 (95% CI = 0.360 \u2013 0.556) in northcentral Pennsylvania and 0.586 (95% CI = 0.488 \u2013 0.677) in central Pennsylvania.  We failed to detect any long-term change in fawn survival rates or predator abundances in the areas designated as Wildlife Management Units by the Pennsylvania Game Commission that surrounded our study areas.  \nNeonates have the most variable survival in large herbivore species and maternal care influences early survival. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the performance of a behavioral monitoring bio-logger (separation sensor) and documented temporally dynamic patterns of maternal behaviors in white-tailed deer. We monitored the behaviors of 5 mother-fawn pairs including 3 sets of twins from parturition until fawn mortality or censorship resulting in 5 mothers with 8 total fawns. Given our limited sample size, our ability to discuss the factors that influence maternal behavior is limited; however, we demonstrated the ability of this technology to effectively study maternal behaviors. Using the separation sensor, mothers with twins increased the amount of time spent near their fawn immediately after monitoring began; although we did not observe this pattern in the one mother we monitored who had only one fawn and maternal behavior varied greatly among individuals. Our results suggest the techniques and technology we employed can be valuable to research studying female attentiveness as a measure of maternal behavior to examine ecological questions such as maternal favoritism (i.e., Trivers-Willard theory).\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16486], "author_name_tesi": "Gingery, Tess Michelle", "last_name_ssi": "Gingery", "middle_name_ssi": "Michelle", "first_name_ssi": "Tess", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Duane Diefenbach", "Matt Marshall", "David Walter", "Christopher Rosenberry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Duane Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor", "Matt Marshall, Committee Member", "David Walter, Committee Member", "Christopher Rosenberry, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fawn", "meta-analysis", "North America", "Odocoileus virginianus", "survival", "white-tailed deer", "maternal behaviors", "activity sensors"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Polychronicity for Personnel Selection: An Investigation of Correlates and Contextual Determinants\n", "id": "13917", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7268", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The structure of many modern organizations demands multitasking employees.

For many chemical systems, we have an understanding of the intramolecular interactions that occur within a molecule, and how these interactions dictate the physical properties of the molecule, such as the dipole moment, color, or the dielectric constant.  The intermolecular interactions that occur between molecules and their molecular environment have proven to be more difficult to isolate, due to multiple interactions occurring simultaneously.  It is important to understand these interactions between molecules and their molecular environment because such interactions affect nearly every practical chemical system, from biological to industrial applications.  Therefore, it is of the upmost importance to understand how the intermolecular interactions can manifest throughout chemical systems.  \n\tWe are interested in separating the multiple contributions to the intermolecular interactions that arise from the molecular environment.  To achieve this goal, I developed theoretical and experimental frameworks for determining kinetic parameters of chemical systems using steady-state vibrational spectroscopy, a tool that has proven very powerful for determining the effects of both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, therefore, we have chosen to focus on using vibrational spectroscopy in my dissertation.  I first demonstrate the equivalency between the kinetic information extracted from IR and Raman spectroscopies by obtaining identical activation energies for the ligand site exchange of Fe(CO)3(\u03b74-norbornadiene) (FeNBD).  These experiments rely upon the extraction of kinetic information from steady-state band shapes and demonstrated that either vibrational spectroscopic technique can be used to extract kinetic information from the band shapes of steady-state spectra.  In order to do this, I worked with collaborators to extend the theoretical framework for extracting the rate constant from the band shapes of vibrational spectra to include Raman spectroscopy.  \n\tThe next step towards the goal of separating the multiple contributions to the intermolecular interactions is to categorize these contributions as static effects and dynamic effects.  For the purpose of this work, I define static effects as those that arise from solute-solvent interactions that cause changes in the band shape, while dynamic effects are those that arise from changes in the dynamics of a system as a result of interaction with the molecular environment.  I establish a way to separate static effects from dynamic effects by analyzing the solvent effects of Fe(CO)3(\u03b74-cyclooctatetraene) using solvent-dependent IR spectroscopy.  The dynamic effects induced by the solvent environment were analyzed through temperature-dependent Raman experiments of FeNBD in a series of linear alkane solvents.  \n\tThe last part of this dissertation further focused on the consequences of static effects, examining the morphology of conducting polymer films used in thin film devices.  We used Raman spectroscopy to characterize the crystallinity of conducting polymer films with and without dopant materials.  From this data, we constructed structure-function relationships by correlating the morphology of the polymer film to the overall device performance that will aid in the rational design of materials used in thin film devices.  This part of my dissertation was done in collaboration with Prof. Elizabeth von Hauff at The University of Freiburg in Germany.  \n\tFuture experiments will explore the effects confining environments will have on the dynamics of FeNBD.  Initial experiments to encapsulated FeNBD into a porous polymer matrix were successful, but there are many potential experiments along this line of reasoning that could be explored, and are discussed in the final chapter of this dissertation.  In its entirety, this dissertation will provide the scientific community with a novel approach that combines the ability to measure ground state kinetics using steady-state vibrational spectroscopy with a theoretical framework to analyze the effects the molecular environment induces on the ground state kinetics in chemical systems.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9957], "author_name_tesi": "Giordano, Andrea Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Giordano", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Andrea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin James Lear", "Lasse Jensen", "Tom Mallouk", "Renee Denise Diehl"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin James Lear, Dissertation Advisor", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member", "Tom Mallouk, Committee Member", "Renee Denise Diehl, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Raman Spectroscopy", "IR Spectroscopy", "Molecular environments", "Kinetics", "Fe(CO)3(eta^4-norbornadiene)"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A QUASI-QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF TIME-COMPRESSED SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS COURSE PEDAGOGY", "id": "12184", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2154", "abstract_tesi": "The number of time-compressed, or length-shortened, college courses continues to rise.

New experiments are being built and designed to further investigate neutrino oscillations, to obtain precision measurements of dominant oscillation parameters and discover sub-dominant effects. On the other hand, neutrino telescopes, like IceCube and the IceCube DeepCore Array, are using neutrinos as a means of learning about astrophysical sources, discovering dark matter and other high energy phenomena. Atmospheric neutrinos constitute a background for these searches. This dissertation shows that the large number of atmospheric neutrinos that the IceCube DeepCore detector will accumulate can be used in order to extract useful information about neutrino oscillations. Atmospheric neutrino interactions within the IceCube DeepCore array are examined in the context of neutrino flavor oscillations. The detection of an appearance of a tau-flavored neutrino flux, not present in the original atmospheric neutrino flux is calculated and quantified using the statistical interpretation of the neutrino-induced electromagnetic and hadronic cascades within the detector. The \u00e2\u20ac\u009dtrack signal\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of Cherenkov light created by muons created from either charged current interactions of muon-type neutrinos with detector volume nuclei or the decay of tau leptons within the detector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s instrumented volume are also examined. Using a chi-squared analysis, new precision bounds are determined for the main atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters and shown to drastically reduce the current parameter space. The implications of these new precision measurements are discussed in the context of currently open questions in the area of neutrino flavor oscillation studies. Future work and the impact of future measurements on this analysis are also discussed. Full three-flavor neutrino oscillation transition probabilities with matter effects are calculated and employed in the study. A discussion of the calculation of the full differential cross sections for neutrino-nucleon deep inelastic scattering interactions in both the limit of a negligible mass final state lepton and in the situation of a non-negligible mass final state lepton are discussed and employed with the latter being necessary for the calculation of the tau-type neutrino charged current interaction induced cascades. Physics motivated assumptions about the systematic error present in the IceCube DeepCore detector and the effective volume of the detector are made for the analysis. In summary, it is shown that cascade measurements in the IceCube DeepCore Array can provide evidence for tau neutrino appearance in atmospheric neutrino oscillations. A statistically significant (3&#963;) &#957;&#964; appearance signal could be obtained in only a few months of observation and is important for future &#957;&#964; interaction studies.

Skeletal muscle tissue was harvested from White Throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) and cultured in an organotypic culture system.

The objective of the research was to investigate quality attributes and inhibition of foodborne pathogens of \u201cno-nitrate or nitrite-added\u201d bacon.  Two natural cure ingredients were investigated: one that required the reduction of nitrate (natural nitrate) during manufacturing, and the other, was a product that has been pre-reduced (natural nitrite).

Nitrate reduction for 12 hours produced 48 ppm nitrite without salt vs 1 ppm nitrite with salt.  Pre-converting without salt may save time during manufacturing.  A second study investigated the quality attributes of \u201cno-nitrate or nitrite-added\u201d bacon.

Yet, they are very vulnerable to anthropogenic impact due to their lack of mobility, exposed tissue, and generally low growth rates. In April 2010, the blowout of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in the northern Gulf of Mexico led to the largest oil spill in US history. The first impacted coral community was discovered three months after the well was capped. Corals there, were covered in a brown flocculent material (floc) that contained traces of oil, directly linking the observed damages to the spill. Eleven months later, two additional affected communities were discovered and, although corals were no longer covered in floc, the characteristic patchy impact distribution on the colonies, previously observed at the first site discovered, indicated that these corals had also been impacted by the spill. I quantified the impact and assessed the recovery of deep-sea corals using high-definition photographs of individual colonies. Paramuricea spp. colonies, well suited for visual monitoring due to their planar morphology, were imaged every year between 2011 and 2017 at five sites (three impacted and two reference sites). Images were then digitized to quantify impact and track recovery patterns. Overall recovery was slow. Although the health of lightly impacted corals improved, heavily impacted colonies showed little or no sign of recovery by 2017. The initial level of visible impact on corals had a significant effect on the improvements in the condition of individual branches between consecutive years. Furthermore, branch loss at two of the impacted sites was still significantly higher between 2016 and 2017 than at the reference sites. Even after seven years, the fate of the corals that were impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill is still uncertain and the effects of the oil spill appear to be ongoing.\n\tThe high-resolution images collected between 2011 and 2014 were also used to investigate the relationship between Paramuricea biscaya and its ophiuroid associate Asteroschema clavigerum, based on the hypothesis that both species benefit from this association. Coral colonies associated with ophiuroids were on average less impacted than coral colonies that had no associates. After defining the area clearly under the influence of ophiuroids for each coral, I found that the level of visible impact to coral branches was lower in the area influenced by ophiuroids than outside that area, and that impacted branches within this area were more likely to recover than branches outside the area of influence. These results suggest a mutualistic symbiosis between P. biscaya and A. clavigerum; Ophiuroids use corals to gain access to food particles brought by currents, and corals likely benefit through the physical action of ophiuroids removing particles deposited on polyps and perhaps inhibiting the settlement of hydroids. The beneficial role of ophiuroids was demonstrated on corals impacted by an oil spill, but these benefits could also extend to corals in environments exposed to natural sedimentation events, perhaps allowing corals to live in environments where heavy sedimentation would otherwise limit their survival.\n\tIn order to assess recovery over the long term and to plan for future monitoring, I developed an impact-dependent, state-structured matrix model. The model, parameterized using data collected as part of the long-term monitoring project, projected the dynamics of three-branch states: visibly healthy, unhealthy and hydroid-colonized. Although branch loss was implicitly included in the model, I focused on the return of extant damaged branches to a healthy state rather than on the slower re-growth of lost branches. The model estimated that, whereas most corals will recover to a visibly healthy state within a decade, the most impacted coral colonies will take up to three decades to visibly recover. Impact-related branch loss will lead to a 10% reduction in total biomass at the impacted sites by the time all coral colonies are projected to appear healthy. Given the very slow growth rates estimated for these corals, hundreds of years may be necessary for coral communities to re-grow to their original biomass. \n\tOverall, even with the help of associated ophiuroids, the recovery of corals impacted by the oil spill is extremely slow, demonstrating the necessity to prevent impact to deep-sea corals rather than relying on restoration after the fact. Deep-sea corals are reliable indicators of anthropogenic impact in the deep sea because they are sessile, their skeleton is almost entirely covered with living tissue, making potential damage easily detectable, and natural mortality is an extremely rare event. The methods I employed allow the detection of small changes in the health of coral colonies that would not be visible with monitoring based on transects. Therefore, I suggest the establishment of photo-based coral-monitoring sites as part of protected areas to detect and limit future anthropogenic impact to vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16314], "author_name_tesi": "Girard, Fanny Apine", "last_name_ssi": "Girard", "middle_name_ssi": "Apine", "first_name_ssi": "Fanny", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles R.

Known as a \"promiscuous\" receptor, AHR can bind to several different classes of chemical compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and flavonoids. When not bound to ligand, AHR resides in a cytosolic complex containing two molecules of heat shock protein 90, one molecule of X-associated protein 2, and a molecule of p23. Upon ligand binding, this complex is transported to the nucleus via nuclear importins and AHR dissociates to form a heterodimer with aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT). The AHR/ARNT heterodimer then binds to specific DNA sequences known as dioxin response elements (DRE) within the promoter region of target genes (e.g. cytochrome P450 enzyme 1A1, CYP1A1) to activate their transcription. \n\tPrevious studies have primarily examined AHR within the context of ligand-mediated transcriptional activation of its prototypical target gene, Cyp1a1. However, the AHR can also influence gene transcription in the absence of exogenous ligand and/or Cyp1a1 expression. Using a conditional AHR knockout mouse model that lacks hepatocyte-specific AHR expression (Ahrfx/fxAlbCre), this dissertation examines how basal AHR activity in the absence of Cyp1a1 transcription can influence metabolic homeostasis. In particular, the data reveal that the loss of hepatocyte-specific AHR expression correlates with reduced body and liver mass relative to congenic AHR-expressing mice (Ahrfx/fx). Additionally, Ahrfx/fxAlbCre mice maintained on purified AIN-93M diet display impaired glucose tolerance without any perturbations of insulin sensitivity. Conversely, Ahrfx/fxAlbCre mice challenged with a high-sucrose dietary modification of AIN-93M exhibit reduced insulin sensitivity without any difference in glucose tolerance. Most notably, Ahrfx/fxAlbCre mice challenged with a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet exhibit significantly decreased gene/protein expression of key enzymes involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid import, as well as significantly increased expression of key fatty acid export genes. Furthermore, inflammatory gene expression is also significantly reduced in HF/HS-fed Ahrfx/fxAlbCre mice relative to Ahrfx/fx. Together, the data suggest that basal hepatocyte-specific AHR signaling may promote diet-induced steatohepatitis in Ahrfx/fx mice. \nUtilizing the Ahrfx/fxAlbCre mouse model, this dissertation also explores the role of AHR in regulating hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) production. FGF21 is an important metabolic hormone and regulator of the fasting response. Notably, FGF21 can attenuate obesity-associated morbidities when administered to various genetic and diet-induced mouse models of the disease. In the absence of exogenous AHR ligand, non-fasted Ahrfx/fxAlbCre mice exhibit 4-fold greater hepatic Fgf21 expression relative to Ahrfx/fx, along with elevated expression of the FGF21-target gene Igfbp1. Furthermore, in vivo agonist activation of AHR reduces hepatic Fgf21 expression during a fast. The Fgf21 promoter contains several putative dioxin response elements (DREs) and utilizing electromobility shift assays, we demonstrate that the AHR/ARNT heterodimer binds to a specific DRE which overlaps binding sequences for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), and cAMP response element-binding protein hepatocyte specific (CREBH). In addition, agonist-activated AHR impairs PPAR\u03b1-, ChREBP-, and CREBH-mediated Fgf21 promoter activity in Hepa-1 cells. Similarly, treatment of Hepa-1 cells with AHR agonist ablates potent ER stress-driven Fgf21 expression, while pre-treatment with AHR antagonist blocks this effect. Finally, the data demonstrate that pre-treatment of primary human hepatocytes with AHR agonist attenuates PPAR\u03b1-, glucose-, and ER stress-driven induction of FGF21 expression, indicating this phenomenon is not mouse-specific. Overall, the data show that AHR contributes to hepatic energy homeostasis partly through the constitutive repression of FGF21 expression and signaling. Therefore, future studies should examine the potential use of AHR antagonists, such as the flavonoid compounds readily found within edible plants, to increase FGF21 expression and subsequently produce therapeutic outcomes.\nIn summary, the data from this dissertation indicate that basal hepatocyte-specific AHR activity plays a critical role in the regulation of liver metabolism and that AHR agonists are not only capable of activating DRE-dependent transcription, but can also suppress or interfere with certain metabolic gene pathways. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms through which AHR exerts these effects remain unclear. Ultimately, this dissertation presents contrasting roles for AHR when activated with ligands and when exerting its regulation in the absence of exogenous ligand. Therefore, future research should aim to define the role of AHR within these separate contexts to gain a better understanding of the complex mechanisms through which AHR regulates transcription. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13693], "author_name_tesi": "Girer, Nathaniel Gabriel", "last_name_ssi": "Girer", "middle_name_ssi": "Gabriel", "first_name_ssi": "Nathaniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Perdew", "Gary Perdew", "Andrew Patterson", "Jeffrey Peters", "Connie Rogers", "Ross Hardison", "Ross Hardison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Perdew, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary Perdew, Committee Chair", "Andrew Patterson, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Peters, Committee Member", "Connie Rogers, Outside Member", "Ross Hardison, Committee Member", "Ross Hardison, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor", "Fibroblast growth factor 21", "Liver Metabolism"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF THIN FILMS AND NOVEL MATERIALS USING\nRESONANT ULTRASOUND SPECTROSCOPY\n", "id": "6111", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2964", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Crystalline thin films have become an important area of research in condensed matter and applied physics, electrical engineering, and materials science.

Typical film thicknesses studied were 100 - 1,000 nm for the CNT films, and 200 and 400 nm for the CMR films.  In general, films occupying only 1/1,000 of the substrate can be reliably measured.  In addition to thin films, traditional RUS was used to determine a correction to the sign of the C14 of alpha-alumina, previously measured over 40 years ago; and the first application of RUS to biological materials, specifically human dentin. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2957], "author_name_tesi": "Gladden, III, Joseph Rhea", "last_name_ssi": "Gladden, III", "middle_name_ssi": "Rhea", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Julian Decatur Maynard Jr.", "Peter C Eklund", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Anthony A Atchley", "Jayanth R Banavar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Julian Decatur Maynard Jr., Committee Chair", "Peter C Eklund, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Anthony A Atchley, Committee Member", "Jayanth R Banavar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["alumina", "dentin", "nanotubes", "phase transitions", "thin films", "elastic constants", "acoustics", "attenuation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "FY 2010: The Response of the In-House Lobbyists at the State-Related Research Universities of Pennsylvania to an Economic Crisis \n\n", "id": "12115", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6175", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to understand: 1) how the in-house lobbyists of Pennsylvania\u2019s state-related public research universities dealt with an economic crisis as it affected the FY 2009-2010 appropriation process; and 2) how the in-house lobbyists at the state-related public research universities of Pennsylvania defined successful lobbying during an economic crisis? The state-related public research universities of Pennsylvania include: Penn State University, Temple University, and the University of Pittsburgh.\n    \nThe political perspective as described by Pfeffer (1981; 1992), Bolman and Deal (2008), Oliver (1991), and others served as the conceptual framework for this study.  The political perspective views conflict between individuals and/or organizations as normal because of heterogeneous goals and scarce resources. Power becomes an important asset in determining what goals are pursued and allocation of resources. Resolution of conflict in not emphasized in the political perspective whereas the use of tactics and strategies to increase power are. \n\nTo answer the questions, a qualitative case study was used. A document analysis was used to describe the economic crisis as it affected Pennsylvania, the FY 2009-2010 appropriation process, and the state-related public research universities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the in-house lobbyists at the state-related public research universities of Pennsylvania to gain their perspectives on the economic crisis and defining success. \n\nAnalysis of the data revealed that the in-house lobbyist used a number of tactics and strategies to influence legislators during the contentious FY 2009-2010 appropriation process. They used rational arguments in value creation or value claiming terms; and given the economic realities being faced in the Commonwealth and the antagonistic proposals of the governor, many of the arguments were value claiming in nature.

One of the negative outcomes of moving is an increased risk of criminal victimization. This dissertation uses the concept of hysteresis (person-place mismatch) to explain how, in three stages, victimization risk might increase: (1) for some people, moving may contribute to a real or perceived inability to fit in a new neighborhood, (2) this lack of fit may affect how individuals behave in the new environment, and (3) these behavioral adaptations may influence victimization risk. \n\nHysteresis is measured across two domains: extrinsic or objective mismatch, such as being black in a white neighborhood, and intrinsic or subjective mismatch, such as a feeling of not belonging or not being able to make friends. Additionally, two forms of behavior are examined: (1) protective behaviors, such as locking doors, avoiding certain areas, and other constrained behavioral adaptations, and (2) maladaptive behaviors, such as drinking, substance use, and offending. Finally, victimization is measured in terms of violent crime, property crime, and bias-related experiences.\n\nThree studies are conducted to examine patterns across four different samples. Study 1 is an analysis of a randomized housing voucher experiment that attempted to relocate residents from impoverished, inner-city housing projects to more affluent neighborhoods. The study consists of two samples \u2013 adults and youth. Study 2 examines the proposed model of hysteresis in a sample of college students at Penn State, with particular emphasis on property victimization. Study 3 assesses the relevance of the model to hate crimes and bias activity at Penn State. All three studies use structural equation modeling to test whether hysteresis and behavior mediate the relationship between residential mobility and victimization.\n\nOverall, results support the idea that movers may experience hysteresis, that hysteresis may be correlated with behavioral adaptations, and that behavior may be correlated with victimization risk. However, results across studies suggest a more complex pattern in that hysteresis and its effects depend on the types of respondents, types of moves, types of neighborhood conditions, and types of outcomes being measured.

Confinement of methyl iodide in the 200 &#506; pores exhibits two phase transitions.  The first transition takes place at 203 K, and is a liquid - amorphous solid transition (glass). This transition has never been observed for bulk methyl iodide or any of the studies in confinement. The scattering pattern of the glass is identical to that of the liquid pattern with one exception.  At high momentum transfer there is a drop in scattering amplitude correlating to the Debye-Waller factor. The system therefore has short range order like a liquid, but the atoms move on a time scale that is experimentally immeasurable.

Problems of resource allocation, environmental protection and economic competitiveness are propelling debates about the most appropriate scale for urban government, and regional solutions are being proposed in cities across the western world.  Despite the presentation of such metropolitan reform proposals as novel, governance change has a lengthy history and it is incumbent upon modern policy makers and academics to understand the background to metropolitan solutions.  At a broader scale the question of how to configure social space to meet local community needs is persistent over time and across place.  This dissertation examines the origin and geographical imprint of successive changes to political spaces in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania between 1750 and 1929.\nAllegheny County is located in southwestern Pennsylvania, and contains the post-industrial City of Pittsburgh.  The county in the twenty first century is predominantly urban and contains 130 distinct minor civil divisions \u2013 cities, townships and boroughs.  By examining the urban history of this county, it is evident that the current social and political form of Allegheny County was not predetermined with the original erection of the county, and instead was formed gradually through a history of guile, negotiation and violence.  This dissertation presents this history through four \u2018episodes of change,\u2019 each of which identifies a different rationale for the division of space and a different response by local communities to the division of space.\nBeginning in the mid-eighteenth century, the first episode tracks the imposition of colonial theories of power and identity upon a sparsely settled landscape.  Colonial surveyors and politicians imposed political lines on the natural world of this region in order to legitimize claims to the region and to assist the governing of local communities.  From the earliest days of the county, local communities began to reshape the political map of Allegheny County in order to meet their changing needs.  During the nineteenth century, the gaze of the Pennsylvania state government was focused on broad infrastructural improvements.  This inattentiveness to local politics meant communities were able to develop new municipal units to fit their changing needs.  The second episode describes the burgeoning \u2018geographical imaginations\u2019 which were finding expression within Allegheny County.  The county was splintering into a mosaic of municipal forms based on social, economic and political considerations.  \nThe third episode of change starts in the late nineteenth century, when the municipal units founded on an industrial logic begin to overshadow the rural and suburban worlds of Allegheny County.  This was a form of horizontal competition, whereby the different geographical imaginations for Allegheny County jostled for primacy within the county.  At the same time, a vertical competition was emerging as Allegheny County became implicated in the broadening national and international economic system.  County and state leaders decided Allegheny County needed a \u2018regional champion\u2019 to contend in this economic competition, and the City of Pittsburgh became synonymous with the county for this reason.\nThe final episode of change was a consequence of Allegheny County becoming embedded in the global world economy of the early twentieth century.  The Progressive Era had given rise to a new national network of civic reformers and professional classes who advocated for change to the political and social institutions of the nineteenth century city.  This advocacy was adopted by the Civic Club of Allegheny County, whose leaders accepted the logic of metropolitan governance and agitated for the creation of a Greater Pittsburgh, which would consolidate the city with the county.  This advocacy would eventually fail at the ballot box, marking the first time local communities had rejected a broad restructuring of local political boundaries in the county.\nThis dissertation includes four key findings.  First, political spaces cannot keep pace with the social evolution and changing needs of local communities and the broader region.  As soon as lines are inscribed upon a map, changes are occurring to render them obsolete.  Second, within existing spatial units are the preconditions for new geographical imaginations \u2013 nascent communities and concepts of place will emerge over time.  Third, theories for the division of space will falter if they are not linked to local contingencies.  This was especially important in Allegheny County, as national theories of the Progressive Era were not suited to the contingencies of that place.  Finally, the division of space was accelerated after the first political lines were inscribed on the area which became Allegheny County.  This initial abstraction facilitated future divisions as local conditions and community needs changed.   \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4300], "author_name_tesi": "Glass, Michael Roy", "last_name_ssi": "Glass", "middle_name_ssi": "Roy", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deryck William Holdsworth", "Roger Michael Downs", "Chris Benner", "Amy S Greenberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deryck William Holdsworth, Committee Chair", "Roger Michael Downs, Committee Member", "Chris Benner, Committee Member", "Amy S Greenberg, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Urban Political Geography", "Metropolitan Governance", "Pittsburgh Pennsylvania", "Scale", "Power", "Identity", "Geographical Imaginations"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "ATOMISTIC MODELING OF AN ELECTROCHEMICAL INTERFACE\n", "id": "12310", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4451", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Electrochemical interfaces are present in a variety of applications.

A non-linear finite element model, using the commercial software package Abaqus, was developed for each compression test to predict the compression modulus and compression strength using the built-in damage progression algorithm in Abaqus.  The models were used to identify failure modes for each compression test.  Premature end-crushing was predicted at 2,200 \u00b5\u03b5 in the modeled modulus specimen of SACMA SRM 1R-94 for the [(+60/0/-60)S]2 laminate.  End-crushing in the modeled SACMA SRM 1R-94 strength specimen was predicted to occur slightly after ultimate laminate failure for the [(+60/0/-60)S]2 laminate. End-crushing was predicted to be highly unlikely for both laminates in the ASTM D6641 model.  The stress-strain response of both models matched relatively well with experimental data.  The predicted strengths for both test methods were underpredicted for the [(+60/0/-60)S]2 laminate and overpredicted for the [(0/\u00b160)S]2 laminate.  \n\nThe fracture toughness of a proprietary intermediate modulus carbon/epoxy [0]10 laminate was experimentally determined using ASTM D5528 and a U.S. Government provided end-notched flexure compliance calibration test method for modes I and II, respectively.  Significant fiber bridging was noted for the ASTM D5528 experimental test specimens, especially at the crack tips.  A finite element model was developed for each test method using the virtual crack closure technique.  A boundary was developed for the modeled load-displacement plot to encompass the experimental behavior of test specimens.  This predicted boundary agreed well with mode I of ASTM D5528 experimental data.  The predicted load-displacement response of mode II had a stiffer response than the experimental data, but the model did not consider potential stiffness degradation due to 5 preload calibrations used on each test specimen.\n\nA statistical sensitivity analysis (ANOVA), based on the previously developed finite element model of ASTM D6641, was used to vary parameters assumed to influence the compression modulus, compression strength, and first ply failure of ASTM D6641.  Of the chosen parameters, fiber misalignment was predicted to significantly affect the FEA-based results of the compression modulus, compression strength, and first ply failure for the chosen levels of variation.  The laminate thickness, adhesive thickness, and enforced bolt displacement were predicted to not significantly affect the FEA-based results of the compression modulus, compression strength, and first ply failure for the chosen levels of variation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9571], "author_name_tesi": "Glath, Michael Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Glath", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin L Koudela", "Charles E Bakis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin L Koudela, Thesis Advisor", "Charles E Bakis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ASTM D6641", "SACMA SRM 1R-94", "ASTM D5528", "end-notched flexure", "ANOVA", "finite element analysis", "damage", "fracture energy"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "FROM SCIENCE TO SPORT:\nA CROSS DISCIPLINARY EXAMINATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION FOR DOPING BANS\n", "id": "11701", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3035", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I will use a cross-disciplinary approach to evaluate the ethics of doping and performance enhancement in sport. I believe such an approach will help remove many myths and assumptions about the ethics of performance-enhancing substances (PESs) that have long stalled the debate. These myths emerged due largely to scholars misunderstanding or remaining unaware of research that existed beyond their individual \u201csilos\u201d of expertise. Subsequently, one central question regarding the ethics of PESs remains unsatisfactorily answered: are sporting organizations justified to prohibit athletes from using PESs?\nThis question will be at the center of my dissertation. Yet I will not offer any final conclusions about the permissibility of drugs in sport, either. Indeed, I do not believe there are any. What I will claim, instead, is that sporting communities have no necessary grounds for rejecting PESs. Yet contingent reasons may exist justifying their decision to prohibit or regulate athletes\u2019 PES use.\nIn order to provide appropriate context for my later claims, my first two chapters will examine the historical development of the doping attitudes from their nascent stages to the death of Knud Enemark Jensen at the 1960 Rome Olympic Games. These chapters provide the necessary context for the modern PES debate by showing how significant cultural movements such as the fascination with doping horses for gambling, muscular Christianity, temperance movements, amateurism, and notions of public health helped shape today\u2019s anti-doping attitudes. \nFollowing, my third chapter will turn to modern PESs and the science behind them. This chapter will help establish certain facts about performance enhancement such as performance gains, mechanisms of action and health risks which are important in ethical decision making. These scientifically grounded conclusions will help dismiss many myths as well as shape subsequent evaluations of the arguments for and against prohibiting PESs. This evaluation will come in my fourth chapter, where I will thematically and critically review past literature discussing the ethics of banning PESs in sports. This review will show that little consensus exists regarding the justification for prohibiting PESs and new efforts towards understanding the ethics of PESs may be justified.\nIn my final two chapters, I will use the cross-disciplinary evidence developed in the first half of my dissertation to establish new ways of viewing the PES debate. The first step, which I will address in chapter five, involves viewing the debate as two separate questions: what are the acceptable means for \u201cperformance enhancement\u201d and why should sports ban \u201cdoping.\u201d In my sixth chapter, I use the cross-disciplinary information to inform a more rational evaluation of PESs, arguing that performance enhancing substances may either improve or harm well-established sporting tests. This, I will argue, renders any ipso facto rejection of enhancement unwarranted if not also irrational.\nI end with an epilogue that cautions against hastily altering the pharmacological landscape as certain issues still remain at work. Despite such issues, I acknowledge that specific PESs may potentially improve certain sports by opening new avenues for enjoyment. Thus I do not conclude that all PESs are necessarily wrong, but that sporting organizations can justifiably choose to ban or regulate athletes\u2019 use of such technologies principally for reasons not typically advanced in the current PES literature.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3025], "author_name_tesi": "Gleaves, John Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Gleaves", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Robert Scott Kretchmar", "John Philip Christman", "Mark Dyreson", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Thomas Adam Hunt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Scott Kretchmar, Committee Chair", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Mark Dyreson, Committee Member", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Member", "Thomas Adam Hunt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Performance-Enhancing Substances", "Sport"]}]
