PCC 6803 encodes the enzyme C-DES: a pyridoxal phosphate enzyme that catalyzes the b-elimination of L-cystine to produce activated persulfide, pyruvate and ammonia.  The mechanism of this reaction was characterized in both the transient and steady state kinetic regimes in order to better understand the intricacies in this reaction compared to the better understood cysteine desulfurase reaction.  Two kinetically separated species form with absorbancies in the 465-495 nm range that may be attributed to &#61537;-aminoacrylate species.  These intermediates were differentiated by a slight shift in the visible region and variable reactivity upon addition of L-cysteine or sodium azide, leading us to conclude that the slower forming intermediate is not a typical &#61537;-aminoacrylate, as previously suggested.  \nThrough stopped-flow spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, we can conclude that the lack of a nucleophilic cysteine residue in the active site of C-DES leads to a change in the rate determining step upon use of cysteine as a substrate instead of cystine.  The lack of this nucleophilic attack means that a stable thiazolidine adduct forms before the deprotonation step, halting the reaction before productive &#61538;-elimination can occur.  This adduct formation explains the low baseline activity of C-DES with cysteine as a substrate and the spectral appearance of a stable, 350-nm-absorbing species.  A protein variant replacing a candidate catalytic base, histidine 114, with alanine was also constructed and characterized.  The activity of the variant is greatly reduced and the absorption spectra of the protein upon binding of substrate shifted in such a way that this histidine residue likely plays both a catalytic role and interacts with substrate upon its binding.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2059], "author_name_tesi": "Koch, Gretchen ", "last_name_ssi": "Koch", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gretchen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bollinger", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bollinger, Thesis Advisor", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["desulfurase", "cystine", "pyridoxal phosphate", "enzymology", "kinetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Variation in Human Hair Morphology and Microstructure", "id": "15023slk336", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15023", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Human hair varies considerably in form and color within an individual and among groups.

Differences in hair form and cuticle thickness are apparent between broadly defined geographic ancestry groups, but these categories do not necessarily reflect our modern, genetically admixed world.\nUsing Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), I investigated the degree of cuticle variability within the hairs from individuals, hairs from peoples who shared similar ancestry, and among people with diverse ancestries. Measurable differences were found in cuticle thickness and in the number of cuticle layers among the populations studied. Hairs from people with African ancestry tend to have thinner cuticles with fewer layers making up the cuticle, while those from people of European and East Asian ancestry tend to have thicker cuticles made up of more layers. Samples of hairs from peoples of European and East Asian ancestry are not statistically significant in cuticle thickness and in the number of layers. Testing European and East Asian hairs against African hairs show statistically significant differences in the cuticle thickness and number of layers. \nVariation exists within and among human populations in hair color, degree of curl, cross-sectional shape, diameter, and length. Analyses of hair dimensions and the number and distribution of pigment particles within a hair cross section revealed variability among diverse populations, and demonstrated that hair traits are not easily separable into distinct categories by ancestry. These findings offer support for eliminating the use of the outdated three-category racial typologies used by many U.S.-trained forensic scientists.

Among the various casting alloys, steel castings are able to maintain their market share because they are inexpensive, readily cast to near-net-shape, are easy to weld and have good mechanical properties. Sand casting is the dominant and most economical method for casting steel. Complex, dimensionally accurate steel castings depend on using proper shrinkage (pattern) allowances during the production of the initial pattern. The correction factor applied to a pattern's dimensions in order for it to produce acceptable castings is called the \"Pattern Allowance.\"  One area in which the steel casting industry can reduce costs and increase its market share is by preventing the formation and repair of dimensionally non-conforming castings. It is not uncommon for steel foundries to take several pattern adjustment and casting trial cycles between when a customer places an order and when the first acceptable casting is ready. A key way to ensure that the dimensional conformance of castings without pattern dimensional rework is to better predict initial pattern allowances. This in turn would significantly reduce the lead-time to produce dimensionally acceptable castings. \nThis research investigates the nature and causes of dimensional errors in steel castings produced in green sand, no-bake and shell molds. The significant process and design variables that affect dimensional variability are identified. Also errors introduced into casting dimensions due to incorrect pattern allowances (shrinkage allowances) are quantified. The major process and geometry variables that affect steel casting shrinkage allowances are identified. The influences of casting geometry and mold restraint and their interaction on the shrinkage behavior of feature dimensions are quantified, and predictive models for improved pattern allowances have been developed. \nHigher pattern allowance variation is observed in features of a casting made in green sand, followed by no-bake and shell, respectively, for similar size features. Pattern allowances measured in this study ranged from -8.0 % to 13.0 %. Features crossing the mold parting line show similar within-feature pattern allowance variations but have much lower nominal pattern allowance values that are usually negative. The amount of variation due to geometry increases as the slenderness ratio of a feature increases.\nThere is a significant effect of heat treatment on the casting dimensions and the effective pattern allowance values. There is an average increase [0.61%] in the pattern allowance indicating that most features shrink further after heat treatment. Pattern allowances can vary somewhat from foundry-to-foundry for same casting; however, the geometry dependent trends in pattern allowance were consistant from foundry to foundry.\nPattern allowance values are found to be dependent on molding method, restraint type, degree of restraint, feature slenderness, feature modulus and parting line location and a multiple linear regression model incorporating these factors is developed. The geometry dependant pattern allowance [GDPA] model showed 36% improvement in pattern allowance error when compared to the standard pattern allowance value of 2.08%. About 85% of the features of a validation casting showed improvement in predicting pattern allowance estimates using the GDPA model. Even though this research focused primarily on steel castings, the methodology used in this research can be easily applied to different materials that undergo shrinkage upon solidification.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6413], "author_name_tesi": "Kochar, Vishal Madanlal", "last_name_ssi": "Kochar", "middle_name_ssi": "Madanlal", "first_name_ssi": "Vishal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt", "Richard Allen Wysk", "Timothy William Simpson", "Md Amanul Haque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt, Committee Chair", "Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pattern allowance", "casting", "geometry", "modulus", "steel", "restraint", "solidification", "parting line", "heat treatment"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Phase Formation and Sintering of YAG Ceramics", "id": "8044", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5964", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, YAG (Yttrium aluminum garnet; Y3Al5O12) laser materials have been applied in various fields including medical operation, metal machining and semiconductor processing. Reactive sintering is the process of interest as it is the most suitable process for mass scale production. However, to achieve the optically transparent quality, 2 important topics related to reactive sintering of YAG are needed to be understood; first, the phase formation of the reaction between the starting powders and second, sintering mechanisms.  In the present work, the kinetics and mechanisms of phase formation during heat treatment of Y2O3 and Al2O3 powders to form YAG (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet, Y3Al5O12) were studied.  Quantitative X-ray analysis by Rietveld refinement was used to follow formation of YAM (Y4Al2O9), YAP (YAlO3) and YAG.  Reduction of the size of both Y2O3 and Al2O3 powders increases the formation rate of YAG.  Direct reaction between alumina and yttria to form YAG was not observed in this study.  Furthermore, Densification and grain growth in pure YAG, SiO2 doped YAG and SiO2 doped Nd:YAG were explored. The stability of large pores underscores the importance of forming in transparent YAG applications.  Addition of SiO2 and Nd2O3 enhance densification rate due to the formation of liquid phase during sintering.  Addition of SiO2 increases growth rate.  Addition of Nd2O3 further enhances grain growth but above 1700\u201eaC, higher Nd3+ content suppress grain growth possibly due to the solute drag.

Sticks-and-Stones (SNS) is a cell adhesion molecule on the surface of fusion competent myoblasts that associates heterotypically with ligands on the surface of founder cells, for their recognition and fusion. Loss-of-function mutants are characterized by an absence of mature myofibers. Intracellular signaling events exist in both myoblast populations to direct actin cytoskeletal changes and recruitment of fusion machinery. Such recruitment is dependent on SNS mediated adhesive contacts in the fusion competent myoblasts. \nThis study identifies critical functional sequences in the SNS cytodomain by generating deletions and mutations. Using the two-component UAS-GAL4 system, the mutagenized constructs were expressed in the mesoderm of loss-of-function sns mutant embryos to test their ability to rescue the myoblast fusion defect. Deletional analysis identified the presence of multiple functional domains within a minimal critical region. SNS is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and mutagenesis to abolish all phosphorylation affected the ability of the protein to restore wild-type muscle pattern, demonstrating a role for the tyrosine residues for SNS function during myogenesis. Additionally, mutagenesis of proline-rich sequences in the SNS cytodomain revealed a requirement during myoblast fusion. The presence of multiple functional motifs presents the enticing possibility that SNS functions by interaction with multiple intracellular proteins for signaling. \nThis study also identifies SNS is not essential for initial fusion events to form bi- or tri-nucleated precursor myofibers. This is due to substitution by Hibris (Hbs), the paralog of SNS, as precursor myofibers are absent in double mutants. Endogenous or overexpressed Hbs, however, does not substitute for SNS through additional rounds of fusion for mature myofiber formation. The two proteins associate into hetero-oligomers in cis. Chimeric constructs suggest that SNS and Hbs extracellular and cytodomains function comparably during myoblast fusion but that Hbs is less efficient. This study clarifies the role of Hbs during myogenesis as redundant with SNS for precursor myofiber formation and synergistic during mature myofiber formation.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3540], "author_name_tesi": "Kocherlakota, Kiranmai S", "last_name_ssi": "Kocherlakota", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Kiranmai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose", "Susan M Abmayr", "Robert Paulson", "Richard W Ordway", "Kyung An Han", "R Scott Hawley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Chair", "Susan M Abmayr, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Kyung An Han, Committee Member", "R Scott Hawley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Myoblast", "Fusion", "Signaling", "Sticks-and-Stones", "Hibris", "Phosphorylation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Parallel Particle-in-cell Performance Optimization: A Case Study of Electrospray Simulation", "id": "28933", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12153", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical technique is frequently used in physics and engineering simulations.

The thesis covers aspects of guided wave mechanics, transducer design and phased array development for plates. Metallic and carbon fiber reinforced composite plates are considered for inspection. The long range propagation characteristics of guided waves combined with the capability of beamforming in a direction of interest significantly increases the probability of detecting defects in large structures and to localize them.  \n\nFree wave modal solutions for the guided wave modes in a structure are obtained using the semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method. The directional dependent dispersion curves in composite laminates are calculated and other guided wave properties like the skew angle, phase velocity, energy velocity and mode excitabilities are computed. The guided wave mode properties are used as input in transducer design. Analytical expressions are developed to obtain the wave field in plates due to arbitrary loading. Using these analytical expressions guided wave fields due to array transducers are calculated. \n\nAt any frequency there can exist several guided wave modes in a structure that complicates the analysis. Annular array transducers are designed to excite individual omni-directional guided wave modes in plate like structures. The mathematical expressions are derived to analytically express the guided wave field excited in a structure due to annular arrays, the optimum parameters needed to excite a single guided wave mode are derived and utilized in the design of transducers. Annular array transducers are designed and tested for applications in SHM. The problem of water loading on structures being monitored for corrosion is successfully overcome by proper design of annular array transducers. Phased annular array transducers are studied to overcome the limitations of annular array transducers. Mathematically, the problem needed to optimize the array parameters for uni-modal guided wave generation is established. 1-3 piezocomposite materials are studied for developing array transducers. The low lateral coupling between array elements in 1-3 piezocomposites is utilized in the design of phased annular array transducers. The designed transducers are successfully tested for their uni-modal generation capability.\n\nPhased array principles commonly used in ultrasound imaging systems and Radar systems are studied. The phased array principles are adapted to plate like structures to enable guided wave beamforming. Linear and circular arrays are studied, the array parameters namely the element spacing and aperture illumination are studied for their influence on beamforming. The influence of unwanted modes on the beamforming is studied and techniques to suppress the unwanted modes are implemented. A phased annular beamformer transducer is developed for guided wave mode control and beamforming to a given direction. Using 1-3 piezocomposites, the phased annular beamformer transducer is fabricated and used for imaging defects in a structure. Guided wave phased array imaging is carried on isotropic and anisotropic plates, both disk type and phased annular transducers are employed. The B-Scans of large plate like structures with different kinds of defects is successfully obtained. A deconvolution algorithm is employed to remove artifacts from the B-Scan images. In anisotropic plates, the phased arrays should take into account the directional dependence of velocity and the excitability of guided waves. Time delay transducers designed for guided wave mode controls are used to excite points on the dispersion curves that are quasi-isotropic and whose behavior is nearly isotropic. Delamination and volumetric defects in composites are studied and successfully imaged using guided wave phased arrays.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3064], "author_name_tesi": "Koduru, Jaya Prakash ", "last_name_ssi": "Koduru", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jaya Prakash", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Thomas R Shrout", "Judith Todd Copley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Thomas R Shrout, Committee Member", "Judith Todd Copley, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["piezocomposites", "annular arrays", "phased arrays", "guided waves"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on the Fertility Preferences of Rural Ghanaian Women: a Longitudinal Perspective", "id": "9300", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2424", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Attitudinal data are expected to be useful for the design and implementation of population policies and family planning programs.

Measurements were performed with an \u03b1 beam energy of 35.9(2) MeV at eleven scattering angles from 40\u00b0 to 140\u00b0 in 10\u00b0 intervals and at nuclear excitation energies up to 16 MeV. Within experimental uncertainty, the maximum fission probability was observed at the neutron separation energy for each \u03b1 scattering angle. Fission probabilities were separated into five 500 keV bins from 5.5 MeV to 8.0 MeV and one bin from 4.5 MeV to 5.5 MeV. Across energy bins the fission probability increases approximately linearly with increasing \u03b1\u2032 scattering angle. At 90\u00b0 the fission probability increases from 0.069(6) in the lowest energy bin to 0.59(2) in the highest. Likewise, within a single energy bin the fission probability increases with \u03b1\u2032 scattering angle. Within the 6.5 MeV and 7.0 MeV energy bin, the fission probability increased from 0.41(1) at 60\u00b0 to 0.81(10) at 140\u00b0.\nFission fragment angular distributions were also measured integrated over each energy bin. These distributions were fit to theoretical distributions based on combinations of transitional nuclear vibrational and rotational excitations at the saddle point. Contributions from specific K vibrational states were extracted and combined with fission probability measurements to determine the relative fission probability of each state as a function of nuclear excitation energy.\nWithin a given excitation energy bin, it is found that contributions from K states greater than the minimum K = 0 state tend to increase with the increasing \u03b1\u2032 scattering angle. This is attributed to an increase in the transferred angular momentum associated with larger scattering angles. The 90\u00b0 \u03b1\u2032 scattering angle produced the highest quality results. The relative contributions of K states do not show a discernible trend across the energy spectrum. The energy-binned results confirm existing measurements that place a K = 2 state in the first energy bin with the opening of K = 1 and K = 4 states at energies above 5.5 MeV.\nThis experiment represents the first of its kind in which fission probabilities and angular distributions are simultaneously measured at a large number of scattering angles. The acquired fission probability, angular distribution, and K state contribution provide a diverse dataset against which microscopic fission models can be constrained and further the understanding of the properties of the 240Pu fission.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14946], "author_name_tesi": "Koglin, Johnathon David", "last_name_ssi": "Koglin", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Johnathon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Igor Jovanovic", "Kenan Unlu", "Jack Brenizer", "Jason Burke", "Mark Strikman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Igor Jovanovic, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Chair", "Jack Brenizer, Committee Member", "Jason Burke, Committee Member", "Mark Strikman, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fission Fragment", "Surrogate Reaction", "Angular Distribution", "Plutonium-240", "Angular Momentum", "Fission Probability"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Art Critiques And Ecological Perspectives Of Contextuality, Equity, And Harmony: Recommendations For Korean Art Education", "id": "18330", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8894", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to draw implications and develop recommendations for Korean art curriculum to achieve education that supports ecological sustainability. To do so, I critique Korean contemporary environmental art and the current Korean art curriculum from an ecological perspective, incorporating values of contextuality, equity, and harmony. Through interviews and document analysis, I particularly focus an ecological art critique on two Korean contemporary artist groups: Baggat Art Group (BAG) and Korea Nature Art Association (KNAA). I analyzed BAG\u2019s and KNAA\u2019s artworks, exhibitions, and other activities, as well as related research or criticisms in terms of artist groups\u2019 conceptualization of the environment and ways each group conveyed ecological concepts. In analysis of the current Korean art curriculum, I focus on nine art textbooks for secondary schools in Korea. \nUsing an ecological perspective as art criticism to analyze contemporary Korean artworks by KNAA and BAG members, I find that works of BAG and KNAA reflect and advocate ecological values of contextuality, equity, and harmony in different ways. Creating and exhibiting their works with natural materials found in the exhibition site, KNAA endeavors to represent the beauty and spirituality of local nature. Artworks of KNAA convey values of contextuality (i.e., valuing locality), equity (i.e., between human-beings and nature), and harmony (i.e., harmonious relationships between humans and nature). BAG expands and broadens KNAA\u2019s conceptualization of ecology in social, cultural, and political life. Similarly to KNAA, BAG creates and exhibits their works with materials found in the exhibition site. However, the messages of the artworks are mostly related to the socio-cultural or political issues of Jara Island, the site of exhibition. BAG brings social and political issues into their works and they raise their voices about those issues. BAG conveys the value of contextuality (i.e., valuing local tradition or culture), equity (i.e., empowerment of all members), and harmony (i.e., embracing diverse perspectives).\nAnalyzing the current Korean art curriculum as to how it reflects or does not reflect ecological values (using nine art textbooks for secondary schools), I focus on examining the notion of environment, sense of place, and aesthetics embedded in the Korean art curriculum. I find that the notion of environment in the current Korean art curriculum mainly regards physical and visual features of environment. Another finding is that the sense of place embedded in the current Korean art curriculum does not encompass distinctiveness or unique values of local place. Also, I find that the current Korean art curriculum is mainly based upon the perspective of formalism, which emphasizes visual attributes such as color and proportional relationships within artworks rather than contextual meaning.\nFinally, I propose three suggestions for Korean art education to be more responsible to practice education for ecological sustainability. First, I argue that Korean art curriculum should convey broader ideas of environment and ecology beyond environment as physical surroundings. Second, I propose that Korean art curriculum guide activities that explore local issues of equity and harmony. Lastly, I suggest that Korean ecological art curriculum interpret environmental responsibility through an ecological lens of contextuality, equity, and harmony.

However, their inherent design constraints often lead to large size and high cost. This thesis discusses several design improvements made to a prototype of a low cost low frequency underwater projector based on clarinet acoustics.\n\nFirst, a new pressure chamber was designed and built to improve water sealing, ease of assembly, as well as interface with a larger diameter pipe to reduce occurrence of cavitation. Lab measurements of the improved prototype were made using both PVC and aluminum based resonators, with two different reed configurations and tested at different blowing pressures. Analysis of measurement results showed how playing frequency varied with blowing pressure and resonator type. In particular, intermodulation products generated at high blowing pressures resulted in perception of a large drop in playing frequency. Distortion of the sound generated was also calculated and shown to increase at higher blowing pressures.\n\nSecond, improvements in the equivalent circuit model of the underwater clarinet were made by including effects of pressure chamber impedance and elastic wall. The chamber and resonator impedances were first modeled using COMSOL Multiphysics. Two-resonance and four-resonance equivalent circuit models were then derived to fit the acoustic impedances measured in COMSOL. Overall system impedance analysis and time domain simulation of the improved model were also performed. Results from the improved model provided explanation for the trends observed during measurements.\n\nFinally, a combination of measured sound pressure level and modeling was used to predict sound pressure level in the far field. The efficiency in converting input pneumatic power to acoustic power was also estimated using the model. By varying different design parameters in the model, the trade-offs between these parameters and the performance of the underwater clarinet were also discussed.

Specialization becomes more importance since it has frequently been applied to media technology (e.g., computer, web site or web agent) in an online context, in which multiple media technologies are employed as sources. The goals of this dissertation are (1) to explore the effects of specialization of media technology at multiple source layers (e.g., computer, web site, and web agent) on attitudes (e.g., trust) in HCI and (2) to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of specialized media technologies at multiple source layers on trust toward different trustees (e.g., media technology and product descriptions) and different dimensions of trust (e.g., cognitive and affective trust), with a focus on the role played by the nature of information processing (i.e., heuristic vs. systematic processing). Based on cognitive psychology, social psychology, and HCI literatures, with an emphasis on their relation to trust in e-commerce, two studies were conducted with an online shopping task for purchasing wines and online questionnaires. Findings strongly support the positive effects of specialization of media technology at multiple source layers on trust in HCI. In addition, web agent appears to be the most prominent of the three source layers, having specialization effects on trust toward web site, web agent, and product descriptions. Most notably, mechanisms underlining the interactions of specialization of media technologies as multiple sources uncover the significant role played by specialization in activating systematic processing alongside heuristic processing. The co-occurrence of the two processing modes influences cognitive and affective trust in media technology and product descriptions, showing support for the bias effect in online communication. These findings provide theoretical implications for understanding how and why individuals psychologically respond to media technology in HCI. The differential effects of specialization of media technology on different types of trust have useful implications for online service users and providers.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6765, 6766], "author_name_tesi": "Koh, Yoon Jeon ", "last_name_ssi": "Koh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yoon Jeon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["S.

Continued base-level rise during deposition of late Onondaga Fm. to early Union Springs mbr. drowned out the carbonate bank and produced a relatively deep, stratified basin into which the lower portion of the Marcellus Fm was deposited.  Correlations within the Marcellus Fm. indicate the Marcellus was deposited as a series of prograding muddy clinothems associated with the Mahantango Fm. delta complex.

Penicillium expansum, the primary cause of post-harvest decay in stored apples, is the most important source of PAT contamination in apples and processed apple products. Animal studies have demonstrated a variety of acute and chronic effects from ingestion of PAT including carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and mutagenicity. Based on long term animal and cell studies, FDA has established an action level for PAT in single strength apple juice at 50\u00ecg/kg (50 ppb).\nThe objectives of this study were to:\n1) Evaluate the thermal degradation kinetics of patulin (PAT) in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) and determine factors that affect the rate of the reaction. \n2) Establish relationships between factors and the rate constant of the degradation reaction and develop a predictive model.\n3) Validate the model and test its predictive power in apple juice (AJ).\n4) Identify products formed and elucidate a mechanism for the reaction between patulin and ascorbic acid.\nFactors affecting the degradation rate of PAT in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) were studied using an apple juice model system containing 0.5% malic acid. A mathematical model to describe the kinetics of the reaction was established and a predictive model for the rate constant of the degradation was developed using a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) approach.\nResults demonstrated that pH, initial concentration of AA and PAT and temperature significantly (p<0.05) affected the degradation rate of the toxin. Initially a second order kinetic model was used to describe the degradation of PAT and estimate the reaction rate constant. A significant predictive model was developed based on these estimations using an RSM design. Closer examination of the fit of the second order model, for experimental treatments, indicated the need for a more accurate and kinetic model.\n Therefore, the data were reanalyzed using the Weibull model to describe the degradation of PAT by AA in both a model system and a commercial apple juice. \nA wide range of temperatures was utilized (25-85oC) and the dependency of b and n Weibull parameters on temperature was determined. The reaction rate constant (Weibull parameter b) had an Arrhenius dependence on temperature (Arrhenius plot R2= 0.986) with an activation energy of Ea=29.6kJ/mol and a z-value of z=59.7oC. The Weibull shape parameter (n) was not temperature dependent. Thus, a simplified Weibull model was applied to the experimental data after setting the Weibull shape parameter n-0.44. The simplified Weibull model produced consistently good fit.\n\tA 3-factor- 3-level Box-Benhken design was then used to determine the effects of the initial levels of PAT, AA, and pH on the rate of the degradation reaction and to develop a model that sufficiently predicts the kinetic parameters at different processing conditions. The developed RSM model, after applying a logarithmic transformation to the response, was highly significant (p<0.001, R2= 0.97) and the lack of fit was not significant (p>0.05). Four validation experiments were carried out; three using the model system (malic acid buffer, pH 3.75), and one using a shelf-stable apple juice commercial product. Observed and predicted values were not statistically different (p<0.05), thus, confirming the predictive power of the model.\nExploratory studies were conducted to determine the mechanism for the degradation of PAT in the presence of AA in the model system. HPLC/PDA, LC/ESI/MS and LC/MS/MS were used to monitor the progress of the reaction. Although the results were inconclusive several degradation products of AA were determined and the reduction of PAT levels by AA was evident. The results from our model system studies suggested that PAT could be degrading via a redox mechanism or a Michael-like addition were ascorbate (nucleophile) attacks PAT (electrophile) to form adducts that will eventually lead to the opening of the lactone ring and the detoxification of PAT. \n \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5968], "author_name_tesi": "Kokkinidou, Smaro ", "last_name_ssi": "Kokkinidou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Smaro", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luke F Laborde", "Jonh Floros"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Luke F Laborde, Thesis Advisor", "Jonh Floros, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Patulin", "Degradation", "Ascorbic acid", "Weibull model", "Apple juice"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "USING SIMULATION TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF SELF&#8208;SERVICE TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION ON CUSTOMER WAITING TIMES AND SYSTEM OPERATING COSTS\n", "id": "11433", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "513", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of the present study was to examine the assumption that the implementation of self-service technology (SST) in a service delivery process could simultaneously improve service levels and decrease system operating costs, two performance measures of interest to decision makers. The context of the study was a hotel check-in process where, after SST implementation, customers would be able to choose between checking in using a self-service kiosk (SSK), or using a service employee.\nFirst, using a sample of hotel customers, an online scenario-based survey was used to determine whether the number of customers waiting in line was a predictor of customer choice between using a service employee and using an SSK. Second, a simulation model was developed to estimate the effect of SST implementation on service levels under different supply and demand conditions. Third, as service level and operating costs are somewhat conflicting objectives, a graphical approach to solving a bi-criteria selection problem was used to compare different combinations of service employees and SSKs. \nFindings of the scenario-based survey provide evidence that, in addition to their perceived usefulness, need for interaction, and anticipated quality, customers decide whether to use SST or use a service employee based on the length of the waiting line for each alternative. The results of the simulation study show that, under the assumed demand and supply conditions, SST provides satisfactory service levels at a lower operating cost. Furthermore, under high demand conditions, a service delivery process including SST outperforms a service delivery process where no SST alternative is available. When the SSK does not perform as well as expected, namely processing times and failure rates of the SSK are high, the introduction of SST has a negative impact on service levels.

Ensembles of numerical weather prediction models are often used to quantify the meteorological uncertainty, but ensembles are subject to sampling error and model deficiencies that can make the measure of uncertainty, ensemble variance, not representative of the actual uncertainty, as quantified by the error variance. Thus, there is a need to calibrate ensemble variances to more accurately represent the actual uncertainty in the forecast. This dissertation examines and further develops the Linear Variance Calibration (LVC) method as a way to calibrate meteorological wind variances for use in atmospheric transport and dispersion predictions.\n\nLVC is investigated in three ways. First, an idealized stochastic model is developed and used to determine fundamental properties and identify the role of sampling error. Second, LVC is applied to real short-term (0-4 day) meteorological ensemble data and evaluated for a number of different conditions over a year-long period. Finally, calibrations are applied to meteorological forecasts and used for atmospheric transport and dispersion forecasts to assess the impact of calibration on these forecasts.\n\nThe stochastic model shows that calibration is necessary for even \u201cperfect\u201d ensembles due to the sampling error created by using a finite-sized ensemble. The stochastic model also provides insight on the behavior of LVC parameters (slope and intercept). Application of LVC to real meteorological ensemble data from the NCEP Short-Range Ensemble Forecast shows that it performs well for most forecasts of 10-m above ground level wind. Calibrations calculated from real data show sensitivity to forecast lead time, season, time of day, and surface type (land vs. water). Results also show that calibrations calculated over a small geographic area may be suspect due to increased spatial correlation that lowers the effective sample size. Surface concentration and dosage forecasts that use calibrated meteorological wind variances from a meteorological ensemble generally have improved reliability and CRPS over forecasts using uncalibrated meteorological wind variances.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6497], "author_name_tesi": "Kolczynski, Walter Casmier", "last_name_ssi": "Kolczynski", "middle_name_ssi": "Casmier", "first_name_ssi": "Walter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Stauffer", "David R Stauffer", "Sue Ellen Haupt", "George Spencer Young", "Naomi S Altman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Stauffer, Dissertation Advisor", "David R Stauffer, Committee Chair", "Sue Ellen Haupt, Committee Chair", "George Spencer Young, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["calibration", "post-processing", "dispersion", "AT&D", "variance"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Many-Objective Groundwater Monitoring Network Design Using Bias-Aware Ensemble Kalman Filtering, Evolutionary Optimization, and Visual Analytics", "id": "10564", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3068", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation contributes the ASSIST (Adaptive Strategies for Sampling in Space and Time) framework for improving long-term groundwater monitoring (LTGM) decisions across space and time while accounting for the influences of systematic model errors (or predictive bias).  The new framework combines Monte Carlo based contaminant flow-and-transport modeling, bias-aware ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF), many-objective evolutionary optimization, and visual analytics-based decision support.  The ASSIST framework allows decision makers to forecast the value of investments in new observations for many objectives simultaneously.  Information tradeoffs are evaluated using an EnKF to forecast plume transport in space and time in the presence of uncertain and biased model predictions that are conditioned on uncertain measurement data.  The goal of the ASSIST framework is to provide decision makers with a fuller understanding of the information tradeoffs they must confront when performing long-term groundwater monitoring network design.\n\nEach chapter of this dissertation focuses on and addresses a specific challenge to LTGM network design.  The scaling challenges of LTGM design are first explored in order to provide a basis for advancing the size and scope of LTGM design problems that can be effectively solved using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).  In addition, complex decision variable interdependencies that exist in large LTGM design problems cause traditional MOEAs to fail as problem sizes increase (defined in terms of increasing numbers of decisions and objectives).  To address this, a new more robust MOEA termed the Epsilon-Dominance Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (e-hBOA) was developed to learn and exploit the complex interdependencies that exist for large LTGM design problems.  Building on the scalable many-objective optimization capabilities of  e-hBOA, the ASSIST framework contributes visual analytical tools, capable of providing decision makers with an improved understanding of the complex spatial and temporal tradeoffs that often exist between their LTGM design objectives.  Finally, a bias-aware EnKF framework was developed that dramatically enhances the accuracy of groundwater flow-and-transport forecasts in the presence of systematic modeling errors (or biases), while making computational innovations that again expand the size and scope of LTGM problems that can be addressed.\n\nThis dissertation demonstrates that the forecasting, search, and visualization components of the ASSIST framework combine to represent a significant advance for LTGM network design that has a strong potential to innovate our future characterization, prediction, and management of groundwater systems.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3057], "author_name_tesi": "Kollat, Joshua B", "last_name_ssi": "Kollat", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Patrick Reed", "Patrick M Reed", "Christopher J Duffy", "Thorsten Wagener", "Timothy William Simpson", "Peggy Ann Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Patrick Reed, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Chair", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member", "Thorsten Wagener, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["monitoring network design; multiobjective optimiza"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Role of Conditional Parental Regard and Excessively Contingent Self-Esteem in Children's Peer Relationships\n", "id": "7722", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5955", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current study sought to further clarify \nthe construct of self-esteem in adolescence, \nthe antecedents of adolescent self-esteem, \nand peer outcomes associated with different\nconfigurations of self-esteem.

The surface layers of these glasses are usually affected by their exposure to corrosive environments leading to structural modifications at the atomic scale. Such variations in surface mechanical properties of these glasses are expected to control a wide range of glass characteristics such as the flaw generation and propagation, glass strength and adhesion of coatings. The current study evaluated the mechanical property variations in commercial float glasses on a length scale equal to the thickness of the corrosion modified surface layer using nanoindentation. This provided an insight into the influence of surface cleaning treatments and corrosion on elastic and plastic response of the float glass surfaces. Variations in the reduced elastic modulus and hardness were evaluated for fresh soda-lime-silica float glass surfaces that were subjected to controlled surface cleaning treatments in pH 0.9 hydrochloric acid, pH 7.1 reverse osmosis water and pH 9.5 Alconox\u00ae solutions. Further, controlled experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of short-term corrosive exposure conditions such as weathering and leaching in de-ionized water on the surface mechanical properties of fresh float glass. Reduced elastic modulus variations in the range of 0.5 \u2013 9% and hardness variations from 2 \u2013 35% were observed due to these controlled exposure conditions. Effects of corrosion on the surface mechanical properties of the tin-enriched side of fresh float glass were found to be very different from the effects on the air side. The relative hardness of the tin side compared to the air side of the float glass was dependent on the exposure history of the glass, which may be the dominant factor that controls float glass surface mechanical properties. Nanoindentation experiments were also performed on 2, 6 and 8 mm thick aged commercial soda-lime-silica float glasses with known tin concentration profiles that had been exposed to laboratory air over a long period of 16 years. The indentation penetration depths lay between 50 and 225 nm, the region with the largest concentration and the steepest gradient of diffused tin. Attempts to correlate the trends in reduced elastic modulus and hardness of these surfaces with their tin concentration profiles\nindicated that the tin diffusion into float glass was not the most dominant parameter affecting their mechanical properties. Upon comparing the reduced elastic modulus and hardness results of the aged 2 mm thick float glass with those from the 2 mm thick fresh float glass that was subjected to different controlled exposure conditions, it appeared that the aged float glasses were also being affected by their exposure history. The reduced elastic modulus and hardness of the tin side of the fresh float glass were found to nearly invariant after exposing to corrosive environments, indicating that the tin side was more resistant to corrosion. Further, the less resistant air side underwent reduction in hardness and reduced modulus after corrosion due to which the corresponding tin sides were harder and had a higher modulus. While an earlier study had indicated that the tin side may be harder than the tin side, a few others had reported that the possibilities of tin side possessing the same or lower hardness and elastic modulus as compared to the air side. Based on the results from both fresh and aged float glasses, these contradictory observations in the published literature are attributed to the exposure history dependence of float glass. The fact that even the short duration surface cleaning treatments significantly affected the reduced elastic modulus of these float glass surfaces raises serious questions about the use of silicate glasses to calibrate nanoindentation systems.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4962], "author_name_tesi": "Kolluru, Pavan Venkata Narayana", "last_name_ssi": "Kolluru", "middle_name_ssi": "Venkata Narayana", "first_name_ssi": "Pavan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher L Muhlstein", "David John Green", "Carlo G Pantano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher L Muhlstein, Thesis Advisor", "David John Green, Thesis Advisor", "Carlo G Pantano, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Float glass", "tin diffusion", "aging", "weathering", "leaching", "surface cleaning", "pH", "nanoindentation", "reduced elastic modulus", "hardness"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Study of bonding and doping properties of sp^2 carbon\nnanostructures: numerical simulations and development of empirical interaction potentials.", "id": "6308", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "509", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The main topics of this dissertation are the development of empirical\ninteraction potentials and the study of electronic and mechanical\nproperties of sp^2-bonded carbon nanostructures.\n\nFirst, we investigate the weak interlayer binding in graphitic\nstructures. We argue that that although the absolute cohesion is not\nproperly described in the local DFT approximations, the {it\nvariation} in the binding energy under interlayer shifts appears to be\nmuch more sound than previously suspected. We combine this result with\nexperimental data to introduce a new empirical potential, which\ndescribes the variation in the inerlayer binding with the relative\nalignment (registry) of the layers. Lacking a registry dependence, the\ncommonly used Lennard-Jones potential significantly underestimates the\nvariation in energy. We use our potential to study interwall sliding\nin nested nanotubes. We find that the well-defined geometry and\nextreme structural anisotropy of a multiwalled carbon nanotube can\nbring qualitatively new features to its nanometer-scale\ntribology. Efficient cancellation of registration-dependent\ninteractions in incommensurate tubes (and also, surprisingly, certain\naxial commensurate tubes) can induce extremely small and {it\nnonextensive} shear strengths. This result suggests the use of\nmultiwalled carbon nanotubes as nanoscale bearings. We also apply our\npotential to look at the alingment of nanotubes on a graphitic\nsubstrate. We discover that the interaction of a one-dimensional tube\nwith a two-dimensional substrate then leads to an unusual registry\nphenomenon not visible in standard layer-on-layer growth: the system\ndevelops favorable orientations which clearly are incommensurate.

Using a\nself-consistent tight-binding model we examine the radial distribution\nof charge in a bromine-doped double-walled carbon nanotube system. Our\nresults confirm recent Raman measurements that most of the charge\nresides on the outer wall, even when the outer nanotube is\nsemiconducting and the inner nanotube is metallic.

Therefore, reduction of reheating costs is one of the major challenges in rolling mills. The reheating furnaces are usually controlled manually by operators who must respond to changes in downstream rolling conditions. Their reheating furnace control is not consistent and has been observed to depend on operator characteristics, experiences or skills. \n\tIn many cases, steel billet lots are small, requiring various types of billets/blooms with different specifications to be heated in a furnace at the same time. This means that it is hard to find the optimal heating conditions due to changes in product mix. Additionally, once operational troubles happen at downstream rolling operations, unexpected stoppages are caused. The operators of furnaces are then required to adjust reheating furnace temperatures so that billet/bloom overheating does not occur.  It is also difficult to re-establish steady-state reheating condition after the stoppages, because the bulk temperature of the billets/blooms, can be quite different than the observed billet/bloom surface temperature. Therefore, the operators have to rely on their experience when making furnace adjustment during and after stoppages.\n\tIn this research, a billet simulation model for a walking hearth type reheating furnace was created and an optimization method for economical operation is proposed. The simulation model employs a three dimensional (3-D) difference method and a dynamic programming methodology developed in Matlab. Also, the thermal radiation view factor from bricks inside furnaces to billets/blooms was calculated dynamically. The hearth temperature was approximated using the simulated bottom face temperature of billets. \n\tIn the optimization method, the extraction temperatures of billets are predicted for current operating conditions. Based on the result, the furnace temperature in each zone of the furnace is controlled. The major feature of this control strategy is having two policies. One is targeting the zone and the time period where billets temperatures can be controlled effectively in changing furnace temperature set points, considering heating and cooling delay and updating the feasible region dynamically. The other is prioritizing the zones for increasing furnace temperature. It was first zone 3, then zone 2, then zone1 and finally zone 4, considering the differences in heat transmission efficiency. \n\tThe final goal of this thesis is to develop an optimization method that can find an optimal solution for furnace temperature control within 10 [min]. This goal was achieved by developing a 2-D billet temperature simulation model, selecting appropriate time increments and mesh size, setting amplifier and lower limiter for temperature increments in optimization, and selective billet tracking for optimization for billet temperature increments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10823, 10824, 10825, 10826], "author_name_tesi": "Kominami, Masahito ", "last_name_ssi": "Kominami", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Masahito", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dynamic Programming", "Optimization", "Furnace control", "Simulation", "Heat transmission", "Difference method"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DESIGN, MODELING AND OPTIMIZATION OF PIEZOELECTRIC ACTUATORS\n", "id": "10439", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2209", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-01-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microactuators provide controlled motion and force for applications ranging from RF switches to microfluidic valves.  Large amplitude response in piezoelectric actuators requires amplification of  the small strain, exhibited by the piezoelectric material, used in the construction of such actuators.  This research studies a uniflex microactuator that combines the strain amplification mechanisms of a unimorph and flexural motion to produce large displacement and blocking force. The design and fabrication of the proposed uniflex microactuator are described in detail. An analytical model is developed with three connected beams and a reflective symmetric boundary condition that predicts actuator displacement and blocking force as a function of the applied voltage.  The model shows that the uniflex design requires appropriate parameter ranges, especially the clearance between the unimorph and aluminum cap, to ensure that both the unimorph and flexural  amplification effects are realized.  With a weakened joint at the unimorph/cap interface, the model is found to predict the displacement and blocking force for the actuators fabricated in this work.\nThis research also compares the performance of a uniflex actuator in terms of its displacement and blocking force  with uniflex and flextensional actuators.  Analytical models for displacement and blocking force for all the three actuators are used in optimization, to study their relative performance. The uniflex actuator outperforms both unimorph and flextensional actuators in displacement, but, the unimorph actuator generates more blocking force. The uniflex actuator can therefore be used in applications that demand higher displacement and lower blocking force compared to a unimorph actuator.\n\n\nThis research introduces a novel  T-beam actuator that can be fabricated by micromachining using a piezoelectric MEMS fabrication process or by dicing using a saw. With a T-shaped cross-section, and bottom and top flange and web electrodes, a cantilevered beam can bend in-plane and out-of-plane with unimorph actuation in both directions. Analytical models are developed to predict displacement, blocking force, and mechanical energy. Six prototypes of these T-beam actuators are fabricated by dicing and electrodes are deposited by photolithography and experimentally tested. The experimentally validated models are used to optimize the cross-section geometry for maximum displacement, blocking force, and mechanical energy. It is found that a cross section with  ratio of web width b to total width s , b*, and flange thickness, t, to total height, h, t*, approaching zero produces maximum displacement. Also, the tip displacement is independent of bounding box of T-beam. The cross section with b*=t*=0.381 produces maximum blocking force, while, b*=0.25, t*=0.33 produces maximum mechanical energy. A properly designed T-beam has better free tip displacement per unit cross section area than a unimorph.

The Arctic warming is greater than any other region on Earth, however, the degree of warming is inconsistent among the climate models even for the same emission scenarios. Clouds, especially low-level clouds, are a prevailing feature of the Arctic atmosphere. They strongly affect the surface radiative and energy budgets, which make them a key component of the Arctic climate. Recent inter-comparison studies using regional climate models show that models are incapable of reproducing the supercooled liquid water observed in clouds during the cold season. Large discrepancies exist in the partitioning of phase between ice and liquid water among different models. It is currently thought that these discrepancies are due to the uncertainties in ice nuclei concentrations, ice nucleation, and ice crystal habits used in models. Predicting these physical processes controls the partitioning between liquid and ice, and hence the impact of mixed-phase clouds on the surface energy budget. There is a need to improve model cloud predictions in the Arctic, however, the microphysical uncertainties mentioned above are tied directly to the cloud dynamics that help maintain persistent mixed-phase clouds. Therefore, this dissertation analyzes and inter-compares the impacts of different ice nuclei concentrations, ice nucleation mechanisms and ice crystal habits on mixed-phase cloud dynamics. Separate simulations using different ice nuclei concentrations, ice nucleation mechanisms, and crystal habits are performed. It is found that the choice of habits in models alters the water paths and cloud dynamics strongly. Next, the relative importance of and interactions among the processes that influence the dynamics of the cloud, such as the radiative cooling at cloud top, and the ice precipitation induced cloud-base stabilization are investigated. To examine these processes in detail, sensitivity studies are performed by fixing the radiative cooling, and the diabatic influences of ice precipitation. In addition, simulations with increasing ice nuclei concentrations, different nucleation mechanisms, and crystal habits are repeated with surface fluxes and large-scale forcing included. The influence of surface fluxes is important as it can compensate for the water mass that is lost through ice precipitation if the ice precipitation is weak. Surface fluxes can also lead to the coupling of the liquid cloud layer with the sub-cloud layer. The cloud-base stability is diminished with the inclusion of the surface fluxes, and the effect of entrainment is enhanced. Sensitivity tests are also repeated with the added surface fluxes.

The goals of this project were to test the efficacy of the mechanical string thinner in the Mid-Atlantic region, and to determine the mode of action of the string thinner. Trials conducted in 2010 and 2011 at Penn State\u2019s Fruit Research and Extension Center in Biglerville, PA, tested six levels of thinning severity treatments (spindle speeds) to determine an effective range on field grown \u2018Buckeye Gala\u2019/M.9 apple trees. Treatments were applied to the same trees for two consecutive years to determine any cumulative effects of using the string thinner on apple. A linear reduction in blossom clusters per limb cross-sectional area, individual blossom number per spur, and leaf area per spur occurred as the level of thinning severity increased. The string thinner reduced cropload as thinning severity increased, but injury to spur leaves early in the season limited any benefit of increased fruit size. Since cropload was reduced as thinning severity increased, fruit quality was enhanced. Increased thinning severity treatments had no effect on return bloom, but increased annual trunk growth. Spindle speeds of 180 - 210 rpm provided the best overall thinning response and minimized injury to spur leaves. Further work will be required to determine if applying mechanical thinning treatments at earlier phenological stages may reduce the injury to spur leaves. A greenhouse trial was conducted on potted \u2018Buckeye Gala\u2019/M.9 apple trees to further elucidate the mode of action of the string thinner.  Mechanical thinning treatments increased the rates of ethylene evolution of shoot leaves, and aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) effectively reduced the rates of ethylene production, and prevented the string thinner-induced wound ethylene response. Net photosynthesis, vegetative growth, and dry matter accumulation was not impacted by thinning severity treatment or AVG.

Time-accurate simulation of propeller unsteady forces using a viscous flow solver requires an expensive, full-wheel, dynamic grid of the rotating geometry.  These computational costs can be reduced by modeling the propeller unsteady force response using a volumetric body force representation of the propeller.  Existing body force models are only quasi-steady, defining propeller powering using open-water operating curves.  Other methods specify the unsteady body force by linking to separate lifting-surface simulations of the propeller, which are expensive.  Therefore, integrating a propeller unsteady-body-force model with a viscous flow solver can simplify gridding and reduce computational costs for maneuvering and sea-keeping simulations of ships and submarines, which are characterized by propeller inflow variations.\nThis work calibrates an unsteady, sharp-edged gust response model for low-aspect ratio blades in sheared flow, typical of turbomachinery applications.  The gust-response model is integrated with an existing, steady, body-force representation of a propeller in a viscous flow solver.  The resulting unsteady-body-force model is validated against geometrically-resolved, unsteady simulations of a propeller in spatially-varying flow.  The unsteady-body-force model correctly predicts propeller unsteady force and moment directionality based on inflow harmonic content.  The magnitude and phase of forces and moments generated by the unsteady-body-force model compare well with geometrically-resolved, unsteady simulations, and match published results from unsteady lifting-surface codes.  The unsteady-body-force model reduces computational costs and grid size by 44% relative to the geometrically-resolved, unsteady simulation.

Mn oxides are the only minerals known to oxidize Cr(III) to Cr(VI) in both experimental and natural systems. Cr(VI), a mobile contaminant in groundwater, can promote carcinogenesis in humans. Cr(III), however, is a nonreactive trace metal essential for glucose uptake by mammals. Among all Mn oxide polymorphs, birnessite induces the fastest oxidation kinetics and the highest reactivity with Cr(III). However, the mechanism of electron transfer between dissolved Cr and Mn oxide particles, particularly with respect to birnessite, is poorly understood. Mitigation and remediation of Cr(VI) requires a quantitative knowledge of this mechanism. \nHere we present a novel method for simultaneous measurement of the birnessite structure and the extent of Cr oxidation at different solution pH conditions. We collected time-resolved synchrotron X-ray diffraction (TR-XRD) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) patterns of triclinic Na-birnessite every 15 minutes while passing pH controlled 1.0 mM Cr(III) nitrate solutions through a capillary cell. In addition, we quantified Cr(VI) concentrations of the eluate solution every150 minutes using spectrophotometry.\nConsistent with Fendorf and Zasoski (1992), we observed an increased rate of Cr(VI) production with decreasing pH.  We attribute the comparatively slow kinetics of Cr(III) oxidation at pH 5.0 and 4.0 to a transformation from triclinic to hexagonal birnessite. This solid-state transition reproducibly coincided with a ~10-fold decline in the oxidation of aqueous Cr(III). In the presence of triclinic birnessite, 25 mol% of the influent Cr(III) was oxidized to Cr(VI), dropping to 3 mol% after the transformation to hexagonal birnessite. Control experiments without Cr(III) revealed no evidence for birnessite transformation within the same time range, and experiments with hexagonal birnessite as the starting material generated solutions with low concentrations (~3 mol%) of dissolved Cr(VI) from start to finish. \nAt pH 3.0 and 2.0, however, production of Cr(VI) was consistently higher than was observed at pH 5.0 and 4.0.  Specifically, at pH 2, 80 mol% of the influent Cr(III) was oxidized to Cr(VI) for the duration of the experiment.  In addition, we monitored the continuous elution of aqueous Mn(II) at pH 3.0 and 2.0, whereas we found little evidence for aqueous Mn(II) in solutions at pH 5.0 and 4.0.  We detected no crystalline Cr (hydr)oxide precipitates during the reactions at any pH. XANES analysis showed evidence for both Cr (III) and Cr(VI) adsorbing onto the surface of birnessite at all pH concentrations. \nWe propose that Cr(III) is oxidized to Cr(VI) by an electron exchange that reduces Mn(III) in birnessite to Mn(II).  At pH 3.5 and higher, the structure of birnessite consequently transforms to hexagonal birnessite. By this pathway, the birnessite crystal structure critically controls the oxidation of dissolved Cr(III) due to the accessibility of reactive Mn(III) in triclinic birnessite relative to hexagonal birnessite. Below pH 3.5, however, birnessite dissolution systematically exposes reactive sites that enable the continuous oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI).", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15510], "author_name_tesi": "Kong, Kyeong Pil", "last_name_ssi": "Kong", "middle_name_ssi": "Pil", "first_name_ssi": "Kyeong", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney", "Matthew S Fantle", "Lee Kump"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew S Fantle, Committee Member", "Lee Kump, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Manganese Oxides", "Birnessite", "Chromium", "Oxidation", "XANES", "X-ray", "Diffraction"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Electrospinning of starch fibers", "id": "15314", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7676", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many efforts to spin starch fibers have been reported in the patent and research literature. All reported spinning methods are dependent upon addition of non-starch components, e.g. other polymers, plasticizers or cross-linkers. In the present study, a method of producing pure starch fibers by an electrospinning technique was demonstrated. This method involves choosing an appropriate solvent for native high amylose starch and spinning on a modified electrospinning setup. Resulting starch fibers have diameters in the order of microns. Post-spinning treatments were employed to increase the crystallinity and cross-link the starch fibers. Electrospinning of starch/clay and starch/ microcrystalline cellulose composite fibers was also demonstrated.\nCorrelation between the rheological properties of starch dispersions and the electrospinnability was established via the extrapolation of the critical entanglement concentration, which is the boundary between the semidilute unentangled regime and the semidilute entangled regime. Dispersions of high amylose starch containing nominally 80% amylose (Gelose 80) required 1.2 to 2.7 times the entanglement concentration for effective electrospinning. Besides starch concentration, molecular conformation and shear viscosity were also of importance in determining the electrospinnability.  The rheological properties and electrospinnability of different starches were studied. Hylon VII and Hylon V starches, containing nominally 70 and 50 % amylose, respectively, required concentrations of 1.9 and 3.7 times their entanglement concentrations for electrospinning. Only poor fibers were obtained from mung bean starch, which contains about 35 % amylose, while starches with even lower amylose contents could not be electrospun.\nThe diameter of the starch fibers produced by electrospinning is a key parameter for most potential applications. Hence, a quantitative relationship between fiber diameter and certain electrospinning parameters, i.e. starch concentration, applied voltage, spinning distance and feed rate, was established by empirical modeling using a fractional factorial experimental design in a constrained region. Response surface methodology was employed to analyze the interactions of the electrospinning parameters. The starch fiber diameter was found to be more responsive to starch concentration than to voltage and distance in the experiment range. Contour plots were used to predict the direction to minimize and maximize the fiber diameters. The smallest fiber diameter (3.98 \u00b5m) can be obtained within the experiment range, whereas the largest fiber diameter is outside of the experimental design region.\nThe starch fibers have potential in various applications, e.g., in the food, textile, and biomedical industries. The formation of starch-guest inclusion complexes is a particular interest for encapsulation of certain molecules. Two methods were used to electrospin starch fibers with starch-guest inclusion complexes: a dope mixing method, where guest material was mixed into the starch dispersion prior to electrospinning, and a bath mixing method, where guest material was mixed into the coagulation bath into which starch dispersions were electrospun. Selected guest compounds, i.e. palmitic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, and cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide, formed inclusion complexes with starch in the electrospun starch fibers. Due to fast precipitation of starch, the coagulation bath containing 100% ethanol was not as efficient as 75% ethanol aqueous solution to induce starch-guest inclusion complex formation. Starch-ascorbyl palmitate inclusion complexes were also formed in electrosprayed powders by a dope mixing method, but this method was less efficient than their formation in electrospun fibers. \nEncapsulation of these molecules in electrospun starch fibers and electrosprayed starch powders may increase their stability during processing, storage, and in the gastrointestinal tract, while providing controlled release properties. However, further research is necessary to gain a better understanding of the encapsulation and release of the molecules that can be entrapped in starch fibers through intra-helical inclusion complex formation, inter-helical encapsulation, and physical macroscopic entrapment.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7611], "author_name_tesi": "Kong, Lingyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Kong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lingyan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gregory Ray Ziegler", "Donald B Thompson", "John Neil Coupland", "Seong Han Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gregory Ray Ziegler, Dissertation Advisor", "Donald B Thompson, Committee Member", "John Neil Coupland, Committee Member", "Seong Han Kim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrospinning", "starch", "fiber", "rheology", "empirical modeling", "encapsulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Topographically-based Landscape-scale Ecological Mapping in Pennsylvania", "id": "7100", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4737", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With emphasis on sustainable ecosystem management, ecological mapping at landscape scale provides basic information about the nature and distribution of ecosystems for natural resources management, planning, monitoring and assessment.  Landtype association (LTA) and ecological landtype (ELT) are two landscape scales of ecological units in a hierarchical ecological classification system developed by the USDA-Forest Service for use in ecosystem management.  LTA is a complex of complementary landscape components (ecological landtypes) that combine through spatial adjacency to create ecological contrasts across regions.  ELT is a subdivision of LTA unit based on similarities in landform, soils, geomorphic processes, and plant associations.  The goal of this study is to develop, describe and verify a scientifically based system of map units for Pennsylvania that incorporates ecological principles and processes across landtype association and ecological landtype scales.\nAt the LTA level, the influences of topography and terrain topology on ecosystem distributions motivated an ecological mapping approach with the concern for ecological, hydrologic and environmental aspects of the area that separates LTA units into three major categories, as highland habitat (HH), transitional terrace (TT), and dual drainage (DD).  Highland habitat is designated as being primarily headwater stream areas composed of mounding or arching to level upper land surfaces.  Dual drainage is designated to be areas having both large streams and small tributary streams.  Transitional terrace is intermediate level elevated terrain unit that is otherwise similar to highland habitat, but also receives some hydrologic influx from adjacent upland along partial margin.  A GIS-assisted, top-down classification method was adopted in the mapping procedure, and produced 10,782 LTA units delineated across the state with size ranging from 100 to 5,000 acres.  These units were classified into eighteen subtypes according to their topographic and hydrologic characteristics.  \nAt the ELT level, considered as unique combinations of topography and soil characteristics, the mapping units were generated by aggregating adjacent soil SSURGO polygons with same soil series, aspect and similar slopes.  There were 699,336 ELT units mapped for sixty-four counties in the state where soil data are available with the size ranging from 10 to 100 acres.\nRelationships between the resulting ecological units and other spatial information were analyzed.  The results indicate that physiographic characteristics, stream node and drainage densities, land cover patterns, and vertebrate species habitat distributions have substantial differences between different types of ecological units.\nIn general, the highland habitats and transitional terraces have larger size, higher average elevation and relief, and steeper slope compared to the dual drainage units.  The ELT units in highland habitats and transitional terraces also tend to have larger size and steeper slope.\nThe hydrologic characteristics of LTA units indicate that in most of the physiographic subsections the first-order stream node density is much higher in the highland habitats and transitional terraces, whereas higher order stream node densities are higher in the dual drainages.  Drainage densities are higher in dual drainages for all stream orders.  In different LTA subtypes, the stream node and drainage density patterns also have definite differences.  This establishes that the LTA mapping in this study can effectively separate headwater areas from downstream drainage areas, and also that the LTA subtype classification can separate different hydrologic characteristics in each subtype.\nLand cover has different patterns in different landtype associations.  There are more intensive human land use areas located in the dual drainage units, whereas forests are more likely to be extensive in the highland habitats and transitional terraces.  It is shown that the LTA unit types reflect the preference of human activities, thus determining the distribution patterns of forest and wildlife habitats.\nMost of the vertebrate species also have significantly different potential habitat distributions between the HH/TT and DD types of LTA units in each physiographic component.  Some key species can be identified having strong affinity for certain kinds of LTA units.  Highland habitats and transitional terraces are favorable for species associated with headwater streams, exposed environment and forest land cover types.  Dual drainages are favorable for species associated with moist environments and large streams.  The results confirm that LTA units can separate different habitats at the landscape level.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4702], "author_name_tesi": "Kong, Ningning ", "last_name_ssi": "Kong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ningning", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wayne Lawrence Myers", "Denice Heller Wardrop", "Charles Andrew Cole", "Rick Lane Day"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wayne Lawrence Myers, Committee Chair", "Denice Heller Wardrop, Committee Member", "Charles Andrew Cole, Committee Member", "Rick Lane Day, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["landtype association", "ecological landtype", "topography", "Pennsylvania"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Are We Making Progress? \ndisparities in regional lymph node evaluation and overall survival among black and white women with non-disseminated breast cancer\n", "id": "18116", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8755", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nResearch Objective: \nOne in three cancers diagnosed among women is breast cancer. Despite the fact that research has advanced early stage breast cancer diagnosis and treatment dramatically over the past decades, black-white gaps in breast cancer-related mortality persist. This study examines whether race is significantly associated with the likelihood of lymph node evaluation, a key diagnostic and treatment procedure, among black and white women with non-disseminated breast cancer, whether lymph node evaluation is independently associated with risk of dying within the follow-up period, controlling for race, and whether the odds of having lymph node examination have improved since 2004, overall and by race. \nStudy Design:\nData were drawn from 2012 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Data, which were linked to county attributes. Multivariate logistic regression models predicting lymph node evaluation among women with non-disseminated breast cancer were estimated controlling for explanatory variables including individual factors (race, age, stage at diagnosis, tumor grade, and marital status), treatment factors (surgery, radiation), and county-level factors (metropolitan county or not, median household income, percentage of the population with at least a college degree, and percentage of the female population aged 40+ receiving mammography within the previous two years). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazard regression modeling were also conducted in this study.\nPopulation Studied:\nA total of 269,122 black and white female primary breast cancer patients were identified. All women were diagnosed from 2004 to 2009 with stage I, II, or III breast cancer. \nPrincipal Findings:\n1) Among women in the sample, 89% were white and 11% were black. Overall, 9% of the sample did not undergo any regional lymph node evaluation. Nearly half (48%) had radiation therapy; 97% had surgery; 87% were diagnosed with early stage breast cancer (Stage I or Stage II); 13% were diagnosed at a later stage (Stage III); 89% of the people lived in metropolitan areas. 2) The odds of receiving lymph node examination were 22% lower for black women compared with those of white women, controlling for stage and other factors. 3) Not having lymph node evaluation was a major risk factor associated with overall survival (Hazard Ratio=2.16, 95% Confidence Interval=2.09-2.25). Among women diagnosed in 2004, the odds of surviving 5 years were 22% lower for black women than those of their white counterparts. 4) Compared to those diagnosed in 2004, women diagnosed between 2006 and 2009 were more likely to have their lymph nodes examined. Significant progress in lymph node evaluation has been made since 2004, overall and by race.  \nConclusions:\nSignificant progress in lymph node evaluation and improvement in breast cancer death is observed in recent years, overall and by race. More progress has been shown for blacks compared with their white counterparts since 2004.The racial gap in lymph node evaluation and in overall death rates is no longer statistically significant by 2009. \nImplications for Policy, Delivery or Practice:\nEnhancing quality of care including monitoring measures such as lymph node evaluation, an important diagnostic and treatment procedure, especially among disadvantaged women may reduce disparities in overall breast cancer survival. Despite of the significant progress in both lymph node evaluation and breast cancer death, lack of improvement was still found in certain groups of patients, who were younger, had no surgery, or contained missing information, suggesting additional policy interventions are needed in hard-to-reach subpopulations. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8611], "author_name_tesi": "Kong, Weihong ", "last_name_ssi": "Kong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Weihong", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Breast Cancer", "Disparities", "Lymph node evaluation", "survival", "progress"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Method of Selecting and Configuring Optimal energy Absorbing Cargo Restraint Systems to Improve Crashworthiness\n\n", "id": "11219", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6619", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the development of methods and tools to design optimal energy absorbing cargo restraint systems to improve crashworthiness, and demonstrates them in a sample design study.  The energy absorbing cargo restraint systems considered have two components: load limiter and lanyard. The load limiter acts as the energy absorbing device of the restraint system. A closed-form solution does not exist due to the changing geometry of the configuration during a crash and the nonlinear behavior of the restraints. Therefore, a cargo dynamics simulation (CDS) was developed to analyze the interaction between the cabin floor, cargo, and restraint system in a crash event. The simulation solves a system of state-variable equation for six degree-of-freedom rigid body dynamics. An optimization method was developed in which the cargo dynamics simulation is coupled with Applied Research Laboratory Trade Space Visualizer (ATSV) \u2014 a multi-dimensional data exploration and visualization software \u2014 to exercise the simulation over the design space and visualize the results. A comparative study was conducted to compare restraint system components and the results from static and dynamic analysis. A parametric study was conducted to provide a rule-of-thumb for tie-down angles that would optimize the design of simple restraint configurations. Design studies are presented as exercises of the optimization method for a generic cargo handling scenario. The crash loads and parameters for the analytical studies were obtained from U.S. Department of Defense specifications as provided in the Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide and MIL-STD-1290. The results of the comparative and optimization studies revealed the importance of lanyard characteristics in restraint system performance. The ideal lanyard was found to exhibit high stiffness, high strength, low weight, and low elongation. The allowable cargo displacement constraint proved to be the most influential factor in optimal restraint system design. Within the confined space of the aircraft, centimeters of displacement can be the difference between a survivable and fatal crash. Finally, a new set of requirements and design criteria are proposed to address normal flight maneuvering conditions, crash conditions, and usability. The requirements were created to provide guidance to cargo handlers for using energy absorbing cargo restraint systems.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6617], "author_name_tesi": "Kong, William ", "last_name_ssi": "Kong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Smith", "Edward Smith", "Michael Andrew Yukish"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Edward Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Andrew Yukish, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["multi-objective optimization", "cargo restraints", "crashworthiness", "cargo dynamics", "crash simulation", "energy absorbers"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE IMPACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL\u2019S LOCUS OF CONTROL ON MESSAGE PERSUASIVENESS", "id": "7946", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6846", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n Considerable research has been done in the past on the relationship between health message effectiveness and recipients\u2019 characteristics, such as motivations and involvement. However, the role of the recipients\u2019 beliefs about locus of control belief on health message effectiveness has not been fully explored. This study attempts to extend prior literature by examining the moderating role of individuals\u2019 chronic and temporary locus of control on message framing effectiveness. It posits that preexisting locus of control and message framing will have interaction effects on message persuasiveness. The current research used two experimental studies to test this assumption in the context of obesity. The first experiment found that individuals with high chronic internal locus of control were more likely to enhance behavioral intentions when they were exposed to individual responsibility messages than social responsibility messages. This observed effect only occurred when individuals were also low in chronic external locus of control. However, individuals with high chronic external locus of control were not more persuaded by social responsibility messages than by individual responsibility messages, even though they were also low in chronic internal locus of control. The second experiment demonstrated that locus of control can be temporarily primed. It found that there was a congruity effect between primed locus of control and responsibility framing. This effect was found for individuals in both high and low cognitive load conditions. \nOverall, this study is the first to examine the moderating effects of both chronic and temporary locus of control on message effects. It provides some evidence in support of the need to tailor health communication messages to the individual\u2019s locus of control. It also extends research on health message framing from traditional valence framing to responsibility framing. Such a new approach has the advantage of allowing researchers to examine health issues not only at an individual level, but also at societal level. The results of this study can also have important practical implications as many of today\u2019s health issues, such as smoking and binge drinking, are often discussed and interpreted in terms of both individual and social factors. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6843], "author_name_tesi": "Kong, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Kong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fuyuan Shen", "Francis Erin Dardis", "Heidi Hatfield Edwards", "Margaret Grace Meloy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fuyuan Shen, Committee Chair", "Francis Erin Dardis, Committee Member", "Heidi Hatfield Edwards, Committee Member", "Margaret Grace Meloy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Locus of Control", "Responsibility Framing"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "A COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS OF THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR DISASTER", "id": "7056", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6444", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research focused on some of the major consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and their effect on the Ukrainian economy.  Specifically, it focused on the indirect longer-term impacts of the Chernobyl accident on every major sector of the economy.  These impacts included changes in the supply, price, and import quantities of goods and services in different sectors of the economy; private consumption; public sector demand; investment; domestic market price, import and export prices, wage rate, return to capital, and wages. These results may be used by policy makers and other researchers to better understand the sectoral distribution of the impact of such disasters and provide resources where most needed. To estimate these indirect effects, state-of-the-art methods such as a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modeling were used. This was the first application of this methodology to the study of the Chernobyl accident. \nSeveral direct consequences were estimated: approximately 4,661 people are expected to have cancers attributable to Chernobyl in the 15 years following the accident. Another 9,281 people are expected to have other serious illnesses. Another important direct consequence is the decline in the birth rate coefficient, due mostly to the physiological effects of the disaster. The estimated decline in the birth coefficient due to Chernobyl was expected to be approximately 0.93 between 1986 and 1989 in Ukraine. This accounts for 24,309 workers. These direct effects were applied in simulations to estimate the sectoral distribution of the longer-term impacts. Without the Chernobyl accident, sectoral production would have been higher while prices would have been lower. Changes in production ranged between 0.1% and 1.7% depending on the scenario and sector. Generally, sectors can be divided into 3 categories: very sensitive, medium and low sensitive. Some sectors are more sensitive than others. This may be due to a specific structure in the economy and the intensity with which each sector is using labor and capital.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6443], "author_name_tesi": "Konovalchuk, Vladimir V", "last_name_ssi": "Konovalchuk", "middle_name_ssi": "V", "first_name_ssi": "Vladimir", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Gerard Abler", "Jill Leslie Findeis", "Francis X Higdon", "Thomas Henry Bruening"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Gerard Abler, Committee Chair", "Jill Leslie Findeis, Committee Member", "Francis X Higdon, Committee Member", "Thomas Henry Bruening, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM", "CHERNOBYL", "UKRAINE", "ECONOMIC EFFECTS", "NUCLEAR DISASTER"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "IDENTIFICATION OF RESIDUES WITHIN THE 35-AMINO-ACID SPACING REGION OF ROUS SARCOMA VIRUS INTEGRASE THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR INTERACTIONS WITH ITS VIRAL AND NONVIRAL DNA SUBSTRATES\n\n", "id": "7811", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6529", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Retrovirus replication requires insertion of the viral genomic DNA into the DNA of the host.  This insertion is mediated by the viral integrase enzyme.  A better understanding of how integrase interacts with these two DNA substrates is important for both the development of antiretroviral drugs and for improved retroviral vectors for gene therapy.\n\tIntegrase specifically recognizes the viral DNA and removes the terminal nucleotides from the 3' end of each strand (this reaction is referred to as processing).  The enzyme then inserts this trimmed DNA nonspecifically into the host DNA (this reaction is referred to as DNA joining).  Interestingly, avian integrases are known to nick viral DNA at both the biologically relevant site and one nucleotide away from that site when reactions are done in the presence of manganese.  However, mutations at residue 124 of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) integrase yielded enzymes that are more specific for nicking at the biologically relevant site.  One of these mutations, S124D, is markedly enhanced for processing activity, both in terms of specificity and effiency, but is dramatically impaired for DNA joining activity.  Additional mutations were constructed to determine what properties of the aspartate substitution result in this activity profile.  It was found that both the negative charge, the position of the negative charge, and the structure of the substituted amino acid all contributed to the S124D\u2019s activity profile.  Moreover, the S124D protein was found to be impaired for binding to nonviral DNA.\nAll retroviral integrases contain a conserved D,D-35-E motif within the core domain.  The three acidic residues are known to be required for enzymatic activity, but the importance of the conserved 35-amino-acid spacing is unknown.  Mutations were constructed in a flexible loop within this 35-amino-acid spacing that altered the length of the spacing or the flexibility of the loop.  It appears that the flexibility of the loop is more important for interactions with viral DNA than nonviral DNA.  Additionally, enzymes with alterations to the spacing maintained enzymatic activity.  However, virions containing these mutations were defective for replication, suggesting that the 35-amino-acid spacing is important for virus replication.  Together, these data show that the D,D-35-E motif participates in distinct and separable functions for integrase acitivity.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6528], "author_name_tesi": "Konsavage, Wesley Merle", "last_name_ssi": "Konsavage", "middle_name_ssi": "Merle", "first_name_ssi": "Wesley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Katzman", "David Joseph Spector", "John Warren Wills", "Leslie Joan Parent", "Ira Joseph Ropson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Katzman, Committee Chair", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rous Sarcoma Virus", "retroviral integrase", "integration"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Microtomography Imaging of Fluid Distribution and Interfacial Area in Bead Packs under Variable Axial Loading", "id": "26581", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11676", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reservoir stress and compaction play an important role in understanding transport phenomena in porous media. It is known that changing stress conditions has an impact on distribution and interaction of immiscible phases in the subsurface. However, there is limited pore-scale experimental data to examine the effect of compaction on porous media transport properties, which in turn requires further validation. The purpose of this work is to investigate macro- and pore-scale properties of granular packs with changing axial stress conditions using a synthetic water-wet porous medium. In this study, we provide a general framework to explore the effect of compaction on the porosity, permeability, relative permeability, surface area and interfacial area in a simplified porous medium. A specially designed core holder was used to exert simultaneous axial and radial stress on a glass bead column. Immiscible fluids (water and soltrol) were injected through the packing to reach equilibrium residual wetting and non-wetting phase saturation conditions. Then, variation in porosity, permeability, relative permeability, residual distribution of phases and interfacial area were monitored in accordance with different axial loadings ranging from 50 to 350 psig. X-ray microtomography (microCT) was used to monitor three-dimensional changes in pore structure. It was observed that axial loading resulted in minor changes in pore structure and residual fluid distributions. Average porosity dropped from 44.83% to 42.66%, whereas absolute permeability dropped from 30.39 to 25.11 Darcy with increasing axial loading. Scattered meniscus interfacial area (a^wn) values were found at irreducible wetting-phase saturation while similar a^wn values were found at residual non-wetting phase saturation as axial load increased. Thus, a^wn is more sensitive to changes in pore structure at irreducible wetting-phase saturation. In dynamic conditions, contact angle hysteresis have an impact on the shape of curvature of the interface between immiscible phases and its affect is proven experimentally in the literature. In most of those experimental studies, meniscus interfacial areas (a^wn) at different saturation points on drainage curve were reported to be higher than that of imbibition which could be explained by contact angle hysteresis. In the present study, similarly, higher a^wn values were found at the end of drainage cycles than that of imbibition. However, this behavior cannot be attributed to contact angle hysteresis, alone. Our findings provide evidence that contact angle hysteresis affects pore-scale displacement mechanisms which consequently lead to changes in final saturation states. It should also be noted that the sensitivity of a^w to change in pore structure is higher than that of a^n at high wetting-phase saturations. However, a^w and a^n are in a good agreement at low wetting-phase saturations with linear approximations obtained from solid specific surface areas and saturations.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11165], "author_name_tesi": "Konya, Samet ", "last_name_ssi": "Konya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Samet", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["compaction", "porosity", "permeability", "relative permeability", "residual saturation", "surface area", "interfacial area"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The experiences of two young children in informal piano settings: Expressions of meaning and value", "id": "18958", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9036", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to seek insight into what children found meaningful and valuable when participating in an informal child-oriented piano lesson setting.

It was the purpose of this study, therefore, to investigate the relationship between adult learner participation and outcome, and a comparison study between Community ABE/GED programs and Even Start family literacy programs in Pennsylvania. This study further compared the results from the Even Start family literacy programs to a similar program (family learning) in Lancashire, UK. \n\tThis study analyzed the effects of human capital investment in conjunction with social capital development.

Laws prohibiting statutory rape are intended to protect minors from engaging in behavior that, although not forceful, may be harmful.  The three studies comprising this research explored the variety of statutory rape laws across the United States, state-level characteristics affecting them, and individual judgments of statutory rape.\n\tStudy 1 was an analysis of all 231 statutes in the 50 states relating to statutory rape (range of 1-8 statutes per state).  Across states, the age of consent for sexual intercourse is 16, 17, or 18.  Most states have laws that decriminalize sexual encounters between peers if the perpetrator is within a specified age-span.  The various age-span laws across states make behavior non-criminal if the perpetrator is less than a specified number of years older than the victim.  These age-spans vary greatly across states: eight states have no age-span laws, but in one state there is an age-span of 10 years.  Most states (n = 39) also grade the severity of the offense based upon the sexual act (oral sex or intercourse, with intercourse the more serious offense).  No state makes a distinction based on gender of the victim, although the Supreme Court has ruled that such a distinction is Constitutional (Michael v. Sonoma 1981).  Based on the findings of this research, the Internal Determinants of a state are associated with the Age of Consent statute.  Diffusion Theory is the most effective theory for explaining variance in the age-span statutes across states.\n\tStudy 2 was an experimental survey (n=427) of young adults\u2019 perceptions of sexual activity.  In the study, age of the victim (14, 15, or 16), age of the perpetrator (17, 18, or 19), and nature of the act (oral sex or intercourse) were systematically manipulated.  Half of the surveys (randomly assigned) included the Pennsylvania statutory rape law.  Study 3 (n=656) replicated and extended Study 2 by manipulating the act, the gender of the victim, and the gender of the perpetrator, and by including a wider range of victim ages (12, 14, 16, or 19) and perpetrator ages (16, 18, or 21).  \n\tAcross studies, respondents were significantly more condemning of acts with younger victims and/or older perpetrators.  Victim age and perpetrator age interacted, such that individuals involved in relationships with larger age-spans were viewed as significantly worse than those with smaller age-spans.  Overall, female respondents were significantly more critical than male respondents in their evaluations of the victim, the perpetrator, and the act.  There was also a significant interaction of victim age and act, such that intercourse was significantly more condemned than oral sex for younger victims (14-years old or younger), whereas oral sex was significantly more condemned than intercourse for younger victims (16-years old or older).  The Study 3 manipulation of victim gender revealed that acts involving female victims were viewed as significantly worse than acts involving male victims.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5662], "author_name_tesi": "Koon-Magnin, Sarah Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Koon-Magnin", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback", "Barry Ruback"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback, Thesis Advisor", "Barry Ruback, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sex", "sexual activity", "statutory rape", "adolescents"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DETERRING SEX OFFENDERS: IDENTIFYING THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT POLICY AND THE POLICIES THAT AFFECT RECIDIVISM", "id": "12174", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13281", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sexual offending is considered the most deplorable type of crime, especially when the victims are children.  A few particularly sensational cases of sexual assaults against children have led to public outrage and, ultimately, the introduction of new strategies for controlling the sex offender population.  Two of the most controversial techniques for controlling sex offender behavior, registration/notification policies and civil commitment statutes, were widely implemented in the 1990\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.  Registration/notification policies (adopted in all 50 states) require that law enforcement officials both maintain a centralized database of all sexual offenders in each jurisdiction and make that list available to the public.  Civil commitment statutes (adopted in 20 states) allow the state to keep high-risk offenders under state control (i.e., in state institutions) even after the offenders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 criminal sentence is complete.  This dissertation focused on the adoption of these policies (Study 1) and the impact of these policies (Study 2).  \nStudy 1 tested two explanations that have traditionally been offered to explain the risk and timing of policy adoption: internal determinants and diffusion.  Internal determinants are factors that are unique to the state, such as the political party of the governor or the unemployment rate.  Diffusion is a temporal process in which states respond to the policy choices that other states are making.  Studies of state-level adoption of multiple types of policies have found that both internal determinants and diffusion theories can be used to explain the timing of policy adoption (Berry & Berry, 1990).  \nThese two theoretical approaches were tested using annual, state-level data from 1986 through 2007.  The data used for analysis was drawn from multiple sources, including the Statistical Abstracts of the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Uniform Crime Reports.  Original variables (e.g., the percentage of neighboring states that have adopted the policy) were also created to capture the diffusion of the two policies and diffusion mechanisms.\nThe results of Study 1 suggest that the factors that led to the adoption of sexual offending legislation differed from those traditionally used to explain policy adoption.  Only one of the internal determinant variables was significantly associated with the risk and timing of adopting registration/notification policies.  Region of the country was an important predictor of adoption risk, such that states in the Southern region were significantly less likely to adopt the policies, or did so later, than states in other regions of the country.  Two additional internal determinants were associated with the timing of adopting a civil commitment statute.  First, states with higher populations were more likely to adopt such policies, or to adopt them sooner, than states with smaller populations.  Second, states with higher levels of unemployment were less likely to adopt civil commitment statutes, or adopted them later, than states with lower levels of unemployment.  There was a significant diffusion effect on both policy outcomes.  That is, as more time passed and more states adopted the policy, the remaining states were increasingly likely to adopt the policy, as well.  Diffusion mechanisms (specifically, the passage of Federal legislation in the Jacob Wetterling Act and the Supreme Court ruling in the case of Kansas v. Hendricks) were negatively associated with the timing of adopting a civil commitment policy.\nStudy 2 tested the impact of the adoption of these two policies on rates of sexual offending within states over time.  The rates of six types of sexual offending were tested: rape (as measured by both the Uniform Crime Reports and the National Incident-Based Reporting System), forcible sodomy, forcible fondling, sexual assault with an object, statutory rape, and incest (all five measured by the National Incident-Based Reporting System).  The findings of Study 2 provided no support for deterrence theory.  Neither the adoption of a registration/notification policy nor a civil commitment statute led to a significant decrease in the rates of sexual offending.  In fact, for four of the outcomes studied here, there were positive relationships between policy adoption and the rate of sexual offending.  Failure to find a deterrent effect may mean that no such effect exists.  However, it is also possible that the limited scope of NIBRS data (only 15 states were available for analysis because states\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reporting is voluntary) did not provide adequate power to detect an effect.\nFour covariates were significantly associated with the rates of sexual offending within states.  First, there was a positive association between the murder rate in the state and the rape rate (as measured by the UCR).  Second, there was a positive association between the percentage of the population living in poverty and the rape rate (both measured by NIBRS).  Third, the divorce rate within a state was positively associated with the rape rate (as measured by the UCR).  Fourth, the incarceration rate within a state was positively associated with the rates of rape (as measured by both the UCR), forcible sodomy, forcible fondling, sexual assault with an object, statutory rape, and incest.\nThese two studies provide a comprehensive view of registration/notification policies and civil commitment statute.  There are three important implications of this research.  First, the success or failure of a policy, once implemented, should be tested as a likely predictor of policy diffusion.  Second, future policy research should continue to address both adoption and evaluation, as these processes are intertwined.  Third, legislators should consider empirical research when implementing sexual offending policy.  Although there is symbolic value in implementing policies regardless of their effectiveness, sexual offending is a serious enough problem to demand policies that will also serve to reduce the rate of sexual offending", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12828], "author_name_tesi": "Koon-Magnin, Sarah Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Koon-Magnin", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["R.

Smith), which is a serious pest in the southern United States. This study is primarily aimed at investigating the protein complement in the maize mid-whorl, which is the main larval feeding site. In the resistant genotype Mp708, a unique, extracellular, 33-KDa cysteine protease (Mir1-CP) accumulates in whorl in response to insect feeding, which retards the larval growth by attacking the mid-gut region of the insect. On the other hand, the susceptible inbred Tx601 does not retard larval growth when compared to Mp708. In this study, our objectives were 1) to identify differentially expressed proteins in the whorls of resistant and susceptible genotypes before and after FAW feeding, and 2) to identify proteins that are up/down-regulated in response to FAW feeding in resistant and susceptible genotypes.\nComparative proteomics analysis, employing the use of gel-based tool, two-dimensional Difference In-Gel Electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) coupled with MS/MS MALDI-TOF, was used. Our results show that the resistant genotype had elevated levels of antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes, which are induced during abiotic stress compared to the susceptible genotype after infestation. The stress-related proteins expressed in the resistant genotype such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase have shown to be induced by jasmonic acid (JA) (Xiang et al., 1996); and it is already established that Mp708 resistant genotype constitutively has elevated levels jasmonic acid. So higher levels GSTs and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase in the resistant inbred implies higher induction of jasmonic acid after infestation. On the other hand the susceptible genotype primarily expressed heat shock proteins instead of other stress proteins. Proteomic analyses to elucidate interactions within each genotype in response to larvae were also performed. Interestingly, the proteins that were up-regulated in resistant genotype after infestation were stress related proteins and the most important proteins that were down-regulated included photosynthetic proteins such as Rubisco small subunit etc. In case of the susceptible genotype, the proteins that were up-regulated by larval infestation involved mostly the metabolic proteins and those down-regulated included stress-related proteins.\nProteomic approaches detected and identified sets of proteins from mid-whorl region of maize that are possibly engaged in the defense mechanism to larval infestation. For this study we conclude that the mechanism of resistance/susceptibility is rather complex and involves a broad range of proteins, where the expression of stress-related proteins is very important to maintain resistance.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5439], "author_name_tesi": "Kooner, Ramneek ", "last_name_ssi": "Kooner", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ramneek", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dawn S Luthe", "Dawn S Luthe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dawn S Luthe, Thesis Advisor", "Dawn S Luthe, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Proteomics", "Maize", "Fall Armyworm", "2-D DIGE"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Understanding the physical mechanisms and capabilities of gravitational wave detectors", "id": "23719", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10862", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The direct detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources has been a goal of physics and astronomy for over 40 years.  Two modern techniques for detecting gravitational waves that are actively being pursued are gravitational wave detection via laser interferometry and pulsar timing arrays (PTAs).  In this dissertation we address a number of questions regarding how these detectors physically interact with a gravitational wave and how PTAs can be optimized for various scientific goals.\n\nWe develop a fully physical and gauge-invariant description of the response of a wide class of light travel time gravitational wave detectors (which includes PTAs and laser interferometers) in terms of the spacetime Riemann curvature, the physical quantity that describes all gravitational phenomena in general relativity.  In the presence of a gravitational wave with a radiation length-scale that is much shorter than the background curvature length-scale, we find the leading contribution to the detector response is an integral of the gravitational wave curvature along unperturbed photon paths between the detector components.  This provides a simple, intuitive understanding of how these detectors operate. This framework also allows the straightforward calculation of corrections to the detector response corresponding to the relative motion of detector components and non-Minkowski background spacetimes.\n\nWe then focus on gravitational wave detection via pulsar timing and introduce performance metrics that quantify the ability of a PTA to detect isolated gravitational wave signals, measure their radiation polarization, and localize their sources on the sky. The PTA sensitivity depends, in part, on the measured timing noise of each pulsar in the array. The timing noise can be reduced by longer pulsar observation times.  Using the NANOGrav PTA as an example case, we identify a set of strategies for the allocation of available telescope time between pulsars that are optimized for various scientific goals.  We find that, purely through the reallocation of currently available telescope time, significant improvements in a PTA's performance across a range of criteria can be made over the current practice of allocating equal amounts of time to each pulsar in the array.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10460], "author_name_tesi": "Koop, Michael Jameson", "last_name_ssi": "Koop", "middle_name_ssi": "Jameson", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lee S Finn", "Martin Bojowald", "Dr Benjamin J Owen", "Michael Eracleous"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lee S Finn, Dissertation Advisor", "Martin Bojowald, Committee Member", "Dr Benjamin J Owen, Committee Member", "Michael Eracleous, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gravitational waves", "general relativity", "pulsar timing array", "detection", "interferometer"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "\"I had to lead a hidden life in some way\": Identities of LGBT elementary school teachers", "id": "12009", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "190", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study focused on identities of six LGBT elementary school teachers in Southern City, USA, a metropolitan area in the southeastern United States.

Accordingly, soft-inplane damperless bearingless and hingeless rotor concepts have garnered significant interest.  However, soft-inplane designs are susceptible to aeromechanical instabilities, such as air and ground resonance, which can potentially induce catastrophic blade vibrations without sufficient blade damping.  To ensure stability, current composite blades typically require auxiliary damping sources that incur weight, volume, complexity, and maintenance penalties.  Alternatively, one promising approach for achieving new lightweight, low vibration rotorcraft structures is passive damping engineered intrinsically into a structure via polymeric nanocomposites.\n\nIn this study, a multi-fidelity modeling effort is employed to investigate the interfacial load transfer micromechanics, including strain energy storage and dissipation, of an off-aligned discontinuously-reinforced polymer/carbon nanotube nanocomposite.  The effects of off-alignment angle on nanocomposite mechanical properties is of primary interest. The methodology in this study is separated into two independent modeling tracks: a simplified analytical micromechanics model and a high-fidelity 3D finite element model.  Both model types explore transverse fixed and transverse free boundary conditions applied to the representative volume element, which correspond to applied strain and applied stress external loading conditions, respectively.  Each model accounts for interfacial shear stress variations along the azimuthal direction of the nano-inclusion surface that are a result of nonzero and non-right alignment angles with respect to the applied loading.  The analytical micromechanics models examine non-embedded fiber conditions, for which matrix end material effects are neglected, in the preslip and postslip regimes and embedded fiber conditions, for which matrix end material effects are included, in the preslip regime.  The non-embedded micromechanics model is based on principles from an extended Cox model for discontinuous fiber reinforcement and generalized shear lag analysis for off-aligned discontinuous fibers; furthermore, the energy dissipation, which is based on principles of a simple amplitude-dependent friction damper, is assumed to be caused only by interfacial slip friction between constituents and is functionally dependent on the interfacial shear force acting over slipped portions of the matrix/nano-inclusion interface.  In order to isolate the effects of azimuthal interfacial shear stress variation, a comparison of the current non-embedded model with an alternative non-embedded analytical model that employs an interfacial shear magnitude approach is performed. The embedded analytical micromechanics model is based on principles from a modified Cox model that extends the non-embedded approach to account for finite matrix end material and nonzero fiber end normal stress.  The finite element model is implemented in the preslip regime for an embedded fiber with limited off-alignment angle range.\n\nThe material properties employed by each model reflect those of a realistic multi-walled carbon nanotube/poly-ether-ether-ketone nanocomposite architecture.  In the preslip regime, the FEM and analytical model predictions for interfacial shear and nano-inclusion normal stress distributions generally display good agreement, which is improved by including inclusion end stress effects in the analytical models.  For the transverse fixed boundary condition, the non-embedded analytical model predicts reduced interfacial slip damping capacity as off-alignment increases, with initiation of slip becoming impossible at relatively high off-alignment angles.  However, for the transverse free boundary condition, the non-embedded analytical model predicts that zero interfacial slip damping occurs comparatively at more moderate off-alignment angles, with nonzero damping occurring at both lower and higher off-alignment angles.  The phenomena of extrema in interfacial slip damping with respect to alignment angle is due to the relative strain behavior between nanocomposite constituents caused by elastic stiffness mismatch. The alternative azimuthal magnitude non-embedded analytical model generally underpredicts storage modulus and greatly overpredicts loss modulus (for nonzero and non-right off-alignments) compared with the corresponding properties predicted by the current non-embedded analytical model because the alternative azimuthal magnitude approach assumes a greater interfacial slip surface area for a given off-alignment angle and strain magnitude compared to the current approach.  Overall, the results demonstrate that nano-inclusion alignment angle substantially affects nanocomposite stiffness and interfacial damping and that azimuthal variation of the interfacial shear is a critical feature of nanocomposite mechanics.  The outcome of this multi-fidelity modeling study is an array of qualified nanocomposite mechanical property prediction methods spanning a wide range of practical off-alignment angles, applied dynamic strain amplitudes and static strain magnitudes, loading and fiber embedment conditions, and nano-inclusion geometries and concentrations.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12650], "author_name_tesi": "Kopp, Reed Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Kopp", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Reed", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C.

(2006); (d) CRIS cluster status were expected to differentially predict the level of acculturation preferred by the students; and (e) CRIS cluster status were expected to differentially predict the degree of social distance from different cultural groups. Participants were 360 college students attending a predominately White institution in the mid-Atlantic region of the U. S. who self-identified as being African American or Black (70% female; 30% male). Data for this study were collected as part of a larger project, in which only four of the eight measures were used: demographic questionnaire, CRIS, AAAS-R, and BSDS-R. For hypotheses one and two, the findings from the bivariate correlational analyses were\nconsistent with and provided further support for the expanded nigrescence theory (Cross & Vandiver, 2001) and the construct validity of the CRIS. A negative correlation was found between Pre-Encounter Assimilation and the AAAS-R total score; a positive correlation was found between Internalization Afrocentricity and the AAAS-R total score; and a negative correlation was found between Immersion-Emersion Anti-White and BSDS-R Whites subscale. Results of the cluster analysis supported hypothesis three in that six to seven clusters were identified: Assimilated, Self-Hating, Multiculturalist, Immersion, Afrocentric, Imersion \u00e2\u20ac\u201cIntense Black Involvement, and Low Race Salience. Additionally, preliminary evidence was found for the existence of two new racial identity cluster patterns: Self-Hating and Immersion-Intense Black Involvement. Using the six-cluster solution, findings from a one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD post hoc analysis provided preliminary support for CRIS cluster membership in\npredicting levels of acculturation. On average, individuals who were classified in the Assimilated\ncluster were likely to rate themselves as more acculturated than those who had been placed in the\nAfrocentric cluster or Immersion cluster. Those who were classified in the Self-Hating cluster on\naverage were likely to rate themselves as more acculturated than those who had been placed in\nthe Afrocentric cluster. Finally, findings from a MANOVA with a follow-up descriptive discriminant analysis provided preliminary support for hypothesis five that the CRIS clusters could be used to predict the degree of social distance from different cultural groups. The MANOVA was statistically significant for cluster status. Only the first discriminant variate was statistically and practically significant and therefore interpreted. Social distance with Whites had the highest correlation to the variate, followed by social distance with Jews and Asians. In contrast, Other Blacks had a negative correlation to the function. Thus, the function was named dominant culture group preference. On average, individuals in the Self-Hating and Assimilated clusters rated themselves higher on the discriminant function, whereas individuals in the Immersion - Intense Black Involvement, Afrocentric, and Immersion clusters rated themselves lower, and the Multiculturalist cluster fell in the middle. In conclusion, the findings from this study may be potentially informative for clinicians and researchers by providing a contextual understanding for how sociocultural variables such as acculturation and social distance intersect\nwith and are influenced by racial identity. The complexities of racial identity are important for\nclinicians and researchers to consider in order to more effectively develop interventions tailored\nto the needs of individuals with different racial identity attitudes.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5526], "author_name_tesi": "Korell, Shanon ", "last_name_ssi": "Korell", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shanon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counseling Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Beverly Vandiver", "Robert B Slaney", "W.

Students from these places have a history of lower educational attainment at both the K-12 and postsecondary levels, yet this population remains understudied.  Existing research largely ignores the variation among rural places and the effects communities can have on students.  This study seeks to uncover the diversity within rural communities and understand how this diversity influences educational pathways.  \n\tLogistic regression is used to study the ways in which local industry and county-level economic conditions influence postsecondary attendance and institutional choice for rural students.  Data are taken from three national data sets, which are then combined to conduct this analysis.  Student data are taken from the restricted-use file of the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, which also contains numeric codes for place of residence and postsecondary institutions attended.  County traits such as local industry, persistent poverty, low employment, and sub-standard housing come from county typologies published in 2004 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service.  Lastly, data about the postsecondary institutions attended come from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System.  \n\tTo help answer questions regarding community effects, this study first examines how postsecondary attendance and institutional choice is impacted by rurality in general, as well as how the effects of individual demographic, socioeconomic, and academic traits vary between the rural and non-rural contexts.  Analysis of county-level industry and economic traits is conducted for the full sample and for rural and non-rural students separately.  Further, local industry effects for rural students are examined at a regional level, and economic factors are studied across socioeconomic quartiles of students.  \nThe results of this study reveal clear disadvantages in postsecondary attendance, institutional level, selectivity, and other indicators resulting simply from living in a rural county.  The effect of most student characteristics did not vary substantially between rural and non-rural areas, but the analysis did reveal one interesting finding: The relationship between college attendance and choice and a student\u2019s socioeconomic status was weaker for rural students than for non-rural students. Some systematic variation across rural communities was revealed, as well.

The emphasis on energy and indoor air quality aspects of high-performance green buildings leads to a need for superior planning, design and construction processes to achieve high-performance green goals within realistic financial and time constraints. The current literature offers product based high-performance metrics as a part of existing building assessment systems (e.g. LEEDTM and Green GlobesTM) as well as metrics to study actual building performance, but lacks descriptive project delivery evaluation metrics.\nThis gap in the literature inhibits project teams to fulfill the desired project goals and results with missed opportunities in the delivery process and shortcomings in the project performance outcomes. The limited green building population and the lack of knowledge about important project delivery evaluation metrics and methods to collect data in this field present the first challenge in HPG building project delivery research. Acknowledging these limitations, the purpose of this research is to advance the knowledge needed to deliver HPG buildings by piloting evaluation metrics for HPG building delivery. \nThe research is exploratory in nature that aims to provide a foundation for future research by defining meaningful evaluation metrics, methods and tools to collect and analyze HPG building project delivery data. A mixed method (QUAN-Qual) is utilized to achieve these aims that start with a quantitative analysis examining a pool of HPG project delivery data collectively and than continues with a qualitative analysis to support the findings of quantitative analysis and draw additional lessons from case studies. The results lay a foundation for rigorous and high yield HPG building project delivery research and form a guide for the green building community to better deliver high-performance green building projects.  \n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6066], "author_name_tesi": "Korkmaz, Sinem ", "last_name_ssi": "Korkmaz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sinem", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Riley Ii", "Michael J Horman", "John Messner", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Riley Ii, Committee Chair", "Michael J Horman, Committee Chair", "John Messner, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Green Buildings", "High-performance", "Project Delivery", "Metrics", "Mixed Method"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Development Of A Scalable Gas-dynamics Solver With Adaptive Mesh Refinement", "id": "26718", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11565", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There are various computational physics areas in which Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and Particle in Cell (PIC) methods are being employed.

The software developed to run such simulations also needs special attention so that the maintainability and extendability is\nconsidered with the recent numerical methods and programming paradigms. Suited for gas-dynamics problems, a software called SUGAR (Scalable Unstructured Gas dynamics with Adaptive mesh Refinement) has recently been developed and written in C++ and MPI.

Multiple adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) meshes were used in order to capture different physical length scales present in the flow. A multiple-thruster configuration was run to extend the studies to cases for which there is no axial or radial symmetry present that could only be modeled with a three-dimensional simulation capability. The\ncombined plume structure showed interactions between individual thrusters where AMR capability captured this in an automated way. The back flow for ions was found to occur when CEX and momentum-exchange (MEX) collisions are present and strongly enhanced when the induced electric field is considered. The ion energy distributions in the back flow region were obtained and it was found that the inclusion of the electric field modeling is the most important factor in determining its shape. The plume back flow structure was also examined for a triple-thruster, 3-D geometry case and it was found that the ion velocity in the back flow region appears to be roughly independent of the number of thrusters. The influence of solar cell panel voltage on backflow flux is evaluated using a combined commercial software generated potential with the induced potential and the influence of gas-surface interactions is studied.

Although\nsome progress in vaccine and antiviral drug development has been made in recent years,\nthere is still a great demand in creating more powerful and versatile antiviral compounds.\nThe viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a key enzyme in viral genome replication and represents a unique target for antiviral drug development. Lethal mutagenesis of the RNA viruses has been recently explored as a romising antiviral strategy. Therefore, understanding structural determinants of the polymerase fidelity will strongly facilitate rational drug design. In this thesis, studies on structure-function relationships of poliovirus (PV)\npolymerase, 3Dpol, and the mechanistic basis for RdRp fidelity are described, including biochemical and biological evaluation of three 3Dpol derivatives: Glu-297, Tyr-30 and Arg-273. Previous studies of PV RdRp have shown that Asn-297 permits the enzyme to distinguish ribose from 2\u2019-deoxyribose. Mutation of this highly conserved amino acid residue to Glu, which is present in all phage RdRps, resulted in a 3Dpol derivative with decreased efficiency of deoxyribonucleotide incorporation. At the same time, the fidelity of the ribonucleotide incorporation displayed by Glu-297 3Dpol was substantially reduced, providing a mechanistic explanation for the elevated mutation frequency\nobserved for RNA phages. In addition, evaluation of the protein-primed initiation reaction catalyzed by 3Dpol led us to the conclusion that even though the same polymerase active site is employed in both reactions, substantial structural differences exist between initiation and elongation complexes. Moreover, Glu-297 3Dpol was able to excise deoxyribonucleotides, suggesting that RNA phage RdRps might have utilized this ability to proofread. We introduced Phe-30 to Tyr mutation in the PV 3Dpol in order to disrupt a strong interaction between the fingers and thumb subdomains of the\npolymerase, observed crystallographically. Contrary to our expectations, Tyr-30 mutation had no effect on the polymerase function. Unexpectedly, this mutation within 3D domain altered an unknown 3CD function after genome translation and replication. This discovery shed some light on a potential role of 3CD in virus maturation and/or viral RNA packaging; the mechanisms of both of these processes are still unknown. The last, but not least, 3Dpol derivative described in this thesis is the Arg-273 3Dpol. Although residue 273 is located about 20 \u00c5 from the active site of the polymerase, mutation changing wildtype amino acid residue His-273 to Arg resulted in both a PV and a\npolymerase with a mutator phenotype. Biochemical evaluation of the Arg-273 3Dpol showed that the conformational change preceding the chemistry step is accountable for the relaxed fidelity observed for this polymerase; X-ray analysis of the Arg-273 3Dpol did not reveal any substantial changes in the crystal structure when compared to the WT 3Dpol, suggesting that Arg-273 may alter conformational flexibility of the enzyme. Arg-273 PV, in combination with the WT and high fidelity Ser-64 PV represents a unique experimental system for exploring relationships between virus fidelity, fitness, and\npathogenicity. Together, these studies provide insight into yet unexplored properties of the\n3Dpol and provide basis for further studies on the polymerase fidelity, virus maturation\nand virus-host interactions and towards designing novel strategies to treat RNA viruses.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6425], "author_name_tesi": "Korneeva, Victoria ", "last_name_ssi": "Korneeva", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Victoria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Eugene Cameron", "Squire J Booker", "Michael Teng", "Ming Tien", "Blake R Peterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Chair", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Michael Teng, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Blake R Peterson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["RNA-dependent RNA polymerase", "fidelity", "nucleotide selection", "poliovirus"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Postfeminist Detectives: Television Genres, Genders, and Crimes", "id": "14699", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7504", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "U.S. television has seen a recent proliferation of yet another crime drama iteration: Bones (2005 - ), Fringe (2008 - ), The Mentalist (2008 - ), and Castle (2009 - ) all partner together a man and woman \u2013 one of whom is not a law enforcement officer, and focus on the romantic tensions between the partners from the pilot episodes.

The primary goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of upper and lower continental crustal composition and structure to improve our knowledge of the tectonic evolution of the Earth.  To contribute this goal, the present study focuses on the estimation of first order seismic structure using receiver functions, and the construction of a library of shear-velocity structures\nin the vicinity of seismic stations across western Eurasia and north Africa using receiver functions and tomography based surface wave dispersion estimates. One hundred and seventy one stations recording a total of about 6,000 teleseismic events producing more than 100,000 seismograms have been investigated. The distribution includes 78 stations in the Middle East and Asia, 57 stations in Europe,  and 36 stations in central and north Africa. I have examined receiver functions for 119 stations with the best data for the period of 1990-2004 and applied the receiver function stacking procedure of Zhu and Kanamori (2000) to estimate Poisson's ratio and crustal thickness. The research area is divided to five tectonics environments, explicitly Shields, Platform, Paleozoic orogenic belts, Mesozoic-Cenozoic orogenic belts, and rift zones based on Condie's (1989) simplified classifications. The results from this study show a slightly lower value of Poisson's ratio s = 0.25 for Shield compared to the Orogenic-belts with s = 0.26 Crustal thickness H ranges from 32-47 km with an average of 38 km and standard deviation of 3 km for the shields. The less well sampled platforms  show a wider distribution of crustal thickness, ranging from  30-58 km with an average 42 km and a standard deviation of 9 km. Orogenic regions also show a wide variation of crustal thickness, with thickness values from 20 to 55 km and standard deviations in the range of 8-10 km. \nSince the ultimate goal of this study is to provide an improved imaged of global continental structure and composition, I combine observations obtained in this study with receiver functions results from other published analysis. In total, I have integrated observations from 606 stations located in different geologic settings. The compiled results show a value of s = 0.26 for Poisson's ratio and H = 39 km for crustal thickness in Shields and Platforms, and s = 0.26-0.27 with H = 35-37 km for the Orogenic belts.   \nThe results show that previously suspected correlations between Poisson's ratio and tectonic age or crustal thickness are more complex - regional variations are more important. Comparison with the standard reference seismic model Crust 2.0 shows that it systematically underestimates crustal shear velocities. A detailed analysis of data from southern Algeria, near the central Hoggar uplift, indicates a significant crustal root beneath the mount Tahat, consistent with underplating of the lower crust. Converted phases from the transition zone suggest relatively low upper mantle velocities to a depth near 410 km, but a strong, azimuthal consistent arrival from 660 km suggests that boundary is relatively unperturbed.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4387], "author_name_tesi": "Kosarian, Minoo ", "last_name_ssi": "Kosarian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Minoo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles James Ammon", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Kevin Patrick Furlong", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles James Ammon, Committee Chair", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Committee Member", "Kevin Patrick Furlong, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Crustal thickness", "Shear velocity structure", "Surface wave dispersion", "Receiver functions", "Poisson`s ratio"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Manipulation of Microstructrue, Phase Evolution and Mechanical Properties by Devitrification of Andesite for use as Proppant\n", "id": "9195", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5298", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Small, roughly spherical ceramic particles, approximately 1mm in size are used for a number of applications including casting sands, catalysts, and cement fillers. The oil and natural gas industry utilizes such materials in tonnage quantities yearly as extraction aids. Particles intended for this application are referred to as proppants. Proppants are composed of materials that differ by density, strength and cost, and are selected on a site by site basis. Recently, competing usage and depletion of reserves of one of the most popular category of proppant materials, sintered aluminosilicates (e.g. kaolinite, bauxite) have driven the need for alternative raw materials for proppant manufacturing. \nAndesite, a by-product of mining operations in the south-west United States was identified as an abundant, readily available, and low cost alternative proppant material that can be fused and net-shaped into a glass which when crystallized results in microstructures which may offer substantial toughening and fracture characteristics which may serve to their advantage for use as proppants that do not decrease the permeability (\u0081gblind\u0081h) the particle bed. \nThis study addressed the devitrification behavior and its role on the mechanical properties of andesite-based glass-ceramic spheres for use as proppants. Time-temperature-transformation studies were performed to evaluate the devitrification behavior of andesite glass. Crystalline phase evolution and microstructural development were evaluated using quantitative x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, differential thermal analysis, and spectrophotometry. \nThe andesite glass devitrification commenced with the precipitation of iron oxides (magnetite) which served as seeds for the epitaxial growth of dendritic pyroxenes. Mechanical properties, such as diametral compressive strength, fracture toughness, hardness, and fracture morphology were correlated with crystalline phase evolution. Selected heat treatments resulting in the desired combination of high strength, toughness, and coarse fragmentation of crystallized spheres were performed for subsequent evaluation of performance as a proppant using American Petroleum Institute test methodologies. For nominally 1mm diameter devitrified proppants, diametral compressive strengths of 150MPa were observed, while results of indentation fracture resistance measurements showed values of 1.5-2.0MPa&#8729;\u0081\u00e3m. Combinations of these mechanical properties resulted in nearly 80% incidence of coarse fragmentation compared with 40% incidence in amorphous andesite proppants. Results corroborated the hypothesis that controlled devitrification resulted in substantial improvement in toughness and fracture morphology which in turn contributed to enhanced permeability of packed particle beds relative to state of the art glass proppants, and comparable to the present state of the art sintered bauxite- and kaolinite-based proppants. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5275], "author_name_tesi": "Koseski, Ryan Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Koseski", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Richard Hellmann Jr.", "David John Green", "Barry Earl Scheetz", "Carlo G Pantano", "Albert Eliot Segall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Richard Hellmann Jr., Committee Chair", "David John Green, Committee Member", "Barry Earl Scheetz, Committee Chair", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Glass-Ceramic", "Proppant", "Andesite", "Hydrocarbon Recovery", "Basalt"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "An Analysis Of Anonymity In Bitcoin Using P2P Network Traffic", "id": "19859", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7383", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the last 4 years, Bitcoin, a decentralized P2P crypto-currency, has gained widespread attention.

A substitution Markov chain (abbreviated SMC) is special class of countable-state Markov chain. Several contributions are contained in this dissertation: first, an SMC is defined and then frequencies of subwords are shown to converge almost surely. I then investigate the boundary theory for this class of Markov chains (which is fundamentally different than previously considered classes of countable state Markov chains) and calculate two examples of the Martin boundary.\nI then present a technique for modifying an SMC that transforms it into a more classical, irreducible Markov chain, and verify that frequencies of subwords still converge in this case.\nI then demonstrate how a particular class of SMC's provide a natural framework to accurately model molecular evolution. Not only can a diverse set of mutational events be modeled with this class of substitution Markov chain, but the theorems regarding convergence of subword frequencies can be utilized to develop an alignment-free method of parameter estimation for this model. It is difficult to overstate the advantage of an alignment-free parameter estimation technique.\nThe last two chapters of this dissertation represent the initiation of a novel line research concerned with the adaptation of tools from symbolic dynamics and thermodynamic formalism to the study of DNA sequences.

It is based on thirteen months of fieldwork in two communities on the Lakus River, a tributary of the Coco River in northern Nicaragua.  The communities, Arang Dak and Suma Pipi, are home to the Mayangna and Miskito, two of Nicaragua\u2019s most populous indigenous groups.  Field methods employed in this study include focal observations of hunters, instantaneous scan sampling of household members, and considerable work with indigenous research assistants, who helped to monitor the harvest of fish and game, record daily food consumption in households, and map the locations of fields and kill sites.\n\nResults of this research indicate that hunting in Bosawas is similar in many respects to hunting elsewhere in Neotropical rain forests.  Hunting is primarily a male-oriented activity, kill sites are clustered near the communities, and mammals contribute most of the biomass in the harvest.  However, the hunters in Arang Dak and Suma Pipi are unusual in their heavy reliance on hunting dogs, which contribute to 85% of the kills of mammalian prey.  From an optimal foraging perspective, hunting with dogs includes costs that cannot be analyzed with the basic diet breadth model, and a modified model is presented that addresses these costs.  Overall, hunters generally pursue prey types that conform to predictions derived from optimal foraging theory.  However, they regularly bypass a few species that apparently belong in the optimal diet set, and possible explanations for these suboptimal decisions are discussed.\n\nIn total, the residents of Arang Dak and Suma Pipi caught 1,090 animals during the study period.  The composition of the harvest varies seasonally and geographically, and some species are closely associated with certain hunting technologies.  Most of the animals are captured in a core hunting zone of 77.6 km2, and many kill sites are close to anthropogenic habitats.  Overall, the harvest of many species is lower than it is elsewhere in the Neotropics, but a sustainability assessment indicates that a few species might be hunted unsustainably in the core hunting zone.  The continued survival of some species in the Lakus River watershed might depend on the maintenance of lightly-exploited tracts of forest outside the core hunting zone, and the implications of this possibility for wildlife management are discussed.  In general, the Mayangna and Miskito are diverse in their economic and subsistence strategies, and this dissertation highlights the role and importance of hunting in household economies.  Finally, data on time allocation and fishing are presented in light of recent debates about subsistence activities across the lifespan.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2863], "author_name_tesi": "Koster, Jeremy Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Koster", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Jeremy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Joel Beckerman", "Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Jeffrey Arnold Kurland", "Katriona Shea"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Joel Beckerman, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Arnold Kurland, Committee Member", "Katriona Shea, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sketch mapping", "sustainability", "hunting dogs", "Optimal foraging theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Repeated Readings and Science: Fluency with Expository Passages\n", "id": "8549", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1379", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current study investigated the effects of repeated readings to a fluency criterion (RRFC) for seven students with disabilities using science text.

The study also investigated parents\u2019 concerns about the dialogical storybook reading technique and the technique\u2019s effects on parent-child relationships. Quantitative data were gathered to investigate the impact of the technique on children\u2019s receptive vocabulary development and their parents\u2019 self-efficacy for storybook reading. Qualitative data were collected to examine parents\u2019 concerns about the technique and its impacts on the parent-child relationship. \nThe quantitative part of the study consisted of a pre-test/posttest with control group design. Participants were 40 Turkish parents and their preschool-aged children. Children\u2019s receptive vocabulary was measured using the Turkish version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). The investigator developed a Parents\u2019 Self-efficacy for Storybook Reading Questionnaire to measure parents\u2019 self-efficacy for storybook reading. After the pre-test, participants were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received dialogical storybook reading training. Seven weeks after the training, a posttest was administered to the participants. \nPaired t-tests and analysis of variance (ANCOVA) were used to examine the impacts of the technique on children\u2019s receptive vocabulary development and their parents\u2019 self-efficacy for storybook reading. Findings revealed that after the dialogical storybook reading training, the experimental group parents\u2019 self-efficacy for storybook reading significantly increased. Concurrently, control group parents\u2019 self-efficacy for storybook reading remained the same between the pre- and posttest. There were no significant differences between posttest scores for the control and experimental groups on self-efficacy for storybook reading. The receptive vocabulary of experimental group children significantly increased from pre- to posttest. However, this increase did not occur for children in the control group. A comparison of posttest results for the two groups revealed that the experimental groups\u2019 receptive vocabulary levels were significantly higher than those for the control group. \nQualitative data were gathered through in-depth interviews with 15 parents from the experimental group to examine their concerns about the dialogical storybook technique and its impact on the parent-child relationship. Data were analyzed according to the principles of grounded theory. After the transcription of the interviews, open codes were derived from the transcription. Open codes grouped under axial codes and analyses of axial codes led to a compilation of final themes. Two major concerns cited by parents about dialogical storybook reading were: change in parental role during storybook reading, and importance of parents\u2019 previous joint storybook reading experiences. Also, parents reported three major impacts of the technique on the parent-child relationship. The three major impacts were: unique activity sharing more time, democracy in family, and need for consistency between parents.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2325], "author_name_tesi": "Kotaman, Huseyin ", "last_name_ssi": "Kotaman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huseyin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Daniel Yawkey", "Gregory John Kelly", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Rayne Audrey Sperling"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Daniel Yawkey, Committee Chair", "Gregory John Kelly, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Rayne Audrey Sperling, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["storybook reading", "receptive vocabulary", "early childhood"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Assessing Security of Mobile telecommunication networks", "id": "8755", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3680", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-01-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the increase in popularity of mobile phones over landlines, the mobile telecommunication network has now become the primary source of communication for not only business and pleasure, but also for the many life and mission critical services such as E-911. These networks have become highly attractive targets to adversaries due to their heavy usage and their numerous vulnerabilities that may be easily exploited to cause major network outages. \n\nOur dissertation is motivated by the numerous vulnerabilities suffered by these networks and the lack of comprehensive mobile telecommunication network specific security assessment. Our dissertation bridges this gap by assessing the current state of security of the mobile telecommunication network, and determining the network characteristics that must be changed to render the network more secure. In our assessment, we: (1) identify and classify possible threats to mobile telecommunication networks; (2) assess potential vulnerabilities that may be exploited to realize these threats; and (3) devise defense strategies to protect from such attacks.\n\nIn the first step, we conducted a comprehensive study to identify possible threats to the network, and developed a unique three dimensional taxonomy to classify these threats. This was the first detailed study of this type. Our most significant results from this study include identifying: the unique cascading effect of attacks in the mobile telecommunication network, by which an adversary can attack a network target from a remote location (for example, an adversary may prevent a police officer or an emergency health-care provider from receiving an E-911 call from a remote location). The technical impact of our work is that it has created an increased awareness of the threats faced by the mobile telecommunication network due to its numerous vulnerabilities.\n\nIn the second step, we developed the Cellular Network Vulnerability Assessment Toolkit - CAT, to assess potential network vulnerabilities. This toolkit allows a user to input specific pre-conditions or vulnerabilities, and provides a visual trace of the possible attacks that may be launched by exploiting the user input vulnerabilities. Visual traces allow users to trace the effect of an attack through a network and determine its side-effects and ultimate service disruption. \nThe toolkit also allows a user to quantify the benefits of a security solution by removing attack effects based on the defenses provided. One major advantage of our toolkit is that potential solutions may be evaluated before expensive development and deployment.\n\nIn the third step, we propose a new security protocol, End-to-End Security - EndSec to address the most damaging attacks uncovered from the second part of our work. EndSec provides multi-hop security by inserting cryptographic checks on key parameters, allowing corruption of data or logic to be traced to its source. The technical impact of EndSec is that it brings accountability to the network previously non-existent, and  enables real-time tracking of adversary activity. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive security assessment of the mobile telecommunication network.  Our  taxonomy is the first to ito identify the cascading effect of attacks on telecommunication networks. Our toolkit, CAT, is the first to assess the vulnerability of the mobile telecommunication network and quantify the effectiveness of potential security solutions. Our protocol, EndSec is the first end-to-end security scheme for mobile telecommunication networks.

We propose the data mining--informed cognitive radio, which uses non-traditional data sources and data-mining techniques for decision making and improving the performance of a wireless network.\n\nWe consider a cognitive wireless network in which users adopt a spectrum-sharing strategy based on cooperation constraints. The majority of cognitive radio schemes bifurcate the role of players as either cooperative or non-cooperative. In this work, however, we modify this strategy to one in which players are hybrid, i.e., both cooperative and non-cooperative. Using a Stackelberg game strategy, we evaluate the improvement in performance of a cognitive radio network with these hybrid cognitive players using an M/D/1 queuing model. We use a novel game strategy (which we call altruism) to ``police'' a wireless network by monitoring the network and finding the non-cooperative players. Upon introduction of this new player, we present and test a series of predictive algorithms that show improvements in wireless channel utilization over traditional collision--detection algorithms. Our results demonstrate the viability of using this strategy to inform and create more efficient cognitive radio networks. Next, we study a Stackelberg competition with the primary license holder as the leader, and investigate the impact of multiple leaders by modeling the wireless channel as an M/D/1 queue. We find that, in the Stackelberg game, the leader can improve its utility by influencing the followers' decisions using its advertised cost function and the number of followers accepted in the network. The gain in utility monotonically increases until the network is saturated. The Stackelberg game formulation shows the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium using an appropriate cost function. The equilibrium maximizes the total utility of the network and allows spectrum sharing between primary and secondary cognitive users.\n\nWe propose a novel medium access protocol. We investigate an auction mechanism for sharing available wireless bandwidth among competing cognitive radios. The bandwidth under consideration may be either in an unlicensed spectrum or in an unused licensed band. Spectrum sharing is achieved via a mechanism in which a cognitive radio acting as the auctioneer advertises spectrum availability to bidding cognitive radios and defines a puzzle to solve as a method to access it. The cognitive radios act as bidders by computing the solution to the problem (i.e., the ``puzzle''). The winner is the bidder who submits the first correct bid and thus gains access to the spectrum for the next time interval. We consider two different variations of our scheme based on parallelizable and non-parallelizable problems and demonstrate that the latter provides a fair auction in contrast to the former. We propose a verification database to counter malicious ``greedy'' players. Our algorithm provides a centralized, easy-to-implement, and computationally fast multiple-access scheme that is verifiable by all participating cognitive radios.\n\nTo ensure a secure cognitive radio network, we propose a blockchain verification protocol as a method for enabling and securing spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks. The spectrum-sharing mechanism is used as a medium access protocol for accessing wireless bandwidth among competing cognitive radios. We introduce a virtual currency, called ``Specoins'', for payment to access the spectrum. An auction mechanism based on a first-come-first-served queue is used, with the price for the spectrum advertised by each primary user in a decentralized fashion. The blockchain protocol facilitates the transactions between primary and secondary users and is used to validate and save each user's virtual wallet. Also important for mobile networks, the blockchain serves as a distributed database that is visible by all participating parties, and any node can volunteer to update the blockchain. The volunteer nodes are called miners and are awarded with Specoins. We propose diverse methods to exchange the Specoins in order to make leasing possible even by cognitive radios that are not miners. We show the improvement of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional ALOHA medium access protocol in terms of spectrum usage. This difference is investigated using small-scale fading variation in the wireless channel to compare the performance of our secure method with the conventional medium access used in communications. The blockchain verification protocol is not only secure but also outperforms conventional systems in moderate cases of small-scale fading. In the case of severe small-scale fading the blockchain protocol will outperform the conventional system if multipath diversity is not used.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16128], "author_name_tesi": "Kotobi, Khashayar ", "last_name_ssi": "Kotobi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Khashayar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sven Bilen", "Sven Bilen", "Kenneth Jenkins", " Jeffrey Mayer", "Conrad Tucker "], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sven Bilen, Dissertation Advisor", "Sven Bilen, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", " Jeffrey Mayer, Committee Member", "Conrad Tucker , Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cognitive Radio", "Wireless Communication", "Machine Learning", "Data Science", "Data Mining", "Blockchain", "Security", "Spectrum Sharing"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "School Effects in the Era of Accountability: \nthe Complex Relationship Between School Composition,school Climate, and Student Outcomes \n", "id": "26657", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11679", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using data from the High School Longitudinal Study 2009 (HSLS:09), a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. high school students, this study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to answer the following research questions: 1) To what extent does school climate vary by the compositional characteristics of schools (i.e. school SES; percentage minority)?; 2) To what extent is there an association between school structure (sector and size) and climate? \n3) To what extent do different aspects of school climate affect student math achievement and attainment? ;4) To what degree does school climate mediate the relationship between compositional factors on high school students\u2019 math achievement and high school attainment?; 5) To what extent are the effects of school climate on achievement moderated by race? School climate is measured by three latent variables measuring academic climate, disciplinary climate, and school attachment.  This study builds upon previous studies and improves them in several key ways.  First, previous studies suffer from bias since traditional regression methods are not designed to be used with latent variables. Moreover, this is one of the first large-scale quantitative studies to capture school climate effects at the high school level for students and schools who came of age during the No Child Left Behind policy era. Specifically, this study aims to provide policy makers with a more cogent understanding of the complex relationship between school composition, school type, and climate with student expectations and math achievement.  The study suggests that school attachment is the most salient school climate factor related to student attainment and it is an important factor for minority students\u2019 math learning.  Additionally, this study indicates that several other school characteristics such as percent minority and school SES are associated with improved school climate and math learning.  Structural elements such as school size and school type were related to climate and some academic outcomes.

A lacquer or varnish type of deposit initially forms followed by transformation to a dark carbon deposit. Yet each of these very different deposits (lacquer or dark carbon) results from degradation of the same lubricant.\nTo provide a reference frame for mass deposition, the standard mass deposition profile was mapped using the PSMO method. Sets of substitutional tests were performed using a second stage of PSMO. Aged film substitution tests were performed using differently aged pre-deposits re-inserted within fresh lubricant to gauge the effect of deposit chemistry upon deposit growth. Similarly, aged oil experiments were conducted to test for any potential synergy between aged oil and evolving deposits. Each test strategy provides a means by which to decouple the lubricant from the deposit so as to gauge the role of deposit chemistry upon continued deposit growth.  To provide a baseline for comparison, heat treatments were applied to films extracted from various stages of the mass deposition curve.  \nTo characterize film chemistry and its evolution, FTIR and EDS spectroscopy were applied PSMO deposits formed during the course of this study.  The former measures alkyl sp3 C-H and carbonyl C=O bond stretching vibrations and their relative concentration as films/deposits age.  The latter provides a more global measure of C- and O-atom content as the deposit undergoes deoxygenation and dehydrogenation reactions.  \nResults obtained in this study showed a declining activity towards mass deposition with film age. Chemical characterization of these series of films by EDS for global elemental composition and by FTIR for chemically specific bond concentration correlate well with each other, specifically comparison of the chemical composition rates shows correspondence between C and O atom concentration changes. Also mass deposition rates decrease with increasing film age, within the proviso for times past induction and accelerative stages.  Aged film studies demonstrate a consistent reactivity decline with increasing film.\nThe significance of these studies is that they are the first to consider the deposit as not only chemically active, but governing subsequent deposition. Traditionally, deposits have been considered as inert, the end product of a series of complex liquid phase radical driven processes, decoupled from the film. Further distinguishing this work from prior studies, referencing the film is the presumption of homogeneous chemistry, albeit time-varying under heated, oxidizing conditions. Hence in this context, the uniform layer deposition model is advanced. \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5512], "author_name_tesi": "Kouame, Sylvain-Didier Brou", "last_name_ssi": "Kouame", "middle_name_ssi": "Brou", "first_name_ssi": "Sylvain-Didier", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Randy Vander Wal", "Randy Lee Vander Wal", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Yaw D Yeboah", "Joseph Manuel Perez Sr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Randy Vander Wal, Dissertation Advisor", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Committee Chair", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "Yaw D Yeboah, Committee Member", "Joseph Manuel Perez Sr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Deposits", "Uniform layer", "Dehydrogenation", "Lubricant", "Deoxygenation", "Polymeric deposit", "Aged Film Test", "Carbon", "Micro- Oxidaton", "Aged Oil Test"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Role of an ARF1 and ARF6 Signaling Pathway in HGF-Stimulated Epithelial Cell Migration", "id": "13672ejd181", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13672", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a potent signaling factor that acts on epithelial\ncells, causing them to dissociate and scatter.

Using the FIA database and statistical modeling, our research has shown that there are factors statistically significant to a harvest at both the plot and tree level in the northeastern United States.  These factors also vary with the proportion of basal area of timber removed in a harvest.  Using logistic regression to examine these significant factors, we have determined that the value of standing timber has an effect on harvest probability at the stand level.  At a tree harvest level, there is no significant relationship between harvesting decision and individual tree value.  This may be due to the factors considered when a site is being considered for a harvest differing from those when individual trees are being selected.  A significant difference also exists for harvests on private versus public land, with private owners tending to take larger, more valuable trees, but less overall stand volume.  Diameter tends to be a strong predictor of harvest probability at both the plot and tree level, and suggests that there is an increasing harvest probability up to a maximum plot average or individual tree size, after which, the probability of a harvest decreases.  Model variable statistical significance for volume/size metrics such as diameter and cubic feet is quite high.  The inability to utilize strong explanatory variables to describe a large portion of the variation inherent in timber harvests is a problem that plagues similar studies, even at smaller scales, suggesting that more research needs to be done on what environmental, social, or economic variables influence timber harvests, and whether these factors are national or regional.

Observations from 88 hurricane passages are used to construct radial thermodynamic storm profiles. These profiles are compared to the idealized boundary layer in Potential Intensity (PI) theory.  Data from 85 passages are used to calculate ocean-air enthalpy fluxes.  Temperature decreases with decreasing radius, while moist entropy begins to increase with decreasing radius beyond the radius of maximum winds, especially for major hurricanes.  Total enthalpy fluxes calculated using composite observed conditions differ substantially from fluxes calculated using PI theory idealizations, though the sign of the difference depends on the flux calculation method used.\nModifying the (PI) calculation to account for energy production beyond the eyewall produces higher maximum intensities. The radial shape of the wind profile modulates the maximum intensity increase. For outer limits of energy production at 2-2.5 times the radius of maximum winds, PI can increase by more than 10 ms-1 over its standard value. These results provide a potential explanation for why individual TCs can exceed their potential intensity.\nRegression mixture-model clustering of TC forecast tracks from 30 120-hour forecasts of the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System ensemble produces interpretable partitions by direction and speed of motion across initialization times. Clustering synthesizes the forecast spread within the ensemble into a small number of representative trajectories. Clustering of track and Cyclone Phase Space (CPS) forecasts of Hurricane Sandy from four ensemble prediction systems also produces meaningful track and CPS partitions. Rand Index and Adjusted Rand Index calculations demonstrate a substantial relationship between track and CPS cluster membership. Storm-centered composites show that both track and CPS clustering yield substantial variations in structural evolution among clusters.\nEnsemble forecasts from the ECWMF and GEFS ensemble prediction systems are used to initialize an ensemble of regional simulations. Tracks and CPS evolutions from these simulations are then clustered using regression mixture models.  Among this ensemble, there is a substantial relationship between track and CPS evolution of Sandy. This is due to extratropical transition (ET) timing and lower-tropospheric thickness asymmetry during ET.

Ocean-air energy fluxes are calculated for 31 hurricanes in the dataset for which SST data are available. Profiles constructed with these data are compared to the theoretical boundary layer profiles of Emanuel Potential Intensity (EPI) theory. It is determined that the boundary layer is not isothermal as in the idealized EPI profile, but decreases in temperature with decreasing radius between the environment and TC core. Also, in the composite TC profile, entropy increases more rapidly inside 2.5 times the radius of maximum winds (Rmax) than pressure decreases alone can account for. This indicates that ocean-air fluxes outside of Rmax can play a substantial role in TC entropy input.  It is also determined that the scheme used in calculating spray fluxes impacts the total ocean-air turbulent energy flux, and has an even greater impact on the distribution between latent and sensible energy fluxes. In the second section of the study, the effects of environmental conditions and conditions in the storm on potential intensity (PI) are studied.  Lower temperature and moisture in the unsaturated boundary layer at Rmax increases PI as measured by maximum sustained winds (Vmax). This occurs because lower temperature and moisture at Rmax allow greater entropy input into the TC at Rmax due to greater ocean-air temperature and moisture disequilibria. The PI increases from using observationally-derived profiles can be as great as 10 ms-1. This suggests that conditions within the TC are of comparable importance to environmental conditions in determining PI. It also suggests that Vmax may be higher than EPI theory currently predicts using its idealized boundary layer profiles.

Using the historical Atlantic TC record, this thesis first examines the empirical relationships between climate state variables and Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) counts. State variables considered as predictors include indices of the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Northern Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and both \u201clocal\u201d and \u201crelative\u201d measures of main development region (MDR) sea surface temperature (SST). In addition, the considered predictors include indices measuring the so-called \u201cAtlantic Meridional Mode\u201d (AMM) and the West African monsoon. Using these predictors in forward stepwise Poisson regression, this thesis examines the relationships between TC counts and climate state variables. As a further extension on past studies, both basin-wide named storm counts and cluster analysis time series representing distinct flavors of TCs, are also modeled. A wide variety of cross validation metrics reveal that total TC counts may be more skillfully modeled than the cluster series, and the most skillful models most commonly share three predictors: the MDR SST index, an index of ENSO, and the NAO index.\n\t\nThe observed record of Atlantic TCs is relatively short however, and is subject to potential biases owing to lack of observation platforms such as aircraft reconnaissance and satellite imagery in earlier decades. Studies of long-term trends in TC activity are thus hindered by the limitations and uncertainty within the historical data. Therefore, this thesis also examines TC activity over a longer time frame using results from a long-term simulation of the NCAR CSM 1.4 coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model. The model has been forced with estimated natural and anthropogenic factors over the past millennium. Atmospheric variables from the model simulation are used to drive a recently developed downscaling relationship that simulates TC genesis and tracking over the course of the 1000-year simulation. This downscaling process generates a realistic long-term TC track dataset over an extended period of time, free of the observational record's many restrictions and biases.  The realistic track data was used to perform an objective analysis of long-term trends in Atlantic TCs and TC landfalls and the potential underlying climate drivers. Analysis of TC event time series reveal that counts of landfalling TCs and even landfalling hurricanes (i.e. the subset of relatively strong TCs) track relatively well with the total basin-wide TC activity on multidecadal and longer timescales. Statistical models driven with relevant climate predictors derived from the model fail to explain as much variance as those which have been developed and applied to modern historical TC counts, but they do demonstrate significant statistical skill over the long-term.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4067, 4068], "author_name_tesi": "Kozar, Michael Eric", "last_name_ssi": "Kozar", "middle_name_ssi": "Eric", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Mann", "Michael Mann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Mann, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Mann, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Climate", "Atlantic", "Tropical Cyclones", "Hurricanes", "Landfall"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "CVD GROWTH AND CHARACTERIZATION OF 2D NbS2", "id": "14355axk5540", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14355", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tMetallic NbS2 is a member of the 5B group dichalcogenides.

The 2H polytype shows superconductivity and has a transition temperature at 6.2 K whereas no superconductivity was reported in 3R NbS2 down to 1.7K.\n\tTo achieve precise thickness controlled crystal films of NbS2 over large areas and on different substrates, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis method is desired. Prior work on CVD of NbS2 films was primarily performed in hot-wall reactors under Ar and N2 environment using a variety of substrates such as bare Si, SiO2/Si, glass, hBN/sapphire and graphene. Almost always NbCl5 was used as the metal precursor, but different source materials ranging from elemental sulfur to complex organic compounds were used as the chalcogen precursor. \n\tThe main goal of the thesis research-was to develop a controlled process to grow monolayer and few layer films of NbS\u00ac2 in a cold-wall CVD reactor and investigate the substrate effect on the film growth. Growth of NbS2 was broadly investigated on C-plane sapphire and epitaxial graphene substrates in the temperature range from 400 to 800 \u2070C. NbCl5 and H2S were used as precursor materials with H\u00ac2 as a carrier gas and different          S: Nb ratios from 1200 to 6000 were studied. The 3R polytype of NbS\u00ac2 was obtained in all experiments.

Measured resistivity values were in a good agreement with previous reports and confirmed the metallic nature of the NbS\u00ac2 films. At low temperatures, an anomalous increase in resistivity was observed which indicated an insulating nature of the films. The origin of the unexpected resistivity increase likely due to oxidation of the films. Oxide layer formation was observed in all the films on C-plane sapphire substrates and a depth profile study revealed that oxidation of NbS\u00ac2 films occurred only on the top surface of the films.\n\tThe films on sapphire substrates had a fine grain structured morphology whereas the planar growth with the well-faceted domains was obtained on the epitaxial graphene substrates.

In order to increase efficiency, portability and performance over their cooled counterparts, uncooled thermal imaging utilizes materials able to operate at room temperature.  These thin film detectors absorb incoming thermal radiation, resulting in a temperature change and a corresponding resistivity change of the thin film imaging layer.  This resistivity change is measured by the CMOS read-out circuitry the microbolometers are fabricated on, and converted to an image.  One of the most widely used materials is a vanadium oxide thin film due to its low resistivity, high temperature coefficient of resistance, and low noise characteristics.  While these films have been manufactured commercially for years using ion beam deposition, this study concentrates on thin film vanadium oxide films deposited using magnetron sputtering.  \n\nIn this study, vanadium oxide thin films are deposited using pulsed DC reactive magnetron sputtering of a metallic vanadium target.  Various properties of these films were studied in order to get a better understanding of the structural and electrical characteristics of the films.  In particular, this study looked at the effect on the film properties of a substrate bias applied to the thin film during deposition.  The vanadium oxide thin films in this study were deposited in an argon atmosphere at various oxygen partial pressures with total flow rates between 15 and 45 sccm at pressures of 2.5 and 5 mTorr.  RF as well as both positive and negative DC substrate biases were applied to the films during deposition.  Structural characteristics of the films were studied using spectroscopic ellipsometry, grazing incident x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.  Electrical properties such as resistivity and the temperature coefficient of resistivity were also studied.\n\nAs seen in previous works, the cathode current at the target, as well as various electrical properties, exhibited a hysteresis effect between films made at increasing %O2 and decreasing %O2.  These films have been shown to have resistivites on the order of 1 ohm-cm with TCR values as large as -4%/K.  GIXRD has been used to show that these films consist of FCC rock salt nanocrystallites in an amorphous matrix.  The application of a substrate bias during deposition has been shown to increase the TCR to resistivity ratio of the films, reduce their process hysteresis, densify the films, and, through the use of TEM images, form a nanocrystalline columnar structure containing micro-twins embedded within an amorphous vanadium oxide matrix.  The substrate bias has been shown to dramatically change the structure of the films as well as to improve numerous film properties critical to their application as imaging layers in uncooled IR microbolometer arrays.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5683], "author_name_tesi": "Kozlowski, Scott M", "last_name_ssi": "Kozlowski", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark William Horn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sputtering", "magnetron", "reactive", "vanadium oxide", "vanadium", "VOx", "pulsed DC", "bias", "microbolometer", "thermal imaging"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "NEW DEVELOPMENTS FOR CLUSTER ION BEAMS IN SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY IMAGING EXPERIMENTS\n", "id": "8152", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2735", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The analysis of the desorption of atomic and molecular ions from surfaces bombarded using energetic projectiles constitutes the technique of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).  In principle, SIMS is a powerful tool in the characterization of organic and biological material.  However, when the projectiles used to irradiate the sample are atomic in nature (i.e. Cs+, Ga+, In+, Au+, Bi+, etc.), several fundamental flaws exist, such as low yields, extensive fragmentation, and the incidence of significant sample damage after erosion beyond 1% of the surface molecules.  Polyatomic (cluster) ions (i.e. Au3+, Bi3+, C60+) have recently been introduced as possible replacements for atomic ions.  Since each constituent atom in a cluster ion has less kinetic energy then an atomic counterpart, the incident energy remains nearer the solid surface during the impact event.  Hence, the energy is deposited into the solid at a depth that is efficient for desorption and inefficient for sample damage.\nThe new physics associated with cluster ion bombardment has led to the observation of several special properties relevant to SIMS measurements, including increased yields, reduced physical and chemical sample damage, and the feasibility of molecular depth profiling.  The aim of this research is to maximize the performance of these properties in the SIMS imaging modality. Specifically, two approaches are emphasized \u2013 optimization of the type of cluster ion and optimization of the SIMS instrumental/experimental strategy. \nSince a large number of cluster ion types are available for use, a series of experiments are presented in which the quartz microbalance (QCM), atomic force microscope (AFM), and SIMS are used to measure surface sensitivity, sputter yield, and physical and chemical damage during ion bombardment of water-ice, phospholipid, cholesterol, and silicon.  The studies compare projectile type, i.e. Au+, Au2+, Au3+, and C60+, projectile incident energy, i.e. 10 keV \u2013 120 keV, and projectile incident angle, i.e. 0\u00b0 \u2013 75\u00b0.  The results show that the total sputtering yield relative to the degree of sample damage is largest when C60+ projectiles are employed at large kinetic energies and glancing incident angles.  Therefore, these conditions are most practical for increasing the overall sensitivity of SIMS and improving the prospect for three-dimensional (3-D) characterization.\nSince the current SIMS instrumental/experimental strategy does not fully exploit the optimized cluster ion beam type identified here, the instrument/experiment is modified. Specifically, the conventional strategy, which employs a pulsed ion beam and axial time-of-flight (ToF) MS detection, is restricted by its duty cycle, secondary ionization efficiency, and sample preparation.  Accordingly, we introduce a novel instrument in which a C60+ ion beam is operated in direct current (dc) mode and the desorbed ions are detected using an orthogonal ToF MS.  In addition to rapid sampling, we show the scheme is capable of tandem MS-MS when a sequence of quadropoles is placed between the sampling region and the ToF region.  \nFor all of the situations presented here, the secondary ionization efficiency is quite low.  Hence, strategies for enhancing the secondary ion yield are needed.  Here, we modify the instrumental/experimental strategy by using tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation obtained from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) to photoionize C60+ desorbed neutral particles.  The results show that although a C60+/VUV postionization spectrum can be attained, the ion yield is not currently large enough to be considered an improvement upon secondary ionization efficiency.  However, it is suggested that by increasing the photon flux of the VUV radiation, an acceptable ion yield may potentially be obtained.\nFinally, cluster ion beams are shown to change the nature of sample preparation for biological material.  Preliminary data is presented which demonstrates the utility of a C60+ ion beam in tandem with cryogenic freeze-fracture hardware for the interrogation of single biological cells.  The results suggest that the experimental strategy is practical for maintaining the 3-D structure of the single cell while exposing an intact, meaningful surface for SIMS imaging analysis.\nIn summary, the work presented here identifies the ion beam type and the instrumental/experimental strategy best-suited for utilizing the special properties of cluster ion bombardment in the SIMS imaging modality.  First, we find that by depositing the largest amount of energy as possible in the near-surface region of the solid using a single projectile, the total sputtering yield relative to sample damage becomes optimal for increased sensitivity and 3-D characterization in imaging analysis.  Second, we find that by modifying the instrumental/experimental strategy to include a dc cluster ion beam with orthogonal ToF detection, a high fluence VUV light source, and freeze-fracture hardware, the door is opened to rapid sampling, tandem MS-MS, improved secondary ionization efficiency, and well-preserved sample preparation during image analysis.  Overall, the developments presented in this thesis improve the prospect for SIMS imaging experiments using cluster ion beams.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2730], "author_name_tesi": "Kozole, Joseph ", "last_name_ssi": "Kozole", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nicholas Winograd", "Barbara Jane Garrison", "Blake R Peterson", "John H Golbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nicholas Winograd, Committee Chair", "Barbara Jane Garrison, Committee Member", "Blake R Peterson, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Molecular Depth Profiling", "Chemical Imaging", "Buckminsterfullerene", "ToF-SIMS", "3-D Imaging"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Structural Characterization of the Active Layer in Organic Solar Cells", "id": "12172", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1549", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Organic solar cells belong to a class of devices where the morphology of the active layer has a large impact on device performance.  However, characterization of the morphology of organic semiconductor mixtures remains a challenge.  We have utilized Grazing-Incidence Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering (GISAXS) and Energy Filtered Transmission Electron Microscopy (EFTEM) to characterize the morphology of polythiophene:fullerene mixtures as a function of processing conditions.  GISAXS has been used to determine the domain spacing within the active layer, whereas EFTEM has been used to generate images with high contrast between domains.  We have applied these methods to two promising polythiophene:fullerene systems, 1:1 mixtures of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and 1:4 mixtures of poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (PBTTT) and PC71BM.  In 1:1 P3HT:PCBM systems, domain compositions are found via EFTEM analysis, which are used in conjunction with DSC experiments to develop a theory for the mechanism of structural formation in polythiophene:fullerene blends.  Previously, it was thought that P3HT and PCBM were immiscible, but we show that a significant amount of the non-crystallized polymer forms a mixed amorphous phase with PCBM.  In 1:4 PBTTT/PC71BM mixtures, we show how larger domains form at long annealing times, which leads to poor performance in solar cell devices.  Using the fact that large domains lead to poor performance as a guiding principle, quantitative structure-function relationships are explored for the 1:4 PBTTT/PC71BM and 1:1 P3HT/PCBM mixtures based on GISAXS results.  Furthermore, EFTEM and GISAXS have been useful in guiding our attempts to perturb the structure of the active layer in organic solar cells.  Preliminary results show that the electric field alignment of crystalline P3HT fibers in an amorphous P3HT/PCBM matrix is promising.

Transfer length measurement test structures on p-SiC (NA = 3 \u00d7 10^20 cm^\u22123) epitaxial layers revealed ohmic contacts with specific contact resistances, \u03c1c, of ~10^\u22126\u201310^\u22125 \u03a9cm^2 after 0.5 h annealing in argon at 1000\u20131200 \u00b0C.  Contacts fabricated on n-SiC (ND = 2 \u00d7 10^19 cm^\u22123) by similar methods were shown to have similar \u03c1c values after annealing at 1000\u20131150 \u00b0C.  Together, these ohmic contacts demonstrated the lowest comparable \u03c1c values made simultaneously to both conductivity types.  Using simultaneous ohmic contacts would reduce the complexity in fabricating SiC devices.  The phases formed were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping.  In samples annealed at 1100 \u00b0C+, the contacts exhibited phase segregation with distinct carbide phases at the surface.  Samples annealed at 1000 \u00b0C displayed relatively homogeneous tungsten\u2013nickel\u2013carbide layers with smooth surfaces and only slightly higher \u03c1c values.  The contacts annealed at 1000 \u00b0C also demonstrated the most promise after aging, both briefly at 1000 \u00b0C and for 100 h at 600 \u00b0C in Ar, with only moderate increases in \u03c1c.  \nThe influence of polarity on metal\u2013semiconductor interfaces must be understood for optimizing electrical contacts.  Metal\u2013InN interfaces were characterized in a side-by-side study on the polar {0001} faces.  The Ni films on (0001) and (000-1) InN exhibited different reaction kinetics upon annealing at 400 \u00b0C.  Structural and chemical analysis using grazing incidence XRD, transmission electron microscopy, and XEDS indicated a sharp interface between the Ni film and the In-face (0001) InN layer.  However, the N-face InN reacted with Ni to form a Ni3InNx ternary phase with an anti-perovskite structure.  These results suggest the potential for polarity to impact other metal\u2013semiconductor systems as well.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11604], "author_name_tesi": "Kragh-Buetow, Katherine Cora", "last_name_ssi": "Kragh-Buetow", "middle_name_ssi": "Cora", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney", "Patrick M Lenahan", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Earle Richard Ryba", "Robert S Okojie"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Chair", "Patrick M Lenahan, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Earle Richard Ryba, Committee Member", "Robert S Okojie, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["silicon carbide (SiC)", "indium nitride (InN)", "polar semiconductors", "high temperature", "ohmic contacts", "tungsten", "nickel"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Articulated Models from Video", "id": "6102", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4701", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of models for visual tracking provides robustness towards image noise, clutter and occlusion and offers the ability to recover three-dimensional pose information of objects even from monocular images and image sequences.

It has in particular the ability to process human as well as non-human targets and makes no assumptions with respect to kinematic tree structure or complexity. \n\nThe overall problem addressed in this thesis is divided into a number of  sub-problems. A target and link-segmentation algorithm is responsible for decomposing an observed target into rigidly moving components and for obtaining initial motion estimates. Based on the obtained information, articulated structure estimation is performed, determining the joint constraints between observed target components. Finally, the 3D shape and pose is estimated by utilizing a novel model-based tracking framework for obtaining pose information across a set of uncalibrated keyframes and by performing shape from silhouette estimation together with 3D joint localization.  \n\nThis work hence presents a set of systematic solutions to the problems of model-acquisition and initialization that bridge the gap between state of the art model-based tracking approaches and practical applications.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4667], "author_name_tesi": "Krahnstoever, Nils ", "last_name_ssi": "Krahnstoever", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nils", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rajeev Sharma", "Rangashar Kasturi", "Octavia I Camps", "David Jonathan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rajeev Sharma, Committee Chair", "Rangashar Kasturi, Committee Member", "Octavia I Camps, Committee Member", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["computer vision", "image processing", "visual tracking", "model-based tracking", "model acquisition"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Supporting Pre-service Science Teachers in Developing Culturally Relevant Pedagogy", "id": "23624", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10528", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study employed a case study methodology to investigate a near\u2010authentic intervention program designed to support the development of culturally relevant pedagogy and its impact on preservice science teachers\u2019 notions of culturally relevant pedagogy.

It was found that the CV/g decreases with decreasing formation voltage due to the presence of the native oxide thickness (which corresponds to the zero formation voltage) becoming a more significant fraction of the total dielectric thickness. Also, since the native oxide is present regardless of tantalum particle size, the percentage of % CV/g loss is almost independent of the initial tantalum particle size, although the absolute losses are greater for smaller particle sizes. \nThe model provided insight into the effects of curvature on electric field, where it was observed that there is electric field enhancement at the anode for features with positive curvature and at the cathode for features of negative curvature. Likewise, there is electric field depletion at the cathode for features with positive curvature and at the anode for features of negative curvature. Since the D.C. leakage current is directly related to the electric field, using the same physical model allows for the effects of particle curvature on the D.C. leakage to be predicted. It was found that for Schottky emission, there is leakage current enhancement at the cathode for negative curvature features. The leakage due to Schottky emission is predicted to be inhomogeneous at the cathodes depending on the features curvature. For Poole-Frenkel conduction, curvature does not affect the leakage current density, but the total leakage current per volume scales with the surface area per volume and is thus greater for smaller particle sizes. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [161], "author_name_tesi": "Kramer, Angela J", "last_name_ssi": "Kramer", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Angela", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Elizabeth Dickey", "Elizabeth C Dickey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Elizabeth Dickey, Thesis Advisor", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["electric field", "Poole-Frenkel effect", "specific charge", "dielectric", "tantalum pentoxide", "tantalum", "electrolytic capacitors", "Schottky emission"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "An Experimental Investigation on Performance of a Model Geothermal Pile in Sand", "id": "18918", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8919", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of geothermal piles as foundation elements of residential and office buildings is an innovative and sustainable method of energy conservation. Heat exchange through piles may have significant impact on their geotechnical performance due to thermally induced mechanical stresses and additional settlements caused by constrained thermal strains. Thermal behavior of geothermal piles are often assessed based on available idealized heat transfer models which rely on over-simplified assumptions and neglect critical operational parameters such as variable heat flux and circulation rate of heat carrier fluid. The physics and mechanics of geothermal piles subjected to thermal and mechanical loadings need to be properly understood in order for the development of an efficient design methodology. \n\nAn experimental setup is developed as part of this research to investigate performance of a model geothermal pile under a series of thermal and mechanical loading. Such controlled laboratory experiments in a soil chamber allow isolation of different variables and their effects on system performance. Temperature was measured at several locations within the pile-soil system to identify the nature of heat transfer through the model heat exchanger pile and to quantify energy output, which is a function of temperature gained from or rejected to the soil, from the pile. Axial load-displacement behavior of the model pile was studied through a series of mechanical load tests performed under different thermal conditions. Load was measured at the pile head using a load cell, and pile head and base displacements were measured using a pair of Linear Variable Differential Transformers (LVDTs). Such displacement measurements were critical in studying how the load-displacement behavior changed with thermal loads. \n\nRadial heat transfer was observed along most part of the pile length. Circulation velocity of the heat carrier fluid and thermal conductivity of soil were found to be important parameters that affect heat transfer through a geothermal pile. Results obtained from this study may further be used to validate numerical and analytical models that predict heat transfer through vertical heat exchangers. Although some changes in mechanical load-displacement behavior due to thermal loading were observed, the role of thermal loading in changing mechanical capacity of the model geothermal pile could not be precisely quantified. Nevertheless, the observed changes in pile load-displacement behavior warrants further research that would quantify strains (and thus stresses) at different pile cross-sections.

The objective of this work is to relate the bulk composition to surface response for various compositions in the calcium aluminosilicate system. These studies emphasized the characterization of CAS glass surfaces before and after corrosion in combination with existing solution chemistry experiments. Corrosion effects such as altered layer formation and hydration were studied for a range of CAS glass compositions. Surface characterization techniques such as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared vibrational spectroscopy (FTIRRS, ATR-IR), and secondary ion-mass spectrometry (D-SIMS) were used to characterize the glass surfaces. The surface response of CAS glass surfaces was found to depend on composition, solution pH, and reaction time. For relatively high-silica CAS glasses (>70% SiO2), incongruent dissolution was not found to be an in-depth effect of corrosion even in strong acid conditions as observed for other glass systems such as the sodium aluminosilicate glass system. Analysis of the reacted glass surfaces indicated the attack of Al-O bonds and release of calcium as the primary mode of degradation in acidic solution.

In humans and other mammals, skeletal muscle normally accounts for nearly 75% of whole body insulin-stimulated glucose transport.  Impaired ability of the muscle to respond to insulin is therefore disruptive to systemic glucose homeostasis.  Interestingly, skeletal muscle also possesses contractile properties that effectively restore glucose control in an insulin-independent manner, and this element is preserved in individuals with diabetes.  While the precise mechanisms remain elusive, it is clear that both insulin and contraction signals converge on GLUT4 vesicles and promote their translocation to the cell membrane.  Akt Substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) is a Rab-GTPase activating protein that was recently identified as the most distal regulatory molecule involved in insulin signaling to glucose uptake in adipocytes.  However, the role of AS160 in skeletal muscle has not been explored.  This dissertation examines AS160 phosphorylation and its putative regulation of glucose uptake in mouse skeletal muscle.  It is demonstrated herein that: 1) insulin and contraction utilize distinct and additive upstream signaling mechanisms to stimulate AS160 phosphorylation in skeletal muscle in vivo and in vitro; 2) phosphorylation of AS160 by insulin and contraction is necessary for their full stimulation of skeletal muscle glucose uptake; and 3) the AS160 calmodulin-binding domain regulates contraction- but not insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.  Collectively, our findings implicate AS160 as a point of convergence for both insulin and contraction signals leading to glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, although the mechanisms by which insulin and contraction mediate AS160 function are not identical.  Future research should evaluate the efficacy of targeting AS160 for novel therapeutic diabetes interventions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2173], "author_name_tesi": "Kramer, Henning Fritz", "last_name_ssi": "Kramer", "middle_name_ssi": "Fritz", "first_name_ssi": "Henning", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Laurie J Goodyear", "Peter A Farrell", "Thomas C Vary", "Neil Sharkey", "Ian Alexander Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Committee Chair", "Laurie J Goodyear, Committee Chair", "Peter A Farrell, Committee Member", "Thomas C Vary, Committee Member", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Member", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["glucose metabolism", "insulin", "exercise", "diabetes", "skeletal muscle"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "The Relationship of Lower Extremity Malalignments in College Students with a History of ACL Injury", "id": "6323", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3733", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are a common and debilitating knee injury. Non-contact ACL injuries are 2-8 times more common in females for reasons that are currently unknown. It has been hypothesized that structural differences between males and females may lead to the increased injury rate in females. The purpose of this study was to examine lower extremity malalignments in college students who had previously suffered an ACL injury. In addition, previous ankle injury was hypothesized to be a contributing factor to ACL injury so ankle injury history information was also collected.\n\tFifty-two college age students (33 females, 19 males) with a history of an ACL injury and 33 females controls with no history of knee injury volunteered for this study. Participants filled out a survey of knee and ankle history and then had 16 different measures of lower extremity malalignment and flexibility taken.\n\tMy most clinically relevant finding when comparing injured males and females was a significant association between ACL injury history and ankle sprain injury history. Those with a history of ACL sprain were more likely to have had an ankle sprain. To explore the relationship between malalignments and ACL injury, a discriminant analysis was performed. Thirty-five and two-tenths percent of the variation in ACL injury history was explained by twelve variables. Of those 12 variables, 21.1% of that association was explained by greater generalized laxity, greater genu recurvatum, and lack of iliotibial band (ITB) flexibility. \n\tIf there is a kinetic chain relationship between previous ankle injury and risk for ACL injury, ACL prevention programs can be added to the ankle rehabilitative programs currently used.

The theoretical frameworks to inform the study consisted of attachment theory and a blend of relational theory and connected knowing. The study focused on understanding adults\u2019 relationships with their canine companions and, specifically, how this particular relationship contributes to personal growth and well-being in adulthood. Data consisted of participant narratives shared during interviews. In addition, participants showed a favorite photograph of their canine companion(s) and shared the story behind the photograph. Through their own stories, ten participants descriptively shared how the relationships with their canine companions have fostered their personal growth and promoted their well-being. The narratives were individually and collectively analyzed.\n\tThe findings revealed commonalities across the narratives. First, participants considered their canine companions to be family members and for some participants the canine companions filled a void in their lives. Several participants shared how personally rewarding it was to rescue a canine in need of a home. Second, the canine companions taught the participants about unconditional love, patience, and responsibility/accountability. Third, spending time with the canine companions, the intuitiveness within the relationship, and the differences in canines\u2019 personalities contributed to the promotion of well-being.\n\tThe study concludes with implications for theory and practice. The findings have implications for the adult education field as growth and learning is not limited to connections and relationships with other humans, but also occurs through relationships with canine companions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7049], "author_name_tesi": "Kramer, Lorie Renee", "last_name_ssi": "Kramer", "middle_name_ssi": "Renee", "first_name_ssi": "Lorie", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Ann Swartz", "Dr Richard Fiene"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Chair", "Ann Swartz, Committee Member", "Dr Richard Fiene, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adult education", "human-animal bond", "anthrozoology", "learning through relationships/connections", "attunement", "attachment to pets"]}]
