For example, gas development and its physical surface disruption to soil properties, especially those properties that respond to disturbance (dynamic soil properties), could alter ecosystem function for sensitive components like hydric soils and reduce the chance of successful interim or final reclamation. \nTo evaluate potential dynamic soil property (DSP) change due to gas development, soil physical and hydrologic properties were measured on conventional and unconventional natural gas pads and pipelines. Results indicate that pad and pipeline reclamation on unconventional gas sites results in significantly higher bulk density, lower carbon and nitrogen pools, and decreased saturated hydraulic conductivity at 20 cm depth compared to undisturbed soils. On conventional sites, bulk density was significantly higher on disturbed compared to undisturbed soils but unlikely to be root limiting. In addition conventional site SOC and nitrogen pools and 20 cm saturated hydraulic conductivity were not significantly different between disturbed and undisturbed soils. The lower DSP change observed on conventional compared to unconventional sites may reflect potential differences in disturbance patterns between infrastructure types and/ or recovery of the soil with time. DSP change on unconventional sites is likely to decrease soil function and be a limiting factor in establishing erosion control cover and site reclamation, and potentially affect off-site hydrologic function.\nThe prevalence of hydric soils in Pennsylvania is anecdotally known to be high, but poorly mapped by the NRCS Soil Survey due to the typical small size of such areas. Locating hydric soils is important for unconventional gas project design and ecosystem monitoring efforts. Disturbance of such soils could also substantially degrade their hydrologic function and ecosystem services. Improved mapping of hydric soils was attempted using field data parameters and Pennsylvania LiDAR derived landscape metrics. Modeling results indicate that using a 1m resolution slope grid as a predictor variable results in correct prediction of 70% of the non-hydric soils and 58% of the hydric soils from a population of 1,153 sample points (416 hydric, 737 non-hydric). The model, in comparison to current NRCS Soil Survey data, results in substantially improved mapping of where hydric soils are likely and unlikely to occur. Improved hydric soil mapping capabilities will aid in the placement of natural gas infrastructure, help avoid ecological impacts, and assist NRCS personnel in carrying out the provisions of the USDA Farm Security Agency Swampbuster Act. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9313], "author_name_tesi": "Fink, Cody M", "last_name_ssi": "Fink", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Cody", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick Joseph Drohan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick Joseph Drohan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["dynamic soil properties", "natural gas pads", "natural gas pipelines", "hydric soils", "LiDAR"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Resource and Space Constrained Project Scheduling\n", "id": "10675", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1311", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Production planning in large-scale industries such as construction and shipbuilding is a key component in the manufacturing process and has a significant effect on the overall cost and schedule of the final product.  This is due to the fact that the successful fabrication of these products requires a significant amount of material and resources, all of which must be coordinated and appropriately scheduled.  Project scheduling methods have been used to model and schedule activities in these industries with great success.  Until recently, spatial resources, such as floor space and interior space, have not been taken into consideration in the planning phase of a project.  Traditionally, spatial conflicts have been resolved locally as they occur, often resulting in costly schedule delays.\nThis thesis develops a framework to model space in a project scheduling problem comprised of installation activities within the interior of a large-scale product.  The objective is to find a schedule with near-minimum makespan.  The installation project activities are constrained by precedence relationships and limited resource availabilities.  Space is modeled as a special resource.  The space modeling approach approximates the space required by the activities and uses those space requirements to calculate spatial conflicts.   Space conflicts are incorporated via a congestion function, which increases the duration of the installation activities with overlapping spatial requirements, reflecting productivity losses due to interference.  The congestion function is based on the conflict volume and the length of time the conflict occurs.  \nA prototype software application is developed from the framework to demonstrate the feasibility of the method.  A hypothetical problem and a case study problem are solved using the application.  The results show that considering spatial constraints increased the project makespan from 7% to 16% for the hypothetical problems and 35% for the case study problem.\nThe developed framework establishes an integrated methodology to model the effects of worker and activity space congestion during schedule generation.  In previous work, space conflicts were identified after the schedule was completed and resolved manually. The congestion function developed in this thesis explicitly considers types of space and the volume and time duration of conflicts among types.  Previous work has either modeled multiple space types without estimating the effect on activity duration, or created a single function independent of space type.  \nBy incorporating realistic space requirements and considering the effect of spatial conflicts during schedule generation, a more realistic project schedule can be created that limits costly schedule delays attributed to less detailed planning practices.  Congestion is inherently present in installation projects and has been managed by front line supervisors with little help from formal scheduling tools.  The framework developed in this thesis enables front line supervisors to account for and control congestion to minimize schedule delays and project costs.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1300], "author_name_tesi": "Finke, Daniel ", "last_name_ssi": "Finke", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah Jean Medeiros", "Deborah Jean Medeiros", "Mark Thomas Traband", "Catherine Mary Harmonosky", "John Messner", "Michael Andrew Yukish", "Vaughn Eugene Whisker Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah Jean Medeiros, Dissertation Advisor", "Deborah Jean Medeiros, Committee Chair", "Mark Thomas Traband, Committee Member", "Catherine Mary Harmonosky, Committee Member", "John Messner, Committee Member", "Michael Andrew Yukish, Committee Member", "Vaughn Eugene Whisker Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Congestion Modeling", "4D Modeling", "Project Scheduling", "Genetic Algorithm"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "STRATEGY INSTRUCTION FOR TYPICALLY DEVELOPING CHILDREN: JOINT BOOK READING WITH CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER WHO REQUIRE AUGMENTATIVE AND ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION.\n", "id": "8682", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1830", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As a result of their inherent difficulty with social interaction and communication, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently require support to communicate and engage in successful social interactions.

Engagement in discretionary activities, defined here as activities that are not necessarily school- or work-related, is important not only for the immediate health and well-being of youth, but also for long-term positive health. For example, experiences during adolescence shape civic commitments thereafter and, beyond individual outcomes, a healthy democracy rests on the participation of its citizens. In addition, the experiences and opportunities adolescents have may be influenced by the historical time in which they live, which may differentially shape their lives. The current dissertation sought to identify combinations of civic engagement, free time, and alcohol use discretionary activities across 12 cohorts of adolescents in the U.S. and in 1 birth cohort of adolescents in Britain, to compare U.S. and British adolescents, and to investigate the longitudinal implications that combinations of discretionary activities among British adolescents have for civic engagement in adulthood. Four research aims were explored in two studies. Study 1 used nationally representative data of U.S. adolescents who participated in the annual Monitoring the Future surveys (Johnston, O\u2019Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2009) to: (1) Describe U.S. adolescents\u2019 combinations of civic engagement, free time, and alcohol use discretionary activities; and (2) Examine whether and how U.S. adolescents\u2019 combinations of discretionary activities differed across 4 decades. Study 2 used nationally representative data of British adolescents participating in the longitudinal British Cohort Study (Butler, Golding, & Howlett, 1985) to: (3) Describe British adolescents\u2019 combinations of civic engagement, free time, and alcohol use discretionary activities and examine whether these combinations replicated those found in the U.S. samples; and (4) Investigate whether British adolescents\u2019 combinations of discretionary activities predicted\niv\ndifferences in civic engagement in adulthood at ages 26, 30, and 34. In both studies, 3 types of adolescent discretionary activities were examined: civic engagement, which captured activities that expressed a commitment to society and the well-being of others; free time, which included activities that were part of adolescents\u2019 daily lives but that did not contain an inherent commitment to society; and alcohol use, which represented experimentation with potential risks to health. Person-centered analyses were utilized to describe different combinations of discretionary activities. By exploring the heterogeneity of youth experiences and whether these combinations of discretionary activities predicted civic engagement in adulthood, we may gain insight into the constellation of discretionary activities that may be important to adolescent development, particularly for subgroups of youth who vary from the general trend.\nTo pursue the first and second research aims, cross-sectional nationally representative survey responses from 12th grade adolescents participating in the annual U.S. Monitoring the Future study (Johnston et al., 2009) were used to identify and explore combinations of discretionary activities. Data were obtained near the midpoints of 4 historical decades from the 1970s to 2000s, specifically 1976-1978, 1986-1988, 1996-1998, and 2006-2008. First, adolescent combinations of civic engagement, free time, and alcohol use discretionary activities were described using latent class analysis, a person-centered approach that identifies differences in subgroups of people within a population based on individual characteristics. Second, variations in combinations of discretionary activities across the 4 decades were tested. After establishing the optimal solution within each decade, the 4 decades were combined and a measurement invariance test was conducted to determine if the optimal solution across decades reflected the same number and characteristics of classes. Among girls, 4 latent classes were found in each decade and across decades: low-involved, noncivic drinkers, civic abstainers, and civic drinkers.\nv\nAmong boys, there were differences across decades. The 1970s decade reflected 3 combinations of activities: noncivic drinkers, civic abstainers, and civic drinkers. The later 3 decades showed these 3 classes plus a 4th, low-involved.\nTo address the third and fourth research aims, longitudinal data from an ongoing nationally representative sample of British individuals (British Cohort Study) who have been followed from birth in 1970 through age 38 was utilized. For the third aim, latent class analysis was used to identify British adolescents\u2019 combinations of discretionary activities and to examine whether these combinations replicated those established in the U.S. adolescent samples. For the fourth aim, logistic regression was utilized to predict civic engagement in adulthood at ages 26, 30, and 34 from the British adolescents\u2019 latent classes. Results identified in the Britain sample did not replicate those established in the U.S. samples; there were fewer latent classes found for both girls and boys in Britain and some of the characteristics of the classes differed, although the overall impression was the same. Among British girls and boys, there were 3 classes; low-involved, noncivic drinkers, and civic drinkers. Logistic regression results indicated that compared to low-involved adolescents, girls and boys in the noncivic drinkers class were less likely to engage in high levels of civic activities as adults, including political interest, voting, and social trust. In contrast, girls and boys in the civic drinkers class were more likely to engage in high levels of civic activities \u2013 including political interest, voting, organizational and union membership, and civic action \u2013 compared to their low-involved counterparts.\nThe discussion for Study 1 considers the prevention implications of these results. Youth in the noncivic drinkers class may be at risk for alcohol-related problems because their time may be taken up with little else, whereas adolescents in the civic drinkers class may attenuate the health risks of heavy drinking through their participation in other activities. Volunteering is\nvi\ncommon across the samples, likely due to school requirements and normative pressures, but other civic activities are relatively rare among all youth suggesting that increasing the number of required civic activities may boost engagement in this area. The discussion for Study 2 considers alternative explanations for the observed differences in discretionary activity combinations between the U.S. and Britain, including differences in sampling, measurement, opportunities for activity participation, age differences, and cultural context. Longitudinal results are discussed in light of potential mechanisms that may explain adult differences between the groups. For both studies, future research examining differences among the classes on adult outcomes, such as health, work, and identity development, are needed.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [185], "author_name_tesi": "Finlay, Andrea Kate", "last_name_ssi": "Finlay", "middle_name_ssi": "Kate", "first_name_ssi": "Andrea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Lianne Maggs", "Jennifer Lianne Maggs", "Constance A Flanagan", "Edward A Smith", "Nilam Ram", "Linda L Caldwell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Lianne Maggs, Dissertation Advisor", "Jennifer Lianne Maggs, Committee Chair", "Constance A Flanagan, Committee Chair", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member", "Nilam Ram, Committee Member", "Linda L Caldwell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["civic engagement", "free time activities", "alcohol use", "adolescence", "latent class analysis", "adult civic engagement"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "TN5 MUTAGENESIS REVEALS POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF METABOLIC PARASITISM OF APPLE FRUIT BY ERWINIA AMYLOVORA", "id": "13895mmf5477", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13895", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The gram-negative bacterium Erwinia amylovora is the causal agent of fire blight, a destructive disease of apples, pears, and other Rosaceae species. This study seeks to further elucidate the trophic aspects of the host-pathogen parasitic interaction and which metabolic pathways are required for pathogenicity. Auxotrophic mutants of E. amylovora were generated via Tn5 transposon mutagenesis followed by plating mutagenized bacterial cells on a selective minimal media on which auxotrophs could not grow.  Forty-seven confirmed auxotrophic mutants were then inoculated onto immature \u2018Gala\u2019 apple fruits in order to evaluate their pathogenicity. The mutated genes were identified by Sanger sequencing of E. amylovora DNA flanking the Tn5 insertion in each auxotrophic mutant. Characterization of transposon insertion sites showed that the following biosynthetic pathways or cellular functions were disrupted: amino acid biosynthesis (19), nucleotide biosynthesis (12), sulfur metabolism (5), nitrogen metabolism (2), survival protein biosynthesis (2), exopolysaccharide biosynthesis (3), and a selection of uncharacterized proteins (4) (the number of mutants of each type is listed in parentheses). We hypothesize that if an auxotrophic mutant is able to cause disease, the mutant must be able to derive the missing metabolites from host tissues. If an auxotrophic mutant is not able to cause disease, this suggests that it cannot derive the missing metabolites from their host. It was determined that the disruption of amino acid biosynthesis, such as for the production of arginine, leucine, and methionine, and nucleotide biosynthesis, such as for the production of purines and pyrimidines, resulted in reduction or elimination of pathogenicity. These two groups of mutants are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the missing metabolic products from the host tissue in order to complement their metabolism and grow normally. Conversely, mutants with disrupted sulfur metabolism remained pathogenic, indicating that these mutants were able to obtain sufficient amounts of sulfur and sulfur metabolites from the host tissue. In addition, mutants defective in several survival proteins and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis were identified during screening as possible auxotrophs, and they displayed reduced or absent disease expression.  The question of why these mutants are auxotrophs is still being investigated. In summary, this genetic study revealed new details of the profile of pathogen-accessible metabolites in colonizing the host tissues and furthered understanding of which metabolic pathways are needed for disease development.\u2003", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14565], "author_name_tesi": "Finley, Melissa Lauren", "last_name_ssi": "Finley", "middle_name_ssi": "Lauren", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tim McNellis", "Cristina Rosa", "Seogchan Kang", "Edward Dudley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tim McNellis, Thesis Advisor", "Cristina Rosa, Committee Member", "Seogchan Kang, Committee Member", "Edward Dudley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plant pathology", "phytopathology", "phytobacteriology", "bacterial metabolism", "erwinia", "erwinia amylovora", "pathogenicity", "parasitism", "tn5 mutagenesis", "auxotroph", "auxotrophy", "amino acids", "amino acid auxotrophy", "bacterial parasitism", "nutrient acquisition"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Diversity, disturbance, and nitrogen: \nusing ecologically-based nutrient management to design multifunctional agroecosystems", "id": "24875", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10997", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Designing multifunctional agroecosystems that provide a diverse suite of ecosystem services is essential to human well-being. Among the most indispensable agroecosystem services are those related to nitrogen (N), an essential nutrient for crop growth that has become one of the most pervasive pollutants of our time. Applying ecological principles to manage N is a viable strategy to optimize agricultural N cycling. The goals of this dissertation research were to: (1) identify key drivers of N dynamics in systems using ecologically-based nutrient management (ENM) and (2) determine if and how aboveground diversity in ENM supports N-related and other ecosystem services. Using data from a five year study of four organic cropping systems, I employed recursive partitioning models to pinpoint management and environment factors that drive soil inorganic N (SIN) dynamics in ENM and identify conditions under which elevated SIN leads to N leaching loss. I found that social factors from farmer decisions to national policies shape the extent to which ENM can effectively promote multiple N-related services and identified tillage as a key leverage point that shapes N cycling in ENM. In a two year field study of cover crop systems ranging in diversity from one to eight species, I focused my investigation of ENM on the impacts of aboveground diversity (an ecological principle frequently applied in ENM) on five ecosystem services. This research showed that just as aboveground diversity enhances ecosystem function in natural systems, cover crop diversity enhances ecosystem services in agroecosystems. This experiment also tested several paths by which cover crop diversity impacts N retention, N provision, N supply, weed suppression, subsequent crop yield, and multifunctionality. Aboveground, individual ecosystem services were correlated with cover crop productivity and the carbon:nitrogen ratio of cover crop biomass. Belowground, cover crops exerted species-specific influences on microbial community structure and increasing cover crop diversity was positively correlated with microbial functional diversity, two linkages that may impact ecosystem services from diverse mixtures. Using an array of diversity indices, I also found direct effects of cover crop diversity on ecosystem services, and concluded that achieving multifunctionality with cover crops requires not only increased species richness, but also functional diversity.

Although numerous chemotherapeutic drugs have been tested in this malignancy, survival of advanced pancreatic cancer has not improved over the past several decades.  Unlike other cancers, which have markers for early detection, current pancreatic cancer predictive indicators lack sensitivity and specificity.  Due to the lack of effective treatment and early screening options available for this disease, identification of novel targets and approaches are desperately needed.  \n\tThe human cholecystokinin-B receptor (CCK-BR) and its ligand, gastrin, are up-regulated in pancreatic cancer compared to normal tissues.  Growth of pancreatic cancer is controlled by the interaction of gastrin with the CCK-BR through an autocrine and exocrine mechanism.  The CCK-BR may be a promising therapeutic target.  One of the goals of this study was to characterize the role of the CCK-BR in human pancreatic cancer proliferation, apoptosis, and migration.  Down-regulation of the CCK-BR by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in reduced cancer cell proliferation and an increase in apoptotic activity evidenced by increased caspase-3 activity, TUNEL positive cells, and decreased XIAP expression.  In addition, cancer cell mobility was also decreased upon CCK-BR down-regulation. \n\tAn alternatively spliced isoform of the CCK-BR, the CCK-CR, retains intron 4 which is expressed as an extra 69 amino acids in the 3rd intracellular loop.  Unlike the CCK-BR, this splice variant is expressed only in malignant tissues.  The second goal of this study was to evaluate the CCK-CR as a diagnostic tool for detection of pancreatic cancer.  Detection of CCK-CR mRNA was problematic due to low transcript abundance and the sequence similarity to the CCK-BR.  CCK-CR detection proved more reliable and consistent at the protein level.  The CCK-BR holds promise as a potential therapeutic target, as strategies to decrease the CCK-BR expression and activity may be beneficial for development of new treatments.   Also detection of the CCK-CR could aid in development of screening options for pancreatic cancer.

This result suggests that the crust along the TAM front has not been magmatically altered by the mafic volcanism associated with Ross Island, and that the mantle thermal anomaly is not likely associated with partial melting of the crust away from Ross Island.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4456], "author_name_tesi": "Finotello, Marco ", "last_name_ssi": "Finotello", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Marco", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Jordi Julia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Thesis Advisor", "Jordi Julia, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["TAMSEIS", "Receiver Functions", "Crustal Structure", "Transantarctic Mountains"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "The Development of Grammatical Competence through Synchronous Computer Mediated Communication\n", "id": "6328", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4255", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nThis study examined whether consciousness-raising (C-R) in synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) fosters grammatical development; specifically, development of por/para and ser/estar.  In order to determine the efficacy of C-R in SCMC, two groups were analyzed; one group was designated as form-and-meaning focused while the other was meaning-focused.  Each group engaged in weekly chats and addressed the same discussion topics.  Three pre- and post-tests (Elicited Imitation/Sentence Repetition Testing, Grammaticality Preferences Component, and oral examinations) were administered.    \n\nIt was determined that: 1) there were statistically significant differences on the outcomes of the EI/SRT and GPC post-tests in favor of the FFMF group, 2) the FFMF group produced greater quantities and more accurate quantities of language, 3) the FFMF group demonstrated higher levels of syntactic maturity with statistically significant results, did not employ a default form of the copular verb, and actively engaged in corrective feedback strategies, 4) the FFMF and MF groups performed equally well, statistically, on both the post-test orals and in terms of semantic range but the social dynamic that surfaced in each group were distinct, 5) the MF group did not ignore form but employed ser as a default, 6) the instructor exercised the same feedback practices for both groups.   \n\nIt was concluded that C-R on por/para, ser/estar in SCMC most likely fostered the development of those grammatical features to a greater degree than in chat without specific instructions to focus on form. When held responsible for its own C-R in SCMC, consciousness was raised for the FFMF group but students were unable to limit the scope of their focus to por/para, ser/estar alone.   Overt evidence reveals that they did focus on ser/estar but there is no such evidence for por/para.  However, the global approach to C-R assumed by the FFMF positively impacted development, por/para included.  In terms of the MF group, it is concluded that the lack of focusing on por/para, ser/estar did not impede upon development, and that unintentional focus on form was insufficient to facilitate growth to the same degree as deliberate focus, although the MF participants demonstrated awareness to form in SCMC.    \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4227], "author_name_tesi": "Fiori-Agoren, Melissa Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Fiori-Agoren", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Lantolf", "Steve L Thorne", "Celeste S Kinginger", "Nuria Sagarra", "John Lipski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Lantolf, Committee Chair", "Steve L Thorne, Committee Member", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member", "Nuria Sagarra, Committee Member", "John Lipski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["form-focused", "consciousness-raising", "estar", "ser", "para", "por", "computer assisted learning", "synchrounous computer mediated communication"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "GIRLS\u2019 EARLY BEVERAGE PATTERNS: LONG-TERM IMPACT \nON DIETARY INTAKE AND ADIPOSITY", "id": "9023", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3811", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Data on the persistence of early beverage patterns throughout childhood and adolescence are limited.

The purpose of the present research is to describe changes in girls\u2019 beverage intake and to assess whether early beverage intake patterns persisted and predicted dietary intake and measures of adiposity from 5 to 15 years. Participants were part of a longitudinal study of non-Hispanic white girls, predominantly middle class, (n=170) living in central Pennsylvania, assessed biennially from 5 to 15 y. At each assessment, intake of beverage (milk, 100% fruit juice, and sweetened beverages: fruit drinks, sodas, and tea/coffee), and dietary intake were assessed using three, 24-hour recalls. Percent body fat and waist circumference were measured. Height and weight were measured and used to calculate body mass index. A series of mixed modeling analyses were used to describe changes in beverage intake and the impact of early beverage intake on girls\u2019 dietary intake and measures of adiposity over time. Results revealed that although total beverage intake servings did not change from 5 to 15 y, major shifts occurred in the contribution of servings of various types of beverages. Milk and fruit juice declined, while soda and tea/coffee increased and fruit drinks remained unchanged. Early difference in soda intake predicted later soda intake and differences in beverage related food groups and nutrients. In addition, higher intake of sweetened beverage at 5 y, but not milk or fruit juice, was associated with greater adiposity and weight status in childhood and adolescence. This association was independent of energy intake at study entry and concurrent age sweetened beverage intake. In sum, these results suggest that prevention efforts should include a focus on promoting healthy beverage patterns to reduce children\u2019s risk of lower diet quality and higher adiposity. Such prevention efforts need to begin during early childhood, and should focus on reducing availability of sweetened beverages, and substituting healthy alternatives, such as milk, water, and limit fruit juice, within recommended levels by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

The study made use of a mixed methods methodology and was theoretically framed using a critical feminist adult education lens and organizational diversity theory.  As such particular attention was paid to gender, race and age in the data collection and findings.  A culture climate instrument was developed, seven factors that relate to diversity climate were identified and the questions for each theoretical dimension were tested for scale reliability.  The culture climate survey collected data from a random sample of engineers designated as professional engineers (PEs) in Pennsylvania.  Findings confirm the extreme underrepresentation of engineers of color; 94 % of the random sample consisted of White engineers.  Although women were also underrepresented, a stratified sampling technique resulted in women representing 45% of the sample.  Findings indicate that overall these engineers have favorable perceptions of the engineering culture climate.  Female engineers\u2019 perceptions, while still favorable, are less favorable than their male counterparts.  Gender is a significant predictor of perceptions for the culture climate indices while age is a predictor for some of the indices.  Qualitative data were collected by semi-structured interviews from a purposefully selected sample of eight female engineers that included two women of color.  While confirming some of the traditional barriers for women in engineering such as the need to prove themselves as competent engineers, they indicate that there are engineering worksites that are flexible and meet their family needs, but they did perceive differential treatment based on gender, race and age.  Other qualitative findings include an unsubstantiated and for the most part disputed by female engineers, meta narrative that engineering is an occupation that is not subject to racial or gender prejudice.

The results from this experiment suggest that providing instructions alone is not sufficient to impact participants\u2019 integration. In Experiment 2, participants were delivered the same instructions as Experiment 1, with an added condition that provided students with additional support encouraging a deeper understanding of the integration task. The results from Experiment 2 also offer no evidence that providing students with instructions to integrate between two systems is sufficient, even if participants understood the integration task. \n\nExperiment 3 tests the effects of providing additional support to participants for how to integrate. Three conditions compared the effects of an integration intervention (II) and a comprehension intervention (CC) to a note-taking control task (CT). Participants in the CT condition spent the greatest amount of time reading the text(s) and scored the highest on a measure of small-grain comprehension. Despite lower comprehension scores and less time-on-task, participants in the II intervention scored significantly highest on the vFRI measure of large-grain integration.

I study the rhetoric of three advocates who played key roles in aviation\u2019s history: the Wright brothers, whose first flight in 1903 began national conversations about human flight\u2019s meaning and purpose; William \u201cBilly\u201d Mitchell, whose bombastic advocacy for an independent air force in the 1920s began an ongoing debate about whether and how America should use airplanes for war; and Charles Lindbergh, who leveraged his fame to become a key voice in the effort to convince Americans that commercial flight had become safe and routine by the late 1920s. Each chapter combines close textual analysis of these advocates\u2019 rhetoric with an intertextual survey of what their contemporaries had to say for and against aviation. \n\nI begin with an introduction outlining the purposes, methods, and contributions of the thesis. Chapter two shows how the Wright brothers, while describing flight as a serious scientific endeavor that promised a better future, took part in a wider trend: labeling human flight with a vocabulary that combined America\u2019s frontier mythology with words and images commonly associated with birds. Chapter three then analyzes how Billy Mitchell leveraged the hopes and fears of aviation\u2019s technological \u201cprogress\u201d to make the case for airplanes as weapons of war.  He fatefully focused Americans on warplane technology and not on the human costs of bombing. Chapter four studies how Charles Lindbergh and the earliest American airlines re-branded flight as a routine and safe experience. Ironically, Lindbergh used his public reputation as an adventurer to help undo flight\u2019s association with adventure and risk-taking, making arguments about how safe, routine, and professional flight had become. Airline advertisements echoed and refined his message, emphasizing the professionalism of pilots and the comfort and convenience of commercial air travel.   \n\nOverall, my thesis maps dramatic changes in how aviation advocates defined, interpreted, and imagined the possibilities of human flight over the first half of the twentieth century. It charts the evolution of that rhetoric from depictions of flight as a romantic expression of humankind\u2019s ingenuity and creativity, to warnings and demonstrations of its power to bring about either salvation or ruination, and finally to characterizations of flight as a routine feature of everyday life.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12059], "author_name_tesi": "Firgens, Benjamin Aaron", "last_name_ssi": "Firgens", "middle_name_ssi": "Aaron", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr J Michael Hogan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr J Michael Hogan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rhetorical History", "Aviation History", "The Wright Brothers", "William \"Billy\" Mitchell", "Charles Lindbergh"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Energy and Economic Impacts of Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation of Cooling Coils", "id": "6t053f96k", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12920", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cooling coils are heat exchangers that cool and dehumidify the air used to condition buildings. They tend to be wet by design (due to dehumidification) and can trap particles from the air. Some of the particles are living: biological and viable. These microbes can reproduce and cause biological fouling of the cooling coil, commonly referred to as biofouling. Biofouling is known to increase airside pressure drop and decrease heat transfer ability. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is one way to mitigate biofouling, though there is little third-party literature documenting its effectiveness. This study examines three things: field measurements of change in coil performance after treatment with UVGI, modeled energy use impact of coil irradiation, and monetization of UVGI benefits including first cost, energy cost, maintenance cost, and collateral health benefits.\nAir handling units with visibly fouled cooling coils at two field sites were chosen to evaluate the effect of UVGI on biofouling: one in Tampa, FL and one in State College, PA (referred to as the PSU site). Coil operation was monitored pre-UV and post-UV. Data collected at the Tampa site showed a 21.65% to 21.7% decrease (95% confidence) in mean coil airside pressure drop and a 14.5% to 14.8% (95% confidence) increase in mean overall heat transfer coefficient (UA). Pressure drop data were controlled for airflow and latent load, while UA data were controlled for heat exchanger entering conditions. The PSU site, which was unexpectedly cleaned before data collection could begin, showed a 1.3% to 1.4% decrease (95% confidence) in pressure drop, and a 45% to 50% increase (95% confidence) in heat transfer coefficient. This counter-intuitive result is believed to be due to an increase in non-biological fouling at the coil face with a concurrent decrease in biological fouling between the coil fins due to UVGI, but the results were thought to be unrealistic by industry professionals. Going forward, the results from the Tampa site are used for modeling work, while the results from the PSU site are not.\nThe Tampa site reduction in airside pressure drop and increase in overall heat transfer coefficient were then applied to a subset of the DOE (Department of Energy) Commercial Reference Buildings in order to model the benefit of UVGI on fouled coils across seven buildings and sixteen climate zones. It must be emphasized that this is the application of the results of a single case study to a variety of situations, as there are currently no data available on differences in fouling for climates and other influencing factors. The majority of energy savings (80%) occurred in fan energy, followed by cooling (17%) and pump energy (3%). The overall savings tended to be a fraction of a percent of total HVAC energy use, or around 0.3 kBTU/sf-yr. This is due to the relatively low amount of fouling used in the models (20% of a 0.75 in wg coil is only 0.15 in wg). An attempt was made to bound the energy savings potential by using other sources in the literature for the amount of pressure drop reduction. For example, one of the studies showed an increase of 156% in coil pressure drop due to fouling, or an increase of 1.17 in wg in the case of a nominal 0.75 in wg coil. Assuming this level of fouling increased the predicted energy savings by an order of magnitude, closer to 2 kBTU/sf-yr. It is important to consider the magnitude of potential airside pressure drop change, as it heavily influences the energy savings due to the dominance of fan power.\nMonetization of the IAQ benefit of UVGI (one of the components of the overall cost analysis) is modeled using a stochastic implementation of the Wells-Riley equation. While the UVGI wattage used for coil cleaning is lower than that of air cleaning, there is still a collateral air disinfection benefit. Work loss days (WLDs) were the evaluation metric for office buildings, hospital acquired infections (HAIs) for hospitals, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for schools. Based on these metrics, on average, office buildings saved $0.01/ft2 to $0.14/ft2 ($0.14/m2 to $1.51/m2) per year, hospitals saved $0.02/ft2 ($0.23/m2), and schools saved between $0.00/ft2 and $0.01/ft2 ($0.06/m2 to $0.11/m2)\nEnergy use calculated from the Tampa site results, IAQ benefits, first cost, and maintenance costs are combined in a 20 year life cycle cost analysis (LCCA). When IAQ benefits are considered, UVGI provides the greatest value to the owner, followed by UVGI without IAQ benefits considered, and lastly mechanical cleaning. The median net present value of cost of each to the owner is, respectively, -$0.13/ft2, $0.12/ft2, and $0.56/ft2 (-$1.37/m2, $1.26/m2, and $6.05/m2).\nUsing a literature data source to, again, bound the possible benefit changes the magnitude of and order of results. The median net present value of cost of UVGI including the IAQ benefit is -$0.77/ft2 (-$8.32/m2), of UVGI not including IAQ benefit is -$0.21/ft2 \n(-$2.30/m2), of mechanical cleaning is $0.25/ft2 ($2.66/m2). Reviewing the differences between these two sets of economic benefits again makes it clear that knowing potential for fouling is important for economic evaluation, and that the literature on this is lacking.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12679], "author_name_tesi": "Firrantello, Joseph Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Firrantello", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William P Bahnfleth", "William P Bahnfleth", "Stephen James Treado", "John Michael Cimbala", "James Landis Rosenberger", "Catherine J Noakes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William P Bahnfleth, Dissertation Advisor", "William P Bahnfleth, Committee Chair", "Stephen James Treado, Committee Member", "John Michael Cimbala, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Outside Member", "Catherine J Noakes, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cooling coils", "UVGI", "ultraviolet germicidal irradiation", "biofouling", "fouling"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "An Evolutionary Perspective on the Origin and Spread of Emerging Infectious Diseases\n", "id": "10475", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "946", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The social and economic burden of emerging infectious diseases is both substantial and increasing. However, relatively little is known of the biological factors that increase the probability of pathogen emergence. A major goal of emerging infectious disease research is to create a framework for predictability that will enable the use of cost effective measures to prevent the future emergence of potentially devastating pathogens, instead of relying on intervention and control. Although the largest class of emerging pathogens is composed of rapidly evolving RNA viruses that infect multiple hosts, we remain a long way from a thorough understanding of the key determinants of disease emergence. The aim of this thesis was to explore the evolutionary dynamics of a broad range of emerging viruses (human and animal, RNA and DNA) in the hope of further revealing the generalities of disease emergence.\n\nThis thesis tested the validity of the general characterization of RNA viruses as emergent and DNA viruses as existing in codivergent relationships with their hosts. Through rigorous analysis of both the temporal dynamics and phylogenetic structure of hantaviruses (RNA viruses), circoviruses (single stranded DNA viruses) and a variety of double stranded DNA viruses, the studies presented here reveal that viruses with many different genomic structures may be capable of jumping species barriers. Contrary to prior expectation, the rates of evolution in some DNA viruses approached those typically assigned solely to RNA viruses, indicating a similar propensity for genetic variability and adaptability, both key characteristics of emergent pathogens. Further, although many DNA viruses and a few RNA viruses (e.g. hantaviruses) are thought to have codiverged with their hosts, this assumption is usually untested. The rigorous statistical assessment of codivergent evolution applied here to hantaviruses and circoviruses found no evidence for codivergence in either case, indicating that evolution by cross-species transmission may be a general trend of many virus systems, including those with DNA genomes. Finally, this thesis demonstrated the utility of using phylogeographic methods to infer the origins and transmission patterns for viruses spreading rapidly on a global scale, furthering our ability to identify the key determinants of viral emergence.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [938], "author_name_tesi": "Firth, Cadhla Brooke", "last_name_ssi": "Firth", "middle_name_ssi": "Brooke", "first_name_ssi": "Cadhla", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Edward Holmes", "Andrew Fraser Read", "Bryan T Grenfell", "Anton Nekrutenko", "Edward C Holmes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin Edward Holmes, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Fraser Read, Committee Chair", "Bryan T Grenfell, Committee Member", "Anton Nekrutenko, Committee Member", "Edward C Holmes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nucleotide substitution rates", "codivergence", "phylogeography", "DNA viruses", "RNA viruses", "emerging infectious diseases"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Reasoning About Higher-Order Functions and Parameters", "id": "6758", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2505", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The compilation of functional programming languages such as Standard ML and Haskell rely on a number of program transformations/optimizations in order to generate efficient code.

These three transformations have in common the fact that they all involve the analysis and manipulation of function parameters.

Lambda-lifting introduces additional parameters to functions in order to eliminate occurrences of non-local, non-global variables.

The first is that John Dewey\u2019s philosophy of education can best be understood as a response to the diremption instantiated in Modernity\u2019s image of the self. Secondly, the practical implications of Donald Davidson\u2019s work in the philosophy of mind and philosophy of language deepen\nand extend in important ways John Dewey\u2019s philosophy of education; and to this extent,\nhelp, by developing certain analytical tools, advance Dewey\u2019s attempt to overcome the\ndiremption of Modern life through his vision of educational practice. As such, Dewey\nand Davidson conceive education to be a form of cultural criticism that is normative at its\nroot. Hence, any worthwhile and edifying educational practice will have cultural criticism\nat its center. Thirdly, despite Dewey\u2019s valiant and formidable attempt to overcome\ndiremption through a conception of education as cultural criticism, it is, at the end of the\nday, insufficient. It\u2019s insufficient because Dewey is still wedded to the notion that in\ncomplex society, education means formal education.

Because of the known distribution in New York, putative populations may exist in the Genesee and Susquehanna rivers in Pennsylvania.  The limited distribution and cryptic ecological requirements of the inland burbot have led to a state classification of endangered (as of 2002 \u00a1V 2003).  The goal of this study was to determine the life history aspects of Pennsylvania\u00a1\u00a6s inland burbot population via five research objectives: 1) determine the historic and current distribution and status; 2) analyze age and size structure; 3) identify important food sources; 4) determine habitat usage; and 5) estimate population densities. \nDuring 2002 and 2003, 109 localities were electrofished to determine the current distribution of burbot in the Allegheny, Genesee, and Susquehanna rivers within Pennsylvania and the upper Susquehanna and Allegheny rivers in New York.  No burbot were captured from the Susquehanna or Genesee rivers in Pennsylvania nor the Allegheny River in New York.  Burbot were captured in the upper Allegheny River in Pennsylvania at 22 localities and the upper Susquehanna River in New York at five localities.  Population abundance was estimated using depletion sampling at three sites on Cole Creek, McKean County, Pennsylvania.  Burbot density estimates increased from 255 burbot / hectare (95% CI: 162, 485) at the upstream site to 266 burbot / hectare (95% CI: 238, 313) at the middle site to 318 burbot / hectare (95% CI: 257, 405) at the lower site.  Inland burbot distribution in Pennsylvania appears to be dictated first by zoogeographical events (e.g., stream capture, glaciation), followed by water quality factors and the presence of sheltering habitat.  Burbot were typically captured near boulders, concrete slabs, bridge abutments, and undercut banks.  Mean water depths 65 - 80 cm and mean velocities 0.0 - 0.1 m/s were most frequent at capture points.  In the upper Allegheny River (summer 2002), mean water temperature and pH were both significantly (\u0192\u00d1 = 0.05) lower at burbot capture sites (n = 23; 17.8oC, pH = 7.29) than at sites where they were absent (n = 48; 20.1 o C, pH = 7.69).  Aquatic insects and crayfish were identified as diet staples of burbot less than approximately 200 mm total length (TL).  The diet of burbot longer than 200 mm TL was a mixture of aquatic insects, crayfish, and vertebrates; thus, a shift from aquatic insects to vertebrates and crayfish was observed as burbot length increased.  Inland burbot from the upper Allegheny River attained a maximum standard length of 370 mm.  Mean relative weight (Wr) of the population (Wr = 74) was slightly lower than the proposed target range for North American riverine burbot (Wr = 80 + 5).  \nIn conclusion, the inland burbot is a zoogeographic relic of the Pleistocene ice age.  Glaciation, a vicariance event, was responsible for their dispersal into the Allegheny and Susquehanna rivers.  The resultant isolation of this founder population may have created an avenue for speciation.  Conservation of these rare and ecologically unique populations should continue as a management priority within Pennsylvania. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1509], "author_name_tesi": "Fischer, Douglas Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Fischer", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["zoogeography", "burbot", "endangered fish", "Pennsylvania"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Immune Response to Vaccinia Virus Infection: Inflammatory Monocytes, Leukotrienes, and CD8+ T Cell Immunodominance", "id": "10147", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3959", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used extensively as a vaccine to convey protection against other poxviruses and, through the expression of recombinant antigens, other pathogens and tumors, several problems exist that limit its potential use within the human population. Two such problems are the dangerous complications of uncontrolled viral replication and the immunodominance of VACV-specific CD8+ T cells. \n\nThe immune mechanisms responsible for controlling VACV replication at the site of infection were previously unclear. Although adaptive immunity is often given credit for this function, viral titers begin to lower during the innate immune response. Through in vivo cellular depletions, we demonstrated that inflammatory monocytes, including a Ly6C+Ly6G+ subpopulation, are critical factors for controlling VACV replication at the site of infection, preventing spread of the virus to other sites, and limiting immune-mediated tissue damage. \n\nLeukotrienes are potent mediators of the innate immune response capable of affecting the monocytic response, although their precise functions in the skin and in viral infections are poorly understood. In MRP1 knockout mice, we observed exacerbated inflammation and tissue damage during an intradermal VACV infection. These effects were not due to a lack of cysteinyl leukotrienes as the use of a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist alleviated tissue damage. Rather, increased leukotriene B4 levels in MRP1 knockout mice were responsible. \n\nWhen recombinant VACV constructs are utilized to induce CD8+ T cells specific for a recombinantly encoded foreign antigen, the majority of the CD8+ T cell response is directed against VACV. We utilized UV and psoralen treatment to globally reduce the expression of native VACV genes while relatively maintaining the expression of a recombinant antigenic peptide. This increased the primary CD8+ T cell response specific for the recombinant antigen, while decreasing VACV-specific CD8+ T cells. \n\nOur findings have implications for the safe and effective use of VACV as a human vaccine. By therapeutically targeting monocytes and/or leukotrienes, the innate immune response can be manipulated to improve the safety of VACV immunization. Further, UV/psoralen treated recombinant VACV constructs represent more effective vaccine vectors for inducing antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3931], "author_name_tesi": "Fischer, Matthew Anthony", "last_name_ssi": "Fischer", "middle_name_ssi": "Anthony", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Charles Norbury", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "David A Antonetti", "Neil David Christensen", "Todd Schell", "David Joseph Spector", "John Warren Wills"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Charles Norbury, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Chair", "David A Antonetti, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["immunodominance", "leukotrienes", "inflammatory monocytes", "Vaccinia virus", "dendritic cell migration"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Experience of Place in Child Literacy Life-worlds: A Phenomenological Study of Readers as Place-makers\n", "id": "27112", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11817", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Current educational policy in the United States supports the standardization of school curricula and promotes a high-stakes testing culture that reinforces the ideologies of market fundamentalism.

In elementary schools in particular, these policies have also led to the decrease of aesthetic activities that nurture children\u2019s social, emotional, spiritual and physical wellbeing, such as music education, art education, physical education, the social studies, unstructured playtime and pleasure reading. \nPlace-based educators have pushed back against these trends by advocating for curricula that promotes permeability between the physical and conceptual boundaries of children\u2019s school, home and community contexts and emphasizes project-based instructional design that meaningfully connects to children\u2019s everyday lived experiences.

The first-ever real-time X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of a biological-mineral reaction demonstrated that the reductive dissolution of birnessite during direct electron transfer by total-membrane fractions of the facultative anaerobe Shewanella oneidensis was characterized by a collapse of the birnessite structure due to a decrease in the c unit-cell parameter. The observed structural collapse was verified by analysis of the reaction products of batch reactions between whole-cell cultures of S. oneidensis and birnessite. A combined XRD and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) examination indicated that the unit-cell collapse was caused by reduction of structural Mn4+ to Mn3+, which increased the net negative charge on birnessite\u2019s octahedral sheets, followed by an inferred increase in the interlayer Na:H2O ratio. The reduced Mn2+ precipitated as rhodochrosite (MnCO3). \n\nThe reduction, chelation, and removal of Mn from the birnessite crystal structure by bacterial siderophores did not result in a structural collapse of the mineral, despite the large amount of Mn removed from the MnO6 octahedral sheets (up to 20 mol%). Rather, the unit-cell parameters remained constant throughout the complete dissolution of birnessite. \n\nA third structural pathway was revealed during the reduction of birnessite in the presence of dissolved transition metals. When aqueous Cr3+ was oxidized to Cr6+ by reduction of octahedral Mn, the birnessite crystal structure experienced a phase transformation from triclinic to hexagonal. During this abiological reduction, the reduced Mn remained part of the hexagonal crystal structure, occupying positions above or below octahedral vacancies. The specialized nature of birnessite\u2019s transformations in response to alternative reduction/dissolution mechanisms presents the possibility that crystallographic analysis of birnessite may serve as a useful biomarker in studies of environments where it is desirable to know whether life forms participated in mineral redox processes.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6124], "author_name_tesi": "Fischer, Timothy B", "last_name_ssi": "Fischer", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney", "Peter J Heaney", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "James David Kubicki", "Christopher Howard House", "William D Burgos"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter J Heaney, Committee Chair", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Chair", "James David Kubicki, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member", "William D Burgos, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["birnessite", "bioreduction", "manganese oxides", "chromium", "shewanella", "time-resolved XRD", "siderophores"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Proposed Specific Factors for Generalized Anxiety Disorder Within the Integrative Hierarchical Model of Anxiety and Depression\n", "id": "8595", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "159", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since its first appearance in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III, 1980), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has provided challenges to the discriminative validity of the mood and anxiety disorders.  Although the removal of autonomic symptoms from the diagnostic criteria for GAD in DSM-IV helped to increase the diagnostic reliability from a range of .27 (Mannuzza et al., 1989) to .56 (Williams et al., 1992) based on DSM-III-R criteria and .67 based on DSM-IV criteria (Brown, Di Nardo, Lehman, & Campbell, 2001), some researchers have expressed concern that this distinction further confuses the boundary between GAD and mood disorders (Clark & Watson, 1991; Brown et al., 1995).  It has been argued that though the removal of these symptoms from the diagnostic criteria improved the overall reliability of GAD, as well as the discriminative validity of GAD in relation to the other anxiety disorders, the overlap with depressive disorders and the discriminative difficulties therein still remain.  Research based on DSM-IV criteria has shown that GAD shares a closer relationship to the mood disorders than it does to other anxiety disorders (Mineka, Watson, & Clark, 1998; Brown, Chorpita, & Barlow, 1998; Watson, 2005).  Clark and Watson (1991) developed the tripartite model, in which depression and anxiety share a common factor of negative affectivity, depression is indicated by low positive affectivity (PA) and anxiety by high autonomic arousal (AA).  Mineka, Watson, and Clark expanded on this model with the integrative hierarchical model, within which each anxiety disorder is indicated by an idiosyncratic predictor.  Watson (2005) has made the argument that this model can and should be extended to new taxonomic systems, including the approaching DSM-V.  However, a specific factor remains to be determined for GAD within this model.\nThe present study sought to determine possible specific factors for GAD within the integrative hierarchical model.  Research participants (n = 423) completed a packet of questionnaires related to the constructs of interest.  Participants were mostly female (69%) and Caucasian (85%), with an average age of 20 years.  Latent path relationships were examined using structural equation modeling (SEM) in LISREL (Joreskog & Sorbom, 2006).  The initial model replicating the tripartite structure of NA, GAD, and depression fit the data extremely well.  Three competing models with possible specific latent factors for GAD were then examined: worry, perfectionism, as represented by a dimensional measurement of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), and positive beliefs about worry.  The latter latent factor consisted of scales related to perceptions of worry as preparatory and motivating.  All models fit the data exceptionally well.  Both perfectionism and positive beliefs about worry strongly related to GAD and failed to demonstrate a statistically significant relationship with depression.  Worry, despite demonstrating a large and significant relationship with GAD (&#946; = .88), also significantly, albeit negatively, related to depression as well (&#946; = -.09).  Due to concerns regarding the instrumental relationship of worry to current GAD diagnostic criteria and possible resultant tautological statistical findings, models were tested to determine if positive beliefs about worry and perfectionism remained significant predictors of GAD while controlling for the latent factor for worry.  These models fit the data exceptionally well.  Perfectionism and positive beliefs about worry were retained as specific factors for GAD.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [158], "author_name_tesi": "Fisher, Aaron Jason", "last_name_ssi": "Fisher", "middle_name_ssi": "Jason", "first_name_ssi": "Aaron", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle Gayle Newman", "Michelle Gayle Newman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle Gayle Newman, Thesis Advisor", "Michelle Gayle Newman, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Comorbidity", "Depression", "Anxiety", "Tripartite", "Integrative", "SEM"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Necessary versus sufficient causes of impaired physiological functioning in generalized anxiety disorder.", "id": "15003", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7818", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An extensive body of literature has established the role of impaired autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning in individuals with clinically-diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; c.f. Hoehn-Saric, McLeod, Funderburk, & Kowalski, 2004). Worry is the cardinal feature and central facet of GAD specifically, as well as a major component of anxiety and mood disorders more broadly (Barlow, 2004). Worry has been shown to disrupt the adaptive responsiveness of physiological systems in anxious individuals as well as controls.  Worrisome thinking prior to exposure to a phobic image has been shown to preclude cardiovascular response to the image in anxious individuals (Borkovec & Hu, 1990; Borkovec, Lyonfields, Wiser, & Deihl, 1993) and the induction of worry in non-anxious controls has been shown to cause significant reductions in heart rate variability (HRV) \u2013 a proxy for parasympathetic control of heart rate (HR; Hofmann, et al., 2005; Lyonfields, Borkovec, & Thayer, 1995; Thayer, Friedman, & Borkovec, 1996).\n\nIf worry is both necessary and sufficient for physiological impairment, it would be expected that a non-clinical, high-worry control group would exhibit impairments in physiological functioning equivalent to clinically-diagnosed GAD participants at resting baseline, and that phasic increases in state worry would impair physiological reactivity across healthy controls, high-worry controls, and GAD participants in response to a stressful task.  However, although prior research seems to indicate that worry is necessary, it may be that clinical distress, significant impairment, or other aspects of the clinically-diagnosed GAD syndrome \u2013 such as the inability to control worry \u2013 are required for the development of significant physiological dysfunction.  It is precisely this question that the present study aimed to address.\n\nThe present study compared clinically-diagnosed GAD patients to both healthy controls, and high-worry controls.  The lattermost group demonstrated significant elevations in worry that placed them within a clinical range, but did not meet clinical criteria for GAD or any other Axis I disorder as determined by structured interview.  Moreover, phasic variability in state worry was tracked across baseline, during the experimental induction of worry versus relaxation, during two laboratory stressors, and finally following a 20-minute recovery period.  Measures of HR, HRV, salivary alpha-amylase \u2013 an index of adrenergic sympathetic tone, and cortisol were taken across the study.  Thus, we examined the relatively effects of state, trait, and clinical worry (GAD) on sympathetic, parasympathetic, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis systems at resting baseline, in response to a laboratory stressor, and following recovery.\n\nResults indicated that clinically-diagnosed GAD accounted for impairments in parasympathetic, sympathetic, cardiovascular, and HPA systems above and beyond state and trait worry.  Individuals with GAD exhibited reduced vagal cardiac control at baseline and recovery, poor coordination of sympathoexcitatory-HPA axis stress reactivity, and rigidity in cardiovascular reactivity resulting from experimentally induced worry.  In addition, it was demonstrated that impairments in vagal cardiac control following recovery were a function of expressed anger and the degree to which individuals with GAD were able to expressed sadness and/or contentment counteracted the negative effect of anger.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7750], "author_name_tesi": "Fisher, Aaron Jason", "last_name_ssi": "Fisher", "middle_name_ssi": "Jason", "first_name_ssi": "Aaron", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle Gayle Newman", "Michelle Gayle Newman", "Kristin Buss", "William Ray", "Douglas Granger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle Gayle Newman, Dissertation Advisor", "Michelle Gayle Newman, Committee Chair", "Kristin Buss, Committee Member", "William Ray, Committee Member", "Douglas Granger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Generalized anxiety disorder", "autonomic nervous system", "cardiac", "health", "emotion"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "ADHD Rating Scales' Susceptibility to Faking in a College Student Sample\n", "id": "7298", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Longitudinal research has demonstrated that symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may continue to cause impairment into adulthood.

Diagnosed women do not cope with this transition alone. A patient\u2019s family interactions are critical to her well-being and adjustment. In particular, diagnosed women\u2019s mother-daughter bond is a significant part of their experience. Although kin communication can function both adaptively and maladaptively in women\u2019s adjustment to cancer, health professionals do not provide families guidance in how to communicatively adjust in a healthy manner. The research report in this dissertation had two purposes: 1) to investigate the significance of family communication in adjusting to breast cancer by using Carstensen\u2019s (1991, 1992) socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) and 2) to explore how diagnosed women communicatively adjust to the disease in their mother-adult daughter bond through openness, avoidance, and emotional support. \n\nThe study incorporated a multiple methods design and involved the collection of both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. A single phase quantitative design served the first purpose, and a multimethods qualitative design the second purpose. For the first purpose, women in three age groups (young, middle, and later adulthood) representing the following two conditions were recruited to participate in a survey: 1) 301 healthy women and 2) 39 women diagnosed with breast cancer. Chi-Square tests of associations were run to examine associations between a limited time perspective (due to age or diagnosis of breast cancer) with social partner preference. Women in Condition 2 (representing each age group) also participated in the qualitative phase. A total of 40 diagnosed women participated and recruited their mothers or adult daughters. A total of 78 women (35 dyads) participated in an individual in-depth interview. Subsamples (N = 10) participated in longitudinal diaries and diary-interviews (N = 8). Women shared how they communicatively adjusted to cancer in their mother-daughter bond through open communication, avoidance, and enacted emotional support. Grounded theory was used to examine all transcripts and diaries. The diary-interview method was employed to permit triangulation with findings from the interviews. Findings from the diary-interview method were analyzed as illustrative and descriptive case studies (a case study representing the experiences of each age group of dyads) and compared with the analyses of the interviews. The case studies deepened the credibility of the findings from the interviews and illustrated each communicative phenomenon on a deeper level.\n\nThe quantitative results extend the utility of SST. Using SST as a framework, Hypothesis 1 and Research Question 1 focused on whether a limited time perspective, due to being closer to the end of life because of age or a breast cancer diagnosis, leads women to prefer kin communication partners. The results revealed that both time factors led women to prioritize communication in family bonds. The qualitative findings showed how women communicatively adapted to breast cancer in their mother-daughter bond. Research Questions 2-5 related to what cancer-related topics diagnosed women openly share or avoid in this bond as well as their motives. Across ages, women openly disclosed physical aspects of the disease (e.g., treatment side effects) but often avoided talking about emotional or distressful topics (e.g., mortality). Diagnosed women often displayed openness and avoidance to protect the mother/daughter from distress. Developmental diversity influenced women\u2019s open and avoidant communication. Research Questions 6-7 asked how mothers and daughters of diagnosed women enact emotional support. Across age groups, women had similar experiences particularly in regard to support that always functioned adaptively (e.g., using humor and listening). Age appeared to influence women\u2019s conceptualization of emotional support, their communication preferences, and their evaluations of support. The context in which support was enacted affected whether women perceived other behaviors as helpful or unhelpful in their adjustment to cancer. The diary findings primarily matched the interview results. Those findings also furthered our understanding of openness, avoidance, and emotional support within the context of mothers and daughters coping with breast cancer treatment.\n\nThe major implications of this dissertation extend theoretical and practical knowledge of family communication, cancer, aging, and health. First, the findings extend SST. Later life women appear to prefer kin communication partners more so than younger generations. In addition, when women are diagnosed with breast cancer in stages 3 or 4, regardless of age, they prefer kin communication partners more than women diagnosed in earlier stages. These findings enhance existing literature in health communication by expanding our theoretical understanding of the role of family communication in a cancer context. Second, the qualitative findings demonstrate that human development affects women\u2019s open, avoidant, and support communicative needs when adjusting to breast cancer. These findings also highlight the need for scholars to appreciate context to capture whether kin communication functions adaptively or not when adjusting to this health transition. \n \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1026], "author_name_tesi": "Fisher, Carla L.", "last_name_ssi": "Fisher", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Carla", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum", "Dennis Stephen Gouran", "Michelle E Day", "Melissa Hardy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Chair", "Dennis Stephen Gouran, Committee Member", "Michelle E Day, Committee Member", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["socioemotional selectivity theory", "life-span communication", "family communication", "mother-daughter relationship", "open communication", "avoidance", "emotional support", "breast cancer", "turning point", "human development", "transition"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Improving the Soil and Mind:\nThe Geography of The Cultivator\n", "id": "9242", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2699", "abstract_tesi": "In the early nineteenth century, American agriculture underwent a radical transformation.

Thus, when foreign destinations troubled accepted conceptions of the \u201cmedieval,\u201d the authors under inquiry set out to reposition the medieval legacy in contemporary contexts in order to reconsider how best to identify and to enact progress both socio-politically and aesthetically. William Wordsworth confronted the failings of fanatical Republican historiography at the Grande Chartreuse on his Alpine tour in 1790. Employing anachronism, he situates medievalisms as a vital intervention in progressive reform and as the inspiration for his innovative poetics. Germaine de Sta\u00ebl\u2019s Corinne, ou l\u2019Italie frames the Italian \u201cMoyen Age\u201d as a testament to the Italian capacity to withstand hegemonic pressures, staging a medievalist intervention against modern tendencies either to repeat the past or to allow it to dominate the present. A melancholic rebellion against history is depicted in the 1816 compositions from Lord Byron\u2019s exilic sojourn in Switzerland. Seeking an escape from the manipulative draw of the past, he represents Chillon, a medievalist monument, as a tentative model for living between resignation from the world and the self-abandonment of active historical engagement.

This promoter-proximal pausing is mediated together by protein complexes 5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) and Negative Elongation Factor (NELF).  Despite many studies of NELF, the manner in which it imparts pausing activity remains unclear.  One feature of interest is the RNA recognition motif (RRM) of the subunit NELF-E, which has previously been shown as necessary for pausing, and its ability to bind to RNA.  This binding activity has been implicated in the modulation of pausing activity and the dissociation of NELF from paused polymerase, allowing transcription into the body of the gene.  I prepared a series of NELF-expressing baculoviruses which were used to produce NELF and a series of mutations in NELF-E.  Using these protein complexes, I studied the effects of NELF-E on pausing in an in vitro transcription system and identified regions required for association of NELF-E with the other three subunits, binding to the Pol II/DSIF elongation complex (EC), and for pausing activity.  I discovered that a region previously identified as a leucine-zipper-like domain near the N-terminus of NELF-E is required for association of NELF-E with other NELF subunits.  The absence of NELF-E from the complex results in complete loss of pausing activity.  Contrary to expectations, I discovered that the RRM is not essential for pausing since deletion of this domain did not affect the pausing activity of NELF in vitro.  Instead, I found that amino acids within residues 40 through 113 in NELF-E are required for pausing activity and EC binding, but not the RRM or flanking sequences.  This provides incentives for studies on NELF-E to examine residues in the N-terminal half of the protein and discover binding partners for this region which hopefully will explain how NELF promotes polymerase pausing.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14346], "author_name_tesi": "Fisher, Michael James", "last_name_ssi": "Fisher", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Gilmour", "Paul Babitzke", "Joseph Reese", "Katsuhiko Murakami", "Michael Axtell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Gilmour, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Babitzke, Committee Chair", "Joseph Reese, Committee Member", "Katsuhiko Murakami, Committee Member", "Michael Axtell, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Transcription", "Pausing", "NELF", "Drosophila", "RNA Polymerase II", "Gene regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "understanding nutrition knowledge and behaviors of collegiate athletes", "id": "19804", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9464", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Background: Collegiate athletes often have inadequate diets due to lack appropriate nutrition knowledge (NK) and subsequently poor nutrition behavior (NB).  Poor diet may compromise athletic performance, delay recovery from physical activity, and increase vulnerability to injury and illness.  The purpose of the this study was to examine the relationship between gender, prior nutrition-related coursework, international vs. domestic student status, living situation, sport played, race/ethnicity, and year in school with NK and NB.\nMethods: Collegiate athletes from Fairleigh Dickinson University, an NCAA Division I institution, voluntarily participated in the cross-sectional study.  An online questionnaire distributed to the athletes via members of the coaching staff collected anthropometric and demographic information in addition to information on nutrition knowledge and behaviors.  Descriptive data were calculated as frequencies (%).  A Pearson correlation (r) was used to examine the relationship between NK and NB.  An independent samples t-test (t) was used to determine differences between male and female gender, whether or not an athlete had previous nutrition-related coursework, and NK and NB.  A one-way ANOVA (F) was used to determine differences between living situation, sport played, race/ethnicity, year in school and NK and NB.\nResults: The final sample (n=140) consisted of 42.5% male and 57.5% female athletes.  The study found no significant relationship between NK and NB.  No significant difference was found between genders for NK and NB.  Athletes who had previous nutrition-related coursework were found to have significantly greater NK (p=.025).  However, there was no difference between NB and those who had previous nutrition-related coursework and those who did not.  International athletes were found to have significantly better NK (p=.005) compared to domestic athletes.  Athletes living off-campus alone or with roommates had better NK (p=.02) compared to students living on-campus or off-campus with family.  No significant differences were found between sport teams with respect to either NB or NK.  Fourth year/senior athletes were found to have significantly better NK compared to both first year/freshman athletes (p=.029) and second year/sophomore athletes (p=.028).\nConclusions: This study revealed that while differences do appear to exist among the collegiate athletes in this population with respect to levels of NK, there seems to be very little difference across the population with respect to NB.  The results of this study also indicate that NK may not be a good predictor of NB in collegiate athletes and that despite adequate NK, barriers to improved NB may exist. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9255], "author_name_tesi": "Fisher, Scott Yves", "last_name_ssi": "Fisher", "middle_name_ssi": "Yves", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Jean Bopp"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Jean Bopp, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nutrition", "knowledge", "behaviors", "collegiate", "athletes"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Some Results In Hyperbolic Dynamics\n", "id": "6891", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6308", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We present three related results in hyperbolic dynamical systems.  \nAs one result, we demonstrate local differential rigidity for certain higher\nrank Anosov actions possesing nontrivial Jordan block structure.

While study of the molecular mechanisms of defense in cacao has been limited, the recent sequencing of two cacao genomes has greatly expedited the ability to study genes and gene families with roles in defense. Here, the pathogenesis-related (PR) gene families were bioinformatically identified, and family size and gene organization were compared to other plant species, revealing significant conservation throughout higher monocots and dicots. Expression of the PR families was also analyzed using a whole genome microarray to measure transcriptomic regulation in leaves after treatment of cacao seedlings with two pathogens, identifying the induced PR genes within each family. We found significant overlap between the PR genes induced by the pathogens, and subsequent qRT-PCR revealed up to 5000-fold induction of specific PR family members. \n\tNext, the regulation of the defense response in cacao by salicylic acid, a major defense hormone, was analyzed. The study focused on two genotypes, the broadly resistant Scavina 6 and the widely susceptible ICS1. First, treatment of leaves of two cacao genotypes with salicylic acid was shown to enhance resistance of both. Moreover, overexpression of TcNPR1, a master regulator of systemic acquired resistance, is also shown to enhance the defense response, supporting the importance of salicylic acid and its downstream targets in cacao immunity. Microarray analysis of the transcriptomic response to salicylic acid revealed genotype-specific responses to hormone treatment. ICS1 appeared to show a more canonical response to salicylic acid, with more PR genes induced, while Scavina 6 exhibited increased expression of chloroplastic and mitochondrial genes. It was hypothesized that this induction was linked to increased ROS production, and subsequent ROS staining experiments confirmed higher concentration of superoxide in salicylic acid-treated Scavina 6 leaf tissue. \n\tThird, a pilot study was performed to quantify genetic variability within defense genes. Using DNA samples representing three populations of cacao \u2013 Peruvian, Ecuadorian, and French Guianan \u2013 we amplified three genes involved in defense, two predicted to be more variable (cysteine-rich repeat secretory peptide 38 and a polygalacturonase inhibitor) and one predicted to harbor less polymorphism (pathogenesis-related 1).  Population genetic analysis of variability suggested that the gene predicted to be more variable may be under diversifying selection, suggesting that they may directly interact with rapidly evolving pathogen proteins. The experiment validated previously described observations about the populations, in particular that the French Guianan population was less variable than the others. The study also supported the predictions regarding gene variability, indicating that our strategy for identifying genes with more variation appears to be applicable but will require further validation. \n\tThe Guiltinan-Maximova lab developed a protocol for transient transformation of cacao leaf tissue, which has been applied to characterizing gene function in several published analyses. Here the highly efficient protocol is presented in full, along with data collected in a series of optimization experiments. We also use the protocol to demonstrate the effect of overexpression of a cacao chitinase after subsequent infection with Phytophthora mycelia.\n\tA preliminary study describing a strategy for selection of high-priority candidate genes for functional characterization is described. Six genes were cloned and overexpressed using the transient transformation protocol; and while the study showed the ability of our protocol to significantly increase transcript abundance of the gene of interest, it did not validate the role of any of the genes in defense by showing decreased susceptibility. \n\tThis dissertation contributes to the study of genomics and molecular mechanisms of defense in four key ways: 1) 15 classes of defense genes are identified and their expression dynamics are characterized, 2) genotype-specific differences in defense response are identified, providing insight into different strategies for survival, 3) variability within defense genes is discovered, differentiating populations of cacao and providing evidence for diversifying selection, and 4) a rapid and efficient strategy for gene functional analysis, which will enhance future genetic analyses in cacao, is presented.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12283], "author_name_tesi": "Fister, Andrew Sean", "last_name_ssi": "Fister", "middle_name_ssi": "Sean", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Guiltinan", "Majid R Foolad", "Siela Maximova", "Charles T Anderson", "James Harold Marden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Guiltinan, Dissertation Advisor", "Majid R Foolad, Committee Chair", "Siela Maximova, Committee Member", "Charles T Anderson, Committee Member", "James Harold Marden, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cacao", "Plant", "Genetics", "Disease", "Defense", "Transformation", "Chocolate", "Tree", "Pathogenesis-Related"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "LATE COGNITIVE, ACADEMIC, AND BEHAVIORAL FUNCTIONING IN CHILDHOOD CANCER SURVIVORS TREATED BEFORE AGE FIVE WITH \nNON-CNS-DIRECTED THERAPY\n\n\n", "id": "8017", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2781", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Children who have been treated for cancer are at risk for experiencing cognitive, academic, and behavioral difficulties which may not appear until long after treatment has ended. These difficulties, known as neurocognitive late effects, are believed to result in part from damage to the central nervous system (CNS) caused by the cancer and by neurotoxic treatment methods. Until recently, children whose cancer and treatment protocols did not target the CNS were believed to be protected from such damage. However, research suggests that these cancer survivors may indeed experience some degree of neurocognitive impairment following treatment. Cognitive, academic, and behavioral functioning were examined in a group of 18 long-term cancer survivors treated prior to school-age with only non-CNS-directed chemotherapy and radiation. Survivors\u2019 scores were compared to their healthy siblings and to the normative population. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the healthy siblings outperformed survivors on all measures, including IQ, reading, math fluency, working and auditory memory, and processing speed. Furthermore, survivors were much more likely to be receiving special education services than their siblings. Cancer survivors demonstrated higher levels of parent-reported problems with attention and executive functioning, compared to both siblings and the normative population. Medium to large effect sizes were associated with the differences between survivors\u2019 and siblings\u2019 auditory memory scores and small to medium effects were found between survivors and the normative group in math fluency. In spite of the differences, survivors\u2019 mean scores on all of the measures fell within the average range, and both survivors\u2019 and siblings\u2019 IQs were slightly above average. Exploratory regression analyses suggested that parent education was the only significant predictor of attention and executive functioning, while time since diagnosis was the only significant predictor of survivors\u2019 scores on the auditory memory composite. The small n was a significant limitation in terms of statistical power and the ability to generalize the findings. Nevertheless, results from the study do support the need for future large-scale research with this population of cancer survivors to determine whether they are at risk for later neurocognitive deficits, and if so, which areas of functioning are likely to be affected.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2778], "author_name_tesi": "FitzGerald, Julie L.", "last_name_ssi": "FitzGerald", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Julie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "School Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Schaefer", "James Clyde Diperna", "Paul Morgan", "Rick Owen Gilmore"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Schaefer, Committee Chair", "James Clyde Diperna, Committee Member", "Paul Morgan, Committee Member", "Rick Owen Gilmore, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["memory", "attention", "intelligence", "pediatric oncology", "non-CNS treatment", "childhood cancer", "neurocognitive late effects", "learning", "treatment effects", "pediatric oncology", "academic achievement", "executive function"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN TWO EIGHTH GRADE MATHEMATICS CLASSES\n\n\n", "id": "5883", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5516", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "During the last decade US K-12 schools have approximately tripled their spending on increasingly powerful computers, expanded network access, and novel computer applications.

Recent research is characterized by an awareness that the process of implementing educational technologies in schools is much more human than technological and can only be understood in context. Exploring the human implementation process is thought to be one key to understanding how educational technologies find purchase and evolve in local classroom environments. This naturalistic inquiry explored the semester-long process of implementing an interactive learning system in two math classes in a rural mid-Atlantic Junior\u2013Senior High School. Schwab\u2019s (1978) curriculum contexts (teacher, student, subject matter, milieux) provided loci for identifying, describing, and interpreting the students\u2019 and teacher\u2019s experiences of the interactive learning system. Data collection was based on field observations, periodic interviews with individual students and their teacher, exploratory and culminating focus group interviews with students, and document analysis. Grounded theory methods were used to analyze the data. I found that there was no significant change in the teacher\u2019s instructional model during her implementation of the interactive learning system. Conditions that supported the teacher in her decision to adopt the educational technology curriculum innovation did not sustain her instructional evolution during the implementation process. The teacher reached a point of implementation impasse while simultaneously using the traditional district-controlled teacher-proof curriculum and the interactive learning system with her two eighth grade math classes. The level of mismatch between the traditional math curriculum and the curriculum represented by the novel educational technology emerged as a critical factor influencing the implementation process. The students\u2019 primary implementation experiences focused on learner-control vis-\u00e0-vis the tools of the system, opportunities for spontaneous peer interactions, and increased motivation in the technology-enhanced math class. I provide recommendations for future research and for the implementation of educational technologies in schools. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5507], "author_name_tesi": "FitzPatrick, Sarah ", "last_name_ssi": "FitzPatrick", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kyle Leonard Peck", "James F Nolan Jr.", "John Daniel Marshall", "Russell Faux", "Alison Alene Carr Chellman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kyle Leonard Peck, Committee Member", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member", "Russell Faux, Committee Member", "Alison Alene Carr Chellman, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["instruction", "grounded theory", "educational change", "curriculum", "eighth grade", "mathematics", "educational technology", "computer tools", "implementation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Decision Making Style Diversity and Faultlines in Teams", "id": "19874", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9451", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As the workplace continues to become increasingly diverse and complex, understanding how multifaceted forms of diversity affects team processes and performance is crucial.

The two tools that were used within this work are the Hydraulic Profiling Tool (HPT) and the Cone Penetration Test (CPT).  The influence of drainage state originates from the coupled soil strain rate, which is prescribed by the penetrometer radius and advance rate along with diffusivity, which controls the induced fluid pressure dissipation rate through the soil, was examined for both instruments through a combination of field and laboratory experiments with numerical and analytical models developed to assist in understanding the resulting data trends.  Through out, the analyses were conducted to first evaluate the role of drainage state on the magnitudes of induced fluid pressures and strength magnitudes; then advanced to utilize this information to develop methods for recovering depth-continuous magnitudes of permeability from the data. Detailed abstracts for each article are provided below.\n\nDepth-continuous permeability profiling using an active source permeameter: A method is developed to recover a depth-continuous hydraulic conductivity (K) profile of an unconsolidated saturated aquifer using an active source penetrometer, the Hydraulic Profiling Tool (HPT).  The tool yields estimates of   through continuous injection of fluid in the subsurface from a small port on the probe shaft while controlled measurements of net applied fluid pressure (&#8710;P) required to maintain a specified flow rate (Q) (typically 350 mL/min) are recorded.  The tool gathers these data of flow rate and measured applied pressure during halted and constant-rate penetration (typically 2cm/sec) of the probe.  The analysis is developed in two parts: first to explore the interplay between advective effects controlled by penetration rate, and second to examine flow volume effects controlled by the targeted flow rate.  These two effects are analyzed through their respective influence on the measured applied pressure response in   space, which shows a linear relationship for the flow rate to applied pressure response when   and when   the response tends towards an asymptotic limit representing soil failure limits as &#8710;P/effective stress.  The analysis shows that penetration rate does not significantly influence the applied pressure response at the tested penetration rates (U = 0, 2, 4 cm/s ).  The targeted applied flow rate does however influence the applied pressure response as flow rates less than ~300 mL/min show a scattering of the data in   space, where above 300 mL/min the data begin to form a linear response.  A targeted flow rate of   is suggested as a suitable flow rate based on this analysis.  Measurements of hydraulic conductivity are then obtained for the HPT data through the derivation of an equation based on a recast form of Darcy\u2019s law where considerations of the flow geometry as .    profiles obtained for the HPT system are then compared against   profiles obtained from an independent method (PSU permeameter) and yield a good correspondence between the two methods.  \n\nInfluence of drainage condition on CPTu \u2018On-the-Fly\u2019 metrics with relation to permeability profiling: Magnitudes of end-bearing  , sleeve friction   and penetration-induced pore pressure   are reported for steady penetration of a one-quarter-scale miniature-CPT probe in a kaolinite-sand (75:25) mixture spun at 100-g in a beam centrifuge. Penetration rates in the range 0.004 to 3.00 (fast) mm/s span the spectrum of fully-drained to fully-undrained loading and represent maximum and minimum penetration and frictional resistances, respectively. Cavity expansion solutions are developed to calculate magnitudes of   and   as drainage state changes based on normalized   pore pressure data.  These confirm relationships between normalized end bearing (Qt) pore pressure ratio (Bq) and dimensionless hydraulic conductivity (KD ) magnitudes as  .  New independent relationships linking end bearing and pore pressures and linking sleeve friction (Fr ) and pore pressures are able to constrain independent relationships between dimensionless permeability   and the metric pairs QtFr  and Bq/Fr . These observations provide additional evidence and correlations in support of the direct recovery of depth-continuous hydraulic conductivity magnitudes from steady profiling by CPT.\n\nAnalysis for a variable rate penetrometer \u2013 Scanning drainage states to better recover soil behavior in the partial drainage transition:  An analysis is presented to examine the pore pressure relationships that develop as a function of variable rate penetration of a standard CPT probe advanced in a homogeneous elastic-perfectly plastic and fully saturated soil.  Dimensionless penetration rate is conditioned as   oscillating between   and   on selected oscillation frequencies ranging from  .  Pore pressure trends are calculated for couplings of dimensionless parameters,   and  , using a finite-element analysis model following a Lagrangian framework.  A parametric analysis conducted shows that for low   magnitudes, representing drained conditions, the peak pore pressure response is very low in magnitude compared with high   magnitudes, which represent undrained conditions.  Oscillation frequencies ( ) are shown to control stroke length of the penetrometer advance per cycle, independent of selected values of   or  , with low magnitudes ( ) yielding longer penetration strokes then high magnitudes ( ).  Steady state pore pressures, on the oscillating cycle, are found to develop after a length of   the penetrometer radius, and for a standard CPT rods equates to steady state occurring after approximately 1/3 of each rod leaving 2/3\u2019s per rod for data collection at steady state conditions.  Soil strength moduli are shown to influence the area of influence surround the advancing cone tip with low magnitudes ( ), presented as high undrained strengths, having the smallest zone of influence, and largest peak magnitudes of pore pressure, compared with high magnitudes ( ) that result in the lowest peak magnitudes of pore pressure and yield the largest zone of influence.  This analysis was advance to examine the ability to recover (coefficient of) permeability magnitudes from the oscillating pore pressure data and yielded a unique solution for permeability as a function of dimensional net pore pressure  , penetration rate ( ), and dimensionless pressure ( ) obtained from the finite-element analysis.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4453], "author_name_tesi": "Fitzgerald, Michael Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Fitzgerald", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Derek Elsworth", "Kamini Singha", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Jamal Rostami"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth, Dissertation Advisor", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Chair", "Kamini Singha, Committee Member", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Member", "Jamal Rostami, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["soils", "hydraulic conductivity", "permeability", "direct-push"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Synthesis of Carbon Materials via the Cold Compression of Aromatic Molecules and Carbon Nanostructures", "id": "22388", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10226", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "        Carbon\u2019s ability for catenation makes it a remarkable element and allows for many interesting and surprising properties and structures.

Although the deformation behavior of zirconium alloys as a function of temperature and the strong influence of hydrogen on the fracture behavior of zirconium alloys have been fairly well established, relatively little is known of the effects of hydrogen (and the resulting hydrides) on the deformation behavior of zirconium alloys over a range of temperatures.  The potential presence of such effects is especially important to high burnup fuel where hydrogen uptake within the cladding may be substantial.  \nDeformation behavior is one of the critical inputs for fuel modeling codes, and therefore a mechanistic understanding of deformation behavior is critical for reactor safety.  The purpose of this study is to quantify the effect of hydrogen on deformation behavior of cold worked and stress-relieved Zircaloy-4 plate material as a function of specimen orientation (i.e., stress axis aligned with the rolling direction, the transverse direction, or normal-to-the plate surface direction), temperature (25C, 300C, and 400C), and strain rate (from 10-4/s to 10-2/s).  Testing for this study was performed primarily in uniaxial compression because, in contrast with tensile testing, compression testing permits the observation of uniform deformation to higher strains so that a more accurate assessment of changes in deformation modeling parameters for strength, strain-hardening and strain-rate hardening with temperature and hydrogen content can be made.\nA comparison of tensile and compressive stress-strain behavior of the Zircaloy-4 plate used in this study showed slightly higher but similar yield stresses and identical strain-hardening.  The plate material exhibits plastic anisotropy similar to cladding tube behavior, such that through-thickness deformation is quite difficult.  Thus, deformation behavior of the Zircaloy-4 plate in compression should be relevant to in-service loading of Zircaloy-4 cladding in tension. A plasticity analysis of the Zircaloy-4 plate using the Hill yield criterion also supports the notion that plastic deformation under through-thickness compression is equivalent to equal-biaxial tension, which is a strain path of particular interest for cladding behavior in reactivity-initiated accidents, where pellet-cladding interactions and fission gas expansion can be significant.\nOnly minor changes in deformation behavior as a function of hydrogen content were observed in this study, and these changes appear to be related to the annealing time experienced during the hydriding procedure.  For samples which were annealed for approx. 70 hours, there was no significant change in either yield stress or strain-hardening with increased hydrogen.  However, for samples annealed for less than 20 hours during hydriding, there was a small decrease in yield stress, a significant increase in strain-hardening in the rolling and normal directions and a more gradual transition from elastic to plastic behavior with increasing hydrogen content.  In all cases, there was no significant effect of hydrogen on the strain-rate hardening or the plastic anisotropy of the plate material.\nThe results of this study suggest that the small effects of hydrogen on the deformation behavior of Zircaloy-4 are caused by dislocations which form upon hydride precipitation to accommodate the difference in specific volume of hydride precipitates and the Zircaloy-4 matrix, rather than by the hydride precipitates themselves. Thus, the observed changes in deformation behavior are sensitive to the annealing time experienced during hydrogen charging as a result of the associated recovery and recovery process, such that the effect of hydrogen on deformation behavior was diminished by long (approx. 70 hrs) annealing times.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4057], "author_name_tesi": "Flanagan, Michelle E", "last_name_ssi": "Flanagan", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Donald Albert Koss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Thesis Advisor", "Donald Albert Koss, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydrides", "Nuclear", "Mechanical properties", "Zircaloy"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Identifying and Supporting Productive Collaborative Teacher Talk ", "id": "13718ama177", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13718", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As improvements and changes in science education are promulgated, science teachers must be educated about these changes.  Professional development programs are central to promoting teacher learning.  Although the field seems to have agreed upon large-scale pedagogical features of high quality professional development with an emphasis on building a collaborative community of learners, effective implementation of these features is still problematic.  The connections between these collaborative features and actual teacher work during the professional development remain unclear.  This qualitative discourse study investigated how teachers engaged in small group discussions use discourse to collaborate during a weeklong professional development program that employed these useful pedagogical features.   Small group discussions among the forty-two participants, diverse in their demographics and teaching experiences, were video and audio recorded.  A collaborative discourse framework was developed and applied to the discussions, successfully categorizing episodes of discourse according to their productive potential for learning.  The structure of the PD activities was then investigated to determine characteristics encouraging to these productive learning conversations.  The analysis in this study indicated requiring groups to come to a consensus helps groups dig deeper into the content, promoting a more productive negotiation of concepts.  Building consensus around an artifact, such as a graph, strengthened the need for consensus and thereby strengthened the opportunities for productive conversation.  In addition, professional development activities that target building and using specific language were also opportunities for productive learning talk, providing opportunities to negotiate the deep meaning of words and concepts rather then leaving them unexamined. When viewed through the lens of Wenger\u2019s Community of Practice (1998), these findings are ways of strengthening the community.  Consensus strengthens the mutual accountability, and the purposeful building of vocabulary strengthens the shared repertoire, as did having the consensus artifact.

The inspections of the audit work of these firms (hereafter, small public practice firms) are the focus of this study.  Theory models the interactions between an inspected entity and an inspector either as static, with independent interactions, or dynamic, with continuous learning among parties throughout multiple inspection cycles.  Because three years pass between inspections, prior inspection results may be irrelevant to the current inspection.  If the inspectors rely on recent information supplied by the small public practice firm to plan and execute the current inspection, a static view might characterize the relationship between the PCAOB and the firm.  On the other hand, a dynamic relationship encourages past PCAOB inspections to influence current interactions with the firm.  I posit that a firm that received a clean prior inspection outcome, i.e., no engagement deficiencies or quality control issues, is less likely to have an increase in the number of audit clients inspected during the current inspection than firms that received other prior inspection outcomes.  Controlling for the current client portfolio characteristics, I find that an average firm with a prior clean report has a 6% decrease in the probability of an increase in the number of client files inspected with the current inspection as compared to firms with different prior inspection outcomes.  This finding provides evidence consistent with a dynamic relationship among the PCAOB and the firms.   For practitioners, these results show that the PCAOB conditions subsequent inspections on past inspection results. \n\tThe inspection process and frequency for small public practice firms does not depend on whether the firm is headquartered in the United States (US) or abroad.  I examine the impact of a home country regulator on foreign firm inspection reports issued by the PCAOB.  Some foreign regulators are similar to the PCAOB.   A PCAOB-like regulator belongs to the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators and employs personnel to inspect accounting firms.  Alternative regulatory regimes include regulators that indirectly oversee the accounting firms through an intermediary professional organization.   I hypothesize and find evidence that foreign firms subject to PCAOB-like regulator are more likely to receive a clean inspection outcome from the PCAOB as compared to foreign firms in alternative regulatory environments.  For the average firm, a PCAOB-like regulator increases the probability of a clean PCAOB inspection outcome by 21% as compared to an engagement deficient outcome.  However, I find no evidence that the regulatory environment otherwise impacts the probability of a clean inspection outcome as compared to a quality deficient inspection outcome.   The association between the home country regulatory environment and PCAOB inspection outcomes provides evidence of the inconsistent application of a single set of standards globally.  For international audit standard setters, these results support the creation of an enforcement function for international auditing standards.   \n      Finally, I use the creation of a new position, PCAOB inspector, and the typical staffing of this position with individuals having extensive Big 4 external audit experience to derive hypotheses based on role theory.   Theory models the interaction of an individual\u2019s role within the organization in which s/he works using role ambiguity as an interceding factor in the relationship between the individual and the organization.  Role ambiguity exists if the individual does not have the required data and understanding to execute her/his position.  Theory posits that a high level of role ambiguity translates into inferior job performance.  I hypothesize and test (1) high role ambiguity, e.g., when the inspector reviews work papers for a public client engagement fundamentally different than an inspector\u2018s prior experience and (2) low role ambiguity, e.g. when the PCAOB leadership state specific areas of focus for inspectors, for associations with specific PCAOB inspection report wording outcomes, representing job performance.  Because each inspection report follows a standard reporting review processes within the PCAOB and the inspectors are typically experienced auditors who are familiar with the execution of auditing standards, there may not be an association between the role ambiguity of an inspector and the wording outcomes of an inspection report.  I find that ambiguity is positively associated with the likelihood of financial statement assertion words, e.g., completeness or valuation, representing the most basic auditing risks.  I find that ambiguity is negatively associated with the likelihood of words embodying key areas of focus for inspections as stated by PCAOB leadership.   As role ambiguity increases in the interquartile range, there is a 6.2% decrease in probability of the existence of words representing key areas of PCAOB focus and a 6.6% increase in the probability of the existence of financial statement assertion words in the engagement deficiency description.  For investors, these findings emphasize that the PCAOB inspector subjectively adjusts the wording of an inspection deficiency.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9078], "author_name_tesi": "Flasher, Renee ", "last_name_ssi": "Flasher", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Renee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven J Huddart", "Steven J Huddart", "Mark William Dirsmith", "Kai Du", "Debashis Ghosh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven J Huddart, Dissertation Advisor", "Steven J Huddart, Committee Chair", "Mark William Dirsmith, Committee Member", "Kai Du, Committee Member", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PCAOB", "Inspections", "Role Ambiguity", "International", "Audit Firms"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "MOLECULAR AND SPECIES-SPECIFIC DETERMINANTS OF ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY", "id": "10449", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "913", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor that modulates gene expression in response to ligand binding. AHR ligands include a structurally diverse group of planar hydrophobic polycyclic organic compounds, which include dietary flavinoids such as 2-(3,4dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5,7-trihydroxy-4H-chromen-4-one (quercetin), as well as endogenous compounds like bilirubin and the environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The AHR mediates most if not all of the adverse affects of TCDD exposure. Rodent models have been traditionally used in studies aimed at investigating TCDD-mediated toxicity and carcinogenesis and in the assessment of human risk. In order to enhance the accuracy of rodent-based toxicological data it is important to understand the molecular differences between human and rodent AHRs.   We proposed that the hAHR would be functionally distinct from the mAHR. Therefore we attempted to identify biochemical and molecular factors that may influence interspecies differences between the mouse and human AHR. At a cellular level the hAHR also has contrasting nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling properties compared to the mouse AHR (mAHR). This led to the hypothesis that identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the ligand-independent nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of the AHR would shed light on this interspecies difference. Firstly we investigated the ability of the AHR to modulate gene expression in the absence of heterodimerization with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). Through the use of an ARNT-binding deficient AHR mutant in cell culture based luciferase-reporter assays it was demonstrated that the AHR is unable to activate dioxin responsive element (DRE)-driven gene activity or repress estrogen receptor activity in the absence of interaction with ARNT. Compared to the mAHR the hAHR also interacts less stably with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). The co-chaperone p23 is a component of the unliganded AHR complex that was presumed to be important to stable interaction between AHR and HSP90. In the third chapter a p23 knockout mouse was used to investigate the importance of p23 expression to AHR ligand-binding and transcriptional activity in vivo. Gene expression and ligand binding analysis revealed that p23 expression was dispensable for AHR ligand binding and AHR-regulated gene induction. Amino acid sequence identity differences exist for the AHR between and within species that is in part responsible for the contrasting inter-species and intra-species sensitivity to TCDD exposure. We show in the fourth chapter that the amino acid sequence dissimilarity in the C-terminal domains of the mAHR and hAHR may actually result in differential recruitment of LXXLL-coactivator binding motif proteins which suggests that each receptor may differentially recruit coactivators. Compared to the human AHR (hAHR) the Ahrb allele, the most commonly used allele in TCDD toxicity and carcinogenesis studies, has a 10-fold higher affinity for typical AHR ligands like TCDD. In contrast to this it is demonstrated that the hAHR shows a higher relative ligand binding affinity for certain ligands such as indirubin and quercetin in the fifth chapter. Finally, using microarray analysis we show that the hAHR and mAHR actually regulate different subsets of genes known to be associated with distinct biological pathways. Altogether these discoveries have identified a number of novel interspecies differences between the hAHR and mAHR. This research may have significant implications for model systems aimed at defining human risk associated with TCDD exposure.

Given the high value placed on children in SSA, infertility increases the risk of psychological distress and marital conflict, encourages risky sexual behavior, and deprives infertile individuals and couples of an important source of economic and social capital.  The following chapters explore the implications and measurement of infertility in Ghana, West Africa.\n\nI begin with an analysis of qualitative data I collected in Accra, Ghana, in 2008.  This chapter examines the effect of infertility on mental well-being and physical health from the perspective of infertile women seeking treatment in a clinical setting.  Additionally, I explore the social consequences of infertility and gendered nature of these experiences from the perspective of both fertile and infertile women.  I find that infertility has important consequences for each of the aspects of women's lives, and that these consequences are not perceived to be shared equally by Ghanaian men.\n\nNext, using 8 waves of panel data collected by the Population Council of New York and the University of Cape Coast, I consider the optimal measure of infertility for social research in sub-Saharan Africa.  Though current infertility research in the SSA suggests a conservative demographic measure is ideal for measuring prevalence, the dearth of self-identified infertility measures in survey data in the region has prevented comparisons.  Arguably, however, women's perceptions of their own infertility status may have a greater impact for social outcomes such as marital instability and mental health.  Using the Cape Coast data set, I assess the stability of several measures of infertility currently used in the demographic and biomedical literature through the application of a test-retest statistical method.  In addition, I examine the correlation between biomedical, demographic, and self-identified infertility, and apply random effects models to explore how each measure relates to background demographic characteristics.\n\nThe final piece of the dissertation empirically examines the relationship between infertility and union instability using discrete-time hazard models.  Previous (primarily qualitative) research in the sub-continent has suggested that there may be a link between infertility a divorce; less is known about the implications of infertility for unmarried couples.  I explore this relationship both for marriages and non-marital sexual unions.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2723], "author_name_tesi": "Fledderjohann, Jasmine ", "last_name_ssi": "Fledderjohann", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jasmine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Johnson", "David R Johnson", "Jenny Trinitapoli", "Leif Jensen", "Alan Booth", "Francis Dodoo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "David R Johnson, Committee Chair", "Jenny Trinitapoli, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "Alan Booth, Committee Member", "Francis Dodoo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Marriage", "Reproductive Health", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "Infertility", "Ghana", "Cohabitation", "Relationship Disruption"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Characterization of Cesium Sites Within Zeolites using Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\n", "id": "8677", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1125", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a technique used to characterize local cationic sites within zeolites.

The resulting spectra acquired from up to three different magnetic field strengths are used to calculate the quadrupole product and isotropic chemical shift for each cesium site.  Since water content is a large contributing factor to cation mobility, each zeolite sample was equilibrated at 0% or 100% relative humidity to determine whether a relationship existed between the quadrupole product and relative humidity.  It was found that the quadrupole product decreases as the relative humidity increases.  Two solid model systems (Cs2SO4 and CsClO4) were also characterized and the same two parameters were determined.  These model systems were analyzed to confirm that this method could accurately determine the isotropic chemical shift and quadrupole product.

Cs is a principal contaminant at several nuclear waste sites, including the DOE Hanford Site, where high-level, high pH nuclear waste is leaking from tens of underground storage tanks.  Our results indicate that Cs uptake by hexagonal H-birnessite increases as pH increases from pH 3 to pH 11; the increase in Cs uptake (wt%) correlates to an incremental increase in unit-cell volume as a function of pH.  As Cs adsorption increases and pH increases, the rate of Cs cation exchange reaction decreases.  On the other hand, triclinic Na-birnessite adsorbs less Cs at a neutral pH than at high or low pH.  Again, greater uptake of Cs correlates to a decrease in Cs cation exchange rate as the pH becomes more acidic or basic.\n\nDuring the course of these variable pH reactions, we observed that a phase transformation occurred between the triclinic and hexagonal phases as a function of pH even in the presence of competing cations (i.e., Cs).  At pH 3, triclinic Na-birnessite transformed to hexagonal H- or Cs-birnessite, and at pH 13, hexagonal H-birnessite transformed to triclinic Na- or Cs-birnessite.  At both low and high pH, cation exchange with the dissolved cation (H, Na, or Cs) preceded the symmetry-changing transformation.  The interlayer cation remained within the structure during the phase transformations, indicating that these materials act as sequestering agents no matter the pH or crystalline phase.  \n\nFor the last set of experiments, we exchanged Mn2+ into triclinic Na-birnessite to assess the possibility of a redox-driven phase transformation to hexagonal H-birnessite. We determined that aqueous Mn2+ catalyzed the phase transformation at pH 3, and the rate of phase transformation increased as [Mn2+] increased.  However, at pH 4.5 and 6, Mn2+(aq) promoted the breakdown of the manganese oxide octahedral sheets.  Initially the Mn2+ exchanged into the interlayer region, indicated by a decrease in unit-cell volume, followed by an increase in the Mnoct-Ooct bond distances to 2.01 \u00c5, suggesting that the octahedral Mn4+(s) was reduced to Mn3+(s).  We supported this observation by completing the same reaction in a batch reactor, where the final solid-state products were a mixture of triclinic birnessite, hausmannite, and three Mn3+OOH products (manganite, groutite, and feitknechtite).  \n\nThis investigation reveals the adaptability of birnessite as a function of chemical environment. Mn oxides control heavy metal mobility not only by high sorption and cation exchange capacities but by redox reactivity, and these properties vary with the particular phase of Mn oxide.  Thus, each phase needs to be characterized individually to fully understand how mixtures will interact in natural systems.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7025], "author_name_tesi": "Fleeger, Claire Rene", "last_name_ssi": "Fleeger", "middle_name_ssi": "Rene", "first_name_ssi": "Claire", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney", "James David Kubicki", "Matthew Scott Fantle", "William D Burgos"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney, Dissertation Advisor", "James David Kubicki, Committee Member", "Matthew Scott Fantle, Committee Member", "William D Burgos, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["birnessite", "cesium sequestration", "phase transformation", "manganese oxide"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Teacher Ratings of Intervention Acceptability in the Instructional Support Team Process", "id": "6440", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "354", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since the late 1970\u2019s there has been significant growth in school-based pre referral intervention programs that now play a prominent role in many school systems across the country.  Such programs are primarily regular education initiatives and are intended to assist students who are experiencing difficulty with school.  Many team formats exist but most are characterized by interaction among professionals in the school who seek to develop effective intervention strategies in an effort to reduce the number of inappropriate special education referrals and help students remain in the least restrictive environment; one such approach is the Instructional Support Team (IST) which was the format used in the present investigation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIST was implemented in the Baltimore County, Maryland Public School System in 1998. The model in place parallels that developed for use in Pennsylvania in the early 1990s. The IST is intended to assist teachers in finding solutions to their challenges through classroom-based assessment and collaborative problem-solving to develop interventions.  If IST is to be successful, teachers must be willing to accept the interventions. However, it is often not known how teachers view the interventions they are asked to implement.  If teachers do not like the interventions, they are likely to implement them improperly or avoid them all together.\t\nThe purposes of the present study were to examine teacher ratings of intervention acceptability for interventions generated and then implemented as part of the IST process, determine what variables may affect acceptability ratings, and finally determine the best model to predict teacher ratings of intervention acceptability.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe participants in this investigation were regular education classroom teachers from kindergarten through fifth grade in Baltimore County, Maryland  Schools that have been designated as IST schools.   Teachers referred students for instructional support services via the established procedures at each school. IST meetings were held during which the presenting problem was reviewed, initial assessment data were presented, and interventions to address the problem were selected.  Teachers were asked to implement interventions for a period of least 30 days.  At or around the time of a review meeting held after the 30-day intervention period, teachers were asked to rate the intervention selected at the initial meeting using the Intervention Rating Profile-20 (IRP-20).  Supplemental questions were asked to allow teachers to rate additional variables related to providing the intervention.  Teachers rated the presenting problem for level of severity, skill, and the effectiveness of the intervention on six point scales.  Teachers also indicated the level of support they received to carry out interventions, the amount of time spent implementing the intervention each day, completed a demographic survey, indicated years teaching, and completed a scale to rate the level of implementation of the IST process in their school.\nRatings for academic and behavioral referrals were analyzed separately.  There was not a significant difference in teacher acceptability ratings for academic referrals compared to behavior referrals. For academic referrals, statistically significant relationships were found between the variable effectiveness, support, and level of implementation with the IST process and intervention acceptability. For behavior referrals, statistically significant relationships were found between the variables effectiveness and support and intervention acceptability. Multiple regression analysis was used to compare a series of increasingly complex prediction models with compact models to identify the model that was most parsimonious. For both academic and behavior referrals, the best model to predict intervention acceptability included the variables effectiveness of the intervention, support, and skill. Relationships between other variables and ratings of acceptability were less salient.\nGiven the current emphasis on pre referral services through the provisions of the No Child Left Behind legislation and the reauthorization of IDEA, it is important for schools to have effective and efficient models with which to service children who experience difficulty. If school-based teams are to be successful in addressing these needs, they must use effective models that are implemented correctly and provide interventions that teachers find acceptable and that are used with fidelity. Data from ecologically valid studies can guide schools in selecting and developing effective models and can identify variables that are related to high ratings of acceptability on the part of personnel who must implement them. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [349], "author_name_tesi": "Fleischer, Andrea H", "last_name_ssi": "Fleischer", "middle_name_ssi": "H", "first_name_ssi": "Andrea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "School Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Leroy French", "Robert Leslie Hale", "John T Neisworth", "James F Nolan Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Leroy French, Committee Chair", "Robert Leslie Hale, Committee Member", "John T Neisworth, Committee Member", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["teacher ratings", "intervention acceptability", "IST", "instructional support team", "prerferral intervention", "intervention acceptability"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Fruits and Vegetables in an Inner-City Head Start Center.", "id": "6364", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5566", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "   Early intervention is one of the most effective methods of creating or changing dietary patterns; yet, evidence on intervening efforts targeted toward low-income and African American preschoolers is limited.  These two groups, from the fetus through adulthood, endure a disproportionate risk of developing diet-related diseases and have a low intake of fruits and vegetables.  Head Start offers one avenue to assist low-income and African American populations in improving their dietary intake and it may, thereby, help reduce their disproportionate health burden.  The purpose of this exploratory, qualitative study is to: \n   1) explore the concepts, preference, availability, and dietary intake of fruits and \nvegetables in low-income, African American preschoolers who participate in an inner-city Head Start childcare center; \n   2) explore the concepts, preference, availability, and dietary intake of fruits and vegetables of the primary care providers (i.e. parents, grandparents, etc.) of the children studied under the first aim; and, \n   3) determine the level of shared meaning, preference, availability, and dietary intake of fruits and vegetables between the children studied under the first aim and both their primary care providers (studied under the second aim) and their childcare providers.  \nDesign and methods were informed by the Theory for the Ecology of Human Development, the Theory of Meaningful Learning, hypotheses generated by Achterberg, and the Ecological Model of Predictors of Childhood Overweight.  The study methodology involved direct observations from January\u2014August, 2002 of over six inner-city Head Start centers.  Methods included:  qualitative interviews (n=24 children, n=22 primary care providers, and n=2 childcare providers), preference ratings, descriptions of household availability, direct observations of the food served at the primary Head Start study center (n=77 days), mealtime observations, menu to actual food served comparisons, a child-feeding practices survey, and the National Cancer Institute Fruit and Vegetable Screener.  Concept maps were used to analyze the interview transcripts.  Statistical analyses aided in differentiating study participants and determining the correlation between concepts, preference, availability, and intake of fruits and vegetables within the sample.  \n   Some of the results indicate:  the children\u2019s average score for naming the foods was \n73-75%.  The children\u2019s concepts varied tremendously\u2014from almost none to some and often involved misconceptions such as \u201cvegetables do bad things to the body.\u201d  The children who were able to express their concepts of fruits and vegetables primarily discussed where, when, and how they ate fruits and vegetables, where fruits and vegetables came from, what fruits and vegetables could do for their body, and their preference for fruits and vegetables.  Preference ratings were positive with 80% of fruits and vegetables being rated as \u201cyummy.\u201d  Fruits were preferred.  The availability of fruits and vegetables in a child\u2019s household varied, especially for fresh produce.  Only six primary care providers reported having all the selected fruits and vegetables in their homes on a regular basis.  The estimated median daily servings of fruits and vegetables were 7.03 \nand ranged from 13.87 to 1.86.  Primary care providers also had a limited and varied understanding of fruits and vegetables with some misconceptions.  Preference ratings were positive (82%) and the estimated median daily servings of fruits and vegetables were 8.69 and ranged from 15.97 to 0.85.  Shared meaning and preference between children, primary care providers, and childcare providers in this study were minimal.  Availability and intake were related among children and also between children and primary care providers.  Child-feeding practices by both primary care providers and childcare providers included using food as a reward and portioning the children\u2019s food.  These results demonstrate that an inner-city Head Start center\u2019s children and primary care providers both had:  a varied understanding of fruits and vegetables with little meaning behind the concepts, a positive preference for fruits and vegetables, limited access to fruits and vegetables, and an intake of fruits and vegetables that varied.  Nonetheless, between these children, primary care providers, and childcare providers minimal common meaning occurred.  \n   These findings indicate that nutrition communication, education, and intervening efforts for populations like this low-income, inner-city, African American sample should focus on developing methods and mediums to increase nutrition knowledge on fruits and vegetables in children, primary care providers, and childcare providers.  Efforts should design mediums to facilitate similar dialogue and activities around fruits and vegetables in the home and childcare settings between these three groups.  Potential topics and aims about fruits and vegetables can include expressing preference; improving household, childcare center, and community availability; along with targeting messages to increase dietary intake.  Future research and theory should validate these findings in other samples and then should build off this work in order to learn how to effectively utilize Head Start\u2014its meals, educational curriculum, and interaction with primary care providers\u2014to promote healthy eating in at-risk populations and, in doing so, help reduce the risk of diet-related diseases prevalent in this population. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5557], "author_name_tesi": "Fleischhacker, Sheila Erin", "last_name_ssi": "Fleischhacker", "middle_name_ssi": "Erin", "first_name_ssi": "Sheila", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheryl Achterberg", "Leann L Birch", "Linda Burton", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Carla Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheryl Achterberg, Committee Chair", "Leann L Birch, Committee Member", "Linda Burton, Committee Member", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Carla Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Head Start", "childcare", "fruits and vegetables", "nutrition education", "preschoolers", "inner-city", "African Americans", "low-income"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Community Colleges in the Lives of Contemporary Youth: Educational Expansion, Steady Expectations, and Inter-institutional Attendance", "id": "18770", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8916", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Community colleges have changed notably over the past quarter century, as have the demographics and educational trajectories of the growing proportion of traditional-age college students who attend them at some point along their transition to adulthood. This dissertation extends the literature on how institutional attendance intersects with change and persistence in postsecondary educational expectations after high school in four key ways. First, I identify the key institutional trends at the heart of the current condition of the two-year sector. Understanding the changing macro-structural environment is a necessary first step in revisiting seminal works within the sociology of education, including Burton Clark\u2019s \u201ccooling out\u201d thesis (1960), Brint and Karabel\u2019s Diverted Dreams (1989), and Rosenbaum\u2019s critique of the \u201ccollege-for-all\u201d ethos (2001), all of which predict a downward leveling of ambition vis-\u00e0-vis the community college experience, though with varying levels of attention paid to the intersecting roles of institutions, families, and academic backgrounds. Next, I employ graphic, descriptive, and inferential logistic analysis to examine competing explanations about the mechanisms involved in the predicted downward leveling of ambition. How, if at all, do expectations change and what are the mechanisms at play for contemporary youth? Finally, special methodological attention is given to the implications of expanding our longitudinal frame, as well as to accounting for the growing complexity of institutional attendance patterns both within and between the two- and four-year sectors when answering this question. The term \u201cinter-institutional attendance\u201d is introduced to highlight this point. Results provide little support for Clark\u2019s cooling out thesis, some support for Brint and Karabel\u2019s diversion hypothesis in early adulthood although this disappears depending on how educational expectations are captured in late adulthood and on the comparisons made, and moderate support for Rosenbaum\u2019s \u201ccollege-for-all\u201d thesis, at least for those at the margins of changing expectations.  Instead, I find that the modal experience among contemporary youth is one of holding on to their bachelor\u2019s degree expectations, even beyond the normative college-going years. The implications of these findings for existing theory and research, as well as for the national College Completions Agenda are discussed, with special attention given to the development of a new theoretical framework for understanding the role of community colleges in the lives of contemporary youth.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8758], "author_name_tesi": "Fleishman, Shannon Smythe", "last_name_ssi": "Fleishman", "middle_name_ssi": "Smythe", "first_name_ssi": "Shannon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David P Baker", "David P Baker", "Jeremy Staff", "John Jesse Cheslock", "Leticia Oseguera"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David P Baker, Dissertation Advisor", "David P Baker, Committee Chair", "Jeremy Staff, Committee Member", "John Jesse Cheslock, Committee Member", "Leticia Oseguera, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["community colleges", "higher education", "college students", "youth", "educational expectations", "inter-institutional"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Autism and Sexuality: Self Advocates Focus Groups", "id": "27501", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12093", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Thirteen individuals who identified themselves as having ASD participated individually or in focus groups to ascertain their ideas about sexuality.

Microelectrode voltammetry revealed that applied magnetic fields did not effect particle diffusion.  \nAu particles were also subject to place exchange with \u00f9-bromo-functionalized thiol and the Br termini were subsequently converted to azides.  These were then reacted with a series of alkynyl-derivatized small molecules in nonpolar solutions which led to their attachment through the formation of a 1,2,3-triazole ring.  These click reactions were used to impart chemical functionality to the Au particles, which was assessed using fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.\nThe ability of electrostatically stabilized Au nanoparticles to selectively deposit onto amine-patterned glass substrates is lastly investigated.  In addition, the syntheses of several classes of noble metal particles again functionalized via place exchange were implicated for additional attachment chemistries.  Strategies aimed at directing the assembly of these particles to specific areas of patterned substrates were likewise investigated.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1301], "author_name_tesi": "Fleming, David Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Fleming", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Christine Dolan Keating", "William O Hancock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanoparticles", "colloid"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "INTERNATIONAL TRADE, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND POVERTY: THE ROLE OF PRODUCT TRADABILITY IN THE CHILEAN CASE\n\n", "id": "8721", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1314", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Globalization is an issue that during the last two decades has been a major topic of discussion by different actors in society. Questions have arisen about the impacts that an open economy has on the agriculture and poverty of developing countries. Is the internationalization of agriculture improving the efficiency of farmers in poor regions through international transfers and spillovers of technology and knowledge? Are local producers better off as a result of agricultural trade liberalization? Is poverty being affected by the internationalization of agriculture? This study attempts in some degree to answer these questions through the creation and analysis of an agricultural tradability index (TI), which measures the degree to which a country or an individual farm produces commodities that are internationally traded as opposed to commodities for which international trade is small. Using data from Chile three analyses are undertaken. First, a TI at the national level is constructed for 37 traditional and non-traditional crops, and its impact on corresponding yields for these crops is analyzed for the period 1991-2005. Results show that the TI is positively correlated with growth in crop yields. Second, the role of the TI at the farm level is analyzed. Using farm-level data from the 1997 Chilean agricultural census, a cross-sectional regression is used to evaluate the role that international agricultural trade\u2014measured by the farm-level TI\u2014has on yields of traditional crops (grains and beans are the main crops in the census for which farm-level yields are reported). In order to consider the trade structure of agriculture in Chile, this analysis is performed on two different groups of farms: 1) farms that produce exclusively traditional crops, which are heavily influenced by import trends; and 2) farms that in addition to producing traditional staples also produce non-traditional crops (especially fruits), which are more heavily exported. An endogenous switching regression model is used to predict which farms produce only traditional crops versus those that produce both traditional and non-traditional crops. The results indicate that, in general, farms with a higher TI have higher yields. Also, comparing the two groups of farms, those producing both traditional and non-traditional crops have a larger coefficient for the TI variable than farms producing only traditional crops. Third, the role of the TI at the community level is analyzed. Using data from different sources, a cross-sectional regression is done to evaluate the role that international agricultural trade\u2014measured by the community-level TI\u2014has on the poverty rate reported in Chilean communities. Including variables controlling for spatial dependence on poverty presence, results indicate that in general communities with a higher TI have less poverty. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1303], "author_name_tesi": "Fleming, David Alexander", "last_name_ssi": "Fleming", "middle_name_ssi": "Alexander", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Gerard Abler", "David Gerard Abler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Gerard Abler, Dissertation Advisor", "David Gerard Abler, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["agricultural productivity", "international trade", "poverty"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on Exogenous Shocks in Rural Areas: Land Conservation Policies and Natural Disasters\n", "id": "13764", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7439", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is composed of three different essays that use different methods, data and case studies. The three essays, respectively (as presented here), cover the analysis of a land based policy using regional level data in the US, the effect of social capital in post\u2013shock environments using community and household level data from Chile, and the use of experimental economics to evaluate individual behavioral changes after the 2010 earthquake in rural areas of Chile. Thus, even though this dissertation seeks to investigate three different topics, they merge in the main core of their purpose: the analysis of how exogenous shocks \u2013given in the essays by governmental and natural interventions\u2013  affect the economic structures of rural areas and human response. The focus of this dissertation is on how rural people respond to land conservation policies and the occurrence of natural disasters.  \nThe first essay investigates the slippage effects of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), an extensive agricultural land retirement effort implemented in the US during the last 25 years by the US Department of Agriculture. The main purpose of this land conservation program is to reduce soil erosion due to agricultural activity as well as other negative environmental impacts generated by crop production.  In terms of rural development, to study the objectives, functionality, and final outcomes of land based policies is highly relevant given that this exogenous intervention (if the policy comes from federal regulation) produces direct and indirect responses in the population living on and in the surroundings of retired land. In particular, the CRP generates multiple outcomes that have been widely investigated by academics; however, there is one important issue that has not being deeply researched and that deserves more attention in order to obtain a better understanding of the indirect outcomes of conservation programs in farmer decisions:  how land put under conservation affects the likelihood of land use conversion in non\u2013protected surrounding areas. This phenomena, denoted in the literature as land slippage effects, is understood as the conversion of non protected land to agriculture as consequence of other agricultural land being retired by the CRP. Based on past works of Wu (2000, 2005) and Robert & Bucholtz (2005, 2006), I analyze the slippage produced by this program using a data set that has not been much explored in empirical economic studies: satellite land cover change information from the US Geological Survey, aggregated at county level. The study area consists of 1,053 counties located in the Midwest states of the US. Results support the existence of slippage effects from the CRP, but they are more conservative than the ones found by Wu (2000). The evidence of slippage provided here is important information for planners, given that whether and how the CRP affects land use decisions in surrounding areas is key information for implementing conservation efforts more efficiently. \nThe second essay analyzes another kind of shock that affect the economic structures of rural (and non\u2013rural) areas: natural disasters. After the occurrence of natural disasters rural households may opt for one of more coping strategies to recover pre-shock welfare levels. Although previous economic researches have analyzed factors influencing household  decisions regarding coping strategies, none have analyzed the role that social capital may play in the access and use of coping strategies by households in areas affected by natural disasters. This research, using data from surveys implemented in households of rural villages severely affected by the 2010 Chilean earthquake, investigates this issue by analyzing the incidence of different types of social capital over the probability that a household face for accessing and using a particular coping strategies. Results show that, after controlling for household characteristics and the damages that these suffered from the earthquake, social capital does matter for the accessibility and use of diverse sources of help and recovery. Results are relevant for planers aimed to recover regions after natural disasters, and complement former empirical works that have shown that social capital is a critical factor to promote economic growth.\nThe third essay follows the line of research of the second proposal in geographic scope and shock event: the case of rural areas in Chile that were affected by the 2010 earthquake. However, the difference is that in this essay, behavioral economics is the main focus. Peoples\u2019 behavior in the aftermath of natural disasters may depend critically on various conditions. In this paper we postulate three conditions, likely to occur after massive natural disasters, that can adversely affect the trusting behavior of people within communities: rivalry for scarce relief and recovery recourses, incremental information asymmetries between agents (what we call aftermath moral hazard) that provides excuses to break previously established social contracts, and migration or social displacement of people. To investigate these issues a series of trust games were conducted in Chile to analyze whether the 2010 earthquake affected the trust and trustworthiness of villagers in rural areas. Experiments were conducted one year after the occurrence of the earthquake in a group of villages severely affected by this disaster and in a group of villages that were not affected (villages that serve as control group). Game outcomes and additional socioeconomic data collected through surveys are compared and analyzed using statistical tests and regressions. We find that trust levels (and most socioeconomic characteristics of participants) are not statistically different between groups. However, we find that trustworthiness levels of people in the affected villages are lower than levels observed in the control villages, supporting our hypothesis that aftermath conditions can negatively affect trusting behavior. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7384], "author_name_tesi": "Fleming, David Alexander", "last_name_ssi": "Fleming", "middle_name_ssi": "Alexander", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Gerard Abler", "David Gerard Abler", "Stephan J Goetz", "Jill Leslie Findeis", "Gary E Bolton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Gerard Abler, Dissertation Advisor", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Chair", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Member", "Jill Leslie Findeis, Committee Member", "Gary E Bolton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Land policy", "Natural Disasters", "Chile", "Trust", "Social Capital"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Psychophysical, Physiological, and Semantic Characterization of Oral Astringents ", "id": "24906", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11120", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The American Society for Testing and Materials defines astringency as \u2018the complex of sensations due to shrinking, drawing, or puckering of the epithelium as a result of exposure to substances such as alums or tannins.\u2019 While a salient attribute in a wide range of food products, such as tea, coffee, red wine, and a variety of berries, nuts, and fruits, this percept remains poorly understood. The present studies aim to address and provide insight into the semantic, psychophysical, physiological issues related to oral astringency. Regarding physiological aspects of the percept, salivary precipitation index (SPI), an in vitro method for estimating individual differences oral astringency, generalized to both a polyphenol and multivalent salt.

Creativity as a concept is complex, and as such, difficult to pinpoint.  It is believed to be a combination of interacting phenomenon, including cognitive, affective, and meaning making processes.  While much about creativity has been studied from a cognitive perspective, what is known about the role of affect is still clouded.  \n\nFrom a practical perspective, organizations are still searching for ways to effectively foster creativity in the workplace.  One of those ways that has found some success is viewing creativity as a learning process, and investing in facilitators who can help employees learn and practice creativity.

To what extent emotion influences this learning process, and how facilitators may or may not use it, is not fully understood.\n\nThis study views creativity at work through an affective lens; and uses a qualitative methodology to better understand how emotion influences facilitation of the learning of creative process.

This required the development of wind tunnel testing and processing procedures. Two wind turbines were studied throughout the course of this project; the Sunforce 400 Watt turbine and the All Power 400 Watt turbine.  The blades of each turbine were mounted and tested on both generators; however the All Power generator data was removed from this report due to problems discovered with the generator itself. The Academic Projects Building 3.5'x5' wind tunnel was used to test the full scale models of both turbines. The Hammond Building benchtop dynamometer facility was used to determine the efficiency of the Sunforce generator.  The Hammond Building 3'x2' wind tunnel was used to determine the sectional lift characteristics of the Sunforce blades. When the full scale model was tested the current, voltage, and rotor rotational speed were monitored along with the dynamic pressure in the wind tunnel at multiple locations and the thrust force of the wind exerted on the turbine. The wind tunnel air velocity was corrected for blockage using a conservative estimate of the influence of the rotating blades based on a Betz optimum turbine of the same size. The dynamometer tested the efficiency of the generator so that a realistic aerodynamic performance of the blades could be determined.  The efficiency depends on the rotational speed of the rotor so an equation was developed to correct the power according to rotational speed. The power was then compared to that produced by the Wind Turbine Performance (WTPerf) code written and distributed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  The code predicts results that were slightly higher than experimentally determined with a maximum power around 1200 Watts at 17 m/s. Instead the turbine blades only produced a maximum power of around 850 Watts which occurred around 15 m/s.  The speed controller inside the turbine prevented the blades from rotating above wind speeds of 15 m/s.  Understanding that the 400 Watt rating was done without considering the losses through the generator, and corresponds to a design speed of only 14 m/s, the results of this study compared remarkably well with what would be expected. Furthermore, the predicted and experimental data agreed almost perfectly for a range of velocities from 0 to 12 m/s. At higher velocities, it was observed that the speed controller again slowed down the turbine, thus degrading the output performance. As a final element of this project, the measured sectional aerodynamic properties of an individual wind turbine blade were compared to predictions from XFoil for a range of angles of attack from -4 to 18 degrees. The results showed reasonable agreement in the mid- range angles of attack but at the lower and higher extremes there was as much as a 20% difference between Xfoil and experimental results.

Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have emerged as potent modulators of metabolic and immune processes, which has to led to their increased use as a potential therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory conditions.  Mechanisms underlying the immunometabolic effects of EPA and DHA are multifaceted and require further investigation.  Questions regarding the appropriate dose, form, and delivery of n-3 PUFA need to be examined in order to provide effective n-3 PUFA recommendations for individuals seeking approaches to ameliorate inflammation and/or support immune health. \nThe objective of the first study was to model the incorporation of supplemental EPA+DHA intakes within dietary ranges into red blood cell (RBC) membranes of healthy adults, and identify factors that modify this response.  This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study conducted in 125 healthy adults comparing 0, 300, 600, 900, and 1,800 mg/d of EPA+DHA given as fish oil supplements for approximately 5 months.  The RBC membrane content of EPA+DHA (Omega-3 Index [O3I]) increased in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.0001), with the dose of EPA+DHA alone accounting for 68% (quadratic, p<0.0001) of the variability in response.  Dose adjusted per unit body weight accounted for 70% (linear, p<0.0001) of the change.  Additional factors that improved prediction of treatment response were baseline O3I, age, sex, and physical activity. Collectively, these explained 78% of the response variability (p<0.0001).   \nThe objective of the second study was to determine the effects of supplemental EPA+DHA on serum inflammatory marker concentrations (i.e., TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and CRP) in healthy adults, and secondly, to evaluate the associations between RBC membrane fatty acid content and inflammatory markers.  There were no significant differences in IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 or CRP concentrations between the 5 groups following supplementation; however, a marginally significant treatment effect on TNF-\u03b1 was observed (p<0.08). Higher quartiles of DHA content in RBC membranes were associated with lower TNF-\u03b1 at baseline (p = 0.001), whereas the lowest quartile of docosapenatenoic acid (DPA) content had significantly higher CRP (p<0.001). Increased arachidonic acid (AA) content was associated with higher TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 (p<0.05); however, increased linoleic acid (LA) content was associated with lower IL-6 (p<0.05). There were no significant associations between changes in RBC content of n-3 or n-6 PUFA and changes in inflammatory marker concentrations.  Our findings indicate that EPA+DHA intake, across a range of nutritionally-achievable doses, has no dose-response effect on circulating TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, or CRP in healthy adults after 5 months of supplementation.  However, observed baseline associations warrant further investigation.  \nThe objective of the third study was to evaluate changes in gene expression following a low-dose in vivo  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in healthy adult men, and secondly, to explore the relationship between subject characteristics, RBC fatty acids, and gene expression.  Eight healthy adult males with diverse O3I profiles were intravenously administered sterile protein-free LPS (0.6 ng/kg body weight).  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected at 0, 2, 4, and 24 hours post-LPS injection were assessed for changes in inflammatory gene expression.  Increased pro-inflammatory gene expression occurred 2 hours after LPS administration, whereas anti-inflammatory gene expression increased at 4 hours.  RBC content of docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), but not EPA or DHA, was associated with increased IL-1\u03b2 expression at 4 hours as well as larger reductions in IL-1\u03b2 expression between the 4 and 24 hour time points (p<0.01). \nIn conclusion, consuming EPA+DHA in the form of fish oil supplementation dose-dependently increases the O3I and several factors in addition to dose (i.e., body weight, baseline O3I, age, physical activity, and sex) further explained the variability in O3I response.  These results can be used to estimate an individual\u2019s required supplemental intake for achieving target cell membrane levels of n-3 PUFA.  Higher intakes of EPA+DHA (i.e., \u22651,800 mg/d) and increased cell membrane content of n-3 PUFA may provide anti-inflammatory benefits as evident by lower circulating inflammatory markers; however, additional clinical studies are needed to assess the effect of higher cell membrane content of n-3 PUFA, including DPA, on inflammatory responses.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9371], "author_name_tesi": "Flock, Michael Ryan", "last_name_ssi": "Flock", "middle_name_ssi": "Ryan", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Michael Henry Green", "Trent L Gaugler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Dissertation Advisor", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member", "Michael Henry Green, Committee Member", "Trent L Gaugler, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nutrition", "omega-3 fatty acids", "red blood cells", "inflammation", "cardiovascular disease", "immunometabolism", "immunology"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INTERPRETING DOUBLE-PEAKED EMISSION LINE\nPROFILE VARIABILITY IN AGNS USING MODELS FOR ACCRETION DISK STRUCTURES\n\n\n\n", "id": "9233", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2228", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A subset of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) have broad, double-peaked Balmer emission lines, regarded as the best kinematic evidence for the production of broad lines by the accretion disk. It has been suggested that double-peaked emitters have a weak or non-existent disk-wind, hence offering a direct view of the accretion disk. The variability of the double-peaked line profile, which is uncorrelated with variations of the continuum flux, then traces changes in the structure of the accretion disk. In this thesis, we use the double-peaked line profile variability to probe the accretion disk structure, and we\ndemonstrate that the double-peaked emitters are connected to the whole population of AGNs, allowing us to generalize those results.\nA set of 30 double-peaked emitters has been monitored for nearly a decade in order to observe long-term profile variability. We present the line profile variability for 10 of these objects and find only short-lived perturbations to the line profile. We find a potential anti-correlation between the amplitude of the line profile variability and the mass of the central supermassive black hole. This anti-correlation could be the result of an observational bias since the most massive objects were not monitored for a complete dynamical timescale. We suggest strategies to confirm the presence of this anti-correlation.\nThe short-timescale variability of the double-peaked line profiles cannot be explained by global perturbations in the accretion disk, which can only explain the long-term variability of some objects. We develop a stochastically perturbed accretion disk model and compare the simulated line profile variations with the variability observed for the two best monitored AGNs: Arp 102B and 3C 390.3. We are able to constrain some properties of the perturbations. For Arp 102B in particular, the perturbations\nmust be located primarily in the outer part of the line-emitting region and the transition\nradius for the perturbations is consistent with the radius of marginal self-gravity of the\naccretion disk. This supports the hypothesis of clump production in the accretion disk\ndue to self-gravity.\nIt has been suggested that the double-peaked line profile can be significantly altered by radiative transfer effects through a disk-wind, producing a single-peaked emission line. We confirm this theory and explore the range of parameters that best reproduce the observed single-peaked line profiles. The resulting single-peaked line profiles are primarily sensitive to the velocity field and optical depth of the disk wind and to the size of the line-emitting region of the accretion disk. For most single-peaked lines to be as cuspy as observed, a large outer radius of the line-emitting region is required, much larger\nthan what is obtained from fits to double-peaked line profiles. This suggests that the optically thick wind can scatter more ionizing photons towards the disk, increasing the size of the line emitting region of single-peaked emitters. Finally, we add perturbations in the disk-wind and the accretion disk to test whether the presence of the wind changes the character of the line profile variability. We find that a rotating filament in the disk-wind can produce a variability pattern uncharacteristic of a rotating perturbation, that is often observed in double-peaked emitters.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2209], "author_name_tesi": "Flohic, Helene Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Flohic", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Helene", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Eracleous", "Stephane Coutu", "Mercedes Richards", "Steinn Sigurdsson", "Richard Alan Wade", "Donald P Schneider"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Eracleous, Committee Chair", "Stephane Coutu, Committee Member", "Mercedes Richards, Committee Member", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Wade, Committee Member", "Donald P Schneider, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["AGNs", "accretion disk"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "COMMUNICATING FUTURE SCENARIOS: DEVELOPING AN INTERACTIVE, PARTICIPATORY INTERNET-BASED TOOL FOR ECOLOGICAL PLANNING\n\n", "id": "11517", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6218", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sprawl development in the United States is linked to a variety of environmental issues,\nincluding impacts to water, soil and air quality; loss of prime agricultural farmland; and\nindirectly to climate change.

In\naddition, new technologies have helped to research, analyze, and design these\ncommunities. Yet sprawl remains a significant issue in the United States. I believe that\npart of the problem is that while the tools, techniques, and principles have changed\nregarding the plan and design of residential communities, the way in which we\ncommunicate these changes has not transformed in equal measure. People are willing\nto choose alternatives to sprawl if given the choice and provided with accurate and\nunderstandable information about their communities. Current learning theory provides\nnumerous genres of research that can provide a theoretical framework for landscape\narchitectural communication to enhance the communication of ecological planning\nprinciples.\n\nCertain genres within learning theory advocate for a more collaborative and interactive\napproach, which can be built by modern technology to delve deeper into complex issues\nthrough \u2018real-world\u2019 simulations. The majority of landscape architects, local\ngovernments, and planners continue to present or communicate designs with static\nboards, reports, websites, and presentations. Some municipalities and researchers\nhave begun to incorporate new technologies in order to apply a more \u201clearning theory\u201d-\ncentered approach to planning, but the applications of these efforts are limited and often\nresult in new complications to the process.\n\nThis research reports on and reviews an adaptive approach to community design and\nplanning emphasizing clear communication of ecological design and planning issues in\nrural communities. Moreover, this approach relies on interactive internet-based\ntechnologies. Considering the quantity of information on the Internet, it is important to\nunderstand what types of content are necessary to provide the best value in\ncomprehending the complex issues that face these communities.\n\nThe primary purpose of this thesis is twofold:\n\u2022 To create an interactive, three-dimensional Web 2.0 tool based on ecological\nplanning principles; and,\n\u2022 To document the benefits and drawbacks of each step of the process so that\nfuture research can refine the process and create tools for user group testing.\n\nUltimately, this thesis is designed to start the discussion about how landscape architects\ncan better communicate the principles of ecological planning in an effort to minimize\nsprawl in a rural context. To put this in context, I focus on the Big Hollow Drainage-way.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6209], "author_name_tesi": "Flohr, Travis Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Flohr", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Travis", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Landscape Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Timothy Murtha Jr", "Timothy Murtha, Ph D", "Brian A Orland", "Kenneth Tamminga", "Douglas Alan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Timothy Murtha Jr, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy Murtha, Ph D, Thesis Advisor", "Brian A Orland, Thesis Advisor", "Kenneth Tamminga, Thesis Advisor", "Douglas Alan Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ecological Planning", "Web 2.0", "Landscape Architecture", "Communication Techniques", "Sprawl", "Sustainability"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "System for Bronchoscope Video-Distortion Correction", "id": "8804", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "668", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many methods for endoscope calibration have been proposed.

Several dietary factors that have been suggested to affect energy intake and weight status, including the form of food (i.e. solid, puree, or liquid). However, the literature on this topic is mixed, and more work is needed to test how the form of food influences satiety. A series of studies was developed to further examine how beverages, soup, and different forms of fruit affect energy intake and satiety. The findings from these experiments provide additional insight into the relationship between different forms of food and energy intake and satiety, and how consuming different forms of food can be used to manage energy intake.\nStudy 1 examined the impact of increasing beverage portion size on beverage and food intake. In a cross-over design, 33 subjects, 18 women and 15 men consumed lunch in the laboratory once a week for six weeks. At each test lunch, the same foods were served, but the beverage served was varied in type (cola, diet cola, or water) and portion size (360 g/12 fl. oz or 540 g/18 fl. oz). Increasing beverage portion size significantly increased the weight of beverage consumed, regardless of the type of beverage served (p<0.05). As a consequence, for the caloric beverage, energy intake from the beverage increased by 10% for women and 26% for men when there was a 50% increase in the portion served (p<0.01). Food intake did not differ between conditions, thus when the energy from the caloric beverage was added to the energy from food, total energy intake at lunch was significantly increased (p<0.001) compared to the non-caloric beverages. \nStudy 2 tested the effects on meal intake of consuming different forms of soup as a preload: broth and vegetables served separately, chunky vegetable soup, chunky-pureed vegetable soup, or pureed vegetable soup. Normal-weight men and women (n = 60) came to the laboratory for lunch once a week for five weeks. Each week, one of four compulsory preloads, or no preload, was consumed prior to lunch. A test meal was consumed ad libitum 15 min after the soup was served. Results showed that consuming soup significantly reduced test meal intake and total meal energy intake (preload + test meal) compared to having no soup. When soup was consumed, subjects reduced meal energy intake by 20% (134\u00b125 kcal; 561\u00b1105 kJ). The type of soup had no significant effect on test meal intake or total meal energy intake. \nStudy 3 tested how consuming preloads of apple, applesauce, and apple juice with and without fiber affect energy intake and satiety. Adults (n=58) ate breakfast and lunch in the laboratory once a week for 5 weeks. Before lunch, one of 4 preloads (152 kcal, 266 g), or no preload (control), was served. Apple (peeled segments), applesauce, and apple juice with pectin had similar fiber contents. An entr\u00e9e was consumed ad libitum 15 min after the preload was served. All preloads reduced entr\u00e9e intake compared to control (p<0.0001). Apple reduced total energy intake (preload + lunch) and increased satiety (fullness) ratings compared to all other preloads and control (p<0.0001). Eating apple segments reduced total energy intake by 164\u00b136 kcal (12%) compared to control. Applesauce reduced total energy intake and increased satiety ratings compared to apple juice (p<0.02). Intakes did not differ following the juice preloads. \nThe findings from these three studies suggest that varying the form of food can affect energy intake and satiety at a meal. While beverages and soup are both considered to be liquids, they seem to affect energy intake and satiety differently. Beverages have a low satiating capacity and consuming caloric beverages with meals could increase energy intake. Conversely, soup tends to be highly satiating, and energy intake can be reduced by consuming various types of low-energy-dense soup as a first course. It is also likely that solid food can be more satiating than beverages. These results suggest several dietary strategies that can be used to decrease energy intake and enhance satiety at meals, 1) consume low-calorie or non-caloric beverages with meals, 2) choose smaller portions of caloric beverages, and 3) consume low-energy-dense soup or fruit as a first course. Using these strategies on a regular basis may assist with the prevention and management of overweight and obesity. \n \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2647], "author_name_tesi": "Flood, Julie Elisabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Flood", "middle_name_ssi": "Elisabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Julie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Jean Rolls", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Cynthia Bartok", "Laura Klein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Jean Rolls, Committee Chair", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Cynthia Bartok, Committee Member", "Laura Klein, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["satiety", "energy intake", "form of food", "obesity"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "THE IMPACT OF CONSUMERS' PERCEPTIONS OF AND PREFERENCES FOR CHANNEL INTERACTIVITY ON CHANNEL PREFERENCES", "id": "6332", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "852", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The interactivity of the Internet drives many companies to develop on-line stores that compete with their and others' off-line stores. However, in on-line stores consumers may experience different types of interactivity compared to off-line stores. Therefore, the first question we address is \"what do we mean by channel interactivity?\" as different types of interactivity are present in on-line and off-line channels. With respect to interactivity, disciplines outside of marketing have recognized three types of interactivity: human, message, and medium. The object interaction literature and marketing channel research also suggests the importance of product interactivity. We developed a concept of channel interactivity that includes four types of interactivity called the four-part typology of channel interactivity. In developing the typology we synthesized the interactivity literature, object interaction literature, and marketing channel research. Based on our typology, the second question we address is: \"when and why do consumers prefer some channel interactivities over others?\" In addressing this question we identify two antecedents, shopping motives and product type, that should impact consumers' preferences for the four types of channel interactivities. The third question we address is: \"do perceptions of and preferences for channel interactivities impact preference for different channels?\" This question focuses on the consequences of channel interactivity. To summarize, we developed a framework of channel preferences, which allows us to examine perceptions of and preferences for the four types of channel interactivity. Two stages of data collection were administered to assess the typology of channel interactivity and channel preference framework. In the first stage face-to-face interviews and a survey were conducted. In the second stage two experiments were administered. The results indicate that consumers do perceive channels to differ in terms of the four types of channel interactivity. Also, we demonstrated that shopping motive and product type impact consumers' preferences for the four types of channel interactivity.

At deep-sea hydrothermal vents, organisms can be exposed to fluctuating environmental conditions. One of the best-studied animals in these environments is the tubeworm, Riftia pachyptila. This tubeworm has extracellular hemoglobins (Hbs) that bind and transport oxygen and sulfide to chemoautotrophic endosymbionts deep within the worm. The symbionts, in-turn, oxidize sulfide and provide nutrition for the worm via carbon fixation. Despite extensive studies on R. pachyptila, little is known about the ability of tubeworms to adapt to alterations in environmental conditions. The hydrothermal vent tubeworm Ridgeia piscesae is exposed to different environmental conditions along the Juan de Fuca Ridge. This study began by investigating the structure of the coelomic fluid 400-kDa Hb from R. pachyptila. From this structure it was determined that this Hb assembles into a hollow sphere, unique among Hb structures. In addition, it was shown that zinc ions, discovered during the structural analysis, are the site of sulfide binding in vestimentiferan Hbs. This contradicts a previous finding that only cysteine amino acid residues bound sulfide in these Hbs. Following this work, the structures of the Hbs from R. pachyptila were compared to the structures of the Hbs from two environmental phenotypes of R. piscesae. It was determined that the Hbs from these two species are composed of subunits with similar masses that have relatively conserved polypeptide sequences (based on cysteine content). Comparison of homologous Hbs between R. piscesae phenotypes also found no structural differences. It was previously reported that there are three distinct Hbs distributed between the vascular blood and coelomic fluid of tubeworms. The data collected for this dissertation contradict that finding and suggest that there are structurally only two Hbs in each species. In the final study, the gas transfer systems were compared between the R. piscesae phenotypes. The mass-specific surface areas and diffusion distances of the gas exchange organs are different. These differences coupled with differences in environmental gradients should lead to very different gas diffusion rates. Differences in Hb concentration and distribution between the phenotypes were also found and may indicate different gas exchange strategies between the phenotypes.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2671], "author_name_tesi": "Flores, Jason Francisco", "last_name_ssi": "Flores", "middle_name_ssi": "Francisco", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "James Harold Marden", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Juliette Lecomte", "A Daniel Jones", "Fran\u00e7ois Lallier", "William Royer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Chair", "James Harold Marden, Committee Member", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member", "Juliette Lecomte, Committee Member", "A Daniel Jones, Committee Member", "Fran\u00e7ois Lallier, Committee Member", "William Royer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["physiology", "marine biology", "hydrogen sulfide", "respiration"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A STRATEGY OF POWER RELATIONS FOR RACIALLY DIVERSE PUBLIC RELATIONS PRACTITIONERS", "id": "13840jzf5408", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13840", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The public relations industry, an industry comprised of mostly Caucasian practitioners, is suffering from a clear lack of racial and ethnic diversification.

Some were pronounced dead after the 1940s. \n\nThrough the analysis of 4 novels of the \u201csegunda novela de la Revoluci\u00f3n;\u201d namely Before the Storm (1947) by Agust\u00edn Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, Pedro P\u00e1ramo (1955) by Juan Rulfo, The Death of Artemio Cruz (1962) by Carlos Fuentes, and Recollections of Things to Come (1963) by Elena Garro, I aim to answer the following question: not whether there was still some life that could be prophesized after the death of the Revolution, but rather if there had actually been life before that apparent death.\n\nTheoretically, to address the stagnant death prevalent in Mexico, I start from a detail left unarticulated by Joseph Sommers in After the Storm: Landmarks of the Modern Mexican Novel (1968). In this landmark work, Sommers pointed out that the second novels of the Revolution after Before the Storm of 1947, introduce psychological depth and \u201cthemes of love.\u201d In relation to the latter, I argue that they shed light on the secular, rhetorical discourse of the ruling P.R.I. (which, predictably, was not going to acknowledge the death of the Revolution). In 1942, President Manuel Avila Camacho gave a speech defending love as a necessary tool for the national construction. \n\nFrom all the above, I bring up the first and main issue organizing my project, a fundamental dynamic which began in the 1940s: the un-discussable death of the Revolution and its goals could be addressed mostly literarily, and indirectly, as a stagnant death; that is, in terms of past, present, and future frustrations of love. This dynamic is markedly different from the one of the \u201cfirst generation\u201d of the novelas de la revoluci\u00f3n, and raises the second main issue I explore: how far can this sublimation of the death of the Revolution extend sustainably? \nCritically informed by Frantz Fanon and Michel Foucault, the \u201csegunda novela de la Revoluci\u00f3n,\u201d featuring these \u201cthemes of (frustrated) love,\u201d comprises the core of my dissertation to elucidate Mexican neocolonialism and the latest defense of love in 1942 by the declining P.R.I. \u201cbefore\u201d the death of the Mexican Revolution. \n\nThis situation ultimately addresses the theme of lifelessness in the cultural discourse beginning not only in the 1940s, but mainly in the overall history of Mexico, marked by the circular return of violence and the triumph of Evil that prevents the materialization of a \u201cnew man.\u201d\n\n\u201cAl filo del agua (1947) de Agust\u00edn Y\u00e1\u00f1ez o las estrategias de supervivencia de la Revoluci\u00f3n Mexicana.\u201d This chapter is a good arena to explore all the above: what kind of life or love was there anytime and anywhere in Mexico, traditionally characterized by what the nineteenth-century historian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luis Mora Lamadrid called \u201cesprit de corps.\u201d Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\u2019s novel addresses not the defense of love, but rather the danger of its impossibility that ultimately leads to violence and hysteria. Relying on Frantz Fanon\u2019s The Wretched of the Earth (1963), I study the desperation of the Ancient Regime to hold on to (neo)colonial power by imposing fears and myths, which ultimately magnifies the irrational libido of the \u201cnatives.\u201d The end of the novel portrays the declining \u201csettlers\u201d facing their own fears or myth and, by extension, their own failure of the libido. This type of self-consciousness finally brings some melancholic peace to the main character of the novel: the priest Don Dionisio. \n\nCuriously enough, Ya\u00f1ez found inspiration for this first novel in Gabriel Faure\u00b4s Requiem, which I use as the thematic thread in my dissertation to articulate my thesis on this contradictory calm or death before/overlapping with the lack of Freedom and the death of the Revolution after 1940s. \n\n\u201cPedro P\u00e1ramo (1955) de Juan Rulfo o m\u00e1s valer no haber nacido.\u201d Rulfo\u2019s novel continues addressing this sublimated death by exploring the cultural memory of Mexico\u2019s \u201ccaudillos.\u201d In Pedro P\u00e1ramo, it is marked by a futile search for love, which in turn is linked to death. Here, I return to Avila Camacho\u2019s defense of love as part of the political sway to the right during his presidency, which was characterized by the rapprochement of left-leaning Mexico towards the United States in the capitalistic sphere, especially in the context of the Second World War. In this chapter, I invoke as a thematic touchstone a Hollywood movie of the 1940s: Frank Capra\u2019s It\u2019s a Wonderful Life (1946). This film, featuring George Bailey\u2019s recovery of the memory of his life and loves thanks to Divine Providence, results in a reaffirmation and love of the community. This stands in diametrical contrast to Juan Preciado in Pedro P\u00e1ramo, who also engages in a return to memory, but in his case this leads to impossible love, Evil, and death.\n\n\u201cLa muerte de Artemio Cruz (1962) de Carlos Fuentes o laa memoria del deseo (in)satisfecho.\u201d Here I explore what Fuentes called \u201cthe death of life,\u201d which runs parallel to \u201cthe life of death\u201d of his novella \u201cAura,\u201d published the same year. Relying on Foucault\u2019s History of Sexuality I (1976), I approach this novel as a deathbed confession. Via this triple-voiced declaration of guilt, the character of Artemio Cruz finally discovers and begins to admit that his life and his identity (and by extension Mexico\u2019s) were determined by exactly the same oppressive powers that (t)he(y) opposed from an early age. To articulate this position, I rely on careful close readings of the dates given in the sections narrated in third person. There is a hidden correspondence, I argue, between the events set in 1903 and those of 1503 during the Spanish Conquest, with overall implications for the history of Mexico.\n\n\u201cLos recuerdos del porvenir (1963) de Elena Garro o m\u00edrame antes de quedar convertida en piedra.\u201d In the last chapter I also emphasize the second issue of my dissertation, regarding how far the sublimation of the death of the Revolution can extend sustainably. Particularly, I explore the historical reach of this sublimation: how far does it go into the past, marked by identity-building confessional practices? Here I rely on Elena Garro\u2019s novel, set during the \u201crevuelta cristera,\u201d as the final awareness of two warring sides trapped in a historical continuum of violence, repression, alienation, and \u201cotherness.\u201d Ultimately, the characters of Garro\u2019s novel find out that they cannot dispose of the libido or their overall status as colonized subjects in search for self-recognition through love. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7626], "author_name_tesi": "Flores-portero, Luis ", "last_name_ssi": "Flores-portero", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Luis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Andres Ochoa", "Nicolas L Fernandez Medina", "Guadalupe Mart\u00ed Pe\u00f1a", "Stephen Wheeler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Andres Ochoa, Dissertation Advisor", "Nicolas L Fernandez Medina, Committee Member", "Guadalupe Mart\u00ed Pe\u00f1a, Committee Member", "Stephen Wheeler, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mexican Revolution", "politics", "literature", "Eros", "Tanatos", "neocolonialism"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Improving plant propagation through the manipulation of the genetic and physical environment\n", "id": "26543", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11393", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sustaining the increasing global population poses a daunting challenge. As food demands increase, we need to produce better plants while consuming fewer resources. The \u201cproducing more with less\u201d dilemma makes this problem very hard to address. Fortunately, over the last several decades, scientists have been developing elite varieties of plants that are higher yielding, drought tolerant, and resistant to pathogens. The discovery and generation of these elite varieties are only a part of the solution. Producing these superior plants at the scale needed to meet the growing demand also presents another challenge. The processes of plant propagation has some inherent problems: The process is long and laborious; the end product is of low monetary value; and traditional methods could give rise to genetic heterogeneity, which results in loss of desired plant characteristics. \n\tTo deal with these obstacles, new micropropagation techniques have been developed to make plant propagation more efficient. However, these techniques are not universal for all plant species and require a considerable amount of time to develop. In some cases, the method has to be optimized for different genotypes of the same specie. These techniques can also result in a decrease in plant quality, particularly, poor development which leads to low conversion rates. This dissertation will suggest a novel genetic approach to improve plant propagation by understanding the important factors that control plant production and development. To test this strategy, Theobroma cacao (the tree that gives us chocolate) was used as a plant model. Finally, from an engineering point of view, a novel bioreactor design was developed as a way to make the process more efficient by increasing yield/quality and lowering costs by automation and scale-up.\n\nThe work of this dissertation is summarized: \n\u2022\tA whole genome microarray was used to study zygotic and somatic embryogenesis (SE) to understand the poor conversion rates in cacao somatic embryogenesis.\n\u2022\tA set of biomarkers was identified to help study the process of somatic embryogenesis in cacao. \n\u2022\tA novel strategy based on transient expression of a transcription factor was developed and demonstrated to improve embryo productivity in cacao. \n\u2022\tAn inducible system that initiates SE based on gene overexpression was developed to help study the process of SE as well as help further research with cacao.\n\u2022\tA novel low-cost temporary immersion bioreactor (TIB) was designed to overcome mass transfer limitations and shear sensitivity while, reducing costs by using gravity driven liquid flow. This allowed the decoupling of gas and liquid flow and translates to significant savings in gas consumption and better manipulation of the physical environment.  \n\u2022\tThe versatility of the TIB was demonstrated by improving heterotrophic and photoautotrophic growth in Nictoiana benthamiana and watermelon, respectively. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10915], "author_name_tesi": "Florez, Sergio L", "last_name_ssi": "Florez", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Sergio", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis", "Wayne Roger Curtis", "Mark Guiltinan", "Andrew Zydney", "Esther Winter Gomez", "Siela Maximova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis, Dissertation Advisor", "Wayne Roger Curtis, Committee Chair", "Mark Guiltinan, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member", "Esther Winter Gomez, Committee Member", "Siela Maximova, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Somatic Embryogenesis", "Temporary Immersion Bioreactor", "Cacao", "Transient Expression"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Nutritional Modulation of Blood Pressure Regulation by the Autonomic Nervous System\n\n", "id": "7749", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2928", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cardiovascular function is modulated by changes in caloric intake and by metabolic factors in plasma such as free fatty acids (FFA).  However, the mechanisms underlying the associated cardiovascular responses are unclear.  The purpose of this series of experiments was to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the altered control of blood pressure (BP) resulting from caloric/fat restriction and elevated FFA concentrations.\nIn the first study we investigated the impact of caloric restriction (CR) on cardiovascular function.  Astronauts consume fewer calories during spaceflight and return to earth with an increased risk of orthostatic intolerance.  Whether a caloric deficiency modifies orthostatic responses is not understood.  Thus, we determined the effects of a hypocaloric diet (25% CR) during 6\u00b0 head down bedrest (BR; an analog of spaceflight) on autonomic neural control during lower body negative pressure (LBNP).  Nine healthy young men participated in a randomized crossover BR study, consisting of four (2 weeks each) interventions (normocaloric BR (NB), normocaloric ambulatory (NA), hypocaloric BR (HB), hypocaloric ambulatory (HA)), each separated by 5 months.  Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), heart rate (HR), and arterial pressure were recorded before, during, and after 3 consecutive stages (7 min each) of LBNP (-15, -30, -45 mmHg).  Caloric and posture effects were compared using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures.  Both BR and CR were associated with lower systolic BP during LBNP (p<.01); however, HR responses were directionally opposite (i.e., increase with BR, decrease with CR).  Survival analysis revealed a significant reduction in orthostatic tolerance (OT) following CR (p=0.03).  Caloric restriction modifies autonomic responses to LBNP, which may decrease OT after spaceflight. \n  The second study employing combinations of BR and CR tested the hypothesis that a caloric deficit diminishes the pressor response to static exercise and noxious cold stress.  Nine healthy young men participated in a randomized crossover BR study, consisting of four, two-week interventions (HA, HB, NA, NB), each separated by 5 months.  HR, arterial pressure, and MSNA were recorded before, during, and after static handgrip HG (40% of maximum voluntary contraction to fatigue), post-exercise muscle ischemia (forearm occlusion), and the cold pressor test.  Bedrest and nutritional combinations were compared using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures.  HR, MSNA, and the change in systolic BP during HG were attenuated with CR.  CR was associated with a higher diastolic BP during cold pressor; however, HR was directionally opposite (i.e., increase with BR, decrease with CR).  Therefore, CR, but not BR, severely attenuates autonomic responses to static exercise.\nThe third study tested the hypothesis that acute elevation of FFA activates the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).  Previous studies have shown that acute increases in plasma FFA raise systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and BP.  However, these studies fail to distinguish between central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms that raise sympathetic activity and paracrine mechanisms that increase SVR directly independent of CNS involvement.  On 2 days separated by at least 2 wks 17 lean, healthy volunteers (10M/7F; 22\u00b11 yrs; BMI: 23\u00b11 kg/m2; mean\u00b1SEM) received a 4-hr iv infusion of Intralipid 20% or placebo (single-blind, randomized, balanced order).  MSNA, HR, BP (brachial auscultation), and cardiac output (Q, C2H2 rebreathing) were measured before and throughout infusion.  The change in HR (+8.2\u00b11.0 vs. +2.4\u00b11.2 beats/min), systolic BP (+14.0\u00b11.6 vs. +3.2\u00b12.5 mmHg), and diastolic BP (+8.2\u00b11.0 vs. -0.1\u00b11.7 mmHg) was significantly greater after the 4-hr infusion of Intralipid vs. placebo (p<.001).  The change in BP with Intralipid resulted from an increase in SVR (mean BP/Q; p<0.001) vs. baseline, without a change in Q.  MSNA burst frequency increased during Intralipid infusion vs. baseline (+4.9\u00b11.3 bursts/min; p<0.05), and total MSNA (frequency * amplitude) was augmented 65% (p<0.001), with no change during placebo infusion.  Lipid infusion increased insulin, aldosterone, and F2-isoprostanes, but not leptin, concentrations.  The concomitant increases in BP, MSNA, and SVR suggest that central sympathetic activation contributes to the pressor response to FFA. \nThe fourth study tested the hypothesis that aging exacerbates the sympathetic and cardiovascular responses to elevated FFA.  The objectives of this study were to characterize the cardiovascular, neural, and endocrine response to acute elevation of FFA.  Seventeen healthy older volunteers (7M/10F; 69\u00b11 yrs; BMI 24\u00b10 kg/m2) received a 4-hr iv infusion of Intralipid 20% or placebo (single-blind, randomized, balanced order) on 2 different days separated by at least 2 wks.  MSNA, HR, BP (brachial auscultation), Q (C2H2 rebreathing), leptin, insulin, aldosterone, angiotensin II, and F2-isoprostanes were measured.   The change in HR (+8.8\u00b10.9 vs. +3.0\u00b10.9 beats/min), systolic BP (+13.9\u00b12.2 vs. +6.6\u00b12.4 mmHg), and diastolic BP (+7.4\u00b11.5 vs. +1.3\u00b10.8 mmHg) was significantly greater after the 4-hr infusion of Intralipid vs. placebo (p<.001).  The increase in BP with Intralipid resulted from variable fluctuations in SVR (mean BP/Q) and Q.  MSNA burst frequency increased during Intralipid infusion vs. baseline (+6.7\u00b11.6 bursts/min; p<0.05), and total MSNA (frequency * amplitude) was augmented 45% (p<0.001), with no change during placebo infusion.  Lipid infusion increased insulin (+40%), aldosterone (+50%), and F2-isoprostanes (+80%), but not leptin, concentrations.  Direct vascular mechanisms and central sympathetic activation contribute to the pressor response to FFA; this response is not different compared to previous studies in a younger population.\nThe results of these studies suggest that nutritional/metabolic factors alter autonomic control of the cardiovascular system.  Specifically, moderate caloric/fat restriction diminishes BP control during orthostatic stress and static exercise.  Conversely, acute elevation in FFA concentration increases BP by activating the central nervous system, and the response to FFA is not different in older individuals.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2922], "author_name_tesi": "Florian, John P", "last_name_ssi": "Florian", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Anthony Pawelczyk", "David Nathan Proctor", "Mihai Covasa", "Nancy Williams", "Mosuk Chow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Chair", "David Nathan Proctor, Committee Member", "Mihai Covasa, Committee Member", "Nancy Williams, Committee Member", "Mosuk Chow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["blood pressure", "sympathetic nervous system", "free fatty acids", "caloric restriction", "hypertension", "spaceflight"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Identification and Validation of Antimicrobial Interventions for Red Meat Carcasses Processed in Very Small Meat Establishment", "id": "7028", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5657", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Carcass decontamination strategies for very small meat plants (VSMP) were developed by systematic experimentation. First, a survey of VSMP in Pennsylvania, Washington and Idaho determined that knife trimming and cold water washing were the most common antimicrobial interventions in use. Secondly, red meat carcasses (n = 866) processed in VSMP in Pennsylvania, Washington, Idaho, and Texas were swabbed to determine prevalences of Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and E. coli O157:H7 and enumerate hygiene indicators (mesophilic aerobic plate count, coliforms, and generic E. coli). Thirdly, manual water washes (various temperatures, pressures, drip times, applications, and distances) and chemical rinses at various concentrations (acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, peroxyacetic acid, aqueous ozone, sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, and acidified sodium chlorite) were applied in inoculation challenge studies to reduce bacteria on inoculated beef surfaces. While hot water (77\u00b0C) yielded log reductions of 2.7 to 5.1 CFU/cm2, there were quality issues with this intervention. Relative antimicrobial effectiveness was determined: organic acids > peroxyacetic acid > chlorinated compounds > ozone. Using this information, individual and combined effectiveness of water washing and/or rinsing with an antimicrobial compound was measured in a laboratory setting. The effectiveness of a portable, pressurized stainless steel spray tank to apply a 2% lactic acid rinse was compared with a garden sprayer, retrofitted garden sprayer, and motorized backpack sprayer. The findings from these studies indicated that a manual warm water wash (54\u00b0C), followed by a 5 minute drip and 2% lactic acid rinse applied with a portable, pressurized steel tank, was the most effective multi-step antimicrobial carcass intervention (MSACI) with reductions of pathogens between 3.5 and 5.0 log CFU/cm2 and 3.8 to 8.9 log CFU/cm2 for hygiene indicators. Instructional materials were developed to train VSMP employees how to implement MSACI in their plants. Lastly, red meat carcasses (n = 747) were swabbed to generate a second microbiological baseline after MSACI implementation. The first and second baselines were statistically compared to validate the reduction in carcass hygiene indicators and prevalence of harmful pathogens.

To effectively allow for the coordination of these varying companies, a construction management firm is often hired. The management firm may either act as a general contractor, in which they perform some of the work themselves, or as a construction manager, strictly focusing on administration. It is common for both types of management to use subcontractors for specific portions of the project. These subcontractors focus in a precise area of construction, and as a result, gain an expertise in that specialty. Subcontracting minimizes project costs by eliminating the time needed to learn and perfect new trades.  \n\nAlthough it is certainly a benefit for a company to spread work among experts, many problems do tend to arise when combining the efforts of varying subcontractors. As project sizes amplify, the number of hired subcontractors usually increases as well, leading to problems in subcontractor management.\n\nThis thesis examines problems that exist in subcontractor management, as well the best practices that should be followed to alleviate these obstacles. In order to provide a guideline for managing subcontractors, five individuals from varying construction backgrounds have been interviewed and asked a series of questions pertaining to their experiences and opinions on managing subcontractors. The collected responses have been analyzed and organized into a survey. The five interviewees, along with five other practicing professionals, have taken the survey and rated the practices based on importance. The recommendations for subcontractor management have been rated and ranked in this thesis to serve as a guide for practicing and future construction managers.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [994], "author_name_tesi": "Flynn, Christopher John", "last_name_ssi": "Flynn", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Horace Randolph Thomas Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Horace Randolph Thomas Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["subcontractor", "construction management", "construction", "subcontractor management"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Quaternion algebras and elliptic curves over function fields of finite characteristic", "id": "18938", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8988", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We investigate a certain relationship between elliptic curves and function field analogues of Shimura curves.

Its production has grown exponentially in recent years in the Marcellus Shale region, covering parts of PA, OH, NY, and WV. Natural gas production generates wastewaters with high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration, mainly from Na(I), Cl(-I), Ca(II), Mg(II), K(I), Sr(II), and Ba(II). Sodium and Cl(-I) concentrations can reach 49,400 mg/L and 196,000 mg/L, respectively. Accidental release of these wastewaters, including spills and leakage, can potentially provide pathways for them to enter natural water bodies, including rivers and groundwater aquifers. \nThis study examines the mobilization of heavy metals, specifically cadmium and lead, induced by accidental release of the wastewater. These metals are toxic to human health. Aquifers can become contaminated with Cd(II) and Pb(II) from industrial wastes from zinc smelters and battery production. Lead was previously used as an additive in gasoline and as a pesticide. Both metals can become immobile once they are adsorbed onto soil and clay sediment. If the Marcellus wastewater enters natural systems, the high salinity can mobilize Cd(II) and Pb(II) through desorption and ion exchange processes, which increases the likelihood of the metals contaminating drinking water sources. In this work, we use well-mixed batch reactors with typical concentrations of Marcellus wastewater components to determine which components and factors, such as composition, pH, and ionic strength, have the largest impact on metal mobilization. The concentration of components was based on values for flowback and produced waters. Flowback waters are those which return to the surface prior to natural gas production commencing, and produced waters are those which return during natural gas production. Produced waters typically have higher concentrations of ions. \n\tIn this work, cadmium and lead were first adsorbed onto illite. A background water solution was created to simulate typical groundwater concentrations of Ca(II), Mg(II), and K(I). Seven different batches of wastewater were created. The solutions started with one cation present, Na(I). Then other cations, Sr(II) and Ba(II), were added to compare their effect on mobilization. The last three solutions made had typical values of Na(I), Ca(II), Mg(II), K(I), Sr(II), and Ba(II), for both flowback and produced waters. The experimental procedure began with mixing the metal-laden clay with background water for two hours, then adding the wastewater solutions and mixing for an additional four hours. \n\tResults showed that the high concentration of Na(I) did mobilize Cd(II). When 1M NaCl was added to the system, 67% of the Cd(II) desorbed from the illite. The presence of Sr(II) and Ba(II) did not increase the mobilization. When Ca(II) and Mg(II) were added with the Flowback solution, Cd(II) desorption increased to 71%. Two experiments were also run with typical produced water composition, which have overall higher concentration of all ions, and results showed 82.3 and 83.6% desorption. It appeared that Na(I), Ca(II), and Mg(II) all increased the Cd(II) desorption. \n\tThe pH of all systems was measured throughout the experiments. Results showed in general that the lower the end point pH was, the more desorption occurred. All experiments had an initial pH of 7.63 +/- 0.04. The NaCl solution and Sr solution experiments both ended with a pH around 7.36. The Ba solution and Ba/Sr solution experiments had an endpoint pH of approximately 7.28. The end pH for the experiments with more complex solutions (Flowback, Produced, and Produced 2) were lower than the other solutions: 7.19, 7, and 6.99 respectively. All end point pH values are lower than the initial pH values. This could indicate that the presence of high concentrations of Ca(II), and Mg(II) could react with other species in the solution, such as CO32-, which would result in a lower pH; therefore the Ca(II) and Mg(II) presence will result in higher desorption. \n\tThe produced waters had the highest ionic strength (0.65 and 0.51 mol/L for Produced and Produced 2, respectively) and the highest desorption. The typical flowback water had one of the lowest ionic strengths (0.11 mol/L) however the third highest desorption.

This disease is characterized by alterations in the ability of the heart to pump efficiently as well as structural changes resulting in myocardial dysfunction.  The functional and structural changes observed with the progression of the disease to a dilated cardiomyopathy are consistent with alterations in protein content secondary to an inhibition of protein synthesis.  Although the effects of chronic alcohol intake are frequently studied in males, females are also susceptible to alcohol-induced myocardial defects.  There are discrepancies among investigations regarding sex and the toxic effects of chronic alcohol intake on the myocardium.  To date, only selected candidate proteins have been investigated and, therefore, the full extent to which myocardial proteins are affected by chronic alcohol consumption across the sexes remains unresolved.\nThe purpose of this research was to utilize proteomic technology in order to examine the global effect of chronic alcohol abuse on the profile of cardiac proteins.  Rats were maintained for 16-18 weeks on a 40% alcohol-containing diet in which ethanol was provided both in drinking water and agar blocks.  Echocardiography evaluation allowed non-invasive detection of structural and functional changes as a result of the alcohol insult.  Two different proteomic labeling techniques were used in these studies.  First, ICAT (isotope coded affinity tags) was used to determine alterations in protein content in male alcohol-fed rats compared to control rats.  Next, iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) reagents were utilized to compare protein profiles between male and female rats.  The 4-plex iTRAQ technology allowed the four experimental groups (male control, male alcohol, female control, and female alcohol) to be analyzed simultaneously with each iTRAQ application.  Enriched subcellular fractions of mitochondrial, myofibrillar, nuclear, and sarcoplasmic proteins were generated to reduce sample complexity and permit detection of low abundance proteins via mass spectrometry-based approaches.  A random effects model of meta-analysis, developed and applied to sample iTRAQ datasets, allowed the overall summary effect of protein content across multiple iTRAQ experiments investigating the effect of long-term alcohol abuse on protein levels to be determined.\nProlonged feeding of an ethanol-containing diet for 16-18 weeks resulted in decreased left ventricular weight as well as alterations in structural and functional parameters, including stroke volume, cardiac output, and end-diastolic diameter in male rats, but not female rats.  Initial proteomic analysis via either labeling technique, i.e. ICAT or iTRAQ, identified and quantified hundreds of myocardial proteins.  Specifically, the ICAT study resulted in 77 significant proteins of 448 total identified proteins.  In this study, myofibrillar proteins involved in contraction, such as &#945;-myosin and actin, were down-regulated in males as a consequence of long-term alcohol consumption, consistent with previous reports.  Application of the random effects model allowed determination of statistically significant proteins within each subcellular fraction across the multiple iTRAQ datasets generated for that fraction.  The number of statistically significant proteins was greatly reduced (-89% to -96%) from the original number of identifications within that fraction.  A total of 45, 95, 98, and 113 proteins were determined as significant alcohol-induced alterations in protein levels in the mitochondrial, myofibrillar, nuclear, and sarcoplasmic fractions, respectively.\nPathway and network analysis revealed several sexual dimorphisms.  A network of proteins involved in cardiovascular system development and function highlighted such a sexual dimorphism.  Alcohol-induced up-regulation of the troponins, key contractile regulatory proteins, was reported in females consuming alcohol in comparison with non-drinking females, while concomitant down-regulation was observed in alcohol-receiving males when compared to non-drinking male counterparts.  These findings were validated by Western blot analysis.  Pathway analysis of proteins involved in energy metabolism, e.g., beta-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation, revealed another sex-dependent difference.  Males consuming alcohol showed increased expression of proteins in complex I (NADH dehydrogenase), complex III (cytochrome b-c1), complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), and complex V (ATPase), whereas females showed no change or even a decrease in expression.\nAs determined by echocardiography evaluation, long-term alcohol intake demonstrated more significant alterations in the structural and functional parameters of the heart in male rats compared to female rats.  Based on these observations and the corresponding changes in proteins, we speculate that females may be protected from the toxic effects of alcohol due to their adaptive ability to maintain contractile function, maintain efficiency of force generation, and minimize oxidative stress experienced by the cell.  The adaptive response to the alcohol insult observed in males is indicative of a decreased efficiency of contraction and increased energy production, as demonstrated by increased expression of troponin as well as proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production.  However, males lack the ability to overcome the alcohol-induced insult to the myocardial tissue, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species and structural abnormalities.  This is consistent with the alterations in myocardial structure and function that are observed in males, but not females, following assessment via echocardiography that suggest male myocardium is more susceptible to the toxic effects of alcohol abuse.  Based on the changes in echocardiography parameters and protein content, we speculate there is a difference in the alcoholic phenotype that may explain the dichotomy in the development and progression of alcoholic heart muscle disease observed between male and female rats.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5217], "author_name_tesi": "Fogle, Rachel LaDean", "last_name_ssi": "Fogle", "middle_name_ssi": "LaDean", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas C Vary", "Willard M Freeman", "Patricia Sue Grigson", "Christopher Hollenbeak", "Christopher J Lynch", "Charles H Lang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas C Vary, Dissertation Advisor", "Willard M Freeman, Committee Member", "Patricia Sue Grigson, Committee Member", "Christopher Hollenbeak, Committee Member", "Christopher J Lynch, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["meta-analysis", "random effects", "alcoholic heart muscle disease", "mass spectrometry", "chronic ethanol", "iTRAQ", "proteomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Integrated Electronics and Fluidic MEMS for Bioengineering", "id": "17695", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8347", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and microelectronics have become enabling technologies for many research areas.  This dissertation presents the use of fluidic MEMS and microelectronics for bioengineering applications. In particular, the versatility of MEMS and microelectronics is highlighted by the presentation of two different applications, one for in-vitro study of nano-scale dynamics during cell division and one for in-vivo monitoring of biological activities at the cellular level.\t\n\nThe first application of an integrated system discussed in this dissertation is to utilize fluidic MEMS for studying dynamics in the mitotic spindle, which could lead to better chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer patients.  Previous work has developed the use of electrokinetic phenomena on the surface of a glass-based platform to assemble microtubules, the building blocks of mitotic spindles. Nevertheless, there are two important limitations of this type of platform. First, an unconventional microfabrication process is necessary for the glass-based platform, which limits the utility of this platform. In order to overcome this limitation, in this dissertation a convenient microfluidic system is fabricated using a negative photoresist called SU-8. The fabrication process for the SU-8-based system is compatible with other fabrication techniques used in developing microelectronics, and this compatibility is essential for integrating electronics for studying dynamics in the mitotic spindle. The second limitation of the previously-developed glass-based platform is its lack of bio-compatibility. For example, microtubules strongly interact with the surface of the glass-based platform, thereby hindering the study of dynamics in the mitotic spindle. This dissertation presents a novel approach for assembling microtubules away from the surface of the platform, and a fabrication process is developed to assemble microtubules between two self-aligned thin film electrodes on thick SU-8 pedestals. This approach also allows the in-vitro model to mimic the three-dimensionality of the cellular mitotic spindle that is absent in previous work.\n\nThe second application of an integrated bioengineering system discussed in this dissertation is to design and fabricate active electronics and sensors for an in-vivo application to monitor neural activity at the cellular level. Temperature sensors were chosen for a first demonstration. In order for temperature sensors to be able to be implanted into brain interfaces, it is necessary for these devices to be fabricated using processes that are compatible with bio-compatible substrates such as glass and plastic. This dissertation addresses this challenge by developing temperature sensors integrated with biasing circuitry using zinc oxide thin film transistors (TFTs) fabricated on polyimide substrates. The integrated sensors show good temperature sensitivity, which is critical for monitoring neural temperature at the cellular level. This dissertation also describes the unique requirements of encapsulating implantable electronics. For instance, encapsulation schemes must be designed in such a way that they both protect electronic devices from extracellular fluids and also do not interfere with the functionality of these devices. In this work, SU-8 is used as a convenient and effective encapsulation layer. Thermal engineering to prevent active electronics from overheating and to ensure accurate temperature measurement from temperature sensors is also discussed, and a synergistic encapsulation and thermal engineering combination is presented.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8262], "author_name_tesi": "Fok, Ho Him", "last_name_ssi": "Fok", "middle_name_ssi": "Him", "first_name_ssi": "Ho", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "William O Hancock", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thin Film Transistors", "Sensors", "Zinc Oxide", "MEMS", "Electrokinetics", "Bioengineering"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Progress Towards the Total Synthesis of (-)-gilbertine", "id": "27568", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12229", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation focuses on an allenyl azide cyclization approach towards (-)-gilbertine (4), a pentacyclic indole alkaloid that is part of the uleine family of natural products. The first two (out of four) stereogenic centers were introduced with high diastereoselectivity through a Nicholas reaction of oxazolidinone 79 and cobalt complex 136. The key allenyl azide cyclization cascade of 70 resulted in a single diastereomer 73b with the desired C(16) stereochemistry. All attempts to form the final C(7)-C(21) bond were unsuccessful. \nReduction and cyclization of amide 149 resulted in a mixture of N- and C-cyclized products (151 and 148, respectively) suggesting that the extra E ring present in 73b created too much strain to allow for the final ring closure. Efforts to complete the synthesis of gilbertine (4) from adducts 148 and 151 resulted in a mixture of products which could not be isolated individually. C-cyclized 148 should have generated gilbertine upon deprotection and subsequent O\u2192C cyclization. However, only deprotection was observed, suggesting that C(20) epimerization had occurred during the Schwartz reduction/cyclization step. These results provided valuable insight into the structural complexity of gilbertine. Thus, in order to complete the synthesis of gilbertine (4), the C ring must be formed before the E ring.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11618], "author_name_tesi": "Folda, Tamara Sandra", "last_name_ssi": "Folda", "middle_name_ssi": "Sandra", "first_name_ssi": "Tamara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ken S Feldman", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich", "Przemyslaw Maslak", "Joshua D Lambert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ken S Feldman, Dissertation Advisor", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich, Committee Member", "Przemyslaw Maslak, Committee Member", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gilbertine", "total synthesis", "allenyl azide", "cyclization cascade", "photochemistry", "indole alkaloid", "organic"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "On Second Reflection: Assembling Contemporary Literature", "id": "1n79h428d", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13042", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "On Second Reflection: Assembling Contemporary Literature examines a range of authors and academics who became editors and publishers of prominent literary magazines and publishing houses since 1945. The dissertation argues that practices of editing and publishing compel these writers and academics to undertake a \u201csecond reflection\u201d on the forms and contexts of postwar writing in the United States. \u201cSecond reflection\u201d provides an alternative for thinking about the reflective aspects of literary works by opening reflection to conditions of experience and production. As such, my project studies writers who became editors and publishers, and who made editorial work into a lens for theorizing how contemporary literature can be constituted. Charles Olson and Nathaniel Mackey take stock of their editorial practices to position their work against the limitations of New Criticism (1950s) and the identity politics of the canon wars (1980s). But they also foster in their writing what I call a \u201cprocedural metaphysics\u201d and a \u201cpoetics of hospitality,\u201d respectively, that derive from editorial experience. The Dalkey Archive Press republishes out-of-print works to lay bare the effects for-profit publishing has on literary criticism; but it also demonstrates how literary remainders\u2014in the form of out-of-print books\u2014operate within the discourse of contemporary literature. Chris Kraus\u2019s Native Agents Series within the Semiotext(e) publishing house not only corrects problematic gender oversights in the press\u2019s list before her editorship, but it also serves as a functioning model with which Kraus theorizes the relationship between gender and genre in postwar writing.

With an increase in the use and availability of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance has become a public health concern and has received much attention from government agencies, public interest groups, and the media. There is disagreement within the medical, veterinary, and regulatory communities regarding the veterinary use of antibiotics and associated risks to public health, and it is therefore important to investigate the many facets of antibiotic use and encourage the development of educational programs and resources for all stakeholders. \n     This study focused on the use of a conceptual framework and survey instruments to explore the beliefs, knowledge and practices of veterinarians and to assess the current status of available educational resources pertaining to antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate a wide variety of Pennsylvania veterinarians in order to identify relationships and differences between their perspectives, and facilitate the development of educational programs and strategies to benefit the field of veterinary medicine, animal industry stakeholders, and the public.\n\tA non-experimental, descriptive-correlational research design was used to develop this study that focused on the population of all veterinarians licensed to practice medicine in Pennsylvania. Survey instruments were designed to capture the perspectives of two different groups of veterinarians: Group 1 \u2013 food/large animal vets, and Group 2 \u2013 all other vets. The surveys contained three sections to obtain demographic information, veterinarian perspectives of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance across five perspectives dimensions (Antibiotic Resistance, Antibiotic Use, Veterinary Clientele, the General Public, and Veterinarian Practices), and perspectives of available educational resources. Veterinarians attending the PVMA Keystone conference completed a total of 66 usable paper surveys, and veterinarians contacted via email listservs completed 284 usable internet-based surveys. \n\tFindings indicated that the two groups of veterinarians possessed varied perceptions across the five perspectives dimensions, and that significant differences in perspectives existed (p < .05). Data also indicated that the two groups of veterinarians recommended different types of antibiotic drugs for disease treatment and prevention. Significant relationships existed between the select demographic variables (gender and years post-graduation from veterinary school) and the five perspectives dimensions. Findings also indicated the need for educational materials and resources regarding antibiotic resistance for veterinarians, veterinary staff, veterinary clientele, and the general public; and concluded that veterinarians may be the best resource for educating their staff and clientele. Several modes for disseminating educational information to stakeholders were also identified, with veterinarian preferences shown for journals, veterinary specific websites, and continuing education (CE) events. \n\tFurther research is necessary to determine the status of veterinary knowledge, beliefs and practices of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in Pennsylvania, and this study provides a basis for further inquiry.

BI is defined by Davis (1989) in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the degree to which a person has formulated conscious plans to perform or not perform some specified future behavior.  BI is determined by measuring the perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of a particular technology or information system.  \nThe study employed 56 undergraduate nursing students, both juniors and seniors, from three (3) accredited Schools of Nursing in a survey research approach that uses a cross-sectional between-subjects design.  One-on-one interviews also were used to document undergraduate nursing students\u2019 perceived behavioral intention of an EHR in the learning environment on clinical rotations and on practice.  \nParticipants were recruited using sampling procedures during the fall 2010 and spring 2011 semesters.  They were either enrolled at (1) Schools of Nursing that bring an authentic EHR experience into the curricula in order to teach nursing practice or; (2) a School of Nursing that uses a paper-based approach to teach nursing practice.   In both environments students also had experience with an EHR on clinical rotations. \nParticipants were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire that has items to assess the perceived usefulness (PU) and the perceived ease of use (PEOU) of an EHR.  They were also given the option to participate in a follow-up interview.  During the interview, they were asked to share their perceptions of their behavioral intention to use an EHR on their clinical rotations and in practice.  \nThe mean scores for all the survey responses and the mean score for individual items on the questionnaire and their standard deviations were consistent across both learning models.

The applicability of temperature-sensitive polymers relies on their ability to phase separate from water abruptly at a specific temperature. A series of polyamides and polyesters was developed, where the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in water is controlled by the balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments in the polymer. Cloud point measurements were used to study the phase transition of the aqueous polymer solutions. It was shown that by changing the size of either the hydrophobic or hydrophilic component, the LCST in water can be shifted to higher or lower temperatures by design. In order to maintain a sharp LCST phase transition, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments were connected in an alternating manner. This avoids \u201cblockyness\u201d within the backbone, which would result in broader phase transitions due to micelle formation. PEO was chosen as the hydrophilic component in all of the copolymers because of its LCST behavior in water and its proven utility in many biological applications. The hydrophobic components consisted of either aliphatic hydrocarbons or aromatic groups. Aliphatic hydrocarbons are an ideal choice for tuning the LCST because they are readily available in many lengths. By selecting sequences of different lengths, the aqueous solution LCST was tuned. Additionally, altering the copolymer molecular weight as well as the hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature of the terminal sequences was used for fine tuning the LCST. \nThe influence of the nature of the hydrophobic group was investigated by preparing copolymers with aromatic hydrophobic segments, including an aromatic group with a pendant carboxylic acid. The latter hydrophobic segment imparted more hydrophobicity to the copolymers than aliphatic units of similar molecular weight, and the addition of carboxylic acid groups to the copolymer resulted in a dual temperature- and pH-responsive macromolecule. \nFinally, by using the \u201cgrafting from\u201d approach in conjunction with polycondensation synthesis, a method to end-tether temperature-sensitive polyamides to a silicon wafer was devised, rendering the substrates temperature-responsive.

Numerous studies have supported the role of strategy use in reading and the ability of strategies to correct breakdowns in comprehension during reading. Likewise, a developing body of research has suggested an important role of executive function in reading comprehension. Such work, however, has primarily been conducted with younger readers; less work has examined the links between specific executive functions and reading comprehension among college-aged and adult readers. In addition, existing research has not yet examined the effect of text characteristics, such as cohesion, on the relations among key cognitive and motivational processes and comprehension of expository text. Existing research has likewise not yet examined how readers\u2019 strategy use and ability to monitor affect the links between specific executive functions and reading comprehension. The current research aimed to address these gaps in the literature through two studies of reading among college learners and adult readers, respectively. \n     In the first study, differential contributions of the executive functions of inhibition, shifting, and updating to comprehension of expository text that varied in referential cohesion were examined among college learners. The contributions of strategy use and metacognitive monitoring to comprehension as well as the mediating roles of each in the relations among specific executive functions and comprehension were also tested. The results indicated that shifting \u2013 but not updating or inhibition \u2013 differentially predicted comprehension of text that was lower in referential cohesion, while updating \u2013 but not inhibition or shifting \u2013 predicted comprehension of text higher in referential cohesion. Metacognitive monitoring, as measured by absolute accuracy during assessment of comprehension, significantly predicted comprehension in both text conditions. Strategy use predicted comprehension only of high cohesion text. Further, metacognitive monitoring mediated the link between shifting and comprehension of the low cohesion text; mediation was not supported among variables when the text was high in referential cohesion. The findings provide additional evidence for the important and interactive roles of text characteristics and cognitive processes in readers\u2019 understanding of expository text, and suggest important areas of future study. \n     In the second study, both individual and combined contributions of executive function to expository text comprehension among adult readers were examined. Using hierarchical regression analysis as well as structural equation modeling, the individual executive functions of inhibition, shifting, and updating as well as a latent executive function factor accounted for unique variance in reading comprehension above and beyond age, prior knowledge, reading time, vocabulary ability, and perceived interest. Ancillary analyses revealed that vocabulary ability mediated the relation between executive function and reading comprehension among the adult readers. Executive function contributed more strongly to lower-level compared with higher-level comprehension of the expository text. Across studies, the findings support implications for interventions that aim to improve readers\u2019 comprehension of expository text by jointly targeting text characteristics and salient cognitive processes.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15346], "author_name_tesi": "Follmer, Dan Jacob", "last_name_ssi": "Follmer", "middle_name_ssi": "Jacob", "first_name_ssi": "Dan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rayne A.

This dissertation examines three Latin American avant-garde projects in relation to their later reenactments (starting in the 1960s and continuing into the twenty-first century) to demonstrate how they assessed and envisioned the material conditions that would permit the development of artistic infrastructures in subsequent contexts. It shows infrastructures are necessarily constructed and developed over time: they cannot be created immediately and therefore their realization requires planning and execution. A focus on artistic infrastructures therefore requires us to re-conceptualize the temporality of the avant-garde and move away from the rhetoric of rupture with which is it is often associated.\n\nFocusing on the infrastructures results in understanding the Latin American avant-garde through the frame of a deferred temporality. This temporality is composed by both the re-enactments acting on the avant-garde, and simultaneously, the foresight of the infrastructural needs of the avant-garde acting on the subsequent adaptations or performances of these works. In developing, creating, or even simply using infrastructures to perform the works of the avant-gardes, the individuals and social agents of the three chapters in this dissertation not only reenact the aesthetic of the avant-gardebut also enact themselves into the history and temporality of Latin American art and literature through the avant-garde projects.\n\nChapter 2, \u201cThe Afro-Cuban Ballets and the Long-Term Racial Aesthetics of the Avant-Garde,\u201d considers two Afro-Cuban Ballets co-conceived by writer Alejo Carpentier and composer Amadeo Rold\u00e1n at the end of the 1920s, but not performed as a whole (with music, choreography, and staging) until the early Sixties, when they were staged by Ramiro Guerra, a foundational figure of modern dance in Cuba. The ballets and their performance are placed within the historicity of social and aesthetic forms that recreate the intricate interaction between racial politics and aesthetics in Cuba. By analyzing the histories of social and artistic infrastructures, the initial projects of the ballets and their performance in the 1960s are located within a long history of both artistic and cultural productions that reify the Afro-Cuban heritage into discourses of identity.\n\nChapter 3, entitled \u201cChinfon\u00eda Burguesa: The Geopolitical Interplay of the Nicaraguan Avant-Garde,\u201d focuses on a Nicaraguan play entitled Chinfon\u00eda burguesa. It explores how the canonization of the play illustrates the institutionalization of the avant-garde movement, and how its staging in Miami in the 21st century attempted to foster a community bond among the Nicaraguan and Latino population in the U.S. The play and its performance in Miami is positioned as the result of the several synchronic and diachronic geopolitical interactions between the U.S. and Nicaragua, followed by an analysis of how these interactions influenced the formation of the reactionary avant-garde of Nicaragua, the artistic infrastructure, and the social and political body of the country.\n\nChapter 4, \u201cWhen the Dictator Became a Puppet. The Theatrical Adaptation of El Se\u00f1or Presidente,\u201d spotlights the staging of Miguel Angel Asturias's novel El Se\u00f1or Presidente, which was adapted for the theater by the Guatemalan director Hugo Carrillo in 1974. It reconstructs the context of the performance in the scheme of the theatrical infrastructure in Guatemala, arguing that the vision of theater as a socio-political medium to change society that Asturias imagined in the 1930s was achieved because of the success of the adaptation years later. Yet this success paradoxically attracted the retaliation of the military forces, which in turn almost destroyed the theatrical infrastructure that made the staging and success of The President possible.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15295], "author_name_tesi": "Fonseca Pacheco, Fernando ", "last_name_ssi": "Fonseca Pacheco", "first_name_ssi": "Fernando", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah J.

K-maps consist of node-link representations of concepts that together form the content of a topic or domain. The benefits of using k-maps are that concepts and ideas are represented as nodes so the learner does not have as much text to process. Cognitive load was hypothesized to be reduced in the k-map condition because relationships among concepts and ideas are explicitly labeled by links; thereby freeing learners from the need to infer relationships. The k-map and text-based presentations used in this study represented the library research process. Two versions of the k-map and text presentations were created. One version included images that served as examples of concepts or ideas. The other version included descriptions of the examples rather than pictures. I hypothesized that participants receiving the k-map instruction would outperform participants receiving the text-based version on measures of recall, transfer, and cognitive load. The images were included to investigate the effect they would have in an already graphical k-map condition versus the less graphical text condition. \nParticipants included 208 lower division undergraduates from two universities. The sampling was designed to ensure that a wide range of reading skill was represented. I also investigated the reading skill level of the participants and how reading skill interacted with the type of instruction (k-map vs. text-based). \nContrary to predictions, the results indicated that participants did not benefit from the k-map presentation over the text condition in terms of total recall of ideas and recall of main ideas. Additionally, there were no main effects for condition on the transfer test; however, a significant interaction between condition and reading skills indicated that some participants performed better in the text condition with images presentation than other conditions. Cognitive load measures indicated that the condition with traditional text and images was more efficient than receiving a k-map version in terms of transfer for participants with medium levels of reading skills. Further analysis indicated that despite this reduction in cognitive load, learners\u2019 level of schema development for the topic was not significantly different. \nThe results of this study indicated that knowledge maps did not provide advantages over traditional text-based presentational methods in an online environment for learning about library research processes. Cognitive load measures indicated that the complexity of the k-map might have been too difficult for learners to process in the short instructional presentation. More research is needed to determine what design variables may help to alleviate this complexity in the application of k-map instruction to online learning for undergraduates.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2774], "author_name_tesi": "Foor, Jamie Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Foor", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Jamie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bonnie J Meyer", "Bonnie J Meyer", "Melissa Hardy", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich", "Rayne Audrey Sperling"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bonnie J Meyer, Dissertation Advisor", "Bonnie J Meyer, Committee Chair", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Member", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich, Committee Member", "Rayne Audrey Sperling, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Knowledge Maps", "Instructional Strategies", "Undergraduate Students", "Library Instruction"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Associations between BMI and diet quality with health-related quality of life, mortality and healthcare resource use in the Geisinger Rural Aging Study (GRAS)", "id": "19419", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9299", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The number of adults aged \u2265 65 years, and especially \u2265 80 years is rising\ndramatically. With increasing age there is an associated rise in co-morbid conditions. The\naverage life expectancy has reached 76 years for males and 81 years for females, the\nhighest ever, focusing attention on the increasing healthcare costs incurred by our aging\npopulation. In addition to reducing health care costs, promoting health related quality of\nlife (HRQOL) is of interest to older persons. Determining potentially modifiable factors\nthat may positively impact these outcomes is therefore of growing relevance.\nBody mass index (BMI) and diet quality are two such factors that warrant\nadditional research. Obesity is a global crisis, and rates of overweight and obesity have\ncontinued to increase even in the oldest segment of the population. Dietary guidelines are\noften not met by older persons, and their calorie needs are frequently exceeded while\nmicronutrient intakes fail to meet requirements. Older adults face additional nutritional\nconcerns due to changes in physiological functions as well as in living and social\narrangements. Studies characterizing the associations between BMI and diet quality with\nHRQOL, healthcare resource use (HRU) and mortality are limited in older adults,\nparticularly in those aged \u2265 80 years. Greater understanding of these associations may\nhelp inform recommendations regarding BMI and diet quality in older adults.\nThe objectives for this dissertation were three-fold: 1) to determine factors that\nimpact diet quality; 2) to assess associations between diet quality and BMI with healthrelated\nquality of life; and 3) to examine the associations between diet quality and BMI\niv\nwith objective health outcome measures including healthcare resource use and all-cause\nmortality.\nThe GRAS enrolled more than 20,000 individuals aged \u2265 65 years old living in\nrural central Pennsylvania in a rolling fashion from 1994-1999. The aim of the GRAS\nwas to evaluate nutritional risk in relation to health outcomes in older adults. In the fall of\n2009, the remaining 5,993 participants were contacted; 4,009 returned completed dietary\nand demographic information (1,722 male, 2,287 female; mean age 81.5 \u00b1 4.4). Of these,\n2,995 were also enrolled in the Geisinger Health Plan for at least part of the follow-up\n(mean=37 months), allowing for extraction of HRU data. Diet-related practices were selfreported\nat baseline (fall 2009). HRQOL score was determined using the Health and\nActivity Limitation Index (HALex) which scores individuals on a scale of 0.0 (death) to\n1.0 (optimal) based on self-reported health and self-reported functional limitation. HRU\nwas extracted from electronic medical records, and deaths were identified using\nelectronic medical records and the Social Security Death Index. Multivariate linear\nregression models were used to analyze the associations of BMI and diet-related practices\nwith DST score. The diet-related practices of skipping breakfast, reporting a decline in\nintake, being food insufficient or experiencing chewing difficulties were associated with\npoorer DST score. Additionally, participants with a low BMI (<18.5) had significantly\npoorer diet quality than individuals with a desirable BMI (18.5-24.9).\nThe next phase of analysis examined the associations between diet quality and\nBMI with HALex score in multivariate linear regression models. Those participants who\nhad either an \u2018unhealthy\u2019 (0.71 95% CI 0.70, 0.72, p<0.0001) or \u2018borderline\u2019 (0.72 95%\nCI 0.70, 0.73, p=.0008) diet had significantly lower HALex scores than those consuming\nv\na \u2018healthy\u2019 diet (0.75 95% CI 0.73, 0.77). Additionally, those with class II (0.67 95%\n0.64, 0.70, p<0.0001) or class III obesity (0.60 95% CI 0.55, 0.65, p<0.0001) had reduced\nHALex scores compared to those with a desirable BMI (0.76 95% CI 0.75, 0.77).\nThe next aim was to determine the association between overall diet quality, fruit\nand vegetable consumption, and BMI with four healthcare resource use outcomes.\nMultivariate negative binomial models were used to estimate relative risk (RR) and 95%\nconfidence intervals (95% CI) for each of four HRU outcomes (inpatient hospital visits,\ninpatient hospital days, emergency room visits and outpatient clinic visits) with diet\nquality and BMI. Poor diet quality was related to a 20% increased risk for ER visits. The\nthree lowest fruit and vegetable quintiles were associated with increased risk for ER visits\n(23-31%), and the lowest quintile was also associated with increased risk for inpatient\nvisits (27%). Obesity increased risk of outpatient clinic visits; however, individuals with\nclass I obesity were less likely than normal weight individuals to have ER visits (RR\n0.84; 95% CI 0.70, 0.99).\nFinally cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations of\nBMI, diet quality, and HRQOL with all-cause mortality after adjusting for relevant\ncovariates. Compared to GRAS participants with BMIs in the normal range, lower BMI\n(< 18.5) was significantly associated with increased mortality (HR 1.85 95% CI 1.09,\n3.14, p=0.02), while a BMI of 25-29.9 was associated with decreased risk of mortality\n(HR 0.71 95% CI 0.55, 0.91, p=.007). Poor diet quality increased risk for mortality (HR\n1.53 95% CI 1.06, 2.22, p=0.02) and favorable HRQOL (i.e. higher HALex score) was\nstrongly inversely associated with mortality risk (HR 0.09 95% CI 0.06, 0.13, p<0.0001).\nvi\nIn conclusion, the diet-related practices of skipping breakfast, reporting a decline\nin intake, being food insufficient or experiencing chewing difficulties, as well as a low\nBMI, were associated with poorer diet quality. In turn, poor diet quality was associated\nwith poor HRQOL as well as adverse HRU and mortality outcomes. Obesity classes II\nand III were also associated with poor HRQOL and increased outpatient clinic visits,\nwhile overweight was associated with reduced mortality.

This strand originates with Petrus Alfonsi\u2019s twelfth-century story collection Disciplina clericalis. His work\u2014by means of compilation and thematic and verbal continuities across discrete and provocatively arranged narratives\u2014undercuts the preeminence of his narratives\u2019 appended morals. Such a move situates the locus of meaning in an emergent dynamic among the compiled texts rather than in the narratives\u2019 appended morals. It likewise subjects appended morals to scrutiny as they compete with this emergent meaning. The effects of this arrangement reverberate throughout the Western tradition of moralized short narrative, particularly in and around England, where Petrus served in Henry I\u2019s court. In Latin, French, and English\u2014the three main languages used in late medieval England\u2014writers of short narrative employ versions of this compilatory complexity in their dealings with moralized short narrative and its associated forms. This dissertation traces sophisticated exemplarity through Petrus\u2019s Disciplina clericalis, Marie de France\u2019s Fables, several Old French fabliaux, Fragment VII of Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, William Caxton\u2019s Esope, and Robert Henryson\u2019s Morall Fabillis. It draws on Jauss\u2019s concept of literary history to trace the innovations and influence of these works. Furthermore, it analyzes specific acts of reception in several of their individual manuscript witnesses. This literary history of a subsection of medieval moralized short narrative reveals that the boldest claims for the cultural and institutional authority of moralized reading found prominent cultural counterpoint long before the recognizably literary humanist story collections of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Correspondingly, these humanist collections, often prized for their innovation, drew on this distinct centuries-old literary tradition where the difficulties of moving from narrative to abstract moral to ethical application had long been at stake.

Previous research in prenatally exposed mouse pups, sacrificed on day of birth (PN0), demonstrated sexually dimorphic patterns of gene expression in response to nicotine.  This dissertation work extends these findings by investigating how prenatal nicotine affects gene expression patterns in adolescents.  The persistence of sexually dimorphic gene response to nicotine is of particular interest due to previously reported sex differences in the results of a behavior experiment conducted on the adolescent animals used in this study.  Early nicotine exposure could permanently change the organization of the brain in a sexually dimorphic manner by altering gene expression.  The use of Bioinformatic resources allows the interrogation of the genes exhibiting sexually dimorphic response to identify potential gene networks that nicotine may be acting upon.  The use of these resources allows the merger of publicly available data with the microarray studies that gives a greater understanding of the biology underlying observed patterns.  In this manner I have identified genes that are sexually differentially regulated by nicotine and suggest potential modes of action for the large number of sexually dimorphic responses seen after nicotine exposure.

There are currently no estimates of population size or densities for river otter populations in Pennsylvania, and large-scale monitoring efforts are hampered by the elusive behavior of river otter. Non-invasive genetic sampling has been used to survey river otter populations, but given the river otter\u2019s unique distribution across the landscape, estimation of population size and densities has been limited to linear habitats in river systems or along coastlines. Spatial capture-recapture models incorporate spatial information from captures into the estimation process, and estimates are more explicitly linked to the area in which observations occur. I analyzed the efficacy of non-invasive genetic sampling to identify individual river otter and I used spatial capture-recapture models to estimate river otter population size and density, and in northeastern Pennsylvania.\n\tI surveyed nine counties in northeastern Pennsylvania, opportunistically collecting samples from latrine sites on public and private land. Latrines were visited on three to four occasions at 6\u201314 day intervals, clearing latrines after each visit, in a capture-recapture framework. I amplified DNA extracted from the samples at ten microsatellite markers, to generate a genotype for each sample. I matched genotypes using program CERVUS to identify individuals. \nMy first analysis compared amplification success rates and error rates for samples of different type and time of environmental exposure or freshness, and compared my amplification success rates to other studies. Previous studies on river otter had lower genotyping success rates than those for other otter species, and did not follow a common sampling protocol despite laboratory studies for the river otter and recommendations from field studies on other otter species. My amplification success rates were most comparable to those from studies on otter species conducted in the winter with samples collected in a storage buffer. I observed similar patterns of success rates as other studies for different sample types and samples classified for different categories related to lengths of environmental exposure, but had higher success rates for every category. Amplification error rates for the different sample types and environmental exposure categories were not reported in the literature, but I included them in the study as another measure of sample quality and to better inform future studies. The importance of comparing success rates and error rates is to better inform future studies on the preferred sampling protocol, and give measures for the amount of effort necessary for studies looking to use non-invasive genetic sampling to identify individual river otter for population analyses.\nTo estimate population size and density in spatial capture-recapture models, I compiled spatial encounter histories given the location and occasion of collection of each sample assigned to an individual. I also used full likelihood models in program MARK to test for differences in capture and recapture probabilities. I reported the first density estimates for a river otter population in northeastern Pennsylvania (2.1 otter/100 km2, 1.4\u20135.0 otter/100 km2 95% Asymptotic Wald-type CI). The estimates of capture and recapture probabilities in the MARK model with those parameters estimated separately indicated that capture and recapture probabilities were not different, but that the probability of capturing an individual did vary by occasion. I observed a difference in density estimates for my SCR and MARK models. I would recommend using SCR models because of the spatial justification for density estimates, and the ability to include landscape covariates to build more informed models, which may prove to be useful for river otter given their unique space use.\n\tFuture studies conducting non-invasive genetic sampling for river otter should conduct their studies in winter and use a storage buffer for samples. Sample type and length of environmental exposure should be considered when considering the amount of sampling effort to derive a genotype for identification of individual otter. NGS and SCR can be used to generate reliable population or density estimates, but as I documented from my MARK estimates of capture probability, numerous sampling occasions are desirable because of the variation in capture probability between occasions. Spatial capture-recapture models are preferable for river otter in Pennsylvania because the area for which density is being estimated is directly tied into the model, which is ideal given the diversity of linear and non-linear habitat types in northeastern Pennsylvania.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11520], "author_name_tesi": "Forman, Nicholas Sean", "last_name_ssi": "Forman", "middle_name_ssi": "Sean", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William David Walter", "David Miller", "Cassandra Michaela Miller Butterworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William David Walter, Thesis Advisor", "David Miller, Thesis Advisor", "Cassandra Michaela Miller Butterworth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["River otter", "non-invasive genetic sampling", "spatial capture-recapture", "population size", "population density", "Pennsylvania"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The big assist: Exploring professional sport and nonprofit relationships through CSR and Ethics of Care\n", "id": "22846", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9768", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Corporate social responsibility (CSR) research in public relations often emphasizes organizational goals, examining how CSR is practiced and communicated, how stakeholders perceive CSR efforts, and how reputational and organizational benefits emerge. Notably, scholars have largely failed to examine CSR impacts from the perspective of those who benefit from corporate giving. This research fills numerous gaps in public relations CSR literature: In addition to exploring the nonprofit perspective of CSR relationships, this study presents the first known effort to explore sport CSR in public relations. To date, sport CSR has been studied almost exclusively in business and marketing literature, where the sport industry is presented as bearing unique characteristics for practicing CSR and creating social impacts (Babiak & Wolfe, 2006, 2009, 2013). These relationships were explored and situated within ethics of care, which is presented as a useful normative framework for engaging in and evaluating CSR based on caring practices and values that privilege the perspectives and needs of relationship partners (Held, 2006). To address scholarly gaps, 29 depth interviews were conducted with nonprofit representatives who worked for organizations that received support from sport organizations located in a major metropolitan area. Inductive coding strategies revealed numerous themes related to CSR impacts and relationships, particularly in the context of sport CSR and care ethics. Findings suggest that nonprofits primarily reach out to sport organizations to establish relationships, and the sport industry is perceived as yielding unique benefits and challenges for partnering organizations. Specifically, nonprofits can yield direct benefits from teams including awareness, reach, and credibility, while team visibility and celebrity serve as indirect benefits that enhance the ability for teams to provide direct benefits. In the context of care ethics, nonprofit practitioners prefer caring relationships that are built upon trust and mutual concern, encourage human flourishing, and exist because of a genuine concern to assist others. Specifically, the strongest nonprofit and sport organization relationships are marked by mutually shared caring practices and values. To advance theoretical development of caring CSR practices and to situate CSR in the public relations domain, a public relations-based definition of caring CSR is presented alongside a proposed model for testing the predictive value of emergent themes.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9518], "author_name_tesi": "Formentin, Melanie Jane", "last_name_ssi": "Formentin", "middle_name_ssi": "Jane", "first_name_ssi": "Melanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Denise Sevick Bortree", "Denise Sevick Bortree", "Colleen Connolly Ahern", "Francis Erin Dardis", "Patrick Robert Parsons"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Denise Sevick Bortree, Dissertation Advisor", "Denise Sevick Bortree, Committee Chair", "Colleen Connolly Ahern, Committee Member", "Francis Erin Dardis, Committee Member", "Patrick Robert Parsons, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["public relations", "corporate social responsibility", "sport communication", "ethics of care"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "TRANSPORT AND DEFORMATIONAL SIGNATURES\nIN COUPLED GEOLOGICAL SYSTEMS:\nINSIGHTS FROM FOREWARD AND BACKWARD MODELING\n\n\n\n", "id": "11662", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5393", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study aims to investigate the interaction between hydraulic transport and mechanical deformation characteristics of geological settings. Numerical models developed here can quantitatively provide constrained information to further explore the phenomena and processes which cannot be easily captured experimentally. They deliver tools to probe into the processes from the observations and provide knowledge from data. The developed models link rheology, permeability, compressibility, deformation, stress, and pore pressure. The magnitude and interaction of these controlling parameters govern the fluid dynamics in volcanoes, geothermal or petroleum reservoirs, carbon sequestration settings, faulted zones in basins and other geological natural systems. \nPart I of this thesis (Chapters I-V) explores the magma transfer dynamics of Soufriere Hills Volcano (SHV) in Montserrat, West Indies. To this aim, ground deformation data are used to test the hypotheses concerning the magmatic processes in a geodynamic context. The purpose of this study is to determine the location, geometry, and extent of sub-surface deformation sources including magma reservoirs, dykes and conduit using field measurements. It is also to explore the relationships of magmatic storage-transport processes such as the basalt injection/storage, andesite reservoir, and volatiles degassing. A Numerical HMC model for cyclic behavior of SHV is calibrated and validated using geodetic data. In Part II (Chapter VI) scale- and process-appropriate numerical models are developed to follow the evolution of mechanical and transport properties in a generic basin during its faulting. The study is to show that the evolution of transport properties of rock due to shear is an important, likely crucial, feedback in promoting localization of fault structures.\nIn Chapter I, defining the concept of \u201capparent depth\u201d, a transfer function is developed so that the results of inversions assuming a homogenous medium can be transferred into a heterogeneous case representing Montserrat Iceland. Ground deformation data from high quality continuous GPS (cGPS) records from 1999 to 2008 are used to show that the SHV magmatic system has multiple crustal pressure sources. As For a dual chamber volcanic model, a deep chamber located within the mid crust which undergoes volume changes approximately an order of magnitude larger than those of a shallow one can explain the apparent depth signature of the deformation field.\nBuilding upon the model presented in Chapter I, in Chapter II measured cGPS velocity histories and mean magma efflux are fitted to model predictions by searching the full parameter space of potential chamber depth combinations by a least-squares optimization. Two geometry sets are considered in dual magma chamber models. The first comprises two vertically-stacked spherical pressure point (Mogi-type) chambers and the second a horizontal circular sill co-centered with a Mogi-type chamber. We confirm that SHV chamber depths and shapes are only weakly constrained by measured surface displacements. Applying the additional constraint of presumed constant influx to the lowermost chamber fixes an optimal geometry of dual interconnected Mogi-type sources at depths of about 5 and 19 km. This corresponds to a constant input of magma to the lowermost chamber of ~1.2 m3/sec which remains steady throughout the three successive episodes of eruption and pause. The magma compressibility varies with depth of chamber. The eruption-pause episodes are characterized by the synchronous deflation-inflation of both chambers with volume changes of the deep chamber larger than the shallow chamber.\nUsing the inversion results of Chapter II, Chapter III suggests that the shallow chamber controls the periodic system behavior: surface magma efflux resumes when the shallow chamber reinflates to its initial threshold pre-eruptive volume (thus triggering re-opening of an eruptive feeder dike), and ceases when it has lost 18\u00b14 Mm3 of its volume (sealing the conduit and staunching the magma flow). These observations are consistent with eruption re-initiation controlled by magma overpressures exceeding threshold strength of the shallow host-rock and of re-cessation triggered by a threshold underpressure. In this way Chapter III provides evidence that the periodic behavior of SHV from 1995 to 2008 has been controlled by shallow processes. To accommodate the mentioned volume change, the initial volume of the shallow chamber should be larger than 1.3 km3. \nThe inferred geometry and boundary conditions from the previous chapters are used in a flow dynamics and transport model in chapter IV. A transient 1-D FEM model is devolved here in an attempt to replicate the three fairly regular cycles of dome growth and repose of Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano. The model captures the key processes controlling the eruption and repose of the volcano including magma crystallization, volatile exsolution, and subsequent rheological stiffening of the compressible magma ascending through an elastically inhomogeneous wallrock. The extreme sensitivity of the highly nonlinear feedbacks of conduit and magma chamber processes result in sudden transitions between active and repose phases after slight variations of the governing parameters. To match the observed eruptivity, the free parameters of the model, including the magma chamber sizes, conduit diameter, and crystallization rate can be estimated. The volumes of the upper and lower chambers are confined to 2 km3 and 10 \u2013 20 km3, respectively. The conduit diameter and crystallization rate control the efflux rates and also the over-pressure in the chambers before the eruptions. To the contrary, the period of eruptions depend mainly on the chamber sizes. The average pressures in the chambers are slightly higher than the lithostat pressure and the upper chamber cycles between conditions of over- and under-saturation during periods of eruption and repose, respectively. As a result, abrupt changes in compressibility of magma exert repetitive cycles of expansion and contraction to the chamber wallrock which can be a deciding factor in the formation of the upper chamber.\nPart II, Chapter V, examines the role of basin shortening on the development of hydro-mechanical compartments in sedimentary basins on passive margins. A coupled flow deformation model is used to follow the evolution of an idealized prismatic basin during lateral shortening. This includes the deformation-induced generation (compaction) and dissipation (hydraulic fracturing) of pore fluid pressures and the resulting natural evolution of underlying d\u00e9collement and fault structures. This model is used to examine the influence of strata stiffnesses, strain softening, permeability-strain dependence and contrast, and deformation rate on the resulting basin structure and fluid charge. Thrust faulting develops as overpressures evolve to trigger failure. A d\u00e9collement forms within the system at the boundary with the substrate where overpressures drive failure in extension, by hydrofracturing. Failure in the basin overlying the d\u00e9collement initiates from these overpressured sediments at the d\u00e9collement. Where the evolution of permeability with shear strain is artificially suppressed, pervasive shear develops throughout the basin depth as fluid pressures are stabilized everywhere to the lithostat. Conversely, where permeability is allowed to increase with shear strain/rupture, faulting first nucleates at the d\u00e9collement and localizes upwards through the section. Correspondingly, permeability evolution with shear is an important, likely crucial, feedback in promoting localization, as failure is concentrated at the limits of the upward-migrating fault-tip. Elevated pore pressures approaching the lithostat are localized at the hanging wall boundary of the faults. Faults extend to bound blocks that vertically offset in to yield graben-like structural highs and lows and evolve with distinctive surface topography and separate pore pressure signatures. Up-thrust blocks have elevated fluid pressures and reduced effective stresses at their core, and down-thrust blocks the converse. These models indicate that fluid migration within compressional systems is intimately connected to both the mechanical and fluid transport behavior of the component sediments via strong feedbacks. \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5386], "author_name_tesi": "Foroozan, Roozbeh ", "last_name_ssi": "Foroozan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Roozbeh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Derek Elsworth", "Barry Voight", "Jamal Rostami", "Chris Marone"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth, Dissertation Advisor", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Chair", "Barry Voight, Committee Member", "Jamal Rostami, Committee Member", "Chris Marone, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fluid dynamics", "Volcano", "Basin", "Fault", "Geodesy", "Back Analysis", "GPS"]}]
