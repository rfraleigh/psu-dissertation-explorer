The method employed for this investigation initially required identifying the underlying linear system of a nonlinear mathematical DNA model followed by the calculation of this linear system\u2019s eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  These were subsequently used as a basis for finding nonlinear periodic solutions commonly referred to as nonlinear normal modes (NNM).  Modes of periodic oscillations were identified by first utilizing low energy eigenvectors as assumptions for initial condition vectors that would lead to NNMs.  These initial guess values were then corrected to actual vectors that result in NNMs utilizing a shooting corrector method.  Curves representing families of NNMs as a function of a particular low energy eigenvector were then obtained utilizing arclength continuation.  Bifurcation branches that emanated from these curves were identified through bifurcation branch switching. Through the implementation of these techniques, modes of localized motion were identified for the 10 base pair ring.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6500], "author_name_tesi": "Streeter, Willie ", "last_name_ssi": "Streeter", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Willie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alok Sinha", "Alok Sinha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alok Sinha, Thesis Advisor", "Alok Sinha, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["eigenvectors", "nonlinear normal modes", "eigenvalues", "localizations"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "SOLID-STATE NMR STUDIES OF THE IMPACT OF TANK WASTE LEACHATES IN THE ENVIRONMENT \n", "id": "10532", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1134", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using a combination of analytical spectroscopy and wet chemistry techniques, we are investigating the coupling between mineral weathering from caustic waste release and contaminant fate/transport in waste-impacted sediments from the Hanford DOE site.

Given the transitional issues known to be experienced by students during the first-year of college, a level of buoyancy sufficient to navigate routine obstacles is necessary for academic success.  Two studies were conducted to explore the relationships among academic buoyancy, motivation, and academic achievement of first-year college students. Specifically, whether academic buoyancy is a better predictor of academic success, as measured by college GPA, than SAT scores and scores on college administered placement tests was examined. The Motivation and Engagement Scale for University and College students and the Academic Buoyancy Questionnaire were administered to first-year students enrolled in a Freshmen Year Experience course at a college of technology. In Study One (N=120), regression analysis of a limited sample indicated that academic buoyancy was a small but significant predictor of academic achievement (R2 =.052).  In Study One, academic buoyancy was the only significant predictor of achievement of the variables explored, warranting further research on the buoyancy construct in a higher education setting.  The findings from Study Two indicated that SATs were the strongest predictor of academic success, accounting for approximately 14% of the variance in students\u2019 GPA at the end of the first-semester of college and for approximately 12% of the variance in students\u2019 first-year cumulative GPA. Self-sabotage, uncertain control, persistence and failure avoidance were the motivational variables likely to be most predictive of academic success.  However, academic buoyancy was also a significant predictor of first semester GPA, but to a smaller degree. When considered altogether, these results advance understanding of the academic buoyancy construct in higher education and extends existing research on college student motivation and academic achievement. They also establish the warrant for additional research on the role of buoyancy in relation to achievement and exploration of intervention strategies targeted at increasing individual student achievement and overall institutional retention rates.

The ferroelectric transition temperature (TC) behavior was considered in the tetragonal phase region of the PbTiO3\u2013Bi(Me',Me\")O3 systems. Trends in the TC compositional dependence exhibited three main cases: case 1, a continued increase in transition temperature above the end\u2013member PbTiO3 (495 oC); case 2, an increase and then decrease of the transition temperature; and case 3, a continuous decrease in the transition temperature with Bi(Me',Me\")O3 additions.  \n     New relaxor materials were developed from the PbTiO3\u2013Bi(Me',Me\")O3 solid solutions; specifically, the Bi(Mg3/4W1/4)O3\u2013PbTiO3 (BMW\u2013PT) binary solid solution and BiScO3\u2013Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3\u00ac)O3\u2013PbTiO3 (BS\u2013PMN\u2013PT) ternary solid solution were investigated.  Permittivity, polarization and pyroelectric measurements were performed on BMW\u2013PT and BS\u2013PMN\u2013PT compositions with respect to temperature with characteristic relaxor behavior observed.  The complex solid solution BMW\u2013PT exhibited a morphotropic phase boundary at ~ 48 mol% PbTiO3 with a corresponding TC of 205 oC.  On further structural analysis with diffraction contrast transmission electron microscopy along with x\u2013ray diffraction, evidence of B\u2013site ordering was observed.  \n     The BS\u2013PMN\u2013PT proved to be a model system with high temperature relaxor properties of Tmax ~ 250 oC to 300 oC and &#61541;max ~ 14,000 to 17,000 at 1 kHz.  The deviation temperature, TD, or temperature of the onset of local spontaneous polarization, was determined by thermal strain measurement and high temperature dielectric measurement to be approximately 600 oC; up to 250 oC higher than any reported value for relaxor ferroelectrics.  The frequency dependence of the temperature of the permittivity maximum was found to follow the V\u00f6gel\u2013Fulcher relationship, with an activation energy (EA) of ~0.1 eV, and a freezing temperature (Tf) of ~ 150 oC.  Static and in\u2013situ transmission electron microscopy investigations of the BS\u2013PMN\u2013PT compositions demonstrated a frustrated microstructure of nanometer scale regions and were used to establish structure\u2013property relationships with different electric field and thermal histories.  A comparative study of the key relaxor parameters, EA, Tf, and TD was tabulated with previously investigated relaxor ferroelectrics.  These parameters were found to scale relative to other lead\u2013based perovskite relaxor ferroelectric compounds and solid solutions, with the BS\u2013PMN\u2013PT ternary system exhibiting the highest temperature behavior.\n     Finally, to demonstrate one possible application area for these materials, multilayer ceramic capacitor devices were designed for operation at 300 oC and up to 10 kHz.  The voltage saturation was found to be extremely encouraging at 300 oC with observed changes in capacitance (~3%) on the application of 10 kV/cm.  The insulation resistivity followed an Arrhenius behavior and at 300 oC was ~ 1010 &#61527;\u2013cm.  Weibull statistics were used to estimate a characteristic breakdown field at 300 oC for the BS\u2013PMN\u2013PT multilayer capacitors of ~40 kV/cm.  Current\u2013voltage measurements were performed to voltages up to breakdown and exhibited Ohmic behavior, indicating intrinsically controlled conduction.  Highly accelerated life time tests were performed on BS\u2013PMN\u2013PT capacitors.

Controversy exists regarding whether or not prevalence rates of depression in MS and the medical population in general, are inflated due to poor delineation of depressive symptoms from medical conditions and use of improper assessment tools. In particular, it has been hypothesized that the overlap of MS symptomatology and neurovegetative depression symptoms (e.g., fatigue, sleep disturbance, weight/appetite changes) on self-report questionnaires may lead to an over-diagnosis of depression in MS. Furthermore, assessment of depression in MS, or any medical sample, is problematic given the difficulty in ascertaining what is a suitable reaction and adequate adjustment to receiving a medical diagnosis and also the impact this has on mood and self-evaluation, both domains of depression as well.  Self-report measures may not be the most sensitive tools in delineating these factors but are nonetheless widely used.  Self-report measures may not be able to elucidate how patients interpret their medical symptoms or reactions to illness as depressive symptoms without being provided additional information beyond item endorsement. The proposed investigation attempts to explore this issue using a modification of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) that asks MS patients to further explain their endorsement of depressive symptoms and how their MS symptoms may contribute to such endorsement. Furthermore, the present investigation proposes to examine the utility of three common self-report instruments (Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Depression Inventory-Primary Care, Chicago Multiscale Depression Inventory) and resultant prevalence rates and recommended cutoffs when used with a MS sample.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3707], "author_name_tesi": "Strober, Lauren Beth", "last_name_ssi": "Strober", "middle_name_ssi": "Beth", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Andrew Arnett", "Thomas D Borkovec", "Robert M Stern", "Elizabeth Susman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Andrew Arnett, Committee Chair", "Thomas D Borkovec, Committee Member", "Robert M Stern, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Susman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Self-Report Measures", "Assessment", "Depression", "Multiple Sclerosis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DEPARTMENT STORE GEOGRAPHIES: \nEXPANSION AND CONSOLIDATION IN PHILADELPHIA\u2019S JOHN WANAMAKER AND STRAWBRIDGE & CLOTHIER, 1860-1960\n\n\n\n", "id": "8487", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6522", "abstract_tesi": "Consolidation in the retail sector continues to restructure the department store, and the legacies of earlier forms of the department store laid the foundation for this consolidation.

These studies have primarily focused on the thermodynamics and kinetics of RNA folding in conditions that are folding-favorable and non-physiological including dilute solution with relatively high ionic strength and Mg2+ ion concentrations. While these studies have imparted invaluable knowledge towards the understanding of RNA biophysics, there is still a great need to characterize RNA folding and function in conditions that are much closer to those of a cell; however, because of the intricacies of the cellular environment, elucidating meaningful biophysical properties from experiments directly in living cells remains difficult.  In an effort to capture the effects of this complex environment on RNA folding, in vitro experiments focusing on distinct features of the cellular environment are performed in attempt to learn how these specific properties of the cellular matrix impact RNA.  In this thesis, RNA structure, folding, and function are assessed from both a thermodynamic and kinetic prospective under conditions that mimic those of cells.  In particular, effects of compartmentalization, macromolecular crowding, and low molecular cosolutes are examined in terms of RNA catalysis and RNA folding using an array of techniques including RNA partitioning, ribozyme kinetics, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), structure mapping methods, and RNA folding thermodynamics.\nOne key aspect of cells is their ability to compartmentalize biomolecules; thus, allowing them to control local concentrations of these molecules.  In Chapter Two and Three of this thesis, it is revealed that local concentrations of RNA can be controlled using an aqueous two-phase system composed of two high molecular weight polymers.  Additionally, increasing the local concentration of an enzyme strand of a two-piece ribozyme within one of the aqueous phase compartments, leads to a significant enhancement in catalysis under single-turnover conditions.  This work indicates that compartmentalization could be very important for RNA function in modern cells as well as in RNA regulation and activation in early-earth protocells. \nAnother key factor of the cellular environment is the concentration of free Mg2+, which is only ~0.5 mM and ~2 mM in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, respectively.  These values are considerably lower than the free Mg2+ (~10 mM) typically used in RNA structure and folding studies in the literature.  Additionally, there are high concentrations of molecules (both high- and low-molecular weight) inside cells that can interact with RNA, exclude volume, and alter solvent conditions.  These molecules can have large impacts on RNA structure, folding, and function especially when Mg2+ concentrations are physiological. It is revealed in Chapter Four of this thesis that the self-cleavage of a small catalytic RNA, the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element\u2013binding protein 3 HDV-like ribozyme (CPEB3), is stimulated by high- and low-molecular weight molecules under physiological free Mg2+ concentrations.  Furthermore, SAXS experiments reveal compactness of the ribozyme under such conditions.  These findings suggest RNA structure-function-relationships that uniquely arise from cellular conditions.\nTo link the RNA folding pathway with RNA activity assays in cellular conditions, in Chapter Five, folding cooperativity of RNA was assessed in physiological concentrations of Mg2+, macromolecular crowders, and low molecular weight cosolutes. Through a combination of biophysical characterization and structure mapping techniques, it was found that tRNAPhe folding cooperativity increases in the presence of macromolecular crowding agents under physiological concentrations of Mg2+.  Conversely, in physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and low molecular weight cosolutes, tRNAPhe folding cooperativity is either increased or decreased depending on the identity of the cosolute.  These experiments demonstrate that cellular conditions increase the steepness of the unfolding transition for RNA and may possibly facilitate native RNA folding despite having low concentrations of free Mg2+.  The work presented in this thesis reveals the effects of the cellular environment on RNA structure, folding, and function and further strengthens the biological structure-function relationship that is so vital to RNA behavior.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9391], "author_name_tesi": "Strulson, Christopher A", "last_name_ssi": "Strulson", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

Discrete-event simulation is a tool that has been predominantly utilized in the manufacturing industry, logistical services, military branches, etc. However, lately an extensive amount of research on improving health care systems has involved discrete-event simulation studies. In this thesis a thorough literature review was conducted and when narrowing the scope to focus on improving inpatient flow at a hospital, the amount of analytical research conducted was limited. This thesis appreciates a range of complexities that are unique to inpatient hospitals and this is evident in the constructed simulation model that captures very specific details of the actual system, while keeping the stochastic nature of the uncertain processes that take place. Thanks to a collaboration with analysts, consultants, and clinical staff members at Geisinger Health System, the relevant facets of the daily processes were identified. Furthermore, a large set of masked data was provided to feed the simulation model with input data. To support this model a considerable amount of effort was spent on data analysis for the model inputs, as well as verification and validation of the model outputs. A set of experiments were conducted based on recent qualitative initiatives from health care industry literature. The main initiative that was explored and analyzed was the possibility of expediting patient discharges. Since most patients at inpatient hospitals are discharged sometime in the afternoon and the patient arrival rates often are high in the morning, patient wait times occur consequently. An experimental design was created to allow for a detailed analysis on the impact of expediting patient discharges.

Although the effects of biological clocks on physiology and behavior are readily observable, their mechanisms and pathways are only slowly being detailed. Certain adipokines, signaling proteins secreted by adipose tissue, including adiponectin and visfatin, may be important to timekeeping systems and act as signals of body condition influencing migratory decisions. Although these adipokines have been investigated in mammals, very few studies have utilized avian species, and currently no work has been published regarding Passerines. Our objectives were to examine circulating levels of both adiponectin and visfatin and to explore potential relationships between these adipokines and the seasonal transition   between the non-migratory and migratory life history stages. Captive white-throated sparrows were monitored, under constant photoperiod to rule out the influence of changing light:dark ratios, for changes in plasma levels of the two adipokines across a 24 hour period during the migratory and non-migratory stages. Examination of plasma adiponectin levels using Western blotting revealed that migrating individuals display different circadian patterns of plasma adiponectin compared with non-migrating individuals, which suggests a change in a biological clock regulating adipokine levels. Correlative evidence reveals a strong relationship between plasma adiponectin levels and amount of body fat and nighttime activity in migrating individuals, and mixed effects modeling estimates a reduction in high molecular weight adiponectin of approximately half in migrating individuals. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for visfatin concentration revealed a reduction of approximately 20% in plasma visfatin of migrating individuals. Although this seasonal reduction may be regulated by a circannual clock, we did not detect a circadian rhythm in plasma concentration in either non-migrating or migrating birds. Plasma visfatin did not vary with subcutaneous body fat.  Collectively, the results of these studies provide evidence that seasonal or daily differences in signal from adipokines may provide individuals with physiological information regarding fat deposits and might underlie the seasonal behavioral changes necessary for migration.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1748], "author_name_tesi": "Stuber, Erica ", "last_name_ssi": "Stuber", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Erica", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Allen Bartell", "Paul Allen Bartell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Allen Bartell, Thesis Advisor", "Paul Allen Bartell, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["circadian", "circannual", "migration", "behavior", "white-throated sparrow", "migration", "Biological clock", "adipokine", "adiponectin", "visfatin"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "\"a Contribution to Modern World Poetry\" Ernst Jandl and the International Avant-garde", "id": "21611", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9661", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation uses close textual analysis and unpublished archival material to explore the poetic internationalism of the Austrian experimental poet Ernst Jandl (1925-2000).

My dissertation traces the interrelations between Anglo-American modernism and Austrian post-war poetry, in order to re-situate Jandl within the context of 20th-century modernism. The contours of his experimental poetics are shaped by a lifelong reception of US-American avant-gardism, most prominently of authors and artists like Gertrude Stein, Charles Olson, and John Cage. Despite Jandl's popularity no monograph has yet been devoted to this phenomenon. In three main chapters that analyze the connection between experimental poetry and the international avant-gardes, my dissertation 1) maps the interrelations between Anglo-American modernism and Austrian post-World War II avant-garde poetry, 2) provides a comprehensive account of the integration of English-language literature into Jandl\u2019s work (published as well as unpublished), and 3) offers a re-appraisal of the semantic capabilities of experimental poetry in general and of Jandl\u2019s lyric \u0153uvre in particular. \nTransnational poetics \u2014 early 20th-century US-American avant-gardism \u2014 post-war Austrian poetry: By connecting these movements and by virtue of its interdisciplinary approach, my project forges links between scholarship on Austrian-American studies, modernism, literary theory, post-war literature, and experimental art more broadly.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9421], "author_name_tesi": "Stuckatz, Katja ", "last_name_ssi": "Stuckatz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Katja", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Martina Kolb", "Prof Martina Kolb", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Adrian Johannes Wanner", "Prof Stefan Matuschek"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof Martina Kolb, Dissertation Advisor", "Prof Martina Kolb, Committee Chair", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Member", "Adrian Johannes Wanner, Committee Member", "Prof Stefan Matuschek, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Jandl", "Austrian poetry", "German-language poetry", "experimental poetry", "post-World War II", "avant-garde"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "CRYSTAL LATTICE OPTIMIZATION AND NEW FORMS OF SILICON", "id": "7002", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1534", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In Chapter 1 a basic outline of the two main methods used in this thesis is given.  A genetic algorithm optimization method based on the concept of natural selection is given.  The important factors to consider in creating an effective genetic algorithm search are described.  I then give a brief overview of Density Functional Theory (DFT) which is the technique most commonly used to do ab-inito calculations on solid-state systems.  The basis for its formulation along with how it is applied to a practical system with some approximations is discussed.  \n\n\nIn Chapter 2 a description of a genetic search algorithm for optimizing the crystal structure of an infinite crystal is given.  This method is applied to a system of colloidal spheres, where the packing density is the figure of merit for structure selection.  Our examination of self-assembled multi-component crystals of nanoparticles predicts\nseveral new structures with stoichiometries of $AB$ (fused spheres),\n$ABC_{2}$, $ABC_{3}$, $ABC_{4}$ and $AB_{2}C_{2}$. These new\nstructures have hierarchical layered or linear arrangements that could\nbe useful for functional self-assembled systems.  For example, the\nfused-sphere binary crystal assembles with zig-zag rows of parallel\nnanowires. The genetic search suceeds while a comparable stochastic\nalgorithm fails to find any structures better than the well-known\nunary or binary phase-separated systems.  \nHere we describe the algorithm and the\nresults it produces: several new classes of binary and ternary\ncrystals of spherical nanoparticles, including a family of layered\nperovskite-like systems and an unusual three-dimensional array of\nparallel zig-zag nanowires. \n\n\nIn Chapter 3, We discuss the possibility of constructing new forms of silicon by building in multiple bonds consistent with molecules that have been produced experimentally.  We find a dilated diamond crystal lattice containing a silicon-silicon triple bond that is metastable.  This structure has very soft vibrational modes that are common in similar structures with buckled bonds (similar to quarts).  The crystal may be stabilized by synthesizing in a rare gas environment, where a mixture of krypton and neon or helium may work best. \nConstructing a crystal lattice out of the trisilaallene central region leads to an unstable crystal structure.  The main reason for this instability is due to the flexibility in the location of the sp-hybridized atom.  Relaxing this structure leads to a new $sp^2$-$sp^3$ hybrid structure.  There are a family of structures with ribbons of graphitic silicon held together by sp3 silicon atoms.  The ribbon width can be increased to lead towards more graphitic silicon-like results.  Graphitic silicon is predicted to be stabilized under negative pressure.  Due to the similarity to graphitic silicon, we expect this family of structures may be stabilized in an environment of negative pressure as well..", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1519], "author_name_tesi": "Stucke, David Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Stucke", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi", "Jainendra Jain", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Chair", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Global Optimization", "Genetic Algorithm", "Crystal Structure", "Silicon Multiple Bonds"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Healing from Dry Bones:  Creative Expression and Adult Learning in Diabetes Care", "id": "7507", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2222", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Because of the complexity and individuality of people, the nature of knowing and teaching in patient education cannot be reduced to \u201cthe kinds of recipes as used in the physical sciences\u201d (William, 2002, p. 54).  Neither can we assume that the recipe we are using is working for all, or even, at all.  As health care educators, we need to be open to explore and to meet the needs of the patient learners.  This is not going to happen in one way, or a \u201cright\u201d way.  Alternative (creative) ways of knowing lead to other, multiple methods of inquiry to understand the teaching and learning process in patient education.   \n\nThe primary purpose of this action research study was to understand how adults make meaning of and experience diabetes, and to use multiple ways of knowing in the integration of diabetes care.  The two research questions which formed the basis of this study were:  \u201cHow do adults make meaning of their Type 1 diabetes?\u201d and \u201cWhat are the ways in which adults with diabetes could engage in creative expression to find greater meaning?\u201d   The action research was informed by a constructive postmodern and feminist poststructural perspective, where there is not one overriding, great Truth, but many truths as defined and experienced by the learners themselves (Foucault, 1980; St. Pierre, 2000; Tisdell, 1998).  As they incorporate creative ways of knowing into their understanding of \u201ctheir shifting selves,\u201d learners experience opportunities for growth and development of their own identity and meaning. \n \nThe qualitative model which informed this study was an action research design, held with a group of seven women (eight, including myself), who had insulin-dependent diabetes for ten years or more.  In addition to an initial planning stage using one-on-one interviews, the action research included three group intervention and reflection meetings, and one final reflection session as a conclusion (five meetings total).  During the initial planning phase, participants discussed two primary questions in a narrative style of interviewing:  (a) Tell me about your diagnosis, and (b) What types of activities do you enjoy outside of work?   Based upon the results of these questions, the intervention (the action or implementation of the plan) included the body as a way of knowing through the use of meditation and understanding how one felt about having diabetes, forming those feelings into a simple image, and using that image to create metaphor and words to describe the experience of diabetes.  Transforming those metaphors and images into photographs, participants expressed what they \u201cknew\u201d about diabetes on multiple levels.  \n\nAlthough participants initially could not express what having diabetes was like during the initial interviewing process and planning stage, after going through the action research process, participants could clearly communicate the experience of diabetes using the metaphor they created during the sessions.  Paying attention to all aspects of knowing within the mind-body-spirit is important not only to those with diabetes, but the field of adult education as a whole.  Following the work of many who write in adult education about the multiple ways adults construct knowledge, this research expands the understanding of how adults with diabetes come to learn, feel and know about their experience, and for others to learn how to use multiple modalities in teaching and learning.  By using the body to process knowledge, and imagery as its product, we can help students understand more about themselves (and ourselves) than using a rational, linear approach alone.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2203], "author_name_tesi": "Stuckey, Heather L.", "last_name_ssi": "Stuckey", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Glen Alan Mazis", "Irene C Baird", "Robert A Gabbay"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Chair", "Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Member", "Glen Alan Mazis, Committee Member", "Irene C Baird, Committee Member", "Robert A Gabbay, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ways of knowing", "creative expression", "adult learning", "health care", "patient care", "action research", "chronic illness", "diabetes", "postmodern", "poststructural"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Rigorous and Explicit Determination of Hyperbolic Exponents and Reserves in Gas Decline Analysis", "id": "25249", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11048", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reservoir evaluation based on rate-time data of gas wells producing under boundary-dominated flow (BDF) is often performed using the Arps\u2019 empirical hyperbolic decline model and associated type-curves.

Two cement systems were utilized in these experiments:  tetralcium phosphate (TetCP) with dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPA) and b-tricalcium phosphate (b-TCP).

One of the major goals of the 1996 welfare reforms was to reduce non-marital fertility as a means of reducing welfare dependence. However, some groups feared that efforts to limit non-marital fertility would lead to an increase in abortion. Moreover, economic theory suggests that strict welfare and abortion policies may be working at cross purposes with one another.  In general, I find that states with more stringent abortion policies tended to adopt more stringent family formation related welfare polices; however, stringent state welfare and abortion policies were only mildly correlated over this time period (r = 0.11).  Moreover, I find some evidence to suggest that state policy stringency summary scores may be a better means of examining the effects of state policy stringency than estimating the effects of specific individual policies.

Each chapter demonstrates (1) how farmers from these four regions responded to environmental problems like soil exhaustion and deforestation; (2) how writers from each region expressed a new ecological anxiety about the waste of natural resources; and (3) how these writers employed different modes of literary persuasion to promote a more permanent sense of place and a more sustainable system of land management. In other words, my study tells the story of an early American environmental movement. Typically, historians trace the roots of American conservation to a later date, often to the work of George Perkins Marsh or Gifford Pinchot, while literary critics privilege the writings of Henry David Thoreau or John Muir, but I find a similar environmental conscience in the early national era. Through new readings of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Timothy Dwight, David Humphreys, J.

These \u201cfounding farmers\u201d cultivated a vision of sustainable agriculture that later inspired the Populist Party of the late-nineteenth century; in the twentieth century, their ideas resurfaced among neo-agrarian writers who began to challenge industrial agriculture; and today, the same core values have shaped the contemporary local-foods movement.

A range of microreactor systems have been presented including polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) reactors, Teflon capillary based reactors, all glass reactors, and PDMS-glass hybrid reactors. The construction and evaluation of a translatable visible spectrometer is demonstrated. This enables absorbance spectrum to be acquired at designated spatial locations on a microreactor.\n\nAll glass microreactors were coupled to the translatable spectrometer to quantify the nucleation and growth of cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanoparticles.

Two of the remaining frontiers in this area of research focus on diffusion and solubility of solvents in polymer below the glass transition temperature and in semi-crystalline polymers.  This work has extended the work of Vrentas and Duda1, Michaels and Hausselin2 and Doong and Ho3 in those areas. \nThis work provides an in depth investigation into the effect the crystalline regions within semi-crystalline polymers have on both solubility and diffusion. Michaels and Hausselin attributed the decrease in solubility with temperature within of semi-crystalline polymers to polymer chains that extend across the amorphous region and tether two crystalline regions together. Doong and Ho extended the theory of Michaels and Hausselin to be used in combination with the UNIFAC group contribution method. Using a similar approach to that of Doong and Ho, this work investigates the amount of tie chains within various forms of polyethylene and has found two correlations that agree with mechanical experiments such as the brittle fracture experiments of Brown  et al.4 The first is that the amount of tie chains increase for polyethylene that was polymerized with a comonomer such as 1-butene or 1-hexene when compared to that of a linear high density polyethylene homopolymer. The second correlation indicates that polyethylene that is crystallized significantly below the melt temperature has more tie chains than the same polyethylene crystallized near the melt temperature. This was shown in solubility experiments conducted on granules directly from a gas phase polymerization reactor. A new theory for diffusion in semi-crystalline polyethylene based on Vrentas and Duda\u2019s free-volume theory is shown to accurately capture the effect of temperature, solvent concentration, and the amount of crystallinity on diffusion.\nThe volumetric behavior of polymers abruptly changes below the glass transition temperature. This change in volumetric behavior creates a deviation between experimental diffusion coefficients and the diffusion coefficients predicted by Vrentas and Duda\u2019s original free-volume theory. This work uses the model of Vrentas and Vrentas5 for diffusion below the glass transition temperature as a basis for a new modification of Vrentas and Duda\u2019s free-volume theory. This is shown to accurately predict diffusion below and above the glass transition temperature of solvents in HPMCAS. To apply this work to the spray drying of HPMCAS, a model was derived to capture the drying of a droplet containing HPMCAS and solvent. Using the diffusion coefficients determined by the modified free-volume theory, the droplet drying model accurately predicts when the droplets shape deviates from being spherical. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14569], "author_name_tesi": "Sturm, Derek R", "last_name_ssi": "Sturm", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Derek", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ronald P.

With this knowledge, simulations with adjustable parameters were injected into a well controlled background of white noise. The efficacy of each data analysis method was probed with respect to simulation signal type, frequency, duration and amplitude.  The efficiency measurements from these simulations illuminated the signal preferences of each method and served as a baseline to investigate the effect of varying the signals' time-domain properties while holding their frequency-domain magnitude constant.

Storybooks are losing their historical role in \u201chelping children navigate the intellectual, social, and emotional terrains of childhood (Cooper, 2007, p.315). Play, as children's leading activity (Vygotsky, 1967), is experiencing the same downward trend. This thesis is an attempt to reveal the potential effects of both children\u2019s literature and play on children\u2019s social and emotional development. Specifically, it examines play activities depicted in picture books and analyzes the self-regulatory behaviors of child characters operating during the play process. Forty picture books are selected for this study. They include books depicting children\u2019s relationships with adult family members, with siblings, with adults outside the family, as well as children's relationships with their peers. The theoretical guidance for the study is Vygotsky\u2019s social learning theory and his notion of the psychology of play. The analysis of the books focuses on how they depict play and self-regulation, and how play is related to the development of self-regulation. The findings show that in these picture books, play is depicted as helping children learn self-regulation. Some of the functions are as follows: to some child characters, play is a culturally acceptable way of expressing and releasing feelings; some child characters achieve emotional self-regulation by deriving a sense of autonomy from play activities; play also makes egocentric, dominant children abide by the rules of sharing or mutual respect and motivates submissive, weak children to stand\nup for themselves. In addition, play is a training ground where children can safely make and learn to correct their mistakes. The role of other people (family members, other adults, or peers) is also analyzed as a possible factor in children's mastery of self-regulation. The findings show that other people may serve as the more knowledgeable others who guide children to achieve self-regulation; they may also simply be playmates who monitor the child characters\u2019 behaviors. Based on the findings, this study advocates using selected picture books in classrooms to help children learn self-regulation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4409], "author_name_tesi": "Su, Min ", "last_name_ssi": "Su", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade", "Daniel Dean Hade", "Vivian Yenika Agbaw", "James Ewald Johnson", "Richard Fiene"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Dean Hade, Committee Chair", "Vivian Yenika Agbaw, Committee Chair", "James Ewald Johnson, Committee Member", "Richard Fiene, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["picture books", "social learning", "self-regulation", "play"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A QUALITATIVE STUDY TO IDENTIFY CORPORATE RECRUITERS\u2019 COMPETENCIES IN WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES", "id": "4f16c281g", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12702", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although it has been nearly 25 years since the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law and 40 years since the Rehabilitation Act became the first civil rights law in the United States to guarantee equal opportunity for people with disabilities, there remains a wide employment gap between people with disabilities and those without (Barrington, Bruy\u00e8re & Waelder, 2014).  On August 27, 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) released final regulations outlining changes to Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 503 requires federal contractors and subcontractors to engage in affirmative action practices regarding recruitment, hiring, promotion, and retention of protected individuals with disabilities. The most effective ways to recruit, hire, and retain talented employees with disabilities has become a critical issue in the human resources management field. In this study, ten disability inclusion experts from three different occupational areas (e.g., recruiters, professionals in the disability employment field, and support employment specialists) participated in semi-structured interviews based on the behavioral event interview technique to identify corporate recruiters\u2019 competencies in working with people with disabilities in the United States.

Human mEH gene expression is subjected to the regulation of alternative promoter usage generating multiple transcripts, including the most prevalent, termed E1b and E1. These transcripts possess distinct untranslated first exons but encode identical mEH protein given that the second exon contains the translation initiation site. E1b is ubiquitously expressed at high levels in all tissues while E1 is selectively expressed in the liver. Although several liver-specific transcription factors were characterized previously as involved in the regulation of E1 transcription, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism regulating E1b expression. Study of those underlying processes is the principle focus of these investigations. \nInitially in these studies we sought to identify the key transcription factors responsible for controlling the constitutive expression of the E1b transcript. Sequence analysis of E1b proximal promoter revealed several potential Sp1/Sp3 binding sites. Site-directed mutagenesis of these motifs established their roles in regulating E1b promoter activities. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses demonstrated that both Sp1 and Sp3 are bound to the proximal promoter region of E1b. Silencing, or knockdown of Sp1 expression using siRNA had no detectable effect on the endogenous E1b transcriptional level. However, knockdown of Sp3 greatly diminished E1b expression in several different human cell lines. These results demonstrated that Sp3 in particular was involved in regulating the basal expression patterns of the mEH E1b variant transcript.\nSecondly, following analysis of DNase I hypersensitivity data available in the ENCODE project, we identified and characterized two intronic DNA elements in the mEH genomic region. This led to the discovery that the master oxidative stress regulator, Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) functioned as a mediator of E1b upregulation in lung cancer-derived cells. Results obtained from both luciferase gene reporter and ChIP assays indicated that Nrf2 interacts with the 2nd intronic DNA element following its activation with the antioxidants, sulforaphane or tBHQ. DNA sequence analysis of the enhancer region together with electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) enabled the identification of a conserved antioxidant-response element within the enhancer that appeared to mediate these transcriptional responses. \nFinally in these studies, we sought to characterize differences in the transcriptional responses of the E1b and E1 promoters in hepatoma cell lines and human normal hepatocytes to chemical mediators. Nrf2 siRNA knockdown studies in hepatoma C3A cells were performed to identify the Nrf2 signaling pathway as functional in mediating the activation effects contributed by the monofunctional inducers, sulforaphane and tBHQ, to both of E1b and E1 promoters. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that these effects were localized to the 2nd intronic enhancer element. However, bifunctional inducers exhibited considerable differences in their regulation of E1b and E1 transcript expression. Treatment with 3-MC, an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist, induced E1b expression but inhibited E1. Another bifunctional inducer, \u03b2-naphthoflavone (\u03b2-NF) upregulated both E1b and E1 whereas 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) treatment resulted in decreased E1 expression (similar to 3-MC), yet had no discernible effect on expression of E1b. Further studies with 6,2',4'-trimethoxyflavone (TMF), an AhR antagonist, together with Nrf2 siRNA, suggested that both AhR and Nrf2 signaling pathways contribute to the regulation of the E1b and E1 promoters mediated by bifunctional AhR agonists. As well, these effects were comparatively evaluated in human hepatoma HepG2 and Huh7 cells, in human primary hepatocytes and in human lung BEAS-2B cells.\nOverall, this thesis research successfully identified and defined multiple levels of molecular interaction that contribute to the regulation of the dual gene promoter usage characterizing human mEH gene expression. The results contributed through these investigations provide important advances in our core understanding of the complex genetic regulatory schemes controlling the dual promoter usage and tissue-selective expression character underlying the functional biology and toxicological roles of human mEH.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8419], "author_name_tesi": "Su, Shengzhong ", "last_name_ssi": "Su", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shengzhong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Toxicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Curtis John Omiecinski", "Curtis John Omiecinski", "Adam Bleier Glick", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Joshua D Lambert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Curtis John Omiecinski, Dissertation Advisor", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Committee Chair", "Adam Bleier Glick, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microsomal epoxide hydrolase", "Nrf2", "Xenobiotic metabolism", "Bioactivation", "Lung cancer", "Sp1", "Sp3", "AhR"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Traffic Engineering and Time-varying Convex Optimization", "id": "9324", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6558", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Computer network traffic engineering aims at providing algorithms supporting Traffic Engineering (TE) for resource optimization (multi-path load balancing), Quality of Service (QoS), and Fast Failure Recovery (FFR) (dealing with link/node failures). This dissertation addresses two computer network traffic engineering problems: the multi-domain traffic engineering problem, and the overlay network traffic engineering problem. The solutions provided have their basis on nonlinear control theory. More precisely, they use concepts from sliding mode theory.\n\nThe motivation for the study of the multi-domain traffic engineering problem comes from the increasing demand for the Internet to provide rich service quality features in support of sophisticated applications at a global scale, including TE, QoS, and FFR. We believe that, to be deployable at a global scale and to be integrated into the basic Internet architecture, a successful solution for a multi-domain environment must be distributed by design and in line with the distributed, two-level routing structure, and hop-by-hop forwarding paradigm of today\u2019s Internet. In this dissertation, as a first\nbut critical step toward finding such a solution, we develop a well-grounded theoretical underpinning for it. This family of control laws proposed for a multi-domain environment enables QoS-based TE and FFR features by performing per-hop edge-to-edge based traffic control at two levels (i.e., inter-domain and intra-domain), in alignment with the two-level routing structure and hop-by-hop forwarding paradigm of the Internet.\n\nBesides the multi-domain traffic engineering problem, we also address the overlay traffic engineering problem. Again, the approach used in the development of the control laws is based on the sliding mode theory. An overlay network, built at network application layer, is another prominent approach to provide QoS feature in the current best-effort Internet infrastructure. Given an overlay network, the goal of overlay network traffic engineering problems is to distribute traffic among available overlay paths\nin order to optimize the use of time-varying network resources. Due to the presence of time-varying network resources (link capacity), as well as the feasible set and the set of optimal solutions being time-varying, the problem is fundamentally a time-varying optimization problem and different from the problems previously addressed in the literature. And in this dissertation, we are able to find a new family of control laws, which addresses the time-varying problem. The family of control laws presented in this dissertation is shown to converge to the optimal (time-varying) traffic allocation and uses only the number of congested links in a forwarding path as feedback for the control, making it an ideal traffic control solution for the overlay network.\n\nSince the overlay network traffic engineering problem is a time-varying optimization problem, we also extend our research to more general time-varying optimization problems. For the problem with a twice differentiable strictly convex objective function, a Continuous First Order Algorithm (CFoA) is proposed. Moreover, in order to achieve \u201csmoother\u201d behavior than the CFoA, a Continuous Second Order Algorithm (CSoA) is also proposed. Both the CFoA and CSoA are shown to converge to and track the timevarying\noptimum. For a subclass of strictly convex objective functions having derivatives with \u201clinear\u201d discontinuity, a Sliding Algorithm (SA) is proposed, which is shown to converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the time-varying optimum. Moreover, the SA is applied to solve time-varying linearly constrained optimization problems, and sufficient conditions for asymptotical convergence of the SA are provided.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6556], "author_name_tesi": "Su, Wenjing ", "last_name_ssi": "Su", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenjing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Lagoa", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Tom Michael Cavalier", "George Kesidis", "Ji Woong Lee", "Mario Sznaier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Lagoa, Dissertation Advisor", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Chair", "Tom Michael Cavalier, Committee Member", "George Kesidis, Committee Member", "Ji Woong Lee, Committee Member", "Mario Sznaier, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["traffic engineering", "optimization", "time-varying optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Investigating the interplay of intrinsic to extrinsic factors influencing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease progression", "id": "22400", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10322", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem and motor cortex. The disease induces paralysis, and death results from respiratory failure. The pathogenesis of ALS begins before a diagnosis can be made in the clinic. Analyzing processes influencing disease progression is an important strategy to elucidate disease mechanisms. We investigated factors influencing ALS disease progression, using the framework that the interplay of a range of extrinsic and intrinsic factors determine phenotypes. Our analysis of intrinsic, genetic factors focused on the H63D polymorphism in the HFE iron regulatory gene. Our results suggest homozygosity for H63D HFE is correlated with approximately 2-year longer disease duration and decreased levels of soluble superoxide dismutase protein in patients with ALS. We propose H63D HFE causes mild endoplasmic reticulum stress, which increases the risk for ALS but also promotes adaptive mechanisms that prolong survival in those who develop ALS. Studies analyzing intermediate factors focused on protein biomarkers. We measured 35 biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of patients with ALS, and created models predicting ALS prognosis based on biomarkers panels comprised of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and iron metabolism markers. We then focused on ferritin, which correlated with longer disease duration in our models. Our results suggest ferritin is elevated in the blood of patients with ALS versus healthy controls and those with non-ALS neurological diseases. We propose elevated ferritin in ALS patients is an adaptive response to oxidative damage. Studies analyzing extrinsic factors focused on pharmacotherapies. Our results suggest HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), which are commonly prescribed to manage cholesterol, adversely impact phenotype in ALS model mice.

Firstly, we fabricated theranostic nanoparticles from a unique biodegradable photoluminescent poly (lactic acid) (BPLP-PLA), which inherently possesses strong tunable fluorescence, biodegradability, and cytocompatibility. In order to minimize the damage of cancer drugs to carrier immune cells and other healthy cells, a BRAF V600E mutant melanoma specific drug (PLX4032) was loaded into BPLP-PLA nanoparticles. Muramyl tripeptide (MTP) was also conjugated onto the nanoparticles in order to improve the nanoparticle loading efficiency. The resulting nanoparticles were internalized within macrophages, which were tracked via the intrinsic fluorescence of BPLP-PLA to demonstrate potential in imaging-based diagnosis and therapy.

However, several applications are limited by the lack of a gap in graphene\u2019s electronic structure. Among the methods of opening this bandgap, chemical modification has been deemed plausible theoretically and has been achieved with varying success experimentally. \nIn this dissertation we cover four main topics regarding graphene chemical modification: i) we model the energetics of adatom bonding with Density Functional Theory (DFT), ii) we use DFT to explore the effect of electronic and hole doping of graphene on adatom bonding and diffusion, iii) we describe the mechanisms behind the interactions between an adatom and graphene with tight-binding models that describe electron correlations beyond mean field approximations, and iv) we present a Monte Carlo model for simulating clustering behavior in partially functionalized graphene. We focus on atomic hydrogen, fluorine, and oxygen in these studies. \nIn the DFT study of adatom bonding energetics (Chapter 2), we find that hydrogen and fluorine attach directly above carbon atoms with chemisorption energies of -0.8 eV and -1.8 eV respectively. Hydrogen has an attachment barrier of 0.2 eV while fluorine attaches with no barrier. For both monovalent adatoms, the carbon below puckers away from the graphene plane, showing evidence of sp3 hybridization. Overlapping partial densities of states between the adatom and the underlying carbon show that the bond is covalent. A net magnetization localized around the adsorption site arises upon the adsorption of hydrogen, though no such polarization is seen for fluorine. The equilibrium position for oxygen on the surface lies above a C\u2013C bond with both neighboring carbon atoms puckering above the plane. Diffusion calculations show energy barriers of 1.2 eV, 0.35 eV, and 0.73 eV for hydrogen, fluorine, and oxygen, respectively. Zero-point energies turn out to be non-negligible for hydrogen kinetics, though desorption is found to be more likely than diffusion both with and without these corrections. \nIn the study of charge effects on adatom bonding (Chapter 3), we find a drastic lowering (from 0.74 eV to 0.15 eV) of the diffusion barrier for oxygen on graphene under electron doping (7.64\u00d7\u301610\u3017^13 cm^(-2)). Such a large drop in the energy barrier corresponds to an increase in diffusivity of over nine orders of magnitude. Analyzing the partial densities for the atoms involved shows a weakening of the bonds in the equilibrium position and strengthening of bonds in the transition state as evidence for the drop in the energy barrier. In the case of hydrogen, electron doping suppresses the magnetization localized around the adsorption site. Electronic charging of the graphene plane is also found to change the bonding between fluorine and graphene from largely covalent to largely ionic. \nIn Chapter 4, we present a Hubbard-like tight-binding model for fluorine on graphene that shows that the mechanism of the sp2-sp3 hybridization crossover arises from a competition between electrostatic interactions and C\u2013F hybridization. A similar model is applied to the hydrogen\u2013graphene system; the magnetic moment formation localized around the adsorption site is explained by a balance between hybridization and intra-atomic coulomb interactions. The model is expanded to include correlations within a small cluster around the adsorption site. This Minimal Anderson Hubbard Model (MAHM) explains the dependence of the magnetization in the H\u2013graphene system on the C\u2013H hybridization, the H site energy, and the H Hubbard term; the model reaffirms the results gained from mean-field calculations.  \nA tight-binding model is proposed in Chapter 5 to explain the paramagnetic response in fluorinated graphene measured in recent experiments. Odd-numbered bare graphene clusters surrounded by fluorinated sites are hypothesized to contribute magnetic moments to the system within this model. Several adsorption models are proposed to simulate graphene fluorination from 1% to nearly 100% coverage. An Ising-like Monte Carlo model including adatom diffusion effects is found to yield odd-numbered cluster concentrations which coincide closely with experimental magnetic moment measurements. \nLastly, Chapter 6 proposes future projects on modeling the effect of a substrate on local charging of graphene and its subsequent effect on adatom diffusion. The effect of charged impurities at the SiO2\u2013graphene interface is discussed as well as the effect of applying fields across inhomogeneous substrates with differing dielectric constants.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7631], "author_name_tesi": "Suarez, Alejandro M", "last_name_ssi": "Suarez", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Alejandro", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Jun Zhu", "Milton Walter Cole", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Dissertation Advisor", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Chair", "Jun Zhu, Committee Member", "Milton Walter Cole, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["graphene", "adsorption", "surface science", "density functional theory", "DFT", "graphane", "fluorographene", "graphene oxide"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "USE OF DISTILLERS GRAINS IN\nPRECISION-FED DAIRY HEIFERS\n\n", "id": "12089", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1997", "abstract_tesi": "Objectives of this study were to determine effects of feeding differing forage to concentrate ratios (F:C) and corn dry distillers grain with solubles (DDGS) inclusion rates on digestion, rumen fermentation and chewing activities, in precision\u2013fed dairy heifer rations.

Eight rumen cannulated Holstein heifers (12.5 \u00b1 0.5 mo and 344 \u00b1 15 kg, age and BW, respectively) housed in individual stalls were allocated to 2 F:C (50:50 LF or 75:25 HF; DM basis) and to a sequence of DDGS inclusion (0, 7, 14 and 21%; DM basis). Forage was a mix of 50% corn silage and 50% grass hay (DM basis). Diets were fed to allow for 800 g/d BW gain and fed 1X/d. Chewing behavior was visually monitored for 48 h at 5\u2013min intervals. Rumen contents were sampled at \u20132, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 h after feeding for pH determination. Total rumen evacuation was performed at \u20132 and 5 h after feeding. Statistical analyses were conducted using the MIXED procedure of SAS. DMI linearly decreased as DDGS increased (6.6 to 6.1 \u00b1 0.1 kg/d; P < 0.01). LF rations had greater apparent digestibility (AD) of DM (66.7 vs. 63.2 \u00b1 0.8%; P = 0.02) and OM (69.0 vs. 65.2 \u00b1 0.6%; P < 0.01). AD responded quadratically for DM, OM, ADF and NDF with 14% DDGS inclusion level having the highest values.

Acetate to propionate ratio decreased as DDGS increased (3.5 to 3.1 \u00b1 0.1; P < 0.01). Rumen protozoa count decreased as DDGS increased (24.4 to 11.9 \u00b1 3.2 \u00d7 104/mL; P < 0.01). No differences were found for rumen pH, and bacterial CP flow estimated by purine derivatives.

Total chewing time tended to be longer for HF (593 vs. 516 \u00b1 28 min/d; P = 0.10) and to increase linearly as DDGS increased (553 to 579 \u00b1 23 min/d; P = 0.09).

Ammonia concentration and molar proportion of propionate increased; while molar concentration of acetate, acetate to propionate ratio, and rumen protozoa number decreased with increasing levels of DDGS. LF rations had greater DM and OM AD. Total chewing time increased by the addition of DDGS and higher F:C. DDGS influenced ruminating time with no effect on eating time while F:C affected eating time. Higher F:C increased rumen digesta weight and volume. Forage and DDGS levels did not affect rumen pH. Moderate levels (14% of DM) of DDGS appear to be more suitable for use in dairy heifer rations yielding the highest digestibility, however with a decrease in nitrogen retention.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1980], "author_name_tesi": "Suarez, Francisco Xavier", "last_name_ssi": "Suarez", "middle_name_ssi": "Xavier", "first_name_ssi": "Francisco", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Thesis Advisor", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["dairy", "rumen", "distillers", "heifer"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Particle size of calf starter: Effects on digestive system development and rumen fermentation", "id": "23556", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10671", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Starter intake before weaning is the conditional factor to calf rumen development and thus to a successful transition at weaning. Rumen development can be negatively affected when the particle size of starter is too small, resulting in abnormal papillae and hyper-keratinization of the rumen epithelium. Two common strategies to increase particle size of starter are to reduce the processing of grain or to add forage to the diet. This dissertation had the objective to study the effects of forage particle size on rumen fermentation and rumen development at an early age. A secondary objective was to review the literature in regard to the effects of providing forage on starter intake.\nThe effects of grain processing in calf starter were evaluated in pre-weaned calves fed either an all pelleted starter or a starter containing identical ingredients but composed of 75% pellets and 25% whole oats. With subtle changes in rumen volatile fatty acid contents and no effects on rumen pH, grinding oats did not affect rumen fermentation, but tended to increase reticulorumen weight and papillae length. \nThe effects of increasing the particle size of calf starter by changing the particle length of forage (straw; 5% of dry feed) were evaluated in young calves. Minimal changes were detected in rumen fermentation, while rumen development parameters, rumen digesta particle size, starch, and pH of feces were not affected by diet particle size. Omasum size decreased as particle size increased, although the implications of this are not yet understood. \n\tCalf intake response to forage addition is affected by ingredient and chemical composition, forage source, particle size of starter and forage, and intake level. Intake should be segregated by week, particularly for pre-weaned vs. post-weaned periods as the response to forage addition will change as intake increases with age. Increasing the particle size of starter by feeding 25% whole oats or by changing the particle size of forage (5% of dry feed) resulted in minimal changes in rumen fermentation and rumen development. Possibly, particle size changes where too subtle for the starch content of the starters, which overshadowed particle size effects.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10303], "author_name_tesi": "Suarez, Francisco Xavier", "last_name_ssi": "Suarez", "middle_name_ssi": "Xavier", "first_name_ssi": "Francisco", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Kevin D Harvatine", "Chad Daniel Dechow", "R J Van Saun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Dissertation Advisor", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Committee Chair", "Kevin D Harvatine, Committee Member", "Chad Daniel Dechow, Committee Member", "R J Van Saun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rumen development", "calf", "volatile fatty acids", "pH", "oats", "straw"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Observations of Wave-turbulence Interactions Impacting the Stable Boundary Layer Over Central Pennsylvania", "id": "19958", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8690", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The impact of wave-turbulence interactions in the stable boundary layer is investigated using observations from a special observing network located at Rock Springs, PA.  Internal gravity waves can affect the evolution and destruction of valley cold pools and produce intermittent turbulence through the modification of momentum and thermal fluxes and nonlinear phenomena (such as wave breaking or rotors).  Thus, their study is crucial for improving air quality modeling and hazard predictions under stable conditions.\nSix cases, characterized by nonstationarity and complex, near-surface circulations in the stable boundary layer, are identified during the spring-fall season of 2011.  These cases include three synoptic regimes for which gravity waves are hypothesized.  The first regime is characterized by westerly or northwesterly flow and trapped gravity waves excited by the Allegheny Mts.  The second regime is characterized by a strong southerly wind component and trapped lee waves excited by Tussey Ridge.  Finally, the third regime is characterized by southerly flow, weak synoptic forcing and weak near-mountain-top shear.  Network measurements for the third regime suggest the presence of downslope windstorm-like motions.\nObservational evidence for the existence of two types of wave-turbulence interactions, resembling that of Type 1 (associated with trapped waves) and Type 2 (associated with hydraulic-jump type events) rotor circulations, impacting the Rock Springs network are presented.  It is also shown that periods of warming are typically associated with downward motion, reduced Richardson number, enhanced turbulence, positive vertical heat flux and large directional shifts (up to 180\u00ba).  The largest temperature and wind speed fluctuations are associated with cases hypothesized to have the strongest nonlinear behavior.  Analysis of 2-m turbulence confirms that the Richardson number is not a good measurement of stability for cases characterized by gravity wave activity.  Turbulence and positive vertical heat fluxes are observed during periods when Richardson number is much greater than 1. \n     In this study, observational evidence of the presence of complex wave-turbulence interactions generated by moderately complex topography (<300 m AGL) is presented.

Intermittent turbulence, generated by submeso motions and/or the waves, can affect the atmospheric transport and dispersion of pollutants and hazardous materials. Thus, the study of these motions and the mechanisms through which they impact the weakly to very stable SBL is crucial for improving air quality modeling and hazard predictions.\n\tIt is important to note that while gravity waves and rotors have been thoroughly studied through theoretical, observational, and idealized modeling studies, little still is known about the response of nonstationary and nonlinear waves for real cases under typical SBL conditions, and about the impact of different wave behaviors on rotor development and evolution, and the generation of intermittent low-level turbulence. Consequently in this thesis, the effects of waves and rotor circulations on submeso and turbulence variability within the SBL is investigated over the moderate terrain of central Pennsylvania using special observations from a network deployed at Rock Springs, PA and high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model forecasts. The investigation of waves and rotors over central PA is important because 1) the moderate topography of this region is common to most of the eastern US and thus the knowledge acquired from this study can be of significance to a large population, 2) there have been little evidence of complex wave structures and rotors reported for this region,   and 3) little is known about the waves and rotors generated by smaller and more moderate topographies. Six case studies exhibiting an array of wave and rotor structures are analyzed. Observational evidence of the presence of complex wave structures, resembling nonstationary trapped gravity waves and downslope windstorms, and complex rotor circulations, resembling trapped and jump-type rotors, is presented. These motions and the mechanisms through which they modulate the SBL are further investigated using high-resolution WRF forecasts.\n\tFirst, the efficacy of the 0.444-km horizontal grid spacing WRF model to reproduce submeso and meso-gamma motions, generated by waves and rotors and hypothesized to impact the SBL, is investigated using a new wavelet-based verification methodology for assessing non-deterministic model skill in the submeso and meso-gamma range to complement standard deterministic measures. This technique allows the verification and/or intercomparison of any two nonstationary stochastic systems without many of the limitations of typical wavelet-based verification approaches (e.g., selection of noise models, testing for significance, etc.). Through this analysis, it is shown that the WRF model largely underestimates the number of small amplitude fluctuations in the small submeso range, as expected; and it overestimates the number of small amplitude fluctuations in the meso-gamma range, generally resulting in forecasts that are too smooth. Investigation of the variability for different initialization strategies shows that deterministic wind speed predictions are less sensitive to the choice of initialization strategy than temperature forecasts. Similarly, investigation of the variability for various planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations reveals that turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)-based schemes have an advantage over the non-local schemes for non-deterministic motions. The larger spread in the verification scores for various PBL parameterizations than initialization strategies indicates that PBL parameterization may play a larger role modulating the variability of non-deterministic motions in the SBL for these cases. These results confirm previous findings that have shown WRF to have limited skill forecasting submeso variability for periods greater than ~20 min. The limited skill of the WRF at these scales in these cases is related to the systematic underestimation of the amplitude of observed fluctuations. \n \tThese results are implemented in the model design and configuration for the investigation of nonstationary waves and rotor structures modulating submeso and meso-gamma motions and the SBL. Observations and WRF forecasts of two wave cases characterized by nonstationary waves and rotors are investigated to show the WRF model to have reasonable accuracy forecasting low-level temperature and wind speed in the SBL and to qualitatively produce rotors, similar to those observed, as well as some of the mechanisms modulating their development and evolution. Here, it is demonstrated that for these cases modest changes in the background wind speed appears to play a more crucial role modulating the wavelength of waves within the valley than the low-level stratification. Generally decreasing wind speeds through the night for both cases produce average wavelength rates of change ranging from -15 to -8 % h-1, similar to those observed near large mountain ranges. These nonstationary wave motions result in highly nonlinear wave-wave interactions that lead to wave amplification and/or intensification of low-level rotors. Rotors are shown to persist for extended periods throughout the night and to be highly coupled to the wave structure. The rotor propagation speed is similar to that of the transitioning modes, and the strongest wind reversal regions typically occur during periods of the largest wavelength rate of change and/or wave amplification. It is demonstrated using real data conditions that rotor intensification is likely under weakening environmental wind speeds, increasing environmental stratification, and transient waves due to the combined effects from 1) wave amplification and 2) rotor nonstationarity.  Overall, the nonstationarity of the waves and rotors due to moderate chnages in upstream background conditions must be recognized as an additional source of intermittency in the SBL.\nFinally, observations and high-resolution WRF forecasts under different environmental conditions using various initialization strategies are used to investigate the impact of nonlinear gravity waves and rotor structures on the generation of intermittent turbulence and valley transport in the SBL. Evidence of the presence of elevated regions of TKE generated by the complex waves and rotors is presented and investigated using an additional four case studies, exhibiting two synoptic flow regimes and different wave and rotor structures. TKE budget analysis shows that wave and rotor activity can enhance turbulence intermittency in the nighttime through the development of shear and convective instabilities and elevated regions of TKE. Turbulent transport is shown to play as much of a role in the local change of TKE as shear production; however advective processes might dominate the low-level TKE intermittency for these cases.  The model is shown to reproduce some of the hypothesized nonlinear dynamics and downslope-wind response for one of the cases.  However, very high horizontal resolutions (0.148-km grid spacing) are needed in order to better resolve wave amplitudes, rotor structures, and near-surface interactions. It is shown that the presence of strong wind speed and negative vertical shear near ridge top is important for a downslope-wind response over the network. The non-dimensional mountain height, a type of Froude number, is shown to be an effective parameter to identify downslope wind behaviors.  However, it is not a good indicator of the wave amplitude (and rotor intensity). The presence of rotors can enhance horizontal thermal gradients and create regions of convergence with highly variable flow regimes and little spatial coherence.  Overall, waves and rotors can significantly affect the transport within the valley, enhancing the downward transport of elevated materials and leading to locally higher concentrations near the surface. \n\tThroughout this thesis, terrain-induced gravity waves and rotors in the SBL are shown to synergistically interact with the surface cold pool and to enhance low-level turbulence intermittency through the development of submeso and meso-gamma motions.  These motions are shown to be an important source of uncertainty for the atmospheric transport and dispersion of pollutants and hazardous materials under very stable conditions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11404], "author_name_tesi": "Suarez Mullins, Astrid ", "last_name_ssi": "Suarez Mullins", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Astrid", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Stauffer", "George Spencer Young", "Fuqing Zhang", "Jacob Willem Langelaan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Stauffer, Dissertation Advisor", "George Spencer Young, Committee Member", "Fuqing Zhang, Committee Member", "Jacob Willem Langelaan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["high-resolution modeling", "wavelets", "model verification", "waves", "rotors", "submeso", "turbulence variability", "stable boundary layer"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Essays In Branding: A Look At Brands Through The Consumers' Eyes\n", "id": "7734", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4977", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Investigating a perceptual process in the first essay and evaluative processes in the second essay, this research examines the consumer-brand relationship from a dual perspective (inside-out and outside-in), showing how individual differences in consumers influence how they perceive and evaluate incoming brand information.

Developing the theoretical background for the construct and a scale to measure it, this essay shows that a) brand-centric consumers assign higher weight to brand information as opposed to item specific attribute information while evaluating products, and b) brand centricity influences the evaluation of brand extensions such that brand-centric consumers  assign i) a higher weight to brand concept consistency than non brand-centric consumers and ii) a higher weight to brand concept consistency than product feature similarity while evaluating brand extensions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4954], "author_name_tesi": "Subba Rao, Puligadda Sanjay ", "last_name_ssi": "Subba Rao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Puligadda Sanjay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William T Ross", "Rajdeep Grewal", "Johann Baumgartner", "Naomi S Altman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William T Ross, Committee Chair", "Rajdeep Grewal, Committee Chair", "Johann Baumgartner, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Consumer", "Brands"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Pattern Recognition using Symbolic Dynamic Filtering", "id": "9113", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "465", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Pattern recognition using symbolic dynamics is a new field of research. This dissertation uses symbolic dynamic filtering for detection data-driven pattern analysis. Specifically, the problem of anomaly detection, which is defined as deviation from the normally observed patterns using Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF) has been investigated. The proposed SDF method is further extended to two dimensional datasets, where it is essential to extract spatial information for meaningful pattern recognition.\n\nSDF attempts to model the time-series dataset through the statistics observed in a representative symbol sequence. The conversion of a time-series sequence is an irreversible process, in the sense that it is subjected to loss of information. It is essential that this crucial conversion is accomplished in a manner that retains the relevant patterns in the data sequence. Instead of converting the time-series data directly to symbols, this dissertation explores usage of the analytic signal for symbol generation. The analytic signal space provides a snapshot of the signal instantaneous amplitude and phase which allows retention of relevant information of the time series in the symbol sequence. The partitions are derived from the distribution of the magnitude and phase of the analytic signal. The analytic signal space partitioning scheme is extended to the two-dimensional domain to generate symbols from data streams such as images. The wavelet transform provides flexibility in the analysis of a signal to extract relevant information from a signal while being relatively immune to noise. A systematic, unambiguous method for partitioning the set of wavelet coefficients to symbols is also developed in this dissertation.\n\nThe partitioning is followed by the representation of the statistics of the symbols with finite state automata. Together, the partitioning algorithm and finite state machine is called the Symbolic Dynamic Filter, where the symbols are modeled by a special class of finite state automata called the D-Markov machine. Construction of the D-Markov machine is extended to model two-dimensional symbol matrices unambiguously, retaining all the information about each symbol neighborhood statistics.\n\nThe SDF algorithm is validated on data obtained from experiments conducted in a laboratory. It is first applied to detect anomalies in a non-linear system, governed by the Duffing equation. Experiments were conducted to generate images from a microscope camera monitoring the surface of a polycrystalline alloy specimen under fluctuating stress. The two-dimensional SDF algorithm is used to analyze these images to detect and quantify the appearance and propagation of a surface flaw on the surface of the specimen.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [462], "author_name_tesi": "Subbu, Aparna ", "last_name_ssi": "Subbu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aparna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Asok Ray", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Shashi Phoha", "Asok Ray", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Alok Sinha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Asok Ray, Dissertation Advisor", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Chair", "Shashi Phoha, Committee Chair", "Asok Ray, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member", "Alok Sinha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Symbolic dynamics", "Analytic signal", "Markov modeling", "Pattern recognition", "Image understanding", "Anomaly Detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "TRIUMPH OVER ADVERSITY: A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF NARRATIVE, COPING AND EXPERIENCE IN INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER", "id": "11453", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6360", "abstract_tesi": "The increased occurrence of chronic illness has created a need to study the experience of illness from the patient perspective.

More than ever, people are writing accounts of the experience of illness and treatment and patients are turning to these narratives for anecdotal information about particular illnesses and their treatments, conventional and alternative (Hawkins, 1999). This study takes a qualitative approach to studying cancer narratives of 21 patients to understand the patient experience of disease as well as examine the role narratives play in the patient experience of disease.

During viral pathogenesis early erythroid progenitor cells are infected leading to their rapid expansion which is dependent upon interactions between the viral envelope glycoprotein gp55, Short-form Stk (Sf-Stk) and the Erythropoietin receptor.  During the latter phase of disease, cellular transformation events lead to the formation of leukemic clones that proliferate causing eventual erythroleukemia.  Several genes have been identified that are required for the early phase of polyclonal expansion of the infected progenitors namely, Dominant - white spotting (W), Steel (Sl), flexed tail (f) and Friend virus susceptibility 2 (Fv2) loci.\nW and Sl play a role in hematopoiesis in general and are also required for steady state erythropoiesis.  Previous work in our lab has identified that the Fv2 locus encodes a naturally occurring truncated form of the Mst1r receptor tyrosine kinase, called short form Stk (Sf-Stk).  Studies from our lab have also demonstrated that Sf-Stk signals are required for the expansion of infected cells in the bone marrow and govern sensitivity to Friend erythroleukemia.  The f gene plays a role in stress erythropoiesis and influences proliferation of erythroid progenitors in the spleen in response to an acute anemic stress.  Herein, we identify the mechanisms by which these loci influence pathogenesis of Friend erythroleukemia and regulate erythropoiesis.  \nEarly analysis of flexed-tail (f/f) mice demonstrated that they are resistant to Friend virus induced erythroleukemia.  We have previously identified that the f mutation maps to a splicing defect in Madh5, a transcription factor that acts downstream of the Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).  f/f mice are defective in their responses to acute hemolytic anemic stress induced by phenylhydrazine.  We have demonstrated that this is due to a defect in the expansion of a novel erythroid progenitor unique to the spleen, which is dependent on BMP4 signaling.  Given that the f/f mice are resistant to Friend disease, we hypothesized that the BMP4 dependent stress erythroid signaling may play a role in Friend virus pathogenesis.  Following infection with Friend virus, we observed upregulation of BMP4 expression in the spleen of wild - type but not f/f mice.  This increase in BMP4 expression correlated with greater number of infected target cells in the spleen of wild - type mice.  The bone marrow targets however do not increase in response to BMP4 signals.  In addition, we have isolated the targets for Friend virus in susceptible bone marrow and spleen, and our analysis shows that the target populations are distinct.  Flow cytometry analysis suggests that infected bone marrow cells can migrate to the spleens in susceptible mice and propagate viral infection.  Based on these data, we propose a novel model for the initial phase of Friend virus pathogenesis which involves the BMP4 dependent stress erythroid response pathway.  Viral targets can be infected in the bone marrow and migrate to the spleen where the infected cells serve as reservoirs of the virus.  Migration to the spleen induces expression of BMP4 in the spleen which causes the expansion of stress erythroid progenitors which are the targets for Friend virus.  \nThe W locus encodes the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase and Sl encodes its ligand Stem cell factor.  Mice mutant in W and Sl have defects in erythropoiesis and are highly anemic leading to embryonic lethality.  The W/Wv mutant is the most severe allele combination that survives to adulthood.  The W/Wv mice are severely anemic and it was originally proposed that this defect in erythropoiesis is the cause of their resistance to FV.  In the second chapter, we demonstrate that bone marrow of W/Wv mice express normal numbers of target cells for Friend virus infection both in vitro and in vivo.  The spleens of W/Wv mice however completely lack Friend virus targets, as determined by colony assays and flow cytometry analysis of infected bone marrow, peripheral blood and spleen.  Further, our flow analysis combined with in vivo transplantation assays, suggest that infected bone marrow cells are able to migrate to the spleen of W/Wv mice but are unable to propagate the infection further due to lack of targets in the spleen.  Based on our data, we propose a new model for the resistance of W/Wv mice to Friend erythroleukemia wherein the defect in the W/Wv mice is due to cell intrinsic defects contributed by the mutation of the Kit receptor rather than defects in the homing and lodgment0 of infected bone marrow to the spleens. \nIn the third chapter, we analyzed the role of the Src family kinase member Lyn in the course of Friend virus pathogenesis.  Early studies identified a role for Lyn in signaling downstream of the Erythropoietin receptor in erythroid progenitor cells.  We demonstrate that Lyn signals do not appear to be required for the expansion of Friend virus targets in the bone marrow or spleen.  However, Lyn appears to play a role in the terminal differentiation of erythroid cells and can thereby potentially mediate the early development of erythroleukemia in the absence of Lyn signals.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [545], "author_name_tesi": "Subramanian, Aparna ", "last_name_ssi": "Subramanian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aparna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Paulson", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Avery August", "Richard John Frisque", "Biao He"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Paulson, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "Biao He, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Friend virus", "Erythroleukemia", "BMP4", "flexed-tail", "Kit receptor tyrosine kinase", "stress erythropoiesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Development of an improved slag-based drilling grout", "id": "8817", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5356", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The drilling mud was designed around blast furnace slag as the principal pozzolan to produce a strength of 500 psi.

This is a novel hybrid nanolithography technique which combines chemical self-assembly with conventional fabrication methods for improving the resolution of existing lithography tools to sub-50 nm. Previous work related to molecular ruler lithography have shown the use of thiol-SAMs, placed one on top of the other like a molecular resist, for scaling down feature sizes. In this thesis various engineering solutions for improving the reproducibility, yield, nanoscale roughness and overall manufacturability of the process are introduced. This is achieved by introducing a sacrificial inert layer underneath the gold parent structure. This bilayer sacrificial host allows for preferential, easy and quick removal of the parent structures, isolates the parent metal from the underlying substrate and improves reproducibility of the lift-off process. Also it opens avenues for fabrication of high aspect ratio features. Also molecular layer vapor deposition method is developed for building the multilayer molecular resist via vapor phase to reduce contaminations and yield issues associated with solution phase deposition. The smallest isolated metal features produced using this process were 40 nm in width.\nThe second half of the thesis describes application of thiol-SAMs to tailor surface properties of gold, specifically the surface charge or zeta potential. Previous work has demonstrated that the direction of movement of fluid in the vicinity of a catalytically active bimetallic junction placed in a solution of dilute hydrogen peroxide depends on the charge of the gold surface. SAMs with different end-group functionality impart different surface zeta potential to the gold surface. Zeta-potential engineering via patterning various end-group functionalized SAMs on gold surface to control direction of catalytically induced electroosmotic fluid flow is demonstrated for the first time.\nThis work also describes the application of catalytic power to produce controlled rotational motion. Gold gears-like structures made using conventional microfabrication techniques and propelled by catalytic power are shown to rotate at speeds of 1 rotation/sec in a dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide. Fabrication of a force sensor for detection and measurement of catalytic forces is also introduced. The force sensor, with sensitivity in the piconewton range, consists of a microcantilever with a catalytically active silver post patterned on the tip. Changes in cantilever displacement and resonance frequency due to the catalytic force were monitored as a function of concentration of hydrogen peroxide. \nOverall, this thesis integrates SAM deposition and patterning techniques with conventional fabrication methods to engineer and control nanoscale structures and devices. Possible future device designs are described including CMOS devices having channel width defined using molecular ruler lithography with sacrificial hosts, drug delivery device based on AFM force sensor and channeless pumps powered by catalytic reactions with SAM controlled electroosmotic fluid flow.\t\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6085], "author_name_tesi": "Subramanian, Shyamala ", "last_name_ssi": "Subramanian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shyamala", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Mark William Horn", "Ayusman Sen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["self-assembled monolayers", "lithography", "catalytic motors", "molecular rulers", "lift-off resist", "zeta potential"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Adapting Sparse Triangular Solution to GPU", "id": "15429", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7643", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Trends in recent years have shown that high performance computing systems are\nincreasingly including GPUs to increase \noating point calculation throughput for\nscienti\fc applications.

The idea of Hard and Soft fusion stems from a classification system that divides sensors into two groups:  Hard and Soft sensors.  Hard sensors are the traditional electronic sensing sources like satellites and RFIDs that use a programmed system to collect the data.  Soft sensing occurs when a human is collecting data. This type of sensing is clearly less predictable, but gives a different dimension to the complete set of data.  With the availability of new communication methods (eg. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) any person in any setting could be a soft sensor.  With the advent of crowd sourcing it will be common to encounter the context of soft sensing in the future.  With the inclusion of humans as sources of data, Information Fusion algorithms should be able to combine these disparate sources.\nIn this thesis I focus on including humans in a decision making system to improve the knowledge of a Decision Maker (DM).  I accomplish this by using a subject matter expert, whom I call a Human Fuser, to manipulate the reliability values extracted by the Information Fusion process.   The Information Fusion process is a hard process as it uses programs to align and associate data to be able to estimate pieces of information.  These pieces of information have a reliability or certainty value attached with them that has been extracted by looking at the sources (the hard and soft sensors) error functions.  I introduce a soft process, called Cognitive Injection Process into the Information Fusion process. \n Including soft sensors will change the DM\u2019s knowledge of the problem scenario because the reliability values of the different pieces of information will be changing.  In a decision making context I need to consider several features, such as the color of a car, speed at which it is travelling etc.  I should consider these features and select the best feature-estimate set, which can help the decision maker in inferring for example in this case, color and speed. In this thesis I address three sub-problems: 1. Feature-Estimate selection through linear mathematical models, 2. Feature-Estimate selection through complex mathematical models, and 3. Introducing multiple human fusers into the information fusion process.  In the first problem I model the feature-estimate selection for soft sensing as a knapsack problem and solve it through heuristics. I consider entropy modeling and minimize entropy, thus leading to best feature-estimate set, in the second problem. Finally I use learning and forgetting models to address the problem of introducing multiple humans in the information fusion process.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7109], "author_name_tesi": "Sudit, David M", "last_name_ssi": "Sudit", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara", "Soundar Kumara", "David J Hall", "David Arthur Nembhard", "Guodong Pang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara, Dissertation Advisor", "Soundar Kumara, Committee Chair", "David J Hall, Committee Member", "David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Member", "Guodong Pang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Information Fusion", "Human Fuser", "Cognitive", "Uncertainty", "Sensors"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF ADAPTIVE FEEDBACK ON ACHIEVEMENT, PARTICIPATION, AND INTERACTION PATTERNS IN ONLINE GROUP DISCUSSION\n\n", "id": "12294", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6598", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Online discussion forums have become widely adopted as a supplement to in-class instruction as well as a primary venue for discourse in purely online learning contexts. Social connections and interactivity in online discussion have been identified as essential elements for successful learning experiences (Lapadat, 2002; Meyer, 2006; Schrage, 1990). In addition, reflection is considered to be a vital aspect of successful learning and helps learners look back on a performance, identify the important aspects of what is being learned, and consider how to improve it in the future (Collins, 2006; Lin et al., 1999; Sch\u00f6n, 1983; Sch\u00f6n, 1987). Accordingly, reflection strategies in online discussion can help students monitor their own thinking process, advance in-depth meaning making, and promote knowledge acquisition and transfer (Guldberg & Pilkington, 2007; McDuffie & Slavit, 2003; Way, 2009). However, connecting notions of self-reflection on performance in the context of online discussion environments has not been clearly established in the literature. In addition, studies on analyzing the quality of discussion contents and the depth of cognitive processing were relatively less explored although in-depth analysis is essential to understand students\u2019 learning progress and status.\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the effect of adaptive feedback on academic achievement, students\u2019 participation, and interaction patterns in online learning with group discussion activity. Also, this study proposes an efficient feedback generation method to support learners participating in online group discussion and eventually enhances reflective learning.\nThis field experimental study randomized the assignment of students (n=36) into either the treatment or control group to compare the effect of adaptive feedback. For this field experimental design study, the repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the data analysis which aimed to measure multiple levels of each factor over time. Both quantitative data and qualitative data were collected from three online discussion sessions. \nThe results showed that the use of adaptive feedback was not effective in showing a significant difference between the treatment and the control group on academic achievement. However, the adaptive feedback helped students in treatment group engage in more intermediate and in-depth level of cognitive processing during online group discussion. In addition, the interaction pattern analysis revealed that students in the treatment group consistently participated with greater numbers of interactive messages than the control group during online group discussion. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6596], "author_name_tesi": "Suh, Wonseok Suh ", "last_name_ssi": "Suh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wonseok Suh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan M Land", "Susan M Land", "Wei Fan Chen", "John David Popp", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan M Land, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan M Land, Committee Chair", "Wei Fan Chen, Committee Member", "John David Popp, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["online discussion", "contene analysis", "social network analysis", "adaptive feedback"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Development of 2- and 3- simulator for three-phase flow with general initial and boundary conditions on the fractional flow approach\n\n", "id": "5794", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5959", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-11-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\nThis thesis presents the development of 2-D and 3-D multiphase flow simulators as named 2DMPS(2-D Multifluid Phase Simulator) and 3DMPS (3-D Multifluid Phase Simulator) for three-phase flow (Water, NAPL, and Gas) in the subsurface, respectively. The 2DMPS and 3DMPS are developed using hybrid the Lagrangian and Eulerian approach (e.g. LEZOOMPC, The Lagrangian-Eulerian decoupling method with an adaptive ZOOMing and Peak/valley Capture scheme) and the Eulerian approach (e.g. Galerkin upstream finite element method). \n\nThe governing equations of the fractional flow based approach consists of two saturation equations having an advection-diffusion form with advection dominated term, and a global pressure equation having an elliptic form. The former set of equations is well suited for numerical solution with the method of characteristics while the latter can be solved with conventional finite element method (e.g. Galerkin finite element method). Accordingly, a mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian approach (LEZOOMPC) is used for solving simultaneously two coupled nonlinear saturation equations, in which advection term can be effectively and accurately dealt with LEZOOMPC algorithm.  Specifically, the accuracy in determining the Lagrangian saturation in most Lagrangian-Eulerian methods including LEZOOMPC depends on both the particle tracking algorithm and interpolation scheme. Most particle tracking methods are limited for the steady state flow case. However, in this research a multidimensional particle tracking algorithm has been developed to account for both temporal and spatial variations of velocity fields during the time step and incorporated into the LEZOOMPC algorithm. \n\nIn addition to the aforementioned ablity of effectively and accurately solving the fractional flow approach equations with the LEZOOMPC scheme, fractional flow appraoch has its own inherent advantages. Since primary variables such as water and total liquid saturations are adopted in the fractional flow approach, 2DMPS and 3DMPS have the capability of automatically handling phase change configuration during the simulation time without any assumption or variable switching technique. The primary variables can be always defined no matter how a set of phase is changed in both time and space. Even though the fractional flow based approach has the several advantages over the pressure-based approach, it also has a difficulty in dealing with boundary conditions that are very often encountered in groundwater literature. However, in this research, general initial and boundary conditions are incorporated into 2DMPS and 3DMPS. The general boundary condition consists of ten types. Eight of these are combinations of the flux type or Dirichlet-pressure type of each individual phase and the last two, defined as variable boundary conditions, are the combination of gradient of capillary pressure or flux type of each individual phase depending on the velocity direction of each phase on the boundary. The general initial condition consists of eight types, which are the combinations of initial pressure and saturation of three individual phases. Any type of aforementioned initial and boundary conditions have been transformed and incorporated in terms of the primary variables, a global pressure and two saturations.\n\nIn this study, 2DMPS and 3DMPS are developed and verified with an analytical solution and other numerical software (e.g. 2DTATMIC). Also several examples are presented to represent the treatment of general boundary and initial conditions and automatic adaptation of phase appearance and disappearance without any variable switching technique, and to show the applicability of real or field problems. Also an algorithm of multidimensional particle tracking technique accounting for transient state flow is presented and verified with analytical solution for both accuracy and efficiency.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5953], "author_name_tesi": "Suk, Heejun ", "last_name_ssi": "Suk", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Heejun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peggy Ann Johnson", "Christopher J Duffy", "Derek Elsworth", "Gour Tsyh Yeh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Chair", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Gour Tsyh Yeh, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["LEZOOMPC", "Phase Configuration change", "Fractional flow formulation", "Multiple phase flow", "Particle tracking", "analytical method", "linear spatial and temporal velocity variation", "semi-analytical method", "General boundary conditions", "Fractional flow approach", "three dimensional multiphase flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "STUDENT FINANCIAL AID IN MONGOLIA:  \nTHE EFFECT ON BACHELOR\u2019S DEGREE COMPLETION\n", "id": "7504", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3095", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\nThis study investigates the relationship between background, college experience, and financial aid variables and baccalaureate degree completion for a cohort of students enrolled in six public colleges and universities in Mongolia. A specific aim of this study is to determine the extent to which the receipt of financial aid influenced degree attainment and if this influence varied by different types of financial aid, apart from, and in combination with, background and college experience variables. The status data as of Fall 2005 for the students enrolled in the fall 2000 served as the target population of the study. The sample consisted of 4,398 cases and an imputation resulted in a dataset of 4,821 cases.

The study finds that aid recipients are 11-14% more likely to complete their undergraduate degree than non-recipients, and this effect varies by types of aid.

Other significant predictors are college GPA, field of study, institution, residence, and parents\u2019 occupation. The study suggests that: a) the impact of receiving financial aid may be enhanced in a low-income and transitional context and when linked to tuition level; b) need-based tuition grants are the most effective, and c) soft loans may be as effective as grants if linked to tuition and directed towards low-income students.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3084], "author_name_tesi": "Sukhbaatar, Javzan ", "last_name_ssi": "Sukhbaatar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Javzan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald E Heller", "David Post", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Regina Deil Amen", "John C Weidman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald E Heller, Committee Chair", "David Post, Committee Chair", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Regina Deil Amen, Committee Member", "John C Weidman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["higher education", "comparative education", "student financial aid", "developing nations", "education finance", "educational policy"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "SHAPE AND STRUCTURAL VARIATION IN THE DISTAL FEMUR OF CATARRHINE PRIMATES", "id": "14707sms6065", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14707", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     One of the primary goals of paleoanthropology is the reconstruction of past behavioral patterns from fossilized remains in order to resolve the evolutionary history of living taxa. The hominin fossil record provides a rich resource of postcranial skeletal remains for the study of locomotor adaptations, under the assumed relationship between bone form and biomechanical function. Locomotor functional adaptation can be studied through the internal remodeling of trabecular structure to adapt to incurred loads and stresses as well as through external joint morphology that reflects joint posture and mobility. The purpose of this dissertation was to examine a sample of modern humans and their closest relatives, modern catarrhines, for the association between locomotor behavior and bone form, both internal and external, and to introduce fossil hominins into the analysis to address the evolution of bipedalism in the hominin record. \n     The analysis focused on the distal femur, an integral component of the knee joint, a joint which has received considerable attention in the study of bipedal locomotor adaptations in the fossil hominin record. The knee joint is one of the primary weight-bearing structures in the hind limb, but its complex morphology and function have posed some challenge to the quantitative analysis of knee joint functional morphology from the perspective of the distal femur. This project used a subsample of four catarrhine taxa, Homo, Pan, Pongo, and Papio, to investigate trabecular bone structural variation in the entire distal femoral epiphysis using a whole-joint method. The resultant mapping of trabecular bone volume fraction showed highly variable patterns within and between species. A sector analysis resolved the variation to a degree, and revealed a signal of bipedal locomotor bony response in the human distal femur in the form of high bone volume fraction in the distal, flattened regions of the condyles. The analysis also showed evidence of flexed limb postures in the non-human primates.\n     A larger sample of catarrhine primates was used to analyze the three-dimensional shape variation of the distal femur, including the articular surface topography and surrounding structures using geometric morphometrics. Locomotor differences in distal femoral shape provided clear discrimination between locomotor groups in the analysis, and the bipedal adaptations of the modern human distal femur occupied a unique position in shape space relative to the other extant taxa. The features that distinguished groups in shape space tended to reflect joint rotational ability and mediolateral distribution of loads across the knee, and the analysis revealed the significant influence of size, substrate preference, and phylogeny on distal femoral shape variation, in addition to locomotor behavior. The inclusion of fossil hominins into the analysis underscored the suite of features associated with bipedal locomotion in the distal femur that correspond to efficiency of locomotion on two legs. The fossil hominins demonstrated an early appearance of bipedally-associated features in the distal femur that strongly suggest habitual bipedal behavior in our earliest ancestors, and conform to previous suggestions of a further refinement of the hominin postcranial skeleton for increased efficiency and mechanical advantage with the emergence of Homo around 2-2.5 Ma.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15725], "author_name_tesi": "Sukhdeo, Simone Mallory", "last_name_ssi": "Sukhdeo", "middle_name_ssi": "Mallory", "first_name_ssi": "Simone", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy Michael Ryan", "Timothy Michael Ryan", "Nina G Jablonski", "Philip Reno", "Matthew Logan Reimherr"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy Michael Ryan, Dissertation Advisor", "Timothy Michael Ryan, Committee Chair", "Nina G Jablonski, Committee Member", "Philip Reno, Committee Member", "Matthew Logan Reimherr, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Functional morphology", "Human evolution", "Primate evolution", "Primate adaptations", "Trabecular bone", "Bone functional adaptation", "Geometric morphometrics", "Knee joint"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Regulation of Arabidopsis floral development and transcriptome during drought stress by Nac transcription factors", "id": "18898", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8749", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As sessile organisms, plants are exposed to adverse environmental factors that negatively affect their growth and development. Many plants are particularly sensitive and susceptible to drought conditions at their reproductive stage. There are a number of studies about drought effects on crop reproductive development, but the molecular mechanism underlying drought response during reproduction is still unclear. A previous study on the inflorescence of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter, Arabidopsis) found that many genes are induced by drought, including NAC019, which encodes a putative transcription factor that belongs to the NAC family. However, the function of NAC019 in drought response during floral development is not clear. This study aimed to investigate NAC019 function in the floral response to drought conditions, with a focus on its role in the stress regulatory network. \nTo achieve this objective, we subjected the nac019 mutant to drought and characterized its phenotype. The stamens and pistils of nac019-1 were smaller than WT, but their length ratio was not significantly different. Despite the smaller size, the pollen produced under drought conditions in the mutant was viable and able to generate a pollen tube, indicating that pollen fertility in nac019-1 was not severely affected by drought. Moreover, when we examined the emergence of new open flowers from a newly recovered inflorescence, we found that, after drought-induced arrest of floral development, nac019-1 took several days longer than WT to produce a new open flower. This indicates that recovery of nac019-1 inflorescence from drought was delayed compared to WT. Additionally, nac019-1 could still produce siliques with normal number of seeds, but the silique number was reduced relative to WT. It also contained more undeveloped siliques than WT. These results suggest that nac019-1floral meristem development was severely affected by drought, but not its floral morphology.\nThe observation that the nac019-1 phenotype was relatively weak suggested that NAC019 and its related genes might share redundant functions. Therefore, a triple mutant with additional mutations from two closely related genes was generated and subjected to drought. Our preliminary data indicated that the vegetative tissue of the triple mutant had a more severe phenotype than nac019-1. Throughout drought stress, relative water content of this triple mutant was lower, and recovered more slowly than the single mutant.\nTo understand the regulatory role NAC019 plays, microarray analysis was performed on the inflorescence of nac019 during early drought treatment. In nac019-1, fewer genes were induced by drought, indicating that the mutant might have a slower response to drought at the onset of this stress. We compared this transcriptomic profile to WT to identify putative NAC019 target genes. We found that many genes were associated with stress and hormone response as well as floral development. Some of the genes are DREB2B, ARF2, MYB21 and MYB24. We also examined the expression of a few genes over a time course of drought stress. Interestingly, NAC019 was highly expressed throughout drought stress, indicating that it is essential for the inflorescence response to drought. \nBased on our results, we propose a model that includes NAC019 function in a regulatory network for floral development under drought conditions. Future studies are required to test the hypotheses in this model, including the interaction between NAC019 and its target genes. Towards this goal, a GR-inducible system has been generated for NAC019, providing a functional assay for NAC019 function in regulating the drought-responsive floral transcriptome.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8606], "author_name_tesi": "Sukiran, Noor Liyana", "last_name_ssi": "Sukiran", "middle_name_ssi": "Liyana", "first_name_ssi": "Noor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Ma", "Richard Cyr", "Teh Hui Kao", "Gabriele Brigitte Monshausen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Ma, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Cyr, Committee Chair", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Gabriele Brigitte Monshausen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Arabidopsis", "drought stress", "floral development", "NAC transcription factors"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "GAIT RETRAINING USING A \u201cSMART SHOE\u201d DEVICE", "id": "10933", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6232", "abstract_tesi": "A device was designed to measure the ground reaction force under the foot and provide real-time feedback as a method for gait modification.

Unlike most current modeling methods where a single axis length is predicted, the primary habits, or two axis lengths, are computed explicitly.  The method produces a positive non-linear feedback between mass growth and crystal aspect ratio evolution and is shown to have a distinct initial-size dependence. This feedback cannot be captured with simpler growth methods, leading to underestimates of ice growth and mixed-phase glaciation.  Assuming spherical particles or mass-dimensional relationships derived from in-situ data cannot mechanistically evolve particle shape result in large variations in phase, leading to inaccuracies in estimates of mixed-phase lifetime.\n\nAspect ratio prediction is most critical for mixed-phase maintenance at habit-prone temperatures (dendritic growth, T=-15 \u00baC, and needle growth, -6 \u00baC) and at ice concentrations >1 L^-1. At these temperatures and concentrations, rates of glaciation can be under-predicted by as much as an order of magnitude by equivalent density spheres. Lagrangian bin parcel studies show that habit prediction is less important for the maintenance of liquid at lower ice concentrations (< 1 L^-1) as the time-scale for liquid depletion is relatively long (days).  Updraft strength also affects mixed-phase cloud maintenance primarily at ice concentrations between 1 L^-1 and 100 L^-1. It is theoretically possible for a multitude of vertical  motions to maintain stratiform mixed-phase clouds indefinitely when temperatures are relatively high (>-10 \u00baC) and ice concentrations are relatively low (<1 L^-1).\n\nA bulk version of the habit evolution method called the adaptive habit model is implemented into a 2D kinematic model and the Large-Eddy Simulation version of WRF, allowing for sedimentation and separate advection of axis length mixing ratios for both dynamically-independent and dynamically-coupled simulations, respectively.  Kinematic simulations with sedimentation increase cloud lifetime at higher ice concentrations, but can also lead to lower liquid amounts.  Radiative cooling initially increases ice growth with a subsequent enhanced sedimentation flux, altering cloud-phase partitioning dependent on ice concentration.  Surface latent and sensible heat fluxes of 50 W m^-2 result in an increase in overall water mass, while compensating fluxes that counteract radiative cooling and sedimentation establish sufficient energy and mass amounts for liquid and ice maintenance.  \n\nStudies of habit evolution are completed using the LES version of WRF simulate Flight 31 of the ISDAC field campaign, in which a single mixed-phase layer was decoupled from the ice-covered ocean surface.  Simulations with spherical ice, which is traditionally assumed in many models, confirm the dependency of liquid water depletion through increased ice concentrations.  Similar to prior studies, simulations with spherical ice produce relatively stable mixed-phase clouds consisting of supercooled liquid layers that precipitate ice.  In contrast to these studies, habit evolution produces stronger ice growth and slower sedimentation rates, leading to more rapid glaciation at higher concentrations.  Additionally, aspect ratio evolution and subsequent ice sedimentation promote a net depositional warming that cannot be offset by cloud-top radiative cooling due to continually decreasing liquid mass for ice concentrations >1 L^-1.  Further studies indicate that colloidally unstable clouds, regardless of habit, cannot be self-maintaining without an external source of moisture.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8574], "author_name_tesi": "Sulia, Kara Jo", "last_name_ssi": "Sulia", "middle_name_ssi": "Jo", "first_name_ssi": "Kara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jerry Y Harrington", "Johannes Verlinde", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux", "Miriam Arak Freedman", "Dr Hugh Morrison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jerry Y Harrington, Dissertation Advisor", "Johannes Verlinde, Committee Chair", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Committee Member", "Miriam Arak Freedman, Special Member", "Dr Hugh Morrison, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ice growth", "glaciation", "mixed-phase clouds", "Arctic clouds", "vapor diffusion", "aspect ratio"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Identification and mapping of new late blight resistance genes in the tomato wild species Solanum pimpinellifolium", "id": "28783", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12056", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The cultivated tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L., is the most valuable vegetable crop worldwide and ranks sixth among all crops. Besides its production value, the tomato is used as a model plant for crop research. However, the tomato is susceptible to over 200 diseases, which can lead to loss of productivity due to crop damage and disease management. One of the most devastating diseases of tomato is late blight (LB), caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary, which can destroy an unprotected crop in 7 \u2013 10 days. Currently the most common method of controlling LB is through the frequent use of fungicides. However, changes in the pathogen have resulted in development of isolates which can overcome these fungicides. An alternative form of disease control is through host resistance of the crop, which can help reduce or eliminate the use of fungicides, leading to lower production costs and reduced environmental impacts. Very little LB resistance has been observed in the cultivated tomato; however, strong resistance exists in related wild species of tomato, including its closest relative, S. pimpinellifolium. Several LB-resistance genes have already been identified and introgressed into cultivated lines and commercial cultivars of tomato; however, isolates of P. infestans have since been identified which can overcome each of the known resistance genes, driving the need to identify new sources of LB resistance.\nA recent screening of 67 S. pimpinellifolium accessions identified 12 accessions with nearly complete LB resistance under greenhouse or field conditions. In the present study, two of those accessions, PI 270441 and PI 270442, were hybridized with an elite tomato breeding line, Fla. 8059, to create two distinct genetic and breeding populations, which were evaluated for genetic inheritance of LB resistance.

These moderately high levels of heritability suggest that PI 270441 and PI 270442 could be valuable resources for breeders looking to incorporate LB resistance into the cultivated tomato.\nStudies were also conducted to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring LB resistance in these accessions. A trait-based analysis was performed by selecting individuals with extreme resistance and susceptibility in F2 populations for marker genotyping and QTL analysis. Initially, a total of 4,430 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were identified for use in the two populations. For the population derived from PI 270441, 201 SNP markers were used to generate a linkage map and conduct QTL analysis employing 83 F2 individuals. Four QTLs associated with the LB-resistant wild parent and two associated with the LB-susceptible cultivated parent were identified. In the population derived from PI 270442, 212 SNP markers were used with 89 F2 individuals to generate a linkage map and conduct QTL analysis. In this population nine QTLs for LB resistance were identified; seven were associated with the LB-resistant wild parent and two were associated with the LB-susceptible cultivated parent.\nPreliminary backcross breeding was conducted to introgress the LB resistance from the two wild accessions into the cultivated tomato using phenotypic selection. At the BC2S1 generation, LB resistance continues to be maintained at levels consistent with the LB-resistant parents, PI 270441 and PI 270442. Meanwhile, some progress has been made with shifting the phenotype of the interspecific progenies towards the cultivated parent Fla. 8059 and reducing the undesirable S. pimpinellifolium traits.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11483], "author_name_tesi": "Sullenberger, Matthew Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Sullenberger", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Majid R Foolad", "Beth Krueger Gugino", "Mark Guiltinan", "David Robert Huff", "Timothy W Mcnellis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Majid R Foolad, Dissertation Advisor", "Beth Krueger Gugino, Committee Member", "Mark Guiltinan, Committee Member", "David Robert Huff, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tomato", "Solanum pimpinellifolium", "quantitative trait locus", "marker assisted selection", "late blight", "Phytophthora infestans"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "An examination of holism in the visual processing of faces using the crowding effect and general recognition theory\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "8429", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "745", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined the extent to which holism in visual perception can be revealed by way of the presence or absence of crowding.  Martelli, Majaj, and Pelli (2005) used crowding to propose an operational definition for holism.  Specifically, they argued that holistic perception of an object is implicated if that object can be identified when the entire object is presented within an isolation field (defined as an area proportional to one-half eccentricity).  Conversely, parts-based processing is implicated if identification is impaired when the entire object is within an isolation field, with an attenuation or elimination of that impairment when each part of the object is isolated by critical spacing.  Martelli et al. found evidence of crowding\u2014increases in threshold contrast as a function of eccentricity for faces and words\u2014suggesting that foveally-presented objects are processed holistically, and peripherally-presented objects are processed by parts. This operational definition is considered from the perspective of general recognition theory (GRT, Ashby & Townsend, 1986).  GRT provides theoretical characterizations of perceptual and decisional independence and separability, with violations of independence and separability allowing for multiple characterizations of holism.  In this study, accuracy of identification responses was used to link Martelli et al.\u2019s operational definition to the definitions of holism provided by GRT.  Two sets of face stimuli were presented under conditions modeled on those used by Martelli et al.  The faces were used to replicate the patterns documented by Martelli et al.: specifically, evidence for the benefit of a facial context in foveal presentation, and impairment in peripheral presentation\u2014benefit and impairment that were eliminated in both presentations when critical spacing isolated the featural parts of the face stimuli.  In addition, the GRT analyses revealed disparities between the current operational and theoretical definitions of holistic processing which suggest that the visual crowding effect cannot serve as a method for defining holism in face processing.  These results contribute to a more systematic definition of holism, and an improved understanding of the visual processing of faces.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [738], "author_name_tesi": "Sullivan, Brianna M", "last_name_ssi": "Sullivan", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Brianna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael J Wenger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael J Wenger, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["GRT", "Crowding Effect", "Holism", "Face Processing"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Characterizing the Nature of Students' Feature Noticing-and-using With Respect to Mathematical Symbols Across Different Levels of Algebra Exposure", "id": "17411", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8498", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to examine the nature of what students notice about symbols and use as they solve unfamiliar algebra problems based on familiar algebra concepts and involving symbolic inscriptions.

Increasingly, writing programs of all kinds are attempting to teach writing skills that will transfer across disciplines, to integrate digital technologies into their teaching and assessment practices, and to adapt their curricula and pedagogies to the needs of both resident and international multilingual students.

Breaking the data\ninto frequency bands not only simplifies the whitening process but allows\n a rough frequency spectrum to be assigned to candidate events.  \nA whitening figure of merit is also described and, in the case\nof data from LIGO's third science run, it is shown that the whitening procedure\nnearly always improves the whiteness of the data.\n\nThe second project described in this thesis is development of a computationally\ninexpensive test that can be run quickly over LIGO data to flag times\nwhere data have been corrupted by a nonlinear coupling.  The test is applied to\nLIGO data and is shown to flag segments whose bispectra contains similar\nfeatures to the bispectra of data produced\nwith a nonlinear model.\n\nFinally, the third project seeks to address two problems that one would confront\nif one tried to do core-collapse supernova astronomy with gravitational waves. \nThe first \nproblem involves extracting a short-duration gravitational waveform from the data\nproduced by a\nnetwork of detectors.

The second problem involves deducing properties of\nthe source from the recovered waveform when our source models are incomplete. \nWe propose calculating the cross correlation between a recovered waveform and\na catalog of waveforms associated with models having varying properties.

These findings tend to support models like the Dual Route Cascaded Model (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001) in which lexical access occurs via two routes, one in which phonology is directly retrieved in parallel, and a second in which phonology is computed serially.  This model predicts that consistent languages rely more on the computational route, whereas less consistent languages rely more on the direct route. If lexical parsing preferences require that languages differing in consistency engage distinct processing, for bilinguals, two languages that differ in consistency should function independently. However, bilingual word recognition research demonstrates that both languages are active and competing, even when they differ in consistency, a finding captured by the Bilingual Interactive Activation model (Dijkstra & van Heuven, 1998). This creates a paradox for word recognition in that cross-language interactions occur, but for lexical parsing, both languages appear to function independently. To examine this paradox, three experiments were performed using tasks shown to reveal parsing preferences. In each experiment, the performance of native English speakers and proficient non-native speakers of English was compared in English. In Experiment 1, participants made lexical decisions to stimuli including pseudohomophones, to compare native and non-native spelling-to-sound computation. In Experiment 2, participants performed clustered lexical decision in which word and nonword stimuli were parsed after the onset or the first vowel to compare the importance of the rime unit in processing. Finally in Experiment 3 participants named words and nonwords including English-German cognates to examine how second language processing strategies differ for German-English bilinguals in the presence of strong first language cues.\n\tIn Experiments 1 and 2, results were similar for native English and native German speakers. In Experiment 1, native Japanese speakers also produced similar results in English, although their performance was more dependent on English proficiency. However when native German speakers named English words in Experiment 3, both first and second language processing strategies were revealed.

Little is currently known about the role of oxide films in electrocatalysts, particularly with regard to the role of the defect structure.  In this work, the physical and defect structures of the oxide film that forms on platinum in acid and alkaline solutions under steady state conditions has been investigated using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and ARXPS (Angle-Resolved X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy).  Mott-Schottky analysis shows that the film in both acid and alkaline solutions is n-type, indicating that the defects in the film are either platinum interstitials or oxygen vacancies, or both.  ARXPS analysis of films formed in acid solution shows that, for potentials between 1.0 and 1.3 VSHE, a single-layer film develops, with the principal oxidation state for Pt (in the film) being +2.  However, a bi-layer structure was observed for films formed at potentials greater than 1.3 VSHE and ARXPS analysis shows that these bi-layer films comprise an inner layer containing Pt(II) and an outer layer containing Pt(IV).  Optimization of the Point Defect Model on the EIS data obtained in acid solution yields values for various kinetic parameters that are then used to predict the steady state thickness and current.  Good agreement with experiment is obtained.\nThe kinetics of growth of the oxide film on platinum has been studied in alkaline solution as a function of pH.  The experimental data confirm the existence of steady states in the current and thickness.  Both transient and steady state currents are found to increase with pH.  The donor density in the film calculated according to Mott-Schottky analysis increases with pH.  Diagnostic criteria for the dependence of the steady state current and thickness on applied potential and pH are derived from the PDM, in which the principal point defects in the barrier layer are postulated to be cation interstitials and oxygen vacancies, thereby accounting for the n-type electronic character.  The steady state thickness is then predicted to vary linearly with the applied potential and pH.  These predictions are in good agreement with the experimental findings.  The PDM also predicts a linear relationship between the logarithm of steady state current and applied formation potential with a non-zero slope, but only if &#61511;&#61625;&#61539;.  If &#61511;=&#61539; and the film is n-type, then ln(Iss) is predicted to be independent of the applied voltage.  The experimentally observed of diagnostic criteria derived from the PDM are employed as the constraints in the optimization of the PDM on EIS data obtained in alkaline solutions.

However, different domains may have different domain specific searches. For example, Chemical research is molecule centric rather than document centric. Usually a chemical molecule can be represented in multiple ways, e.g., textual chemical entities such as chemical names and formulae, and chemical structures such as 2D graphs and 3D graphs. Thus, in Chemoinformatics, chemical entity searches and chemical structure searches are more important than simple document searches using keyword matching. In this work, we show how to build a domain specific search engine that enables both entity and 2D graph searches for chemical molecules. First of all, documents are collected from the Web, and then preprocessed using document classification and segmentation. We apply Support Vector Machines for classification and propose a novel method of text segmentation. Then chemical entities in the documents are tagged and indexed to provide fast searches. Simultaneously, chemical structure information are collected, processed, and indexed for fast graph searches.\nMany issues exist to support textual chemical entity searches. Chemical names and formulae usually appear in chemical documents when corresponding molecules are mentioned, but a chemical molecule can have different textual representative ways. A simple keyword search would retrieve only the exact match and not the others. Additionally, ambiguous non-chemical terms such as \"He\" are retrieved. We show how chemical entity searches can improve the relevance of returned documents by avoiding those ambiguous terms. Our search engine first extracts chemical entities from text, performs novel indexing suitable for chemical names and formulae, and supports different query models that a scientist may require. We propose a model of hierarchical conditional random fields for entity tagging that considers long-term dependencies at the sentence level. Then to support efficient and effective entity searches, we propose two feature selection methods for entity index building. One is to select frequent and discriminative subsequences from all the candidate features for chemical formula indexing. The other is to first discover subterms of chemical names with corresponding probabilities using a proposed independent frequent subsequence mining algorithm, and then segment a chemical name hierarchically into a tree structure based on discovered independent frequent subsequences. A unsupervised hierarchical text segmentation (HTS) method is proposed for this. Then subterms on the HTS tree can be indexed. Finally, query models with corresponding ranking functions are introduced for chemical entity searches. Experiments show that our approaches to chemical entity tagging, indexing, and search perform well.\nIn addition to text searches, massive amounts of structured data in Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics raise an issue of effective and efficient structure searches. Graphs are used to model structures for a long time. A typical type of graph search is a subgraph query that retrieves all graphs containing the query graph. To support efficient search, graph features such as subgraphs are extracted from graphs for graph indexing. Then, for a given subgraph query, graph candidates that may contain the subgraph are retrieved using the index, and subgraph isomorphism tests are performed to scan the candidates. However, since the space of all the possible subgraphs of the whole graph set is prohibitively large, feature selection for index pruning is required. Thus, one of the key issues is, given the set of all the possible subgraphs of the graph set, which subset of features is the optimal to achieve the highest precision for a given query set? To answer this question, first, we introduce a graph search process for subgraph queries. Then, we propose several novel feature selection criteria, Max-Precision, Max-Irredundant-Information, and Max-Information-Min-Redundancy, based on pointwise mutual information. We also propose a greedy feature search algorithm to find a near optimal feature set based on Max-Information-Min-Redundancy. Finally we show empirically that our proposed methods achieve a higher precision than previous methods.\nBesides subgraph queries, users often execute similarity graph queries to search for graphs similar to the query graph. Previous methods usually use the maximum common edge subgraph (MCEG) to measure the similarity of two graphs. However, MCEG isomorphism is NP-hard and prohibitively slow to scan all graphs in the data set, so that it is not feasible for online searches to use MCEG in the fly to measure the similarity of retrieved graphs. We propose a novel approach to this issue from a different view by ranking search results using a weighted linear graph kernel that can avoid real time MCEG isomorphism tests, but achieve a reasonably high quality of search results. First, subgraphs features are extracted from graphs and indexed. Second, for a given graph query, graphs containing its subgraph features are retrieved and similarity scores are computed based on the indexed subgraph features. Finally, graphs are sorted and returned based on similarity scores. Subgraph weights used by the graph kernel are learned offline from a training set generated using MCEG isomorphism. We show empirically that the proposed methods of learning to rank for similarity graph queries can achieve a reasonably high normalized discounted cumulative gain in comparison with the \"gold standard\" method based on MCEG isomorphism. Moreover, our method can be applied to learn other similarity metrics, such as explicit knowledge provided by domain experts or implicit knowledge from user logs.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [869], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Bingjun ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bingjun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Lee Giles", "Prasenjit Mitra", "Jesse Louis Barlow", "Robert T Collins", "Bing Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Lee Giles, Committee Chair", "Prasenjit Mitra, Committee Chair", "Jesse Louis Barlow, Committee Member", "Robert T Collins, Committee Member", "Bing Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Information retrieval", "information extraction", "entity tagging", "entity search", "query model", "graph mining", "graph indexing", "graph search", "feature selection", "Chemoinformatics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The function of neuroligin-2 in neuronal development and neuropsychiatric disorders", "id": "17363", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8392", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Synapse is the functional unit for brain functions. Neuroligins are a family of cell adhesion molecules found at the postsynaptic sites of both excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic synapses. The trans-synaptic interactions between neuroligins and their presynaptic receptor neurexins regulate synapse formation and function. First, I investigated the functional defects of novel neuroligin-2 mutations linked to schizophrenia. In a cohort of 584 schizophrenia patients, we identified novel neuroligin-2 missense point mutations. Among them, I identified R215H as a loss-of-function mutation applying a heterologous GABAergic synapse induction assay. The R215H mutant was defective in mediating cell adhesion and in promoting GABAergic synapse formation. Mechanistically, the R215H mutant showed significantly reduced cell surface expression possibly due to incomplete glycosylation. My work suggests that defect in GABAergic synapse formation may be a potential risk factor for schizophrenia. \nIn the second part of my thesis, I reported a novel function of neuroligin-2 in regulating GABA functional switch from excitation to inhibition through KCC2. KCC2 expression was significantly reduced after knockdown of neuroligin-2 by shRNA-mediated RNA interference. Knockdown of neuroligin-2 abolished GABA functional switch in developing neurons and reversed GABA action to excitatory in mature neurons. Overexpression of shRNA proof neuroligin-2 rescued both decreased KCC2 expression and delayed GABA functional switch induced by shRNAs. Using gramicidin-perforated patch clamp recordings, I further demonstrated that neuroligin-2 expression level directly regulates GABA equilibrium potential. In addition, I showed that KCC2 overexpression rescued glutamatergic synapse loss induced by knockdown of neuroligin-2, suggesting that neuroligin-2 regulates glutamatergic synapses through KCC2.\nIn summary, my findings uncovered a new function of neuroligin-2 in regulating GABA functional switch and glutamatergic synapse formation. Therefore, in addition to its conventional role of cell adhesion at GABAergic synapses, neuroligin-2 may serve as a master regulator in balancing excitation and inhibition in the brain. Dysfunctions of neuroligin-2 may cause excitation/inhibition imbalance and contribute to the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, as indicated by the case of neuroligin-2 R215H mutant in schizophrenia.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8307], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Chicheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chicheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gong Chen", "Douglas Cavener", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Richard W Ordway", "Rick Owen Gilmore"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gong Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Chair", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Rick Owen Gilmore, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Neuroligin", "Synapse", "GABA", "Schizophrenia", "KCC2"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The roles of post-translational modification of PIV5 P protein in viral gene expression\n\n", "id": "11702", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1690", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Paramyxovirus RNA synthesis requires the large (L) protein and the phosphoprotein (P). It was initially thought that phosphorylation of the P protein was important for viral gene expression, however there is no direct proof supporting the assumption. Recently, our group reported that phosphorylation at S157 of the P protein of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a prototypical paramyxovirus, correlated with decreased viral gene expression. In this study, I have shown that: (1) Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) bound the P protein through the S(pS157)P motif; (2) PLK1 inhibitor increased PIV5 gene expression; (3) PLK1 over-expression inhibited PIV5 gene expression; (4) PLK1 inhibitor reduced phosphorylation level of the P protein in PIV5 infected cells; and (5) PLK1 directly phosphorylated the P protein in vitro,  indicating that PLK1 down-regulated PIV5 gene expression by phosphorylating the P protein. Furthermore, I have determined the PLK1 phosphorylation site, S308, within the P protein and found that mutation at S308 to alanine increased the minigenome activity, which was not affected by either PLK1 inhibitor or PLK1 over-expression. Mutation at either the binding site or the phosphorylation site of PLK1 in PIV5 increased virus gene expression, which correlated with increased induction of cell death and cytokine induction. The results indicate that PIV5 limits its viral gene expression to avoid induction of innate immune responses.\n\nSince the P protein is heavily phosphorylated, we speculate that phosphorylation of the P protein at other sites may play a positive role in PIV5 gene expression. I have identified a phosphorylation site of PIV5 P protein by mass spectrometry, T286, and found that (1) mutation of T286 to alanine reduced PIV5 minigenome activity; (2) P-T286D showed very low activity and P-T286E showed no activity in the minigenome system; (3) rPIV5-P-T286A virus grew slower than PIV5; (4) viral RNA synthesis and protein expression in rPIV5-P-T286A infected cells were delayed. The defects of T286A/D/E were not due to NP-P-L complex formation. I also found that P-T286A/D/E affected viral transcription. It is the first time that the P protein phosphorylation is found to be important for paramyxovirus gene expression in virus infection. \n\nSumoylation is a protein post-translational modification and plays an important role in regulating protein function and signal transduction. I have discovered that the P protein of PIV5 can be sumoylated by SUMO1 in both transfected cells and infected cells. I have identified one sumoylation site within the P protein, K254. Mutation at K254 to arginine (P-K254R) reduced PIV5 minigenome activity. Incorporation of K254R into the genome of the virus (rPIV5-P-K254R) resulted in reduction of viral growth, viral RNA synthesis and viral protein expression, indicating that PIV5 uses host sumoylation system to regulate its growth.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1676], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Dengyun  ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dengyun ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Biao He, Anthony Schmitt", "Biao He", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Na Xiong", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Avery August"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Biao He, Anthony Schmitt, Dissertation Advisor", "Biao He, Committee Chair", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Chair", "Na Xiong, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Kinase", "Virus", "Post-translational modification", "Gene expression", "Apoptosis", "Immune response"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "SYNTHESIS OF COMPLEX NANOSTRUCTURES OF LAYERED METAL CHALCOGENIDES AND OTHER NANOMATERIALS USING COLLOIDAL CHEMISTRY", "id": "13199dzs190", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13199", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To access novel and complex nanostructures spanning the wide variety of chemical composition and crystal conformation has significant impact on the next technology revolution in the sense that the ability to produce advanced materials underpins the development of the future devices. Solution-based chemical synthesis of nanomaterials in the colloidal solution has attracted numerous attentions in the last few decades because the huge potential scientists have seen in this method to achieve unprecedented control over the materials characteristics such as morphology, composition, size, and uniformity demonstrated by the successful synthesis of quantum dots to the construction of complex hierarchical structures. Layered metal chalcogenides is a family of compounds that when reducing the layer thickness into nanoscale becomes a good analog to graphene, but with much more plentiful choices of chemical composition and properties. The application of colloidal synthesis into making 2D materials based on the layered metal chalcogenides is an exciting research direction but still in its infancy. In this dissertation we describe how to control the reaction parameters in colloidal synthesis to make meta-stable and complex nanostructures with interesting properties that could have potential application in the field of energy storage and conversion. \nFirst, we discuss the colloidal synthesis of amorphous germanium iron alloy nanoparticles and their electrochemical performance as anode materials for lithium ion batteries. The meta-stable amorphous state of the particles was achieved by a fast quenching step following the crystal nucleation and growth. Both thermodynamic and kinetic factors are evaluated through aliquot study to elucidate the growth pathways. The as-prepared sample was tested for the half-cell and acquired good specific capacity and cycling stability. The addition of iron into the germanium is believed to effectively alleviate the volume change during the lithiation/delithiation process of germanium and possibly has a good impact on the overall electrical conductivity of the material. Introducing earth-abundant elements into the silicon-related materials is a promising way to reduce the cost of the next generation lithium ion batteries while still maintain a good performance. \nNext, the principles we learned in the colloidal synthesis of metal alloys are adopted and modified to successfully make MoSe2 nanoflowers that comprise of poly-crystalline few-layered nanosheets. Besides the reaction kinetics, precursor choices that affect the reactivity of the chalcogen entities in the solution have been identified as the key parameters to determine both the morphology and crystallinity of the final product. Characterization techniques like powder XRD and high-resolution TEM have been employed to reveal a slight deviation of the crystal structure of the nanoflowers from the bulk counterpart, which we believe can be attributed to the few-layer nature of these flowers. Raman spectroscopy is used to probe the interlayer decoupling behavior of the flowers with different size and layer thickness compared with the bulk MoSe2. We found out that the interlayer interaction can be modulated through laser heating, thermal, as well as nanostructuring effect and especially the laser modulation could result fast and reversible response. This study presents the possibility and feasibility of using colloidally synthesized TMDs as the platform to understand the 2D properties of these materials.\nChapter 4 takes the knowledge we learn in the previous two studies into the exploration of novel and under-studied ternary metal chalcogenides using colloidal synthesis. By a facile one-pot heat-up method, we have successfully obtained a ternary In4SnSe4 with a unique crystal structure that is drastically different from the well-known binary metal chalcogenides crystal structures of zincblende or wurtzite that are both derivative of diamond structure. The as-prepared microwires of In4SnSe is proven by high-resolution TEM and STEM-EDS mapping to have a surface Si-contained oxide layer of about 10~20 nm. Bandgap calculation of the In4SnSe predicts an electronic band structure with a direct band gap of 2.0 eV, which matches well with the solar spectrum and make it a promising candidate material in the photovoltaic devices. The optical bandgap of the as-prepared sample was also measured by diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy and yielding a value of 1.57 eV, which matches well with the photoluminescence peak located around 1.54 eV. Both theoretical and experimental result corroborate on the possession of a direct bandgap of ~1.5 eV for the In4SnSe4, which could attract more studies on this family of materials that have similar crystal structure. \nFinally, the GeSe and SnSe from the layered metal chalcogenides family are used as a model system to study the possibility of making 2D heterostructures in colloidal solution. We have employed both heat-up and continuous hot-injection method to test various reaction parameters such as precursor concentration and adding sequence and are able to obtain five different samples of 2D heterostructures, one of which realized a full coverage of SnSe on top of the entire GeSe hexagonal sheet. These 2D heterostructures are in the scale of few micron meters, which has never been achieved in any other 2D heterostructures before. By comparing the morphologies of the five samples, we propose a growth pathway that affected by both thermodynamics and kinetics, involving the competition between homogeneous nucleation/growth and the heterogeneous nucleation/growth. The methodology in this study can be potentially applied to other 2D systems with more imminent technical significance.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12856], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Du ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Du", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "John B Asbury", "Benjamin James Lear", "James Hansell Adair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Chair", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanoscience", "Layered Chalcogenides", "Colloidal Synthesis", "Molybdenum Diselenide", "Germanium Selenide"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Arsenic Chemistry with Sulfide, Pyrite, Zero-valent Iron and Magnetite\n", "id": "11370", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2012", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of this thesis is to study the immobilization reactions of arsenic in water. Since compounds containing iron or sulfide are common in most natural and engineered systems, the research focused on the redox reactions and adsorption of arsenic with sulfide, pyrite, zero-valent iron (ZVI), and magnetite which were studied through wet chemistry methods and spectroscopic techniques. The kinetic and thermodynamic information of the reactions of As(V) with S(-II), As(V)/As(III) with pyrite and surface-oxidized pyrite, As(V) with ZVI and acid-treated ZVI, As(III) with magnetite was used to identify mechanisms. The necessity to maintain strictly anoxic conditions was emphasized for the study of arsenic redox chemistry with sulfides and ZVI. \nThe major findings of this research can be stated as follows. First, dissolved sulfide reduced As(V) to lower valences to form a yellow precipitate at acidic pH. The reaction involved the formation of thioarsenic intermediate species. Dissolved O2, granular activated carbon (GAC) and dissolved Fe(II) inhibited the removal of As(V) by sulfide. Elemental sulfur catalyzed the reduction of As(V) by sulfide, which implied the possible benefit of using sulfur-loaded GAC for arsenic removal. Possible reaction mechanisms were discussed. Second, As(III) adsorbed on pristine pyrite over a broader pH range than on surface-oxidized pyrite, while As(V) adsorbed over a narrower pH range with pristine pyrite. As(V) was completely reduced to As(III) on pristine pyrite at acidic pH but not at higher pH. The reduction was first-order with respect to As(V). As(V) was not reduced on surface-oxidized pyrite at pH = 4-11. The different behaviors of As(V) and As(III) on pristine and surface oxidized pyrite determines the toxicity and mobility of arsenic under oxic/anoxic environments. Third, commercial ZVI reduced As(V) to As(III) at low pH (<9) but not at higher pH. Acid-treated ZVI reduced As(V) to As(0), indicated by wet chemical analyses and  by XANES/EXAFS, which could result in reduced mobility and toxicity of arsenic. Fourth, magnetite is a good adsorbent for both As(V) and As(III). As(V) was not reduced by stoichiometric magnetite even under a strictly anoxic condition. Addition of dissolved Fe(II) to magnetite did not reduce As(V) either. Under oxic conditions, the homogeneous oxidation of As(III) by dissolved oxygen was negligible. As(III) was rapidly oxidized in the presence of magnetite. The extent of the oxidation was promoted with addition of As(V). The effect is more significant at low As(III) concentrations. The effect could be important at field sites where total arsenic concentrations are low.\nThis research is contributes to the understanding of the behavior of arsenic in sulfidic natural systems and in sites treated with GAC, ZVI-based permeable reactive barriers or injected with nano-ZVI particles. The optimum conditions and kinetic data for arsenic removal are applicable in field situations and engineered systems.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1994], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Fenglong ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fenglong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey", "Brian Dempsey", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare", "William D Burgos", "Herschel Adams Elliott", "Peggy Ann Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey, Dissertation Advisor", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Chair", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Committee Member", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "Herschel Adams Elliott, Committee Member", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["iron oxides", "zero-valent iron", "water treatment", "Arsenic", "sulfides"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EXPLORING THE MEMORY HIERARCHY DESIGN WITH EMERGING MEMORY TECHNOLOGIES", "id": "12460", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2164", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The performance of a processor relies on two important resources: the micro- processor\u2019s computing ability of processing data and the memory hierarchy that stores data and supports data to the micro-processor. Unfortunately, as technologies scale down, the progress of the memory hierarchy, which uses traditional memory technologies, is slower than that of the micro-processor. Especially, when the micro-processor design moves to the regime of chip-multi-processors (CMPs), the gap between processors and memory hierarchy becomes even larger and thus results in the well known problem of \u201cmemory wall\u201d.\n\nFirst, the increasing number of processing cores on a single chip requires more data to be fed in time to support the high computing throughput. It means that more memory needs to be integrated on-chip to maintain the high performance. The low density of the traditional SRAM technology, however, limits the capacity of on-chip memory. Second, since the power consumption issue has become one of the most important design concerns, the high leakage power consumption of traditional SRAM/DRAM technologies significantly impedes the progress of the memory hierarchy. This problem becomes even worse as the technologies scale down and more memory is integrated. Third, the data stored in SRAM/DRAM memory become more and more vulnerable to radiation-based soft errors with technology scaling. The extra overhead of error correction mechanisms further limits the improvement of performance and induces more power consumption. As a summary, traditional memory technologies, such as SRAM and DRAM, cannot satisfy the memory requirement with technology scaling because of low density, high standby power, and poor reliability.\n\nTo attack the \u201cmemory wall\u201d, various non-volatile-memory (NVM) technologies have been proposed as candidates for the design of future memory hierarchy because of their advantages of high density, zero standby power, fast access speed, non-volatility, etc. These memory technologies include Spin Torque Transfer Random-access Memory (STT-RAM), Phase Change Memory (PCM), Resistive Random-access Memory (RRAM), etc. With these emerging NVMs, the memory hierarchy design needs to be rethought to achieve high performance, low power consumption, and high reliability. Since these emerging memory technologies have different characters, the following three questions should be answered to achieve the design goals: (1) how to choose the proper memory technologies for different levels of the memory hierarchy? (2) how to improve the architecture of the tra- ditional memory hierarchy to facilitate the adoption of these emerging memories? (3) how to leverage the advantages of different memory technologies?\n\nIn this dissertation, we intend to answer these questions by exploring the memory hierarchy design from different angles. First, we propose to replace different levels of a traditional memory hierarchy with proper emerging memory technologies, according to their characters. We will show that both performance and power consumption can be improved after we apply modifications to the memory architectures. At the same time, we find it feasible to leverage advantages from different memory technologies by using the hybrid memory design. Second, we presents a analytical model named \u201cMoguls\u201d to theoretically study the optimization design of a memory hierarchy. With the help of this model, we can not only estimate the level number and the corresponding capacity of the memory hierarchy, but also find out the best choice of memory technology in each level quickly. Third, we explore the vulnerability of the CMPs to radiation-based soft errors by replacing different levels of on-chip memory with STT-RAMs. The results show the trade-off among reliability, performance, and power consumption.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2144], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Guangyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Guangyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yuan Xie", "Yuan Xie", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Xiaolong Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yuan Xie, Dissertation Advisor", "Yuan Xie, Committee Chair", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Committee Member", "Xiaolong Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["memory hierarchy", "emerging memory", "STT-RAM", "PCM", "performance", "power", "reliability"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Performance of Multi-Parents Genetic Algorithms (MPGA) for IIR Adaptive System Identification\n", "id": "23533", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10670", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Genetic algorithms (GA) are based on the principles of natural selection and natural genetics that originate in biology.

Our lab recently has reported a novel role of HIM-8 in negatively regulating the Sox domain transcription factor EGL-13 encoded on the X chromosome.  Mutation of him-8 suppresses the egg-laying and underlying vulval morphology defects of the egl-13 mutant with mutations in the Sox DNA binding domain.  My data show that all ZIM proteins function similarly to HIM-8 in suppressing EGL-13 transcription factor.  In addition, mutation of him-8 suppresses phenotypes caused by missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of other transcription factors, including the zinc finger protein SPTF-3, the PAX protein EGL-38, and the HOX protein LIN-39.  Mutation of him-8 has no effect on null alleles of above transcription factors and non-null alleles of non-transcription factors including LIN-15, SUR-6, EGL-26 and UNC-37.  These results suggest that HIM-8 and the related ZIM proteins have a broad ability in suppressing transcription factors encoded on multiple chromosomes; that the HIM-8/ZIMs suppression is specific to transcription factors with compromised DNA binding activity; and that the effects caused by HIM-8/ZIMs are global that occur in multiple tissues in the soma.\nI further investigated the mechanism by which HIM-8/ZIMs suppresses the activities of the transcription factors.  My data demonstrated that him-8 mutations increase the transcription of the targets of two transcription factors and that him-8 and zim-1 mutations result in increased H3K4 methylation level, indicating that the transcription level is increased and that the chromatin is modified to a more accessible status in him-8/zim-1 mutant.  It is possible that him-8/zim-1 increases transcription level by mediating chromatin modification.   dpy-30 RNAi did not clarify the role of DPY-30 in HIM-8 suppression, but it suggests that RNAi might be an additional mechanism of HIM-8 suppression.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2396], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Hongliu ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hongliu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhi Chun Lai", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Pamela J Mitchell", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Chair", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Pamela J Mitchell, Committee Member", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HIM-8 suppression", "zinc finger ZIM proteins", "chromatin modification"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "AN ENERGETIC VARIATIONAL APPROACH TO MODELING COMPLEX FLUIDS AND ITS NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS \n", "id": "12057", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2298", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation we present an energetic variational approach to modeling complex fluids. \nThe principle of least action or the principle of virtual work is applied to derive the conservative (Hamiltonian) part of the system, including the non-Newtonian stress tensor.

Suppose we have observed n current descendant sequences of length L. One interesting question is how to estimate the unknown ancestral distribution from the observed descendants, considering realistic biology complexities such as mutation and recombination.\n\nWe developed a statistical model by extending the ancestor mixture model (Chen and Lindsay (2006)) with both mutation and recombination to estimate the ancestral distribution. However, though we can write out the full likelihood for the ancestral distribution explicitly, there is an enormous computation challenge in the actual computation due to an enormous number of recombination possibilities. This number grows exponentially in sequence length. Therefore, we proposed to develop composite likelihood as a methodology that makes the computation feasible.\n\nIn this thesis, we first introduce our developed statistical model. We then discuss issues in the construction of composite likelihoods from the view of statistical efficiency. Then, a Markov chain composite likelihood (MCCL) method is proposed and applied to our statistical model, now considering only the more challenging recombination factor. Two estimators, a left to right estimator and a hierarchical estimator, are developed consequently to estimate both marginal and joint ancestral distributions through MCCL. Finally, some simulation results are shown to investigate the performance of two estimators.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3204], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Jianping ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jianping", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce G Lindsay", "Bruce G Lindsay", "Debashis Ghosh", "Bing Li", "Rongling Wu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce G Lindsay, Dissertation Advisor", "Bruce G Lindsay, Committee Chair", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Member", "Bing Li, Committee Member", "Rongling Wu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Markov chain likelihood", "modified Hoeffding score", "Hoeffding score", "coposite likelihood", "mutation", "recombiantion"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "PECVD, SPATIAL ALD, AND PEALD ZINC OXIDE THIN FILM TRANSISTORS \n\n", "id": "8818", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3097", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes low-temperature ZnO deposition and thin film transistor (TFT) fabrication for the fastest ZnO circuits reported to date.  Using both plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) and, in collaboration with the Eastman Kodak Company, a novel spatial atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, we have fabricated circuits with 4 mm minimum channel length TFTs with propagation delay less than 30 ns/stage.  For comparison, we also describe devices fabricated using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition that result in much slower circuits.\nA key problem in fabricating ZnO devices and circuits is control of the semiconductor trap density and the semiconductor/dielectric interface state density.  We believe this strongly limits the performance of ZnO TFTs fabricated by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).  ZnO TFTs using an Al2O3 gate dielectric deposited in situ by PECVD showed moderate gate leakage (< 105 A/cm2), field-effect mobility of ~10 cm2/V\u00d7s, and threshold voltage of 7.5 V.  However, these devices are strongly limited by interface states and reducing the gate leakage results in TFTs with lower mobility. ZnO TFTs fabricated with low-leakage Al2O3 have mobility near 0.05 cm2/V\u00d7s, and five-stage ring oscillators fabricated using these TFTs have a 1.2 kHz oscillation frequency at 60 V, which is substantially slower than simulation results. ZnO TFTs with large gate leakage showed a higher field-effect mobility due to interface state charging through the leaky dielectric. \nAlthough the performance of PECVD ZnO TFTs may be limited by interface or bulk traps, PECVD provides flexibility in depositing low-temperature doped films. We demonstrated boron-doped ZnO thin films, grown at 200 \u00b0C by PECVD, with resistivity as low as 4 \u00d7 10-4 W\u00d7cm and with excellent optical transmission (>85% for visible spectrum). The free electron concentration, determined by Hall effect measurement was as high as 1 x 1021/cm3 with mobility of 13.5 cm2/V\u00d7s. In this doped ZnO work a low reactivity oxidant, CO2, is used to provide uniform growth over large-area and to simplify the system design.  The boron source used was triethylboron (TEB), which is substantially less toxic than commonly used diborane. These results are among the lowest resistivities reported for doped ZnO thin films.  \nIn contrast to PECVD, spatial ALD, and PEALD may result in films with fewer stoichiometric defects and improved semiconductor/dielectric interface. ZnO TFTs fabricated using spatial ALD had a typical field effect mobility of ~15 cm2/V\u00d7s, a threshold voltage of 5 V, subthreshold slope of < 0.3 V/dec, and current on/off ratio > 108. Similarly, PEALD ZnO TFTs showed a typical field-effect mobility of ~16 cm2/V\u00d7s, a threshold voltage of 2.5 V, sub-threshold slope of 80 mV/decade, and current on/off ratio of 1010. Using both spatial ALD and PEALD ZnO TFTs, seven-stage ring oscillators with 4 mm minimum channel length TFTs oscillated at 2.3 MHz, corresponding to a propagation delay of ~30 ns/stage. These are the fastest ZnO TFT circuits reported to date.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3086], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Jie ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Chair", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition", "Atomic Layer Deposition", "Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Depostion", "Thin Film Transistors (TFTs)", "Zinc Oxide (ZnO)", "ZnO TFTs Circuits"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "CHINESE AS \"SPECIES\" IN THE AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL: AN ORGANIZATIONAL CASE STUDY\n", "id": "12190", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3101", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The importance of including Chinese language instruction in American schools has attracted much attention and discussion in recent years.

The common theme that runs through my research is use of the phylloquinone anion radical as a marker for electron transfer (ET). The work is divided into three parts. In the first part, I report the discovery of a new optical signal that can serve as a marker for in vivo Fe-starvation. This signal is shown due to the transient reduction of the A1A and A1B phylloquinones, which becomes apparent because of the increased conversion of energy to CS states per unit time when the Fe-stress-induced protein IsiA binds to PS I and enlarges its optical cross section. I verify the role of IsiA as a functional accessory LH system under physiologically relevant conditions. In the second part, I study the Met axial ligands of the A0A and A0B chlorophylls (Chl), which are traditionally considered to be the primary electron acceptors. Site-specific variants of PS I were generated in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by substituting M688PsaA or M668PsaB for His, an amino acid that provides the axial ligand to most of the other Chls in PS I. This substitution leads to two populations of RCs: in one the His is bonded to A0, and in the other in which the His is hydrogen bonded (H-bonded) to the C1 carbonyl of the A1 phylloquinone. In either case, the midpoint redox potential of the bonded cofactor is raised, thus rendering forward ET unfavorable. Hence, in the branch carrying the mutation, ET is blocked, and the negative charge on either A1\u2212 or A0\u2212 recombines with the positive charge on P700+. In the third part, I probe the near environment of the accessory Chls (Aacc), which have not yet been shown experimentally to participate in primary CS. Site-specific variants of PS I were generated by substituting N604PsaA or N591PsaB, which are bonded to the Mg atom of Aacc through a H2O molecule, with Met, His or Leu. The quantum yield of CS is found to decrease in the ET branch containing the substituted amino acid. Unlike the M688HPsaA or M668HPsaB variants, no sign of rapid charge recombination to P700+ is detected that can account for the lower quantum yield. Significantly, no re-direction of CS to the unaltered branch is observed in any of the A0 and Aacc variants. In summary, my work shows that the IsiA protein is an efficient antenna system for Fe-stressed cyanobacteria, that the Met ligand to A0 is critical for efficient forward ET, and that the accessory Chls play an active role in primary CS in PS I.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8862], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Junlei ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Junlei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John H Golbeck", "John H Golbeck", "Donald Ashley Bryant", "B Tracy Nixon", "Carsten Krebs", "Lasse Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John H Golbeck, Dissertation Advisor", "John H Golbeck, Committee Chair", "Donald Ashley Bryant, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cyanobacterium", "photosynthesis", "Photosystem I", "charge separation", "light harvesting", "electrochromic band shift", "electron transfer"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Double-Gate, Tri-Layer, and Vertical ZnO TFTs and Circuits", "id": "26520", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11691", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Zinc oxide thin film transistor (ZnO TFT) technology can be applied to the integrated circuits (ICs) of high-performance large-area electronics. In this dissertation, innovations in device structure, fabrication process, and circuitry are made to overcome the original limitations of the technology and to improve the performance of ZnO TFTs and their circuits. The contents include research on double-gate TFTs, tri-layer TFTs, double-gate tri-layer TFTs, selective etching of Al2O3 over ZnO, and TFT-based digital/analog circuits. Additionally, self-aligned vertical ZnO TFTs for low-cost device scaling are studied with physics-based modeling.\n\nZnO TFTs with the active layers deposited by a plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) system are used as the baseline devices in this research. These devices are n-channel TFTs of high mobility >10 cm2/Vs, large on-off ratio >107, and negative turn-on voltage. Due to the lack of stable p-channel TFTs, NMOS-only circuitry is one choice for ZnO TFT-based circuits. A double-gate ZnO TFT structure is developed, which allows tuning of the turn-on voltage of the TFTs by biasing the top gate electrode. Characterization circuits in enhancement-depletion mode with high gain >100 and large noise margin are achieved with double-gate TFTs. Digital circuits including logic gates, full adders, flip-flops, and frequency dividers and the corresponding design method are developed. A low-power low-input-voltage active rectifier as an analog circuit are also customized and realized. The research lays the foundation for using double-gate ZnO TFTs to build complex digital/analog electronic systems on a large scale.\n\nTo obtain a more positive turn-on voltage, which reduces the static power consumption of TFT circuits, tri-layer ZnO TFT and double-gate tri-layer ZnO TFT structures with in-situ PEALD Al2O3 passivation are developed. Selective etching of the Al2O3 passivation layer without hurting the ZnO active layer for metal contacts is accomplished with pH-controlled selective etchants, which is the critical process to realize these structures and is developed with in-depth study. Alkaline aqueous solutions with pH between about 9 and 12 are found to etch Al2O3 at a useful rate with minimal attack of ZnO. High selectivity >400:1 and an Al2O3 etch rate of \u223c50 nm/min are obtained using a pH 12 etch solution at 60 \u00b0C. Near-zero turn-on voltage and improved bias-stress stability are obtained with the tri-layer structure due to the in-situ protected back surface of the ZnO channel layers.\n\nVertical TFTs (VTFTs) with ZnO channel layers deposited with spatial ALD (SALD) are studied, which achieves sub-micrometer channel length and increased drive current using only low-resolution patterning. A physics-based model is developed using the Synopsys Sentaurus drift-diffusion simulator. Acceptor-like traps above and below the conduction band minimum are needed to model the semiconductor behavior of SALD ZnO. By producing the asymmetric I\u2013V characteristics with simulations, the role of the ungated ZnO region near the foot of the VTFT is understood, which has a more significant effect on charge injection than on charge extraction.

As franchising increasingly becomes an essential business practice, especially in the service industries, it is important to examine how a firm\u2019s use of the franchising system affects competitive market conditions, and the purpose of this dissertation is to investigate how franchising alters the competitive condition of the business environment.\nThis dissertation conducts two-levels of investigation, industry-wide and firm-specific, in order to examine the influences of franchising on three specific dimensions of competition: competition structure, change in the competition structure, and the nature of competition.  In addition, it explores the moderating role of the hospitality industry, in particular on the relationship between franchising and the three dimensions of competition.\nThe dissertation employs two-stage OLS (2SLS) estimation to test the proposed hypotheses.  First, based on the industry-level analysis, the study finds that the degree of the franchising involvement of an industry decreases industry concentration, changes in industry competition structure, and the dynamic competition of the industry.  In the hospitality industry, as compared to other service industries, these negative effects of franchising on both the changes in the industry competition structure and the dynamic competition disappear, and actually turn positive.\nSecond, based on firm-level analysis, this dissertation finds that the more and faster a firm\u2019s involvement in franchising is, as compared to its competitors, the higher the competitive power is that the firm faces within a market.  In addition, a firm\u2019s increased involvement in franchising as compared to its competitors increases its dynamic competition.\nThe present study\u2019s inquiry into the relationship between franchising and competition contributes to the theoretical knowledge about how franchising influences the dynamics of competition by supporting the resource/knowledge based view.  It contributes to the strategic management literature by reinforcing the importance of the relative strategic actions taken to create competitive advantage in the market and by supporting the concept of hyper-competition. The study further provides several practical implications for business managers and policy-makers.

The highly organized anatomy of the cerebellum makes it a good model for the study of network function. As the only output of the cerebellar cortex, Purkinje cells are considered as the cellular basis for certain types of motor learning. Purkinje cells receive excitatory synaptic inputs from parallel fibers and climbing fibers, and inhibitory inputs from GABAergic interneurons located at the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Since the activity of Purkinje cells is largely regulated by the synaptic integration, knowledge about cerebellar granule cells and interneurons is necessary for the understanding of the mechanism of motor learning and memory.\n\nInterneurons including stellate cells and basket cells obtain afferent excitatory inputs from parallel fibers and project inhibitory inputs onto Purkinje cells, and thus form a feed-forward inhibition network. The inhibition from the interneurons counteracts the excitatory effects from parallel fibers and prevents the Purkinje cells from being over excited. However, the synaptic plasticity of the interneurons remains elusive. Using stellate cell as a model, we investigated the function of glutamate receptors in the synaptic plasticity in interneurons and the consequent impact on the pattern of GABA release from interneuron axonal terminals, which directly determines the inhibition of Purkinje cells. We observed that the activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors could induce a new form of synaptic plasticity at the parallel fiber-to-stellate cell synapse, including a subtype switch of AMPA receptors from naturally GluR2-lacking (Ca2+-permeable) to GluR2-containing (Ca2+-impermeable). This plasticity is probably postsynaptically induced and requires protein kinase C (PKC) and the activity of protein interacting with PRKCA 1 (PICK1). In addition, previous studies showed that the activation of NMDA receptors directly triggered a long-lasting potentiation of GABA release at axonal terminals. Our work about the characterization of NMDA receptors in stellate cells suggested the possible expression of NR2B and NR2D subunits. However, blockade of single subtype of NMDA receptors did not affect the basal level of GABA release. \n\nChanges in synaptic transmission would alter the excitability of a cell and therefore affect the action potential firing pattern. We explored if action potential firing would in return regulate the synaptic efficacy. We found that blockade of spontaneous action potentials (sAPs) in stellate cells induced an increased expression of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors at the parallel fiber-to-stellate cell synapse. This effect might be transcription-independent, but requires intact protein synthesis machinery. Moreover, inhibition of calmodulin mimicked the effect of sAP blockade, indicating the sAP blockade-induced GluR2 expression may be mediated by a reduced calmodulin activity.\n\nOur study revealed mechanisms underlying long-term plasticity of AMPAR subtype at the parallel fiber-to-stellate cell synapse, and the potential functional significance. Our findings would gain the insight into cerebellar interneuron functions and their contribution to motor learning and memory.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3839], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Lu ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Si Qiong Liu", "Si Qiong Liu", "Matthew Whim", "Bernhard Luscher", "Steven Schiff", "Gong Chen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Si Qiong Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Si Qiong Liu, Committee Chair", "Matthew Whim, Committee Member", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "Steven Schiff, Committee Member", "Gong Chen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["calmodulin", "action potential", "extrasynaptic", "NMDA receptor", "PICK", "PKC", "AMPA receptor", "synaptic plasticity", "GABAergic interneuron", "cerebellum", "protein synthesis", "electrophysiology"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The functions of PIV5 V protein\n\n\n\n", "id": "8011", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4541", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) belongs to the rubulavirus genus in the paramyxovirus family, which includes many well-known human and animal pathogens as well as emerging viruses such as Hendra virus and Nipah virus. The PIV5 V protein contains a cysteine-rich C-terminal domain which is conserved among all paramyxoviruses. The V protein can block both interferon (IFN) signaling by causing degradation of STAT1 and IFN production by blocking IRF-3 nuclear import. Previously, it was reported that recombinant SV5 lacking the C terminus of the V protein (rPIV5V\u00a6\u00a4C) induces a severe cytopathic effect (CPE) in tissue culture whereas wild-type (wt) PIV5 infection does not. In chapter 1, the nature of the CPE was investigated. Our data suggested that: (1) The CPE induced by rPIV5V\u00a6\u00a4C is apoptosis; (2) wt V protein inhibited the apoptosis induced by rPIV5V\u00a6\u00a4C; (3) IFN was not required for the apoptosis; (4) Caspase-2 and 3 were activated but not required for rPIV5V\u00a6\u00a4C induced apoptosis; (5) caspsae-12 is activated; (6) Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress makers such as GRP78, GRP94 are upregulated in rPIV5V\u00a6\u00a4C infected cells, suggesting that rPIV5V\u00a6\u00a4C might induce apoptosis by triggering ER stress. \n\nRecently, it is reported that PIV5 V protein plays a important role in regulating PIV5 RNA synthesis in the mini-genome, possibly through a host protein. In chapter 2, the mechanism of the regulation of viral RNA synthesis by PIV5 V protein is investigated. The data we have suggested that Akt1, a serine/theronine kinase, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), interacted with PIV5 V protein. Both inhibitors and siRNA of Akt1 reduced PIV5 replication, indicating Akt plays a critical role in PIV5 replication. Furthermore, inhibitors of Akt also reduced the replication of Mumps virus (MuV), Measles virus (MeV), Respiratory Synthcytial Virus (RSV) and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), indicating that Akt plays an important role in replication of many non-segmented negative single-stranded RNA viruses (NNSVs). The P protein of NNSVs is phosphorylated at multiple sites and is a part of viral RNA polymerase complex.  Inhibition of Akt activity reduced the level of P phosphorylation, which is known to play a critical role in viral RNA synthesis. Akt plays important roles in many cellular processes such as cell survival, metabolism, growth, proliferation and mobility and has been targeted for cancer therapy. The finding that NNSV replication requires Akt will lead to better understanding how these viruses replicate, as well as novel strategies to treat infectious diseases caused by NNSVs. \n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4509], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Minghao ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Minghao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Biao He", "Avery August", "Na Xiong", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Konan Kouacou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Biao He, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Na Xiong, Committee Member", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Member", "Konan Kouacou, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rPIV5V\u00a6\u00a4C", "Apoptosis", "AKT", "PIV5", "NNSVs", "AKT inhibitors"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "DIETARY COCOA (THEOBROMA CACAO) SUPPLEMENTATION IMPROVES OBESITY-RELATED FATTY LIVER DISEASE IN MICE  ", "id": "13456mus307", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13456", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), defined in 1980s, is a liver disease that histologically mimics alcoholic hepatitis but occurs in individuals who do not abuse alcohol.  NAFLD is an increasingly recognized condition that may progress to end-stage liver disease; it can be characterized by fat accumulation in liver exceeding 5\u201310% by weight. NAFLD is classified into two stages: simple fatty liver (i.e. steatosis) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The later stage, NASH, has drawn more cautions because its can evolve to more advanced liver damage, and cannot be treated effectively so far. \u201cTwo hit hypothesis\u201d has been proposed to explain the progression from simple steatosis to NASH. According to this hypothesis, steatosis is the \u201cfirst hit\u201d which increases the vulnerability of the liver to various \u201csecond hits\u201d such as chronic inflammation, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, that in turn lead to the inflammation, fibrosis and cellular death characteristic of NASH. It is expectable that food components targeting at those \u201csecond hits\u201d have therapeutic properties and may help prevent the pathogenesis process of NASH. \n\tCocoa (or cacao) is a product of Theobroma cacao fruit, which grows in the equatorial tropics including Central and South America, West Africa, and Malaysia. Cocoa has a long history in use, to treat numbers of disorders such as angina and heart pain. Recent studies has confirmed various health-beneficial effects associated with cocoa products including their multifactorial ability to modulate immune response, and anti-inflammatory, anti-radical and anti-carcinogenic properties. Considering the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH, the multifactorial effects of cocoa may make it a promising candidate in preventing obesity-related fatty liver disease. \n\tTo study the protective effect of cocoa, a high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mouse model is applied. This model is advantageous to investigate metabolic fatty liver disease due to two reasons. Firstly, steatosis developed in healthy livers. Secondly, after steatosis, inflammatory process is triggered by release of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress that lead to hepatocyte apoptosis. This model allows observing the pathogenesis from simple steatosis to NASH. In experiments, mice were fed with high fat diet (60% calorie from fat) for 8 weeks to induce steatosis. After 8 weeks, mice were randomly divided into two groups: HF-HFC and HF group. In HF diet mice still maintain high fat diet for additional 10 weeks, whereas in HF-HFC mice were treated with 8% cocoa supplemented with high fat diet.\n\tIn this research, we hypothesized that cocoa supplementation can ameliorate obesity related NAFLD through modulating lipid metabolism pathway, boosting endogenous antioxidant defense capacity, enhancing mitochondria biogenesis, and reducing chronic inflammation in mice.  To test our hypothesis, we proposed three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Evaluation of protective effect of cocoa supplementation on hepatic lipid metabolism pathway in mice model of NAFLD (discussed in chapter 2). Specific Aim 2: Evaluation of protective effect of cocoa supplementation on hepatic oxidative stress and mitochondrial function in mice model of NAFLD (discussed in chapter 3). Specific Aim 3: Evaluation of protective effect of cocoa supplementation on liver Kupffer cell differentiation in mice model of NAFLD (discussed in chapter 4). \n\t In chapter 2, we demonstrate that cocoa-treated obese mice decrease triglycerides (TAG), an important diagnostic marker of NAFLD, by enhancing fatty acid disposal and reducing lipogenesis in the liver. In chapter 3, we demonstrate that the beneficial effects of cocoa supplementation on NAFLD is through increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and related antioxidant response signaling. In chapter 4, we demonstrated that dietary cocoa is able to alternatively activate M2 KCs in HF-fed mice, and this phenotypic switch protects mice from ongoing of liver damage compared with HF treated alone.   \n\tIn conclusion, in this dissertation, we demonstrated that cocoa supplementation did mitigate obesity-related fatty liver disease, and could be useful in preventing the progression of hepatic steatosis to NASH. These effects are caused by three mechanisms: modulating lipid metabolism pathway, boosting endogenous antioxidant defense capacity, increasing mitochondria biogenesis and reduce chronic inflammation. It is clear that dietary cocoa could be a potential dietary intervention to modulate obesity-related fatty liver disease.

We found that normalized K error can be well approximated by a smooth function of heterogeneity-normalized H and K data densities. Stepwise polynomial fitting suggests including only the first-order terms and a mild interaction term. The relative information content ratio of H to K for the next data point (Rn) suggests the worth of K is always more than that of H, and could be as higher than 10 when K data is sparse. Rn is a function of data densities and K correlation length, thus the decision must consider the amount of presently available data and the heterogeneity of the field.

In Petunia, the polymorphic S-locus, which controls self/non-self recognition, contains an S-RNase gene which regulates pistil specificity and multiple S-locus F-box (SLF) genes which collectively regulate pollen specificity. The collaborative non-self recognition model predicts that, for a given S-haplotype, each SLF recognizes a subset of non-self S-RNases to mediate their ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome, and multiple SLFs collaboratively recognize and detoxify all non-self S-RNases to allow compatible pollination. \n\nThe overall goal of my dissertation research is to study how SLF proteins interact with S-RNases in order to understand the biochemical basis of self/non-self recognition during SI interactions. The function of the S-RNase gene in controlling pistil specificity has been established through both gain- and loss-of-function experiments; however, only gain-of-function experiments have been used to demonstrate the function of several types of SLF genes in controlling pollen specificity. In Chapter 2, using a gain-of-function assay, I examined the relationships between S2-SLF1 (S2-allelic product of Type-1 SLF) and four S-RNases. The results suggest that S2-SLF1 interacts with S7- and S13-RNases, and the previously identified S1- and S3-RNases, but not with S5- or S11-RNase. An artificial microRNA expressed by the S2-SLF1 promoter, but not by the vegetative cell specific promoter, Late Anther Tomato 52 (LAT52), suppressed expression of S2-SLF1 in S2 pollen, suggesting that SLF1 is specific to the generative cell. The S2 pollen with S2-SLF1 suppressed was compatible with S3-, S5-, S7-, S11-, and S13-carrying pistils, confirming that other SLF proteins are responsible for detoxifying S5- and S11-RNases, and suggesting that S2-SLF1 is not the only SLF in S2 pollen that interacts with S3-, S7-, and S13-RNases.  Petunia may have evolved at least two types of SLF proteins to detoxify any non-self S-RNase to minimize the deleterious effects of mutation in any SLF. \n\nAn SLF is predicted to be the F-box protein component of an SCF complex (composed of Cullin1, Skp1, RBX1 and an F-box protein), which mediates ubiquitination of protein substrates for degradation by the 26S proteasome. However, the precise nature of the complex is unknown. In Chapter 3, I used pollen extracts of a transgenic plant expressing S2-SLF1:GFP for co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by mass spectrometry (MS). I identified PiCUL1-P (a pollen-specific Cullin1), PiSSK1 (a pollen-specific Skp1-like protein) and PiRBX1 (an RBX1). Thus, all components but RBX1 of the SLF-containing complex may have evolved specific isoforms in SI. \n\nAccording to the collaborative non-self recognition model, SLFs collectively mediate ubiquitination and degradation of non-self S-RNases. In Chapter 4, I describe a surprising finding that SLF1 of P. inflata itself was subject to degradation via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway (UPP), and identified an 18-amino-acid (18-aa) sequence in the C-terminal domain of S2-SLF1 (SLF1 of S2-haplotype) that contains a degradation motif. Four of the 18 amino acids are conserved among all 17 SLF proteins of S2-haplotype and S3-haplotype involved in pollen specificity, suggesting that the stability of all SLF proteins is likely subject to similar regulation. Deleting the 18-aa sequence from S2-SLF1 stabilized the protein but abolished its function in SI, suggesting that regulation of the stability of SLF proteins is an integral part of their function in SI. I used S2-SLF1:GFP as the bait to perform Co-IP followed by MS, and identified PiDCN1 (defective in cullin neddylation 1) and PiUBC12 (NEDD8-conjugating enzyme) that may be involved in neddylation of PiCUL1-P to activate SCFSLF complexes; and identified PiCAND1 (cullin-associated NEDD8-dissociated protein 1), UPL1-like protein (a mono-subunit E3 ligase containing a HECT domain) and an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, that may mediate dissociation of SLF proteins from their SCFSLF complexes and degradation.\n\nIn Chapter 5, I describe an ongoing project to validate the role of PiDCN1 and PiUBC12 in neddylation of PiCUL1-P, and the function of PiCAND1 in dissociation of SLF proteins from their SCFSLF complexes, based on the results obtained from Chapter 4. I also discuss some of the experiments I carried out to further pinpoint the degradation motif of S2-SLF1 in yeast. \n\nFinally, in Chapter 6, I summarize all the major findings of my dissertation research, and describe how these findings have advanced our understanding and laid a foundation for future studies of S-RNase-based SI.

Mechanistic studies\nhave revealed that similar to certain natural cell surface receptors, the synthetic receptors internalize cargo molecules through a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. However, the lack of an efficient method for the synthesis of 3\u00e2-\ncholesterylamine has limited the development of this technology. Additionally, trapping of molecules delivered by synthetic receptors in confined intracellular compartments, endosomes, restricts potential applications of this delivery system. To address these issues, we developed novel and practical methodologies for the large-scale preparation of 3\u00e2-cholesterylamine and related building blocks; we also designed and synthesized novel 3\u00e2-cholesterylamine-capped PC4 lytic peptides, which enable 3\u00e2-cholesterylamine-conjugated cargo bearing a disulfide linkage to selectively escape from early/recycling endosomes of living mammalian cells.

This work uses horizontal injection wells to generate higher injectivity values. The concept of CO2 injection pattern is introduced to take full advantage of the formation capacity. Accordingly, the injection performance of different injection pattern types is studied. A commercial simulator is employed as core numerical simulation tool.  In order to reduce the uncertainties from the various reservoir properties, the analysis is achieved via implementation of the Monte Carlo simulation protocol. The model does multiple simulation runs and expresses the output parameters within p90 and p50 ranges. In order to avoid the time-consuming high-fidelity simulation runs, artificial neural network based model is employed in generating the data for the Monte Carlo analysis. This work develops expert network systems and applies the developed network to determine the optimal design of injection pattern. The expert systems are also applied to basin scale field case studies. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8471], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Qian ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Carbon geological sequestration", "deep saline formation", "horizontal injector", "Monte Carlo Simulation", "ANN"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "OLIGOPEPTIDE DERIVATIZED [Ru(bpy)3]2+ COMPLEXES AS SCAFFOLDS FOR ARTIFICIAL PHOTOSYNTHETIC PROCESSES", "id": "27386", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11899", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The design of supramolecular systems with controlled arrangement of chromophores, electron/energy donors and acceptors remains a challenge in artificial photosynthesis. Biological systems have been known to accomplish the intricacy presented simply by self-assembly. With this inspiration, biomimetic structures that utilize self-assembly to tether donors and acceptors together have been developed and studied. Using oligopeptides as the donor-acceptor bridging linkers and metal-ligand interactions as the only driving force for self-assembly, a variety of compounds with unique photophysical properties could be synthesized. Study of these compounds would provide useful information to fine tune the structures to create long-lived charge separated state and promote efficient solar energy conversion. This thesis describes the synthesis, characterization and application of a series of oligopeptide derivatized [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes for artificial photosynthesis. Factors affecting photophysical properties are investigated and the first example of using this motif to photocatalyze chemical reactions is thoroughly studied. \nA series of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ compounds linked to 1-3 Pd2+ by oligoaminoethylglycine(aeg) were synthesized for use in photocatalytically dimerizing \u03b1-methylstyrene . This is the first example using the aeg chain between a photosensitizer and a reaction center. The products had faster reaction rates and better selectivity than conjugated linkers described in the literature. Catalytic efficiency when linking [Ru(bpy)3]2+ with 1, 2 and 3 Pd2+ centers was also compared and it was found the complex with three Pd centers had the lowest catalytic activity because of lower chemistry stability. The excited state quenching mechanism is likely to be an electron transfer process based on solvent study, variable temperature study and control experiments using added sacrificial electron donor.\nA series of [Ru(bpy)32+] hairpin structures were designed to study impact of side chain change of different oligopeptide linkers (e.g. aminoethyglycine (gly), aminoethyvaline (val), aminoethyleucine (leu) and aminoethyphenylalanine (phe) ) on the emission photodynamics of [Ru(bpy)3]2+-[M(bpy)2]2+ complexes (M = Cu, Pd or Zn). For the Ru-Cu and Ru-Pd complexes, the non-radiative decay rate decreases and the energy barrier for non-radiative decay process increases as the steric bulk of the side chain increases. However, no trend was observed for the Ru-Zn complexes. Solvent study showed all the Ru-Cu and Ru-Pd complexes have a negative trend of non-radiative decay rates vs. Pekar factor but no trend was observed for the Ru-Zn complexes, which indicates Ru-Cu and Ru-Pd have an electron transfer non-radiative decay mechanism and is different from the mechanism of Ru-Zn. The impact of side chain change on the non-radiative decay of Ru-Cu and Ru-Pd is probably due to bulky side chains restrict the necessary geometry change that accompanies the electron transfer.\nTo expand our study to hexacoordinate metal ions, we have developed a series of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes with three pendant bpy ligands that can directly coordinate to a hexacoordinate metal ion such as Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+ or Mn2+ to form [Ru(bpy)3]2+-[M(bpy)3]2+. Spectrophotometric emission and absorption titrations confirmed a 1:1 metal binding stoichiometry and this was further supported by mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The formation of [Ru(bpy)3]2+-[M(bpy)3]2+ also caused quenching of the excited state emission of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ by ~ 50% - 90%. Energy transfer mechanism is speculated to be the plausible explanation for this nonradiative quenching because of high energy barrier for electron transfer and spectrum overlap.\nFinally, synthetic attempts towards multi-metallic, multi-functional mixed ligand complexes for redox cascade is described in the last chapter. Ru hairpin structures with 8-hydroxyquinoline as the pendant ligands were synthesized. Binding Cu2+ quenched the emission intensity of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ by electron transfer. Binding Zn2+ formed a two-chromophore complex, and the quenching mechanism is still under investigation. Structures that could potentially be used for redox cascade have been designed and synthesized. Experiments using Ru-Co complexes to split water were proposed. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11352], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Sha ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Beth Williams", "Tom Mallouk", "Benjamin James Lear", "John H Golbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Beth Williams, Dissertation Advisor", "Tom Mallouk, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["[Ru(bpy)3]2+", "Artificial Photosynthesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "MASS SPECTRAL STUDIES OF BIOMOLECULES USING CLUSTER BEAMS AND LASERS\n", "id": "6212", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6026", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is a very important technique for surface analysis. However, the low secondary ion yields often limit the success of SIMS. In this thesis, two methods are adopted to enhance the secondary ion signal intensities: ionizing the sputtered neutral species with laser beams (referred to as \u201claser postionization\u201d) or using a newly acquired buckminsterfullerene (C60) source for sputtering. \n\nNanosecond laser postionization has proven to be very successful for analyzing inorganic species; however, it often causes too much fragmentation of organic molecules. Here, we investigate the use of femtosecond laser pulses for ionizing secondary neutral species. A variety of biomolecules, including Val-Val, Leu-Trp and Histamine are studied. We find that the signal intensities can be increased 10 - 40 fold by ionizing the neutral species with respect to the secondary ions. However, a significant degree of fragmentation still occurs, especially for ion beam-desorbed molecules. To gain insight into the fragmentation mechanism, the laser intensity dependence of the signal acquired for both gas phase and ion beam-desorbed histamine is studied. The results show that the photon orders of gas phase histamine molecules are higher than those of ion beam-desorbed histamine molecules. This dependence indicates that the ion beam-desorbed species must have a relatively high internal energy which can in part be utilized for ionization. It is believed that this extra energy causes the excessive fragmentation observed in ion beam-desorbed as opposed to gas phase species. \n\nLaser postionization imaging is also attempted for both inorganic and organic species. It is demonstrated that the laser postionization image can retain the spatial resolution achievable in secondary ion mass spectrometry, while enhancing the signal intensities by at least a factor of 10. The high signal intensity is crucial for imaging experiments where spatial resolution is often limited by the amount of signal available. Femtomole sensitivity can be easily achieved by the laser postionization technique. The 1 kHz repetition rate also shortens the time needed for data acquisition with respect to the 10 Hz for ns lasers. \n\nAlthough it is well-known that C60+ sputtering improves the SIMS signal, the mechanism is often unclear. More specifically, it is not clear whether the cluster bombardment produces higher sputtering yields or leads to a more efficient ionization of the sputtered species. In order to elucidate this question, the yields of neutral particles and secondary ions sputtered from a silver surface are investigated experimentally by comparing postionized neutral and secondary ion yields and the results are compared with those from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the experiments, a polycrystalline Ag sample is analyzed by a ToF-SIMS spectrometer equipped with both a Ga+ and C60+ ion source and coupled with a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser system for postionization of neutral species.  The results show that the neutral Ag yield produced by 15-keV C60+ bombardment is 5.6-fold higher than that found for 15-keV Ga+ bombardment, a finding which is in qualitative agreement with corresponding MD simulations.  The enhancement effect is observed to be about the same for both the neutral species and their corresponding secondary ions, thus indicating that in this case, the enhancement is caused by an increase of the respective partial sputtering yields, while the ionization probability remains largely unchanged. Experimental results also indicate that the neutral Ag species produced by C60+ bombardment have emission velocity distributions that maximize at much lower values than those observed by Ga+ bombardment, suggesting the presence of non-linear collision cascades.\nSputter depth profiling is a well-established method for determining the chemical composition of a solid as a function of depth beneath the surface. It is well known that the depth resolution obtained with this method critically depends on the kinetic impact energy of the ions used to erode the surface, and is generally found to be better for lower impact energy. If cluster beams are used to erode the sample, one might therefore expect an improved depth resolution due the fact that each constituent atom carries only a fraction of the total impact energy. In order to test that concept with C60+ projectile, a Ni:Cr multilayer sample consisting of nine alternating layers of Cr and Ni deposited onto a  Si (100) substrate with nominal layer thicknesses of 53 and 66 nm respectively, is analyzed using either Ga+ or C60+ projectiles for sputter erosion. This particular sample is selected because of the polycrystalline nature of the metal films, depth resolution of a few nanometers can only be achieved and maintained throughout the removal of the complete layer stack if low energy primary ions are employed in connection with oblique ion incidence, sample rotation and, in some cases, oxygen flooding during the erosion. The depth resolution obtained is 8.7 nm for C60+ with 20 keV bombardment and improves to 5.1 nm when the kinetic energy is decreased to 15 keV. Very much in contrast, a very poor depth resolution is observed with 15 keV Ga+ projectiles. The large improvement caused by C60+ is believed to be due to the unique ability of the cluster ions to remove material without regard to crystallographic orientation, thereby reducing the buildup of surface topography caused by erosion rate variations between differently oriented grains. In addition, it is believed that the low impact energy per constituent atom of the impinging clusters appears to be similar to the use of ultra-low energy atomic primary ion sources. \n\nIn addition to the inorganic samples, it is investigated how far a cluster beam might be useable to determine the depth dependence of molecular species. For atomic projectiles, the molecular depth profiling has always been compromised by the accumulation of ion bombardment induced damage which leads to a rapid decay of the molecular signal with increasing ion fluence. To test the potential of cluster beams with respect to molecular depth profiling, a 26 nm poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film and a thick sample of histamine dissolved in water ice are analyzed as model systems for molecular depth profiling. Experiments were conducted with both the C60+ source and the Ga+ ion source. Results show that the target analyte signals retained their integrity even under prolonged C60+ bombardment, while the molecular information quickly disappears under the atomic projectile bombardment. These results demonstrate that great potential of the buckminsterfullerene (C60) cluster beams for molecular depth profiling applications.\n\nIn collaboration with Dr. Jamal I. Berry, femtosecond laser desorption of biomolecules using ice as a matrix was also performed. The results show that biomolecules can be reproducibly detected from water ice using laser desorption ionization. The signals can be detected from a variety of substrates, including Au, Cu, Al, In, and even from Si. The only requirement that needs to be fulfilled is that the laser fluence needs to be higher than a certain threshold, which is dependant on the system under investigation and has a value of about 4 J/cm2 for bradykinin on Au. The threshold will be slightly different depending on the thickness of the sample and the type of sample substrate. The theory is that the laser energy needs to be pumped into the system in a very short period of time. The substrate is the chromophore and will therefore absorb the energy to cause explosive boiling at the substrate-analyte interface, lifting the target molecules off the surface. \n\nOverall, we demonstrate that both postionization of the neutral species using femtosecond laser pulses and the use of C60+ projectiles can successfully be applied to enhance the signal intensities. In addition, the C60+ source can be used for sputter erosion in molecular depth profiling. Femtosecond laser pulses can also be used to desorb a variety of biomolecules off the surface using ice as a matrix.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6018], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Shixin ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shixin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A Daniel Jones", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Nicholas Winograd", "Peter C Eklund"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["A Daniel Jones, Committee Member", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Member", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Chair", "Peter C Eklund, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Laser pastionization", "C60", "Cluster beams", "Femtosecond laser", "Depth profile", "Histamine", "Ni Cr", "LDI", "Laser desorption ionization", "PMMA", "Ag"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "USING COGNITIVELY INSPIRED AGENTS AND INFORMATION SUPPLY CHAINS TO ANTICIPATE AND SHARE INFORMATION FOR DECISION-MAKING TEAMS\n", "id": "7064", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5872", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "September 11 and hurricane Katrina have shown that timely information is important not only for disaster prevention but especially valuable in effective disaster response.  From the point of view of information and communication technologies, the challenge is how to coordinate information sharing effectively among members of a complex decision-making team (e.g. the first responders for a disaster).  A common difficulty is to provide useful and time-sensitive information to team members quickly but at the same time not overwhelm them with irrelevant information. This problem has also been encountered in other application domains that require effective communication in a team environment: examples include military command and control, heath care, and global enterprise.\nResearch in the area of team cognition suggests that anticipating information needs of other teammates is a key behavior for achieving highly efficient and effective teamwork. Guided by this finding, a framework of Information Supply Chain (ISC) is proposed and implemented in this thesis research.  ISC contains three novel features. First, it anticipates information requirements using a cognitively inspired decision model. Second, it consolidates and prioritizes the information requirements using a novel planning algorithm. Third, it integrates inference, information seeking, and auction for satisfying the information requirements. The ISC framework is formalized using existing agent theories as well as implemented in an agent architecture called R-CAST. The efficiency and the formation of ISC are evaluated using an experiment in a simulated \u201cinformation market\u201d.\nThis research has made two major contributions in addressing the challenges of information sharing among decision-making teams. First, more accurate information needs can be anticipated using a high-level cognitive model of decision-makers.  This avoids \u201cpushing\u201d irrelevant information to a decision-maker, which often leads to information overload. Second, the cost associated with information seeking and distributing activities can be greatly reduced because these activities can now be well-coordinated within the ISC framework.  In summary, the work presented in this thesis can help a human team to make better decisions under time pressure, especially in a distributed environment where an immense amount of information and knowledge are scattered among members of the team. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5869], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Shuang ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shuang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Akhil Kumar", "Michael Mc Neese", "John Yen", "Tracy Mullen", "Madhu Reddy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Akhil Kumar, Committee Member", "Michael Mc Neese, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Chair", "Tracy Mullen, Committee Member", "Madhu Reddy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Recognition Primed Decision", "Team Decision Making", "Cognitive Model", "Information Sharing", "Multi-agent System", "Context-driven Personalization"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Length of Stay and Readmissions in Mastectomy Patients", "id": "25027", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11147", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Background: Interest is growing in preventing readmissions as payers start to link reimbursement to readmission rates.

The outcomes measured were length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission. Univariate comparisons between characteristics of readmitted (n=172) and non-readmitted patients were performed using t tests and chi-square tests. Readmission was modeled using logistic regression; LOS was modeled using linear regression and controlled for potential confounders.  \n\nResults: In multivariate analyses, patients with peripheral vascular disease were more likely to be readmitted (OR 4.36, p=0.002). Increased LOS was also associated with increased odds of readmission (OR 1.26, p=<0.0001).  Since LOS was an important predictor of readmission we also estimated determinants of LOS using linear regression. The occurrence of reconstructive surgery (p=<0.0001) and renal disease (p<0.0001) were highly predictive of longer LOS. \n\nConclusions: This study showed peripheral vascular disease and longer lengths of stay were associated with higher odds of readmission in women undergoing mastectomy. Clinicians should be cognizant that optimizing a patient\u2019s vascular status before mastectomy may lead to lower rates of readmission. Additional research is needed to determine whether the relationship between readmissions and length of hospital stay is a causative versus associative phenomenon since length of stay is a modifiable factor that may lead to lower readmissions.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10710], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Susie Xinying", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "Xinying", "first_name_ssi": "Susie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Hollenbeak", "Anna Leung"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Hollenbeak, Thesis Advisor", "Anna Leung, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["mastectomy", "readmissions", "length of stay", "breast cancer", "breast surgery"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Roles of Hippo Signaling Pathway in Mouse Ovarian Function", "id": "28915", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12230", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mammalian follicular development is regulated by various secreted and gap-junction-mediated intercellular communication signals. This complicated network of regulatory and metabolic mechanisms is not completely known. The Hippo signaling pathway has been recognized as a highly conserved pathway among species that controls the organ size, stem cell functions and is also profoundly implicated in numerous human cancers and other diseases. Lats1 mutant mice exhibit follicle depletion and develop ovarian stromal tumors, while its effector YAP1 is not only recognized as an ovarian oncoprotein, but also found to promote follicular growth when actin polymerization is initiated by ovarian physical disruption. These studies demonstrated the potential importance of Hippo signaling in ovarian function, but little is known about what roles this pathway plays during early follicular development and ovulation. Our study first utilized Lats1 mutant mice and the YAP1 inhibitor verteporfin to study the roles of Hippo pathway in early follicular development and found that LATS1 is required for maintaining the primordial germ cell pool and both LATS1 and YAP1 are essential for follicle activation. Then we established a new mechanistic model for the regulation of ovulation, by demonstrating that oocytes induce granulosa cell proliferation by inhibiting the expression of Hippo components before ovulation, while ovulatory signals promote granulosa cell differentiation by activating the Hippo signaling activity in a timely manner during ovulation. Lastly, we accentuated the importance of Hippo pathway during ovulation by showing that blocking YAP1 leads to spindle deformation during oocyte maturation. More importantly, pYAP1 at T119 site is induced through meiotic progression and was shown to be a target of PP2A phosphatase. However, it\u2019s unclear if this regulation of pYAP1 plays important roles in actin cytoskeleton-mediated spindle assembly and migration during oocyte meiosis.

Adopting continuous penalties such as the LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996) and the SCAD (Fan and Li, 2001) made it possible to cope with the high dimensionality. Independence screening is very useful tool to identify all the important covariates at less computational cost than the traditional methods when the number of covariates grows at non-polynomial rate of the sample size. When the response is survival time, feature screening is more challenging because the responses are subject to censoring. In this thesis we propose a model-free  independence feature screening procedure for ultra-high dimensional survival data. This new procedure can be directly applied for most commonly-used models such as Cox\u2019s model, Cox\u2019s frailty model, additive Cox\u2019s model, parametric, nonparametric and semiparametric proportional odds models and accelerated failure time models, in survival data analysis. Thus, the virtue of the new procedure is desirable since it is usual that little prior information is known for the actual true model for ultra-high dimensional data. The newly proposed procedure is easy to implement and computationally efficient. We systematically studied the theoretical properties of the proposed procedures, and established the sure screening property and consistency in ranking\nproperty for the proposed procedure. Its performance is evaluated and compared with the existing procedure proposed based on Cox\u2019s model (Fan, Feng, & Wu, 2010) by extensive simulation studies and the real data analysis. Since our proposed procedure uses marginal correlation utility measure, an inherent issue is that it cannot identify those important features that are marginally independent with\nresponse. To resolve this issue, we propose an iterative procedure in spirit similar to iterative sure independent screening procedure proposed by Fan and Lv (2008). The major challenge in the development of the iterative procedure is the lack of definition of residuals under the model-free framework for survival data analysis. The commonly used residuals, such as martingale residual, Schoenfeld residual and deviance residual, are all defined with respect to certain semiparametric models. Therefore those residuals are not applicable in our model-free framework. We instead use the residuals from regressing the entire features space on the previously selected active features. We also carefully studied the performance of the proposed iterative procedures. Our Monte Carlo simulation studies show that the proposed\niterative procedures performs quite well with moderate sample sizes.

Current studies have sought out to investigate the host factors that are involved in virus assembly and budding by interacting with M protein to facilitate M functions.\nIn an effort to identify host factors that are important for henipavirus assembly and budding, proteomics-based approach was performed to identify host proteins that interact with viral M protein. Here, we affinity purified viral M proteins by FPLC and identified co-purifying host proteins by mass spectrometry. Co-immunoprecipitation was used as a secondary screening of protein candidates identified from mass spec results. One of the host proteins candidates, AP3B1, the beta subunit of AP-3 complex, was selected for further investigations. Importantly, a 29 amino acids polypeptide derived from AP3B1 hinge domain was identified as the minimal fragment to bind M protein as well as effectively inhibit henipavirus-like particles (VLPs) production. This inhibitory effect is due to disruption of M protein association with membrane. Additionally, in AP3B1 depleted cells by siRNA knockdown, Nipah VLP production is significantly reduced. By immunofluorescence\niv\nmicroscopy, M protein colocalization with endogenous AP3B1 was also observed in mammalian cells. Our results suggested that AP-3 might play an important role in M protein functions.\nHenipaviruses have two types of surface glycoproteins, the attachment protein (G) and fusion protein (F). They were responsible for virus entry by mediating virus attachment to cell receptors and fusion with cell membrane. Numerous studies have illustrated how the virus entry occurs under the coordination of G and F proteins. However, little is known about how glycoproteins assemble into virions or VLPs. We know that M protein is the main driving force of particles formation, so we wondered how M protein coordinates with G protein and F protein to facilitate their trafficking and assembly into virions or VLPs. Here, under the unique pathway of HeV F protein identified by our collaborator Dr. Rebecca Dutch at University of Kentucky, we have found that HeV M protein, F protein and G protein all partially colocalized with Rab11a-REs, and overexpression of a DN Rab11a could significantly inhibit Hendra M-VLPs as well as F-VLPs formation in the cells. Interestingly, in cells that express inhibitory AP3B1 Hinge domain, M colocalization with Rab11-REs was disrupted. Unlike M protein or F protein, G proteins releases poorly into particles when expressed alone in cells. We observed that G incorporation into VLPs could be facilitated by co-expression of M protein but not F protein, likely through G-M interaction at the plasma membrane. Moreover, we have found that F protein incorporation into VLPs depended on its endocytic trafficking event regardless its cleavage status, as an endocytosis defective mutant F S490A that was retained on\nv\nthe cell surface was shown to be significantly defective on particles assembly. On the other hand, HeV F protein still well incorporated into VLPs when its cleavage was prevented by a cathepsin L inhibitor, E-64d. Therefore, we hypothesized that henipavirus M and F proteins have separate mechanisms for trafficking to Rab11-REs, with the M protein trafficking facilitated by its interaction with AP3B1. M and cathepsin-cleaved F proteins must then assemble together within these compartments prior to their delivery to the cell surface for particle budding and assemble with G protein through G-M interaction at the plasma membrane.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10659], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Weina ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Weina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Robert Paulson", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Craig Eugene Cameron"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Paul Schmitt, Dissertation Advisor", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Chair", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Henipavirus", "Hendra virus", "Nipah virus", "assembly and budding", "paramyxovirus", "AP-3 complex", "Hendra virus fusion protein", "Rab11a"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Achieving Smart Health with Mobile Devices", "id": "13361xxs118", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13361", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Existing healthcare systems are cost-prohibitive and inefficient, and thus there is an urgent need for the transformation of healthcare from expensive, reactive and hospital-centered to low-cost, proactive and person-centered. The rapid development of mobile devices over the past few years has opened up opportunities for smart health, bringing an inexpensive, convenient and efficient way for medical data collection and health monitoring. With various built-in sensors, advanced processors and wireless communication capabilities, mobile devices can be exploited to develop a broad range of healthcare applications.\n    The specific goal of this dissertation is to design systems for achieving smart health with various mobile devices (e.g., smartwatch, smartphone and wireless mote). First, we design a smartwatch based system which leverages the built-in accelerometer to monitor the respiratory rate and body position during sleep. To calculate respiratory rate, we design a filter to extract the weak respiratory signal from the noisy accelerometer data collected on the wrist, and use frequency analysis to estimate respiratory rate from the data along each axis. Further, we design a multi-axis fusion approach which can adaptively adjust the estimates from the three axes and then significantly improve the estimation accuracy. To detect the body position, we apply machine learning techniques based on the features extracted from the accelerometer data. Second, we present another smartwatch based system which detects 8 common daily activities, including sitting, walking, running, going upstairs, going downstairs, eating, driving and sitting in a vehicle. By leveraging the built-in motion sensors on the smartwatch (i.e., accelerometer and gyroscope), a multi-level classification system is proposed which considers both detection accuracy and energy efficiency. Several practical issues are considered in developing the system to meet the specific requirements of the smartwatch, such as sensing capabilities and resource constraints of the smartwatch, and different wearing habits of smartwatch users. Third, we propose a smartphone based system to unobtrusively detect the sound-related respiratory symptoms occurred in a user's daily life, including sneeze, cough, sniffle and throat clearing. The built-in microphone on the smartphone is used to continuously monitor a user's acoustic data and uses multi-level processes to detect and classify the respiratory symptoms. Several practical issues are considered in developing the system, such as users' privacy concerns about their acoustic data, resource constraints of the smartphone and different contexts of the smartphone. Finally, we design targeted vaccination for infectious disease containment. To understand the disease propagation better, we collect student contact traces in a high school based on wireless motes carried by students. With our wireless system, we can record student contacts within the disease propagation distance, and then construct a disease propagation graph to model the infectious disease propagation. Based on this graph, we propose a metric called connectivity centrality to measure a node's importance during disease propagation and design centrality based algorithms for targeted vaccination. Further, we enhance our solution by exploiting the knowledge of the infected nodes which have been detected during vaccination.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13101], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Xiao ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Guohong Cao", "George Kesidis", "Sencun Zhu", "Siyang Zheng"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Dissertation Advisor", "Guohong Cao, Committee Chair", "George Kesidis, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Siyang Zheng, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Smart health", "Mobile sensing", "Mobile computing", "Machine learning", "Disease containment"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "MATERNAL AND PATERNAL RESOURCES ACROSS CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE AS PREDICTORS OF YOUNG ADULT ACHIEVEMENT", "id": "13460xbs5014", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13460", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Family experiences have been linked to youth\u2019s achievements in childhood and adolescence, but we know less about their long term implications for educational and occupational achievements in young adulthood. Grounded in social capital theory and ecological frameworks, this study tested whether mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 education and occupation attainments, as well as the mean level and cross-time consistency of parental warmth during childhood and adolescence, predicted educational and occupational achievements in young adulthood. We also tested interactions between parental achievement and warmth in predicting these young adult outcomes. Data were collected from mothers, fathers, and two siblings in 164 families at up to 11 time points. Predictors came from the first nine annual points (youth age M = 10.52 at Time 1) and outcomes from when young adults averaged 26 years old (firstborns at Time 10, secondborns at Time 11). Results from multilevel models revealed that both mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 educational attainment and warmth consistency from childhood through adolescence predicted young adults\u2019 educational attainment. Fathers\u2019 occupational prestige predicted sons\u2019, but not daughters\u2019, prestige. An interaction between mothers\u2019 warmth consistency, occupational prestige, and youth gender revealed that, for sons whose mothers\u2019 prestige was low, warmth consistency positively predicted their prestige, but this association was nonsignificant when mothers\u2019 prestige was high. Conversely, for daughters with mothers high in prestige, warmth consistency was a trend level, positive predictor of daughters\u2019 prestige, but was nonsignificant when mothers\u2019 prestige was low. Thus, maternal resources appeared to have a cumulative impact on daughters, but the process for sons was compensatory. Discussion focuses on the role of family resources in the gender gap in young adult achievement.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13355], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Xiaoran ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaoran", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan M.
