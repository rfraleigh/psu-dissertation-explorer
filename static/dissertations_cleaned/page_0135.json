This shear stress has been difficult to measure directly and has, in the past, been inferred from particle removal rates. Here we make a fundamental measurement of the mean shear stress imposed upon a planar wall by a normally-impinging turbulent air jet using the technique of oil-film interferometry. The resulting shear-stress distribution is then compared with measured removal rates of latex microspheres from a planar glass surface as a function of the radial distance from jet impingement normalized by the height of the nozzle exit above the surface. The particle removal experiments are carried out in quasi-steady flow with sparse (few collisions) particle distributions. These experiments show that the efficiency of particle removal is directly but not linearly related to the imposed shear stress.

Moreover, it seeks a better understanding of the ways Natives are denied political agency through public discourses that attempt to represent indians in romanticized, overtly cultural, and ultimately apolitical terms.

However, in the early 1830s, while the ACS was in tremendous turmoil struggling to maintain its centrality in the nation\u2019s political imagination, the movement recast itself as a benevolent organization and privileged volunteerism over politics.  Leaders continued to recognize the importance of political activities but they also encouraged female participation even as they promoted the centrality of female values in the movement.  For a brief but intense period in the 1830s and 1840s, the ACS came to rely on all types of female support.  Women who joined colonization societies perceived their efforts to be part of the triumph of American, white evangelical Protestantism in the world and viewed colonization as an ideological middle ground between immediate abolition of slavery and perpetual bondage.  These women were committed to ridding the United States of both slavery and African Americans. Female colonizationists believed that the United States was a specially blessed place and saw their own sex as exceptionally privileged.  This status encouraged their willingness to act as the conscience of the nation in all places judged morally inferior. Just as benevolent women might extend their concern to the poor, the widow, and the orphan in America, so too, might women legitimately engage in moral and religious reform in locations outside America.  On the one hand, female support for colonization reflected an extension of woman\u2019s natural role as moral guide and guardian.

This field encompasses the microscopic world of quantum mechanics to the macroscopic behavior observed when exploring the behavior of large ensembles of interacting molecules.  The complexity of these problems requires, in most instances, the use of computers to simulate the physics of the phenomenon and model the dynamic behavior.  For example, in quantum mechanics the only systems which can be solved exactly are those composed of only one or two particles.  Nevertheless, high-level numerical approximations to the many-bodied problem can be achieved employing numerical methods.  Other numerical methods enable researchers to understand large amounts of data, which modern-day instruments record, via decomposition and simulation. Each chapter of the thesis addresses an independent topic in computational chemistry.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Chapter 1</h3>\n\n<p>Deoxyribonucleotides are the building blocks of DNA.  One of the last steps in their <I>de novo</I> synthesis is carried out by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR).  RNR is ubiquitous in all living organisms and catalyzes the reduction of di- or triphosphate ribonucleoside to the respective deoxyribonucleoside.  Recently a new subclass of RNR has been discovered.  The class Ic RNR from the obligate parasite <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I> (<I>Ct</I>) uses a stable Mn(IV)/Fe(III) cofactor to initiate nucleotide reduction by a free-radical mechanism. This novel cofactor may be a promising drug target.  The generation of the Mn(IV)/Fe(III) active state begins with either a Mn(II)/Fe(II) or a Mn(III)/Fe(III) cofactor, which is oxidized via molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide to yield a Mn(IV)/Fe(IV) state.  This latter state is quickly reduced by one electron.  <I>Ct</I> RNR holds promise for new insights into the structures of high-valent dinuclear metal clusters.  Unlike their analogues from <I>E. coli</I> RNR and methane monooxygenase (MMO), both complexes can be obtained in high yields.  The presence of the two different metals in the cofactor could further our understanding of dinuclear metal clusters. Their presence allows researchers to study EPR-active oxidation states, that in the diiron <I>E. coli</I> RNR and MMO cofactors are EPR-inactive.  In this chapter, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are coupled with previous EPR and <SUP>57</SUP>Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy to postulate structures for the two cofactors. Fe and Mn <I>K</I>-edge EXAFS data yield intermetallic distances for the Mn(IV)/Fe(III) and Mn(IV)/Fe(IV) cofactors of ~2.9 and ~2.8 Angstrom, respectively. The Mn data also suggest the presence of a short 1.74 Angstrom Mn-O bond for the Mn(IV)/Fe(III) cofactor. These metrics are compared to the results of DFT calculations on 16 cofactor models derived from the crystal structure of the inactive Fe<SUB>2</SUB>(III/III) form of the protein. Models are differentiated by the protonation states of their bridging and terminal OH<SUB>X</SUB> (if present) ligands, as well as the location of the Mn(IV) ion (site 1 or 2). The models that agree best with experimental observations for the Mn(IV)/Fe(III) cofactor feature a mu-1,3-carboxylate bridge (E120), terminal solvent (H<SUB>2</SUB>O/OH) to site 1, one mu-O bridge, and one mu-OH bridge.  The models that agree best with the experimental observations for the Mn(IV)/Fe(IV) cofactor feature an identical core structure to that of Mn(IV)/Fe(III), but with the terminal solvent to site 1 displaced by the second carboxylate oxygen of E89.  If correct, reduction of the Mn(IV)/Fe(IV) cofactor by one electron is accompanied by significant core rearrangement and association of water to site 1.  The site-placement of the metal ions cannot be discerned from the available data.  Hyperfine couplings and <SUP>57</SUP>Fe Mossbauer parameters are also predicted.</p>\n\n<h3>Chapter 2</h3>\n\n<p>Hydroxylation of hydrocarbons is of great interest both industrially and biologically.  The C-H bond in alkanes is relatively inert, such that harsh reaction conditions are required to activate it industrially.  Conversely, Nature is able to activate C-H bonds at ambient temperature and pressure.  The P450 family of enzymes is largely responsible for hydroxylating exogenous alkanes <I>in vivo</I>.  In P450s, hydroxylation occurs at an Fe(IV)=O porphyrin radical cation cofactor.  It is hypothesized that the ability of metal-O(H) complexes to abstract hydrogen is directly related to the strength of the O-H bond formed in the resulting metal complex.  For P450s, this Fe(IV)-OH species is called compound-II (P450-II).  It is also hypothesized that P450s utilize an axial sulfur in order to increase the driving force to oxidize hydrocarbons.  The sulfur increases the basicity of the Fe(IV)-O cofactor, making it basic under biological conditions.  Thermodynamically, the metal O-H strength is directly dependent on the pK<SUB>a</SUB> of P450-II.  Peroxidases, which usually possess an axial nitrogen, are incapable of performing alkane hydroxylations and are deprotonated at neutral pH.  DFT calculated O-H bond strengths in P450 and peroxidase models are nearly identical, which is contrary to the aforementioned hypotheses.  However, calculations on twenty iron and manganese complexes with experimentally known O-H bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) are found to be inaccurate at the B3LYP/6-311G and B3LYP/6-311+G(1D,1P)//6-311G levels of theory.  The calculated O-H bond energies are analyzed to understand the discrepancy with experiment.  The contribution to the dissociation enthalpies from the sum of the zero-point, rotational, translational, and vibrational energies are shown to be similar for all complexes (-5.4 +/- 0.6 kcal/mol).  Finally, a Becke-inspired three-parameter hybrid functional is proposed to accurately predict metal O-H BDEs.</p>\n\n<h3>Chapter 3</h3>\n\n<p>This chapter documents the development of the author's optimization code and will be utilized throughout the rest of the dissertation (Chapters 4-5).  The motivation for development of the code stemmed from a desire to include chemically intuitive constraints in nonlinear regression problems.  Regression is frequently used to fit theoretical models to experimental data by minimizing the difference between the actual experimental results and the predictive model.  The fitting of rate constants to kinetic traces is a typical chemical example.  As will be seen in the subsequent chapters, constraints range from experimentally obtained molecular expectation values to the fact that absorption spectra cannot be negative.  The versatility of the method is seen in the wide range of problems it allows the researcher to address.  The code is classified as an interior-point method.  It is necessarily constraint oriented and aware of the geometry of the problem (convex vs. nonconvex).  The algorithm employs finite derivatives and can be used to find solutions to which there is no explicit formulation of the problem.  The novelty of the code is in the use of a class object which contains virtual merit and constraint functions which are easily tailored to any problem.  The class object also allows complex algorithms (even outside executables) to be passed to the optimization routine instead of the simple functions passed to available software.</p>\n\n<h3>Chapter 4</h3>\n\n<p>Chloroperoxidase (CPO) is frequently studied to understand the important alkane-hydroxylating enzyme P450 (see Chapter 2). One intermediate of interest is compound-II (CPO-II).  Compound-II is the Fe(IV)-OH species which immediately follows hydrogen atom transfer.  When CPO-II was first characterized with <SUP>57</SUP>Fe Mossbauer, two species with significantly different quadrupole splittings were found (Stone <I>et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc.,</I> <B>2006,</B> <I>128,</I> 6147-6153).  The major species' splitting was accurately predicted with DFT, but the identity of the minority species has remained enigmatic.  In order to find a model consistent with the minority species, a spectroscopically constrained geometry optimization is developed and employed.  A model which is consistent with the experimental Fe(IV)-OH quadrupole splitting of 1.59 mm/s, as well as the Fe-O Raman stretch at 565 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>, is found.  As a proof of concept, said quadrupole-constrained geometry optimization is shown to transition between different configurations of Fe(CO)<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>2-</SUP> and Fe(CO)<SUB>5</SUB>.  The constrained optimization approach developed here has potential to be used whenever a molecular expectation value is known experimentally which is not reproduced by the minimum energy model.</p>\n\n<h3>Chapter 5</h3>\n\n<p>Chemists are frequently interested in rate equations, which are first-order differential equations. Numerical integration of these equations allows the researcher to accurately predict the concentrations of chemical species at any time given the initial conditions.  Runge-Kutta (RK) integration is widely used for solving the rate equations.  In this chapter, Adomian decomposition methods (ADM) are used to obtain the solutions of chemical rate equations.  The Adomian method outlined here outperforms high-order RK routines in the arenas of accuracy and truncation error. Additionally, four modifications are introduced that place the Adomian integration on par with RK in terms of speed (a primary reason for which Adomian decomposition methods are currently underemployed). This increase in computational performance is highly significant to kinetic inversion and global analysis problems where rate constants are obtained via the fitting of experimental data and hundreds of numerical integrations are needed. The inclusion of up to the fifth term in the Adomian expansion gives a truncation error of order <I>O(h<SUP>10</SUP>)</I>. The method as presented yields solutions which are step-size independent in the non-stiff regime. The problem of rapid polynomial divergence is addressed through discretizing the time axis.</p> \n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2898], "author_name_tesi": "Younker, Jarod Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Younker", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Jarod", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green", "Michael Thomas Green", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Carsten Krebs", "Philip C.

Experiments within this research also investigate the flexibility and suitability of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) for other sediment transport applications.\n\nImproved scour prediction methods are developed by utilizing state-of-the-art experimental techniques.  Experiments are carried out over a range of particles sizes (0.200 - 0.750 mm) and Reynolds numbers (2,222 - 7,777).  Incremental scour data is collected by profile plotting and centerline scour measurements.  Measurements reveal a bedform that is nearly self-similar.  From the dimensionless self-similar scour profiles, rigid boundary sediment beds are constructed so that the flow along the scour profile could be analyzed.  Flow characteristics such as velocity fields and boundary layers along the scour profile are obtained with PIV.  Research indicates a strong correlation of the measured velocity fields with results from previous researchers.  From the PIV acquired data, the boundary shear stress is calculated using a quadratic friction law.  Predictions of scour profile equilibrium are performed by equating the jet induced boundary shear to the slope corrected critical shear.  A scour evolution model is developed based on established sediment transport formulae.  Scour prediction models are validated with data collect from laboratory experiments.  Results indicate that existing sediment transport equations over-predict scouring rates.\n\nIn addition to long term scouring, PIV technology is implemented to study the rapidly evolving early stages of scour.  PIV provides a non-intrusive, near-instantaneous technique for data collection.

However, most simulators are static in nature and only represent a single anatomical patient configuration. This is problematic because it limits a resident\u2019s opportunity to practice adapting their skills to challenging but common patient cases. Virtual Reality (VR) simulation may have an advantage over these static simulators because they can present variations in patient anatomies. However, few studies have explored the impact of VR simulators on Central Venous Catheterization (CVC) procedures. This is important because 39% of patients who receive CVC\u2019s experience adverse effects and these complications can be attributed to variations in patient anatomy. \nThe purpose of this thesis was to design and develop a user interface and personalized learning system for a Dynamic Haptic Robotic Trainer (DHRT) that can present variations in anatomy and provide consistent objective feedback on performance, validate the DHRT system as an effective method for training the surgical skills necessary to place an Internal Jugular (IJ) CVC, explore the relationship between, self-ratings of performance, and subjectively measured ratings of performance and objectively- measured ratings of performance, and explore the impacts of the Dynamic Haptic Robotic Training system on CVC self-efficacy and CVC procedural skills when compared to current manikin based simulators. This was accomplished through four empirical studies conducted with a total of 56 medical professionals including:  26 medical students, 26 first year surgical residents and 4 expert surgeons. Specifically, two studies were conducted as part of this thesis during the design and development of the system. Feedback provided to novices during surgical skills training sessions was analyzed and used for the development of a graphical user interface and learning feedback system for the DHRT system. These studies also empirically and methodically identified 4 objective metrics for evaluating surgical skill proficiency in placing an IJ CVC. Two empirical studies explored the effectiveness of the DHRT system and manikin trainer for improving skill gains and self-efficacy in CVC insertion procedures. \nOverall, this thesis work identified a methodology for systematically collecting and analyzing verbal and written feedback provided to novices during surgical skills training sessions and provides an empirical basis for the development of a graphical user interface and learning feedback system for the DHRT System for ultrasound-guided internal jugular catheterization based on this feedback. This thesis provides an empirical basis for the validation of a virtual reality haptic training system for surgical procedures when paired with observer feedback, and contributes to the knowledge base of skill evaluation for IJ CVC placement.  Additionally, this provides empirical evidence that showed that the DHRT and Personalized Learning Interface System is an effective method for improving self-efficacy on CVC procedures, provides evidence that suggests surgical residents may not have a strong ability to accurately self-asses their performance, and provides empirical evidence that showed that the DHRT and Learning Interface System was an effective method for improving objectively measured skills used in CVC procedures by providing direct, specific feedback.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15312], "author_name_tesi": "Yovanoff, Mary A", "last_name_ssi": "Yovanoff", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Mary", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scarlett Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scarlett Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Surgical Training", "Haptic Feedback", "Internal Jugular Catheterization", "Self Efficacy", "Medical Education", "Robotic Training"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Designing For Awareness Promotion In Complex, Distributed Collaborative Activities", "id": "17513", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8162", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Maintaining awareness is central to effective collaboration. Existing awareness solutions work for relatively simple and well-defined collaboration in traditional workspace envi- ronments, but they become less flexible or lack of scalability when applied to distributed, collaborative activities that are characterized by higher level of complexity, such as emer- gency response. The overall objective of this study is to address the major challenges of awareness support in these complex, distributed collaborative activities.\nBy following the design science paradigm, we first developed an integrated conceptual model to understand unique requirements for awareness support when the complexity of collaboration is scaled up. Built on top of the conceptual model, we then proposed the awareness promotion framework, emphasizing the active role of computer to me- diate awareness processes based on a formal knowledge representation of collaborative activities. Following the computational framework, we developed the prototype system, EDAP, and performed an in-depth case study in emergency response to demonstrate its feasibility and utility.\nThis study has made two major contributions towards the research objective. Firstly, it provides an integrated conceptual model on top of several interrelated constructs, i.e. activity, local scope, and dependency, to understand the distributed nature of the aware- ness phenomena. The model is able to account for how the awareness is distributed across multiple team members through the integration of individual cognitive processes and team processes. Secondly, it presents a computational framework for awareness pro- motion. Comparing with existing awareness support systems, our awareness promotion approach emphasizes the active role of computer to mediate awareness processes among multiple team members. It utilizes a formal knowledge representation of collaborative activities to dynamically model collaborative activities and offload some of the repre- sentation and reasoning efforts from the human to the computer so as to handle the increased level of complexity in distributed collaborative activities.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8099], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Bo ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guoray Cai", "Guoray Cai", "Alan Maceachren", "Mary Beth Rosson", "Xiaolong Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guoray Cai, Dissertation Advisor", "Guoray Cai, Committee Chair", "Alan Maceachren, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Rosson, Committee Member", "Xiaolong Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CSCW", "Collaboration", "Activity Awareness", "Dependency", "Event-based Systems"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "GEOAGENT-BASED KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS\n\n", "id": "6864", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1284", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Modern geography focuses on studying processes. In addition to observed phenomena, the study of geographic processes must (and does) place emphasis on understanding how components interact within geographic systems. As a fundamental tool for geographic representation and spatial analysis, current GISystems (geographic information systems) are nevertheless still data centered. While they are good at representing \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d information, they have limited capabilities in representing higher-level knowledge. This is because in the current GISystems there is a lack of means of capturing and representing human understanding of geographic processes to address \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d questions. In addition, non-observational factors such as laws, policies, regulations, plans, and cultural elements (e.g. religions, customs) cannot be easily represented. \n\nInstead of the traditional data-centered approach, this dissertation presents a knowledge-oriented strategy for the representation of geographic processes. To reach that end, two major steps are adopted: (1) introducing the concept of GeoAgents as the spatiotemporally distributed knowledge-representation components, and (2) presenting an integrated approach to incorporate multiple knowledge-representation techniques with geospatial databases. GeoAgents are defined in this dissertation as spatial, dynamic, and scale-dependent agents within an explicitly geographic context. By incorporating GeoAgents with graph-based concept maps, rule-based expert systems, quantitative models, and geospatial databases, this research develops a Java-based prototype \u2014 GeoAgent-based Knowledge System (GeoAgentKS) \u2014 that allows the representations of diverse kinds of geographic knowledge and spatial data to be integrated in a single cohesive software system. \n\nTo examine the knowledge-oriented strategy of geographic representation in real-world problems, GeoAgentKS are employed in a case study to represent the complex geographic processes relevant to community water systems (CWSs) in Central Pennsylvania. In this case study, geographic knowledge is captured via interpretation of the pre-existing documents and computer-based-concept-mapping interviews with domain experts. To evaluate the usability of GeoAgentKS, evaluation interviews with different experts and novices were conducted to assess the adequacy of the knowledge representation and the effectiveness in conveying knowledge. The experts in the evaluation interviews believed that it was possible to use the GeoAgentKS to represent the complex, dynamic and scale-dependent human-environment interactions. And the knowledge stored in the GeoAgentKS could be quickly learned by novices. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1273], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Chaoqing ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chaoqing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donna Jean Peuquet", "Alan Maceachren", "Brenton Yarnal", "John Yen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donna Jean Peuquet, Committee Chair", "Alan Maceachren, Committee Member", "Brenton Yarnal, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["geographic process", "representation", "GeoAgents", "GIS", "knowledge"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Statistical Asymmetry-based Automatic Brain Tumor Detection from 3D MR Images\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "10847", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1287", "abstract_tesi": "The detection and accurate segmentation of brain tumors from MR images is an important and necessary step for early diagnosis, optimized treatment, surgical planning, and follow-up assessment. However, it is a tedious and error prone task for the medical professionals to process manually. The performance of existing supervised machine learning techniques for automatic tumor segmentation is time consuming and largely dependent on the type and training samples. Brain tumors are mostly asymmetrical blobs with respect to the mid-sagittal plane (MSP) in the brain, we propose a novel 2D slice asymmetry-based, fast, fully-automatic, and unsupervised framework for brain tumor detection and segmentation from volumetric MR images. This approach detects asymmetrical intensity deviation of brain tissues in 4 stages: (1) automatic MSP extraction, (2) asymmetrical 2D slice extraction for an estimated tumor location, (3) region of interest localization, and (4) 3D tumor volume delineation using a watershed method. The method has been validated on 10 Harvard tumorbase cases with a 67.66+-7.20% mean Jaccard Coefficient, and an average end-to-end run time of 3.5 minutes per 3D scan.\n\nFurthermore, multiple and small-sized tumors, which are good indicators for potential metastasis or early stage tumor, present substantial challenges to both human and the state of the art automatic brain tumor detection algorithms, that have been overlooked in practice. Thus, we improve our computational framework to solve this challenging problem. The central contributions of our work include (1) a feasible formulation of a 3D blob extraction algorithm directly from volumetric images; (2) an asymmetry-based abnormality detection algorithm for human brain anatomy; and (3) a Bayesian formulation to asymmetry 3D blob analysis by formulating multiple cues as priors and likelihood probabilities. This improved method is validated for brain tumor detection on 20 clinical 3D MR scans from the Hershey dataset with tumors (1 to as many as 15 tumors per 3D scan) of size 3 mm^3 to 28079 mm^3 in volume. In addition, 5 normal clinical 3D MR scans are evaluated quantitatively to demonstrate that our approach also has the potential for normal/suspicious patient classification. The results show a 87.84 to 95.30% detection rate and an average end-to-end run time of 4 minutes per 3D scan. The goal of this thesis work is to assist medical professionals in automatically evaluating patients' brain MRI scans that is accurate, robust, and convenient.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1276], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Chen-Ping ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chen-Ping", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yanxi Liu", "Yanxi Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yanxi Liu, Thesis Advisor", "Yanxi Liu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["tumor volume segmentation", "3D blob detection", "brain tumor detection", "brain asymmetry"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Use of radar Doppler spectra in Arctic mixed-phase cloud studies", "id": "19670", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9567", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Stratiform clouds across the globe frequently contain both liquid- and ice-particles within the same region of the atmosphere; that is, they are often mixed-phase clouds. Modeling the processes of mixed-phase stratiform clouds remains a challenge. Progress is slow in part because of the dearth of observations that shed light on critical processes in these clouds. Recent availability of high quality millimeter-wave cloud radar Doppler spectra is an important new source of information on the micro-physical and dynamical processes within these clouds. \n\nIn the current study a radar Doppler spectrum simulator is used to produce in-cloud radar Doppler spectra from outputs of large eddy simulations with detailed bin microphysics. These model-simulated radar Doppler spectra are compared with observed radar Doppler spectra for the case study period via comparisons of reflectivity, mean Doppler velocity, and spectrum width, as well as estimates of volume-mean vertical air velocities and hydrometeor fall speeds extracted from the spectra. The results indicate that there is a mismatch in the important processes governing model and observed mixed-phase clouds, including cloud vertical air motion structures, ice nucleation, ice aggregation, and how the model increases ice particle fall speeds as particles gain mass. In order to improve mixed-phase cloud parameterizations in models, specific observations to constrain model parameters are required.\n\nRetrieving and quantifying the radiatively important liquid-phase particles within mixed-phase clouds remains a challenge because the radar signal is frequently dominated by the returns from the ice particles within these clouds. The ice masks the small reflectivity contributions from the liquid phase. To extract these small liquid-phase contributions a spectral deconvolution algorithm is developed that separates them from MMCR/KAZR Doppler-velocity spectra in which ice-particle returns dominate. In this approach spectra are first decomposed using a continuous wavelet transform. The resulting coefficients are then used to identify regions in the spectra where cloud-liquid drops contribute; Gaussian distributions are subsequently fit to these regions. Results from this algorithm indicate that this approach is capable of separating the cloud-liquid drop and ice-particle contributions to the radar Doppler spectra. In the process volume-mean vertical air velocities, turbulent broadening and mean ice-particle fall speeds are also extracted.\n\nStatistics of the macro-physical, micro-physical, thermodynamical, and dynamical properties of mixed-phase clouds are characterized using a month of ground-based measurements collected during October 2011 at Barrow, Alaska. Cloud layer temperature is the primary factor that determines mixed-phase cloud properties. One-hour mixed-phase cloud events are classified into cold and warm cases. Clouds in category 1 (warm) were lower, thinner and had weaker and liquid-dominated precipitation, while clouds in category 2 (cold) were higher, thicker and had more intense and ice-dominated precipitation. Precipitation reflectivities and reflectivity-weighted mean precipitation fall speeds are found to increase with vertical air motion. Ice particles generally form, grow and fall out of the cloud layer in updraft regions. Ice precipitation processes also play a role in determining the macro-physical properties and liquid microphysics of these clouds. \n\nThe newly developed spectral deconvolution algorithm enables us to investigate relationships between cloud macro-physical, micro-physical, thermodynamical and dynamical properties based on long-term observations of mixed-phase clouds. Studies on these relationships derived from long-term observation will strength our understanding of the physical processes in Arctic mixed-phase clouds, which is a necessary to develop more sophisticated parameterizations to partition cloud phases in climate models.

The inputs to both problems are a universe of elements $U$, and a collection $\\mathcal{S}$ of subsets of $U$. NP-hard problems are generally believed not to be solvable exactly in polynomial time. One direction to study NP-hard problems is to find polynomial-time approximation algorithms which aim at improving the approximation guarantee.\n\nWe study approximation algorithms based on local improvements for the $k$-Set Packing problem. The $k$-Set Packing problem asks to find a disjoint collection of sets with size $k$ which have the maximum coverage. We present a local search algorithm which looks for a class of local improvements of $O(\\log n)$ sets ($n=|\\mathcal{S}|$), which we call the canonical improvements with tail changes. The algorithm achieves an approximation ratio $\\frac{3}{k+1}-\\epsilon$ in time singly exponential to $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}$. On the other hand, we construct an instance with locality gap $\\frac{3}{k+1}$ for any algorithm using local improvements of size $O(n^{1/5})$. Thus, our approximation guarantee is optimal with respect to results achievable by algorithms based on local improvements.\n\nThe $k$-Set Cover problem asks to find a collection of minimum number of sets which cover the entire universe, where the sets have size at most $k$. The standard greedy algorithm for the $k$-Set Cover problem selects $i$-sets greedily for $i$ from $k$ down to 1. We replace the greedy selection by a set packing algorithm based on local search. Our key contribution is a new $k$-set packing heuristic which we call a restricted $k$-Set Packing algorithm. The algorithm makes a local improvement only when the number of 1-sets needed to complete the cover does not increase.\nEquipped with the restricted $k$-Set Packing algorithm, our $k$-Set Cover algorithm achieves an approximation ratio $H_k-0.6690+\\epsilon+O(\\frac{1}{k})$, where $H_k=\\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{i}$ is the $k$-th harmonic number. For small $k$, our results are $1.8583$ for $k=6$, $1.7143$ for $k=5$ and $1.5$ for $k=4$, which are the currently best approximation guarantee for the $k$-Set Cover problem for any $k\\geq 4$.\n\nAlthough these local search algorithms achieve good approximation guarantee, they are usually not applicable for real-world problems especially when we have large-scale data. To obtain an efficient approximate solution to some set covering problems, we propose a one-pass streaming algorithm which produces a prefix-optimal ordering of sets. This algorithm can be easily used to solve the Max-$k$-Cover and the Partial-Cover problems. The algorithm consumes space linear to the size of the universe of elements. The processing time for a set is linear to the size of the set. We also show with the aid of computer simulation that the approximation ratio of the Max-$k$-Cover problem is around 0.3. We conduct experiments to compare our algorithm with existing algorithms.\n\nAnother direction of studying NP-hard problems is to find efficient exponential-time algorithms to exactly solve the problem. Dynamic programming is one generic way for this purpose. However, it could have the drawback of requiring exponential space. We consider exact computations based on tree decomposition of graphs using dynamic programming. In this case, the space complexity is usually exponential in the treewidth. We study the problem of designing efficient dynamic programming algorithms based on tree decompositions in polynomial space. We show how to construct a tree decomposition and use algebraic techniques to obtain a dynamic programming algorithm which runs in time $O^*(2^h)$, where $h$ is a parameter closely related to the tree-depth of a graph. We apply our algorithm to the problem of counting perfect matchings on grids and show that it outperforms other polynomial-space solutions. We also apply the algorithm to other set covering and partitioning problems.\n\nFinally, we consider one important application of the Set Cover problem, diversifying the subgraph search result. The subgraph search results are typically ordered based on graph similarity score. We design two ranking measures with the ``diminishing return\" property based on both similarity and diversity. We give two efficient algorithms, the greedy selection and the swapping selection with provable performance guarantee. We also propose a local search heuristic with at least 100 times speedup and a similar solution quality. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approaches via extensive experiments.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9432], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Huiwen ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huiwen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Martin Furer", "Piotr Berman", "Robert T Collins", "Stephen George Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Martin Furer, Dissertation Advisor", "Piotr Berman, Committee Member", "Robert T Collins, Committee Member", "Stephen George Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["k-set cover", "k-set packing", "streaming set cover", "space saving", "diversifying"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "AN EXAMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF PARTICIPATION IN A COLLEGE STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM\n\n\n", "id": "8798", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2308", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this dissertation is to determine the program effects of studying abroad for college students at a northeastern U. S. university including: the motivation for studying abroad, the relationships between participants\u2019 characteristics and program effects, and the interrelationships among program effects. A series of investigations have been conducted to answer three research questions and six proposed hypotheses. The questions and hypotheses are based on the results of a pilot study and an intensive review of the previous literature. A total of 265 college students participated in this study and completed a web-based survey in 2005. \nThe dissertation is organized in a three-article format. The first study explores the motivations for studying abroad and concludes, via qualitative content analysis, that there are six main motivations for studying abroad: cultural learning, academic learning, foreign experience, personal development, pleasure, and social interactions. Moreover, this motivation study showed that the expectancy-valence theory is an alternative approach to interpret participants\u2019 motivations for studying abroad and the findings exemplify and illustrate that students are motivated by the expected program benefits. However, this study did not testify the application of expectancy-valence theory in study abroad context.\nThe second study determines the program effects and examines the relationship between participants\u2019 characteristics and program effects. Five program effects are extracted from the answers to a 24-item questionnaire including: language learning, cultural immersion, foreign connection, personal growth, and career development. The results suggest that gender and year-in-college are not significant predictors in terms of program effects. Also, the rest of the findings suggest that business and science majors have higher levels of foreign cultural learning than art majors. Also, the semester-based programs significantly contribute to increasing foreign connections because the homestay option is the most effective living arrangement for foreign language learning among all residency arrangements. Local friendships also contribute to foreign connection and cultural learning. \nThe third study examines six hypotheses with respect to the interrelationships among program effects. Two models were derived from previous literature and tested in these data. After statistical analyses, an intercultural connection model suggests that language learning is the antecedent for cultural immersion and cultural immersion is the antecedent for foreign connection. Cultural immersion fully mediates the relationship between language learning and foreign connection. In a personal progress model, foreign connection serves as an antecedent both for personal growth and career plans and personal growth also has positive relationship to career plans. Personal growth partially mediates the relationship between foreign interaction and career plans.\nTaken together, all results suggest that studying abroad plays a crucial role in the \u201cUniversity of Travel\u201d (Pearce & Foster, 2007), where the close relationship between travel and learning. College officials might consider developing more customized programs for specific target audiences than before, like language learning-oriented or foreign experience-oriented travel programs based on the findings from the second and third studies. From an academic perspective, this study might serve as the primary step in describing the program effects and comprehending how tourism and education cohere together in a travel context. Moreover, future research is needed to examine the program effects longitudinally and experimental-designed research would be an effective approach to identify the cause and effect relationships in terms of program effects.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2288], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, HungChih ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "HungChih", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Leisure Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Garry Chick", "Yi Jen Doris Lee", "Duarte Morais", "Harry Zinn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Garry Chick, Committee Chair", "Yi Jen Doris Lee, Committee Member", "Duarte Morais, Committee Member", "Harry Zinn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tourism", "Motivation", "Program Effects", "Study Abroad"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "GENERATIONAL STATUS, ENGLISH PROFICIENCY, AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN MATHEMATICS\n\n", "id": "10503", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3116", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The immigrant student population is becoming the major minority student group in the United States, but few studies have examined whether immigrant high school students receive equal opportunities to learn mathematics.

This thesis examines the strategy of supplier selection in a cross docking cold chain. Buyers usually do not consider from this perspective, but this method may help them to save extra money. In the first phase, Borda Count, L_\u221e Norm, and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) have been used to reduce the original suppliers. An optimization model has been stated in the second phase to determine which supplier to choose from the reduced suppliers selected in the first phase. And the two-phase supplier selection method has been performed in an example. The sensitivity analysis of the example showed that the order allocation among the suppliers would not change when we varied the inbound shipment capacity.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11556], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Mengyi ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mengyi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supplier Selection", "Cold Chain", "Cross Docking"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "UNDERSTANDING USER INTERACTIONS THROUGH LINK ANALYSIS IN SOCIAL NETWORKS", "id": "14108muy145", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14108", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Social networks exist in many places throughout the world. A typical example of a social network captures a group of human beings and their associated interactions, with vertices representing human beings and links representing human interactions. Most social networks are dynamic, and they grow with both vertices and links. From the perspective of link analysis, link prediction is a fundamental task, because social network growth and development depend heavily on user interactions, and link prediction results can be easily applied to boost user interactions. Also, link prediction has a wide range of applications, such as recommendation systems. In this thesis, our research aims at developing effective link prediction models.\nIn the real world, most social networks are heterogeneous and have various types of links. However, current social network research often treat all links homogeneously. Such a simplification has negative implications for link prediction. Different types of links have different properties. We should be able identify such properties to design distinctive models to predict different links. Also, by identifying link types, we can focus on only those links that are under our interests, and break large social networks into small subnetworks to increase computational efficiency in link prediction. Thus, to facilitate link prediction, and to achieve a deeper understanding of social networks, we also need effective link classification models.\nTo conduct our research for link prediction, we design two recommender systems and test their effectiveness on data from a major U.S. online dating site. Online dating is a fast growing market in recent years, and most sites adopt recommender systems to suggest potential dates. We notice that, for most social networks, new links can be introduced in two ways. First, they can be added when new members join. Second, existing members can establish connections among themselves. As a result, we conduct two distinctive studies. In the first study, we aim to provide reciprocal online dating recommendation for new users. To accomplish this task, we take a hybrid approach. We analyze the preferences of existing users based on their activities, and cluster them into different communities. We then link new users to such communities in a probabilistic way and make recommendations for new users based on activities of communities formed by existing users. Compared with the baseline, our model achieves significant improvements across multiple evaluations. In the second study, we analyze interaction patterns for existing online dating users and design a new collaborative filtering algorithm to make recommendations for them. The algorithm considers both the taste and attractiveness of users. We apply these two considerations to two main design stages of collaborative filtering. When compared against two separate baselines, our algorithm achieves better results in both precision and recall, especially for those reciprocal connections. \nBecause links in online dating networks are homogeneous, we take another dataset for our research of link classification. We conduct a study on a cellphone network, where some of its user pairs are labeled with one of three relationship types. Cellphone networks are some of the largest social networks in the world, and they contain various types of links. To design an effective method of classifying user pairs, we extract three categories of features: network topology, communication, and co-location features. By applying several classification algorithms over these features, we successfully classify three types of links. We also find that communication features are very powerful in identifying family relationship, while co-location features provide best performance in identifying colleague relationships.\nWith this research, we hope to provide some insights about the origin, development, and nature of links in social networks.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15282], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Mo ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "first_name_ssi": "Mo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Xiaolong Zhang", "Xiaolong Zhang", "Dongwon Lee", "Guoray Cai", "Derek Allen Kreager"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Xiaolong Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Xiaolong Zhang, Committee Chair", "Dongwon Lee, Committee Member", "Guoray Cai, Committee Member", "Derek Allen Kreager, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["social network analyses", "link analysis", "data mining", "recommender system", "cold start", "classification"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF HEALTH MESSAGE FRAMES AND CULTURAL APPEALS ON INFLUENZA PREVENTION: A CROSS-COUNTRY INVESTIGATION \n", "id": "9789", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4785", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation was designed to advance the understanding of communication strategies for disease prevention by considering the combined effects of health message frames (loss versus gain frames) and cultural appeals (individualistic versus collectivistic appeals).

However, bus accidents always attract high public attention due to the severity of\neach accident. According to a bus-accident survey conducted at PTI (The Pennsylvania\nTransportation Institute), loss of yaw stability is one of the major causes leading to bus\naccidents. Maintaining yaw stability is difficult and sometimes impossible for a human\ndriver under critical driving situations. In this case, it is very natural to consider the use\nof automatic driver-assistance systems to avoid accidents. In order to improve the safety\nlevel of buses as well as that of the overall transportation system, a yaw-stability\nenhancement system needs to be developed for buses. However, very few studies have\nbeen conducted on handling characteristics and yaw-stability improvement for buses.\nThis thesis focused on studying bus handling characteristics and developing a\nyaw-stability enhancement system for heavy-duty transit buses.\nIn the thesis work, an active front-wheel steering (AFS) system was developed for\na typical 40-foot transit bus. A crucial part in the design of an AFS system is dealing\nwith the nonlinear characteristics of the tire forces. Tires are the parts in vehicle\ndynamics afflicted with the highest degree of nonlinearity due to vehicle motions, tireroad\nfriction, vertical load, and many other factors. It is obvious that an AFS system has\nto be robust with respect to the huge uncertainty caused by the nonlinearity in the tire\nforces. Following the approach recommended by Ono et al., the nonlinear tire force was\ncharacterized by uncertain cornering stiffness. Ono suggested that if a controller is able\nto regulate the motions for a linear vehicle model with uncertain cornering stiffnesses, the\niv\nsame controller can be applied to the vehicle model with nonlinear tire forces. Based on\nthis approach, a proportional-integral (PI) controller was designed using the constrained\noptimization method proposed by \u00c5str\u00f6m et al.. The designed AFS controller was\nevaluated on a three degree-of-freedom nonlinear bus model using a series of test\nscenarios. The computer-simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the AFS\nsystem in yaw-stability enhancement for buses. In addition, a comparison between the PI\ncontroller and a H&#8734; loop-shaping controller revealed that, for the specified test cases, the\nrobustness about road friction variation the simple PI controller achieved was similar to\nthat of the advanced H&#8734; loop-shaping controller.\nThis thesis also investigated the handling characteristics of a typical 40-foot\ntransit bus both experimentally and numerically. The experimental data showed that\nheavy-duty buses exhibit unique handling characteristics, which are different from those\nof cars or trucks. Compared to a car, a bus has a narrower linear operating range and a\nmuch slower yaw response. Compared to a truck, a bus has a much higher rolloverthreshold.\nThe results from the computer simulation suggested that vehicle weight has\nonly a minor effect on bus handling during normal operation.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4765], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Nan ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean N Brennan", "Mark Levi", "John M Mason", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sean N Brennan, Committee Chair", "Mark Levi, Committee Member", "John M Mason, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bus", "Heavy Vehicle", "Yaw Control", "Front-Wheel Steering"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Information Interoperability between Building Information Modeling Authoring Tools and Simulation Tools to Support Energy Efficient Building Design", "id": "21405", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9909", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    Effective Energy Efficient Buildings (EEB) design requires the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) design authoring tools, along with various simulation tools to support decision making for optimized building solutions. This requires frequent interactions between computational tools. Traditionally, people have been using a point-to-point model for data exchange between those tools, which is complex and inefficient. An integrated data-centric model can reduce the communication cost and improve the interoperability. By setting up a BIM data hub in the center, both BIM design authoring tools and simulation tools only need to talk with the data hub. In this way, the communication interface among those tools is improved. \n    However, even in this model, each tool still requires an interface to connect to the BIM data hub. If part of those tools have the same kind of interface, and part of them are supported by one single tool, the data exchange model could be further simplified. In this case, the building lifecycle is divided into two modes: design and simulation. The lack of a unified interface to support information exchange and interoperability among different building design and simulation tools has become a bottleneck of the EEB design process. Therefore, a link between design mode and the simulation mode is required for the whole simulation process. \n    In this thesis, two existing infrastructures are leveraged to build a connected workflow using this simplified approach. The open source BIMserver is used as the information retrieval center, and OpenStudio is used as the information exchange and simulation platform. BIMserver can support the storage, maintenance, and query of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) based building information models, and OpenStudio is a platform supporting whole building energy-related modeling and simulations. The main contribution of this thesis is to build an information exchange bridge between BIMserver and OpenStudio, which enables different design authoring tools and simulation tools that are connected to either of them to interoperate and exchange needed data. \n    This thesis describes the integrated approach at the data level, connecting BIMserver and OpenStudio to build a unified EEB data exchange model.

Twelve healthy young adults participated in the study (4 conditions, 12 trials/condition, 30s/trial) and accelerometers were used to measure digit tremor. Amplitude analysis showed that the 30 degree posture angle increased the magnitude of acceleration regardless of vision condition. Visual information increased tremor amplitude of the left hand but not the right hand digits. Tremor amplitude was greater in the index finger and progressively smaller in the middle, ring and little fingers. Approximate Entropy (ApEn) showed that the higher postural angle led to greater tremor irregularity. The coupling of the tremor of the index and middle fingers was highest and the level of the coupling within hand decreased as the relative adjacency of digits from each other increased. There was no evidence of tremor coupling in the homologous digits across hands.

This complexity requires an integrated, non-invasive, and multiscale experimental approach. In order to fulfill this task, a multimodal fluorescence micro-spectroscopy system was designed and built on a single platform to gain complementary molecular and cellular information at high spatial-temporal resolution. These integrated biophotonics techniques include differential interference contrast (DIC), confocal and two-photon (2P) microscopy, 2P-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), steady state fluorescence polarization anisotropy imaging, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). As a proof of principle, a breast cancer cell line (Hs578T) labeled with the mitochondrial marker rhodamine 123 (Rh123) was used as a model system. High resolution DIC and confocal images indicated distinct cell morphology (amorphous, polygonal shape) with a perinuclear mitochondrial distribution. In addition, the nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio in the cancer cells appeared larger than the normal counterpart. Time-dependent and 3D confocal images revealed dynamic mitochondrial movements in the Hs578T cells. Two-photon FLIM demonstrated heterogeneous conformations of and/or environment surrounding Rh123 with an average lifetime of ~3.1 ns that is significantly different from the free fluorophore in phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4 (~3.7 ns). Steady state anisotropy imaging of Rh123 indicated a restrictive environment in mitochondria with an average anisotropy of ~0.24. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy of Rh123 in cells revealed two major components (~2.2\niv\nns and ~48 ns), indicating a heterogeneous mitochondrial environment of Rh123. At the single-molecule level, the lateral diffusion of mitochondrial Rh123 takes place on a much slower time scale (~2 ms) compared with the free fluorophore (~0.1 ms). Our diffusion studies indicate that the apparent hydrodynamic radius of mitochondrial Rh123 is ~39 nm, which is also sensitive to the temporal resolution. Further, the biomolecular information gained using the proposed assay, within the context of cell morphology, using the proposed assay, would be helpful for modeling the functional response of living cells to extracellular stimulation (chemical, mechanical, or otherwise). More importantly, our non-invasive approach complements conventional biochemical techniques on cell lysates and is also applicable to a wide range of molecular and cellular studies.

Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are key metabolic cofactors in energy metabolism and redox reactions in all living cells.  The enzymatic activities of these biochemical reactions are dependent on the concentration and distribution of these NADH and FAD coenzymes. Mutations of mitochondrial DNA in diseased cells lead to structural mutations of the electron transport chain complexes (I-IV) and, therefore, numerous health problems such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiomyopathy, and ageing. Mitochondria also participate in programmed cell death (apoptosis), generation of free radicals and oxidative stress.  As a result, intracellular coenzymes have the potential to serve as natural biomarkers for the respiratory state activities and mitochondria-related health problems. Conventional biochemical methods have provided the bulk information on the concentration of these intrinsic cofactors using cell lysates and, therefore, a snapshot of the enzymatic activities in both normal and diseased cells. These biochemical techniques, however, are incapable of providing the morphological context and molecular conformation dynamics inherent in living cells or tissues. Other steady-state fluorescence-based techniques have been developed since the pioneering work of Britton Chance in the 1960\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.  However, these techniques are limited by the ambiguous distinction between intrinsic NADH concentration and alteration of cellular autofluorescence, which is sensitive to the molecular conformation (i.e., free or enzyme-bound) as well as the complex cell environment. \n   To overcome these limitations, we have developed integrated multimodal fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy techniques, on a single platform, to differentiate between normal and cancer breast cells using intracellular NADH and FAD as natural biomarkers. Human breast cancer cell line (Hs578T) and its non-transformed fibroblast counterpart (Hs578Bst) from the same patient were used as model systems. To examine the sensitivity of our assay to different cell lines, a non-tumorigenic mammalian epithelial cell line (MCF10A) and its transformed counterpart (MCF7) from different patients were also used. Complementary studies on primary and ras-transduced keratinocyte cells isolated from mice enabled us to assess the sensitivity of our experimental approach and these coenzymes to targeted alteration of key regulatory proteins. \n     The environmental heterogeneity of intracellular cofactors (i.e., how cellular environment may influence the autofluorescence quantum yield) was investigated using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging. These fluorescence lifetime and intensity images, recorded using a calibrated microscope, were analyzed to construct concentration images of the endogenous coenzymes at the single cell level. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy images, using polarization-analyzed autofluorescence, were then used to obtain direct measurements of the fluorescence fraction of free and enzyme-bound NADH at the single-cell level. Complementary studies were also conducted using potassium cyanide to inhibit ETC enzymes in these model cells. Control experiments include NADH and FAD interactions with representative enzymes (e.g. lactate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, and lipoamide dehydrogenase) in solution. Using our integrated fluorescence assay, we also investigated the local environment and complexity of the inner membrane of mitochondria, where oxidative phosphorylation takes place, using rhodamine-123 as mitochondrial label.  \n    Our results are discussed in terms of the cell biology, cancer pathology, and related literature studies.

A physics-based line-contact tribology model for the entire lubrication regime is developed. The line-contact tribology model is integrated with gear kinematics to establish a gear-meshing tribology model. As the primary application, the gear-meshing tribology model is coupled with a heat transfer model to conduct system-level transient analysis of LoL performance between a pair of spur gears. \nBased on the load sharing between hydrodynamic pressure (fluid) and solid contact, the entire lubrication regime is commonly divided into elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), mixed lubrication (ML) and boundary lubrication (BL). To establish a physics-based model, the dissertation further divides the mixed lubrication regime into three sub-regimes: light-mixed lubrication, significant-mixed lubrication and near-boundary lubrication, based on their physical characterizes. A model is developed for the boundary and near-boundary lubrication regimes where the majority of the contact load is supported by solid contact. This model accommodates key thermo-mechanical and tribo-chemistry considerations in these two regimes, including contact temperature, contact friction coefficient, surface boundary films and the boundary film failure criteria. A well-established line-contact tribology model is then reviewed and used to model the EHL and light-mixed lubrication regimes where the contact load is essentially carried by hydrodynamic pressure, and only a small portion of the load is carried by surface asperities (roughness). In the significant-mixed lubrication regime, comparable load is shared between the fluid and the solid. In this regime, the strong coupling between the fluid pressure and the solid contacts makes a sound first-principle model for this regime intractable. A physics-based interpolation method is then developed and applied to approximate the contact and lubrication variables in this regime.\nThe contact between unmodified involute spur gear teeth is equivalent to a line contact. During the mesh between a pair of teeth, contact load, surface velocities, and contact geometries of the equivalent line contact vary based on a number of gear configurations. In the gear-meshing tribology model, the meshing kinematics of involute spur gears is integrated with the line-contact tribology such that, with given gear configurations, system operating parameters, gear bulk temperature and lubrication condition, contact variables (pressure, temperature and friction force etc.) can be obtained at every meshing position, thus to evaluate the meshing performance.\nTo simulate gearbox loss-of-lubrication performance, the gear-meshing tribology model is coupled with a system heat transfer model to develop a system-level simulation tool, which is used to analyze the interaction between local tooth meshing tribology and global gearbox heat balance. A nominal system based on the LoL test gearbox facility at NASA Glenn Research Center is studied. The simulated results are comparable to the experiment results in both scales and trends. Then a series of parametric analyses are conduced, showing that LoL performance may be improved in various aspects such as gear configurations, material properties and the presence of an emergency lubrication system.

My paper discusses these three aspects in more detail, with the hope that the answers I have found will be helpful in guiding future community design for a better living environment.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8718], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Qingyang ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qingyang", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexandra Staub"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexandra Staub, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["housing adaptation", "living environment", "sense of belonging"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Regulation of Macrophage Heterogeneity and Diet-induced Metabolic Diseases by the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Ron", "id": "18986", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8881", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tissue resident macrophages present in virtually all tissues are important immune cells that regulate the progression of many diseases. Classically activated macrophages (M1) elicit immune responses and eliminate pathogens, while excessive products generated in this inflammatory process cause host tissue damage and potentiate the progression of chronic inflammatory diseases. Alternatively activated macrophages (M2) attenuate inflammation and produce mediators that are involved in tissue regeneration. Our previous results showed that Ron receptor tyrosine kinase tilts the balance of macrophage activation towards an M2 phenotype and away from an M1 phenotype. In acute inflammatory models, absence of Ron results in impaired inflammatory regulation due to M1 and M2 imbalance and lead to an accelerated disease progression. However, the mechanism through which Ron inhibiting pro-inflammatory M1 activation is not well understood. Here, we demonstrated that Ron and its ligand, macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), regulated LPS-induced inflammatory signals through inhibiting activation of IKK, retarding I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and reducing the DNA binding of NF-\u03baB in response to LPS in primary macrophages. In addition, MSP inhibited the NF-\u03baB-dependent upregulation of I\u03baB\u03c2, which inhibits transactivation of p65 and its DNA binding. However, MSP did not inhibit the MyD88-dependent TAK1 and MAPK activation or the MyD88-independent activation of IFN\u03b2 production in response to LPS. Altogether, we revealed the mechanism of Ron inhibiting M1 macrophage activation in primary macrophages.\n\n We also investigated the ability of Ron to regulate macrophage activation in a diet-induced chronic systemic inflammation model, the disease phenotypes of which include atherosclerosis, fatty liver disease and obesity. We showed that the expression of Ron in adipose tissue macrophages, aortic macrophages, and fatty liver Kupffer cells was tightly associated with an M2 phenotype. Ron expression in these tissue resident macrophages was reduced with the progression of these chronic diseases. Additionally, Ron deficient mice exhibited enhanced severity of atherosclerosis and liver injury with more lipid accumulation when challenged with a high cholesterol diet. This phenotype was associated with elevated expression of inflammatory markers in atherosclerotic aortas and fatty livers. Our results demonstrated that Ron is important in regulating macrophage phenotype in diet-induced inflammation, and thus attenuates the progression of diet-induced atherosclerosis, fatty liver disease and obesity. \n\nTaken together, the results presented in this thesis indicated that Ron balances macrophage activation by inhibiting M1 macrophage activation while promoting an M2 macrophage phenotype, and plays a protective role in the progression of diet-induced metabolic inflammation. This work provides evidence that Ron might be used as an M2 macrophage marker in certain diet-induced chronic inflammatory diseases.

The successful fabrication of metalattices opens up the possibility of designing new materials with previously inaccessible properties, instead of relying on the limited options offered by natural. Information about morphology and chemical bonding in the metalattices is critical for understanding their properties as feature sizes scale to mere nanometers and are reduced to the quantum regime. \nThis thesis addresses a systematic characterization of Si and Ge metalattices fabricated using 60, 30, and 14 nm opal templates. We developed a protocol to release metalattices from their template using HF vapor. The metalattice, composed of amorphous or nanocrystalline silicon, shows long-range order and interconnectivity in two-dimensional (2D) microscopy images. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to investigate the nanostructures synthesized by high-pressure chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD), providing both crystallinity and chemical information of the infiltrated material. In addition, three-dimensional (3D) volume reconstruction using scanning transmission electron tomography was conducted to retrieve structural information in the third dimension. The face centered cubic (FCC) symmetry of the metalattice was confirmed by observations from many different angles using a tilting process and computer reconstruction. The metalattice closely adopts the shape of the inverse opal. Changes of lattice parameters and porosity of the metalattice due to contact between spheres in the template were observed. The relationship between the contact area and the resulting shape of the metalattice was compared to geometric calculations and found to be consistent with the measured results from our tomographic reconstruction. Finally, the cropping planes of the reconstructed octahedral and tetrahedral site meta-atoms confirmed the void-free infiltration by HPCVD and are consistent with conclusions about a lack of voids from positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS).\nElectron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were applied to investigate the local electronic structure of the Si metalattices at the nanoscale. The Si L2,3 core-loss edge of the Si metalattice was blue shifted compared to the onset measured from bulk Si. In addition, a shape change was found for the Si L2,3 core-lose edge of the Si metalattice, suggesting modification of the band structure. HRTEM revealed that the Si metalattice is composed of Si nanocrystallites ranging from 2-10 nm, and the nanocrystal size decreases from the octahedral site meta-atoms to the tetrahedral site meta-atoms and is about 2-3 nm in the meta-bonds. The largest blueshift of 0.55 eV was found in the meta-bond, which is the smallest feature of the metalattice and has the smallest average nanocrystal size. Furthermore, an enhanced interband transition (E2) peak was found in the low-loss EELS of the small features in the Si metalattice, and this scattering event even surpassed the volume plasmon peak in the meta-bond region. In summary, we observed a systematic change in EEL spectra in both core-loss and low-loss regions, showing a gradual blueshift in energy which is smallest in the octahedral site meta-atom and largest in the meta-bonds. Both the special confinement applied by the nanocrystallite inside the metalattice and the periodic nature of the metalattice should contribute to the modification of the band structure of the Si metalattice.\nFinally, room temperature photoluminescence was observed from the Si metalattice. Surface passivation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 successfully preserved the luminescence intensity that was diminished after the Si metalattice was released from the silica opal template. A broadband photoluminescence ranging from 600-900 nm was found, and the intensity was three times stronger after the passivation than that of the as-deposited Si metalattice. Mechanisms related to this emission were discussed. A dynamic PL study is suggested for further understanding of the origins of the photoluminescence from the Si metalattices.

Interior noise reduction in aircraft using such panels is a challenge because acoustic attenuation is reduced for light, stiff composite structures, especially those manufactured to have fewer mechanical joints. Conventional strain-based damping approaches are not effective over a broad range of operating temperatures, and are also reduced in effectiveness by the presence of tensile pressure loads. \nAcoustic meta-materials offer an approach to reducing the dynamic response of, and noise transmission through, sandwich panels. The key concept underlying this approach is to consider the meta-materials as a highly-distributed system of tuned vibration absorbers that introduces one or more stop bands in which range the response of the global structure is reduced. The resonance frequencies of the absorber system may be tuned to match an excitation frequency (or a range of excitation frequencies) and / or to match one or more global resonance frequencies. \nUsing the assumed-modes method, a meta-material system was designed to be integrated into the honeycomb core of a representative sandwich panel. To determine the dynamic response of the global sandwich panel, the meta-material system was modeled as an effective distributed complex mass. \nThe cores for two sandwich panels were fabricated using 3-D printing technology, using a stiff polymer for the baseline honeycomb core, and a combination of a stiff and soft/lossy polymers for the meta-material-augmented core. The two cores were characterized statically to determine effective elastic properties, and dynamically to determine the natural frequencies and loss factors of the meta-material system. Unidirectional carbon-fiber face sheets were bonded to both cores to construct sandwich panels. The sandwich panels were tested dynamically for two different boundary conditions, cantilevered and free-free. Experimental results confirmed that the vibration absorbers reduced the peak responses near the natural frequencies of the meta-material system; multiple well-separated local modes of the meta-material system turned out to be significant. \nFuture work will address broadband damping by tuning the local natural frequencies of the meta-material system over a range of design frequencies, and distributing the mass of the system optimally over the global sandwich panel for the modes of interest.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10714], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Tianliang ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tianliang", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George A Lesieutre, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vibration reduction", "acoustic metamaterial", "sandwich panel", "3-D manufacture"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Sturctured and Unstructured Computations of Unsteady Turbomachinery Flows Using Pressure Based Methods", "id": "5912", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6605", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThis thesis is aimed at an improved understanding of unsteady turbomachinery flow physics using time-accurate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. Two pressure-based algorithms have been adapted for the numerical computation of turbulent, two- and three-dimensional, steady and unsteady flows through turbomachinery. The differential model employed is the incompressible Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations. In this work, several new and/or modern techniques have been adapted, implemented, and applied. These include higher order accurate structured and hybrid unstructured discretization, an inlet wake passing strategy, an interface sliding technique for the computation of rotor-stator interactions, parallel processing capability, and full-two-fluid modeling for multiphase flow analysis. The methods are employed in the analysis of several unsteady turbomachinery flows. The results are presented, compared with experimental data and interpreted, elucidating several important intrinsically unsteady physical processes in these machines. \n\tDetails of the physical and numerical modeling strategies of these algorithms are presented, with emphasis placed on new contributions. Specifically, details of the wake passing and rotor-stator interaction schemes are presented, as are details of the discretization practices, structured and unstructured grid generation strategies, multiphase flow analysis treatments, and parallel processing implementation.\n\tSeveral unsteady turbomachinery test cases are computed and compared with available experimental data. These results illustrate the effectiveness and generality of the schemes developed, and elucidate important, unsteady physical processes in the machines considered.\nFirst, the unsteady flow field through the midspan section of a second stage stator of a two-stage compressor is carried out with the inlet wake passing strategy. The effects of rotor-stator blade row spacing and the rotor/stator blade count ratio on the turbomachinery unsteady flows are investigated. It is found that a decrease in the rotor-stator blade row spacing causes more decay of the upstream wake and leads to increases in the unsteady pressure fluctuations on the blade surface. The nonlinear effects and variations in the harmonic content are captured by the Navier-Stokes code. Loss mechanisms are evaluated. They include: (1) losses due to the decay of the wake upstream of the blade row; (2) losses due to the decay of the wake inside the stator passage, including modification of the wake profile by the stator pressure field; and (3) the blade profile losses, which are affected by the passing of the inlet wake. The wake/blade count ratio effect is found to be dominated by the reduced frequency effect near the stator leading edge. The wake interaction and vortex formation have major influence on the unsteady pressure response in the 10-25% axial chord region. Beyond this region, the smallest wake/blade count ratio has the most pronounced influence on the unsteady flow and pressure field. The increased interaction effect at higher wake/blade count ratio results in a more rapid decay of the wake, thus reducing the influence of the wake beyond the 25% chord location. The losses increase significantly as the wake/blade count ratio is increased. This increase is mainly brought about by the increased number of wakes and the losses associated with their decay upstream and inside the blade passage.\nSecond, the three-dimensional, steady state flow field through the inlet guide vane of a high Reynolds number pump is predicted and compared with experimental data. Separations on the blade suction surface near the trailing edge and at the hub wall corner are captured, though the predicted separation zones are smaller that those measured. Loss profiles including profiles losses and wake losses are analyzed. Details of the predicted wake profiles at various radial locations are compared with measurement. Radial and tangential components of the wake profiles are captured well, but an overprediction of the axial wake depth is found at most radial locations. This may be due to the grid and the low Reynolds number two-equation turbulence model used in the computation. Also, it is found from a simulation study at the midspan section that the inlet turbulence length scale can have a significant effect on the decay characteristic of the wakes. Finally, analysis of the decay of the wake and the secondary flow shows that near the endwalls, the decay of the secondary flow is slower than the decay of the wake. Thus the secondary flow could be a major source of unsteadiness for the downstream blade row in these regions.\nThird, the midspan section of an axial flow turbine stage is investigated. The nozzle is closely followed by a downstream rotor. The small axial gap between the blade rows indicates a strong unsteady interaction between them. Here, the full rotor-stator interaction is captured by computing the nozzle and rotor flows together simultaneously using the interface sliding scheme, which allows accurate and efficient resolution of the nozzle wake and its interaction with the rotor flow field. The predicted nozzle wake decay is smaller than that measured, likely due to the two-equation turbulence model used. This leads to a higher predicted unsteady response on the rotor blade than that measured. Turbulence intensity, total relative velocity and its unsteady fluctuations are used as indicators to investigate the dynamics of the nozzle wake inside and downstream of the rotor blade passage. The chopping by the rotor blade, the rapid transport of the nozzle wake along the rotor suction surface, and its interaction with the rotor wakes of the nozzle wakes are captured with reasonable accuracy. \nLastly, single- and multi-phase (i.e., bubbly) flows through the midspan section of an axial flow pump stage are investigated. This flow field is of relevance to marine propulsion applications; in particular, the bubbly flow calculation is of interest in surface ship wake acoustic signature analysis. The hybrid unstructured, full rotor-stator, multi-bubble-field (separate continuity and momentum equations solved for five gas \u201cfields\u201d each with a unique representative bubble diameter) analyses performed represents the first demonstration of such a calculation capability that has appeared.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6603], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Wen-Sheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wen-Sheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lyle Norman Long", "Robert Francis Kunz", "Philip John Morris", "Vigor Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member", "Robert Francis Kunz, Committee Chair", "Philip John Morris, Committee Chair", "Vigor Yang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["unstructured grid", "pressure based method", "rotor-stator interaction", "turbomachinery flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "IN VIVO FUNCTION AND INTERACTION OF SNARES, NSF AND SNAP DURING PRESYNAPTIC VESICLE TRAFFICKING IN DROSOPHILA", "id": "11144", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6627", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Synaptic transmission is a fundamental aspect of nervous system function. At chemical synapses, neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles fuse to the presynaptic plasma membrane at specific sites known as active zones and release neurotransmitters, which act on postsynaptic neurons. SNAREs, NSF and SNAP are core components of the synaptic vesicle fusion apparatus. Gaining insights into their in vivo functions and interactions has been the primary research goal of this dissertation project. Taking advantage of the powerful genetic model system of Drosophila, the project has combined genetic, biochemical and live imaging methods to reveal interesting insights into synaptic protein behavior and interactions at living synapses. This work extends our previous analysis of a temperature-sensitive (TS) paralytic NSF mutant, comatose, and extends previous models describing the spatial organization of SNAREs, NSF and SNAP proteins with respect to presynaptic active zones.\n\nSpecifically, biochemical analysis demonstrated for the first time that acute disruption of dNSF1 activity in comatose leads to accumulation of protein complexes containing dNSF1, dSNAP and SNAREs, suggesting that mutant dNSF1 is capable of associating in complexes with dSNAP and SNAREs, although its ability to disassemble them is impaired by the missense mutation located in the D1 domain. Moreover, dNSF1, dSNAP and t-SNAREs exhibit activity-dependent redistribution to Peri-Active Zone (PAZ) regions of the plasma membrane in comatose, suggesting the PAZ as the location where NSF-mediated disassembly of SNARE complexes would normally take place. Further, dSNAP exhibits a stable punctuate distribution pattern to the PAZ following its redistribution in comatose but is still mobile and can disassociate from the PAZ, suggesting dSNAP may bind and disassociate from dNSF1 and SNARE complexes independent of SNARE complex disassembly. Moreover, the apparent shift of this equilibrium towards dSNAP binding to the PAZ may reflect accumulation of dNSF1 and SNAREs, which leads to higher capacity of affinity for dSNAP binding at the PAZ. Unlike dSNAP, dNSF1 is fixed at the PAZ following its redistribution in comatose, suggesting that anchorage or immobilization of dNSF1 at the PAZ is mediated by synaptic components or signals other than the classic synaptic vesicle fusion apparatus (SNAREs and SNAP).\n\nLive imaging approaches developed and adapted in our laboratory, including in vivo Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) analysis, have been employed to monitor the behavior and interactions of synaptic proteins at living synapses. Particularly, efforts have been made to establish, optimize and compare two independent FRET methods within the model system. Notably, for the first time in any system, intermolecular FRET was observed between presynaptic proteins and defined activity-dependent protein interactions within living presynaptic boutons. Live imaging analysis has also generated other interesting insights with respect to in vivo orientation of proteins in assembly within complexes and assessments of protein mobility at native synapses. These imaging studies have provided important in vivo evidence from individual living presynaptic boutons which complements and extends previous biochemical analysis in developing molecular models of neurotransmitter release mechanisms. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6625], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Wenhua ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenhua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard W Ordway", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Richard W Ordway", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Aimin Liu", "Douglas Cavener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard W Ordway, Dissertation Advisor", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Chair", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Aimin Liu, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["synaptic function", "NSF", "SNAP", "SNAREs", "live imaging", "FRET", "Drosophila"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "migration, family types, children's education and work participation in Mexico: who leaves, who stays, and does it matter?", "id": "17497", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8591", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Labor migration and marital dissolution both contribute to family separation and, through separation, affect children's decisions about education and work.

Using the nationally representative 2005 Mexican Family Life Survey, I first compared children aged 15-18 who lived in non-migrant, two-parent households with children who experienced labor migration and children who lived in lone-parent households. Both children living in households of family separation are less likely to attend school, even though the results are not statistically significant when further controlling for socioeconomic status.

This modeling scheme serves as an important strategy for understanding the moisture redistribution processes across the watershed and river-basin landscape. For example, the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) has successfully been applied to explain the impacts of antecedent soil moisture on peak streamflow and timing. However, due to the heavy computational cost of solving integrated models with complex model structure, efficient parameter estimation for PIHM is a major computational and algorithmic challenge. The focus of this dissertation has four main themes: (1) develop an efficient calibration strategy for PIHM; (2) develop a weighted-objective calibration scheme for multi-variable distributed parameters (e.g., streamflow, water table depth, and eddy flux data); (3) test the parameter-estimation process for spatial shallow groundwater calibration of PIHM using national wetland geospatial data (National Wetland Inventory: NWI); (4) extend the capabilities of PIHM for linking vegetation dynamics from an ecosystem model and evaluating the importance of vegetation growth in water balance studies.\nThe temporal and geospatial complexity of the data requirements for integrated and fully coupled catchment models increases the difficulty of applying parameter optimization in real watershed applications. In this research, a new strategy known as partition calibration was proposed to enable the automatic calibration of PIHM. The concept can be thought of as a \u201cdivide-and-conquer algorithm,\u201d where the parameter space is divided into two or more sub-problems that can be solved sequentially. The first partition of the parameter vector is divided according to the two dominant time-scales of catchment hydrological processes: 1) event-scale hydrologic response parameters; and 2) seasonal-scale response parameters. Once divided, the event-scale group parameters and seasonal-scale group parameters are then calibrated sequentially. The second partition focused on the separation of the total calibration objective onto multiple targets to predict each observed hydrological variable. The \u201cinformativeness\u201d of each calibration target was defined in terms of a weighted objective function. Application of the scheme suggested the use of an informativeness-based partitioning of streamflow, groundwater, and ET parameters and demonstrated that partition calibration was superior to both single-objective calibration and un-weighted average multi-objective calibration.\nApplications of the PIHM were found to be efficient with the partition calibration strategy. The first PIHM application involves characterization of the freshwater wetland response to climate change at seven catchments within the Susquehanna River Basin. In this case, streamflow time series and geospatial mapping of wetlands in the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) were used to calibrate the model to capture the distributed groundwater and streamflow dynamics. After calibration, the model was applied to an IPCC climate change scenario (2046-2065), and the modeling results suggested that upland groundwater levels were more sensitive to climate change than water levels of wetlands in lower parts of the catchment, as expected. In the final part of this research, long-term modeling of PIHM compared the role of fixed seasonal variation in LAI (Leaf Area Index) and a fully dynamic vegetation growth model.  The community ecosystem model BIOME-BGC was linked to PIHM to test the hypothesis that default monthly LAI values are sufficient to represent long-term water balances in a catchment. By comparing model results for fixed LAI and dynamic LAI, it was demonstrated that fixed LAI is not sufficient for capturing interannual variability of forest vegetation and water flow dynamics, especially as it relates to the onset and growth of forest.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9362], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Xuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy", "Christopher J Duffy", "Murali Haran", "Xiaofeng Liu", "Jason Philip Kaye"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Chair", "Murali Haran, Committee Member", "Xiaofeng Liu, Committee Member", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Shale Hills", "CZO", "Susquehanna River Basin", "PIHM", "parameter", "calibration", "physics-based model", "wetland", "Biome-BGC"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A New Variable Screening Procedure for COX'S Model", "id": "23542", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10649", "abstract_tesi": "Survival data with ultrahigh dimensional covariates such as genetic markers have been collected in medical studies and other \ffields.

The proposed methodology is also demonstrated through an empirical analysis of a real data example.\n\nDue to the need of studying the theoretical property of variable selection procedure for Cox's model, we study the asymptotic behavior of partial likelihood for the Cox model in our second project. We find that the partial likelihood does not behave like an ordinary likelihood, whose sample average typically tends to its expected value, a finite number, in probability. Under some mild conditions, we prove that the sample average of partial likelihood tends to infinity at the rate of logarithm of the sample size in probability. This is an interesting and surprising results because the maximum partial likelihood estimate has the same asymptotical behavior as the ordinal maximum likelihood estimate. We further apply the asymptotic results on the partial likelihood to study tuning parameter selection for penalized partial likelihood. Our finding indicates that the penalized partial likelihood with the generalized cross-validation (GCV) tuning parameter proposed in Fan and Li (2002) enjoys the model selection consistency property. This is another surprising result because it is well known that the GCV, AIC and $C_p$ are all equivalent in the context for linear regression models, and are not model selection consistent.

It has been shown to significantly improve patients\u2019 quality of life with respect to physical function, pain relief, and overall health.\n    In recent years, unplanned readmission after THA has become an increasingly serious problem in the United States. Unplanned readmission significantly reduces the quality of life of THA patients. Moreover, in fiscal year 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) started to penalize hospitals for high 30-day readmission rates after THA surgery. Relevant studies indicated that readmission after THA surgery is deemed a healthcare quality indicator and that a considerable portion of 30-day unplanned readmission after THA can be effectively prevented. Therefore, it is necessary to mitigate the potential problems and improve THA care quality in order to reduce unplanned readmission. \n    Moreover, the demand for THA surgery is expected to increase from 326,100 in 2010 to 572,000 in 2030 in the United States. However, the available capacity of THA may be insufficient for such a massively increasing demand. In this landscape, effectively using THA surgery to optimize patient outcome becomes an important topic.\n    With the advancement in healthcare information technology, healthcare data has become exponentially available. Data science and engineering is needed in the healthcare ecosystem to support medical decision making, facilitate quality improvement initiatives, and improve patient outcomes. However, data science and engineering has not been adequately used in improving THA patient outcomes. The objective of this doctoral dissertation is threefold: 1) to advance data-driven healthcare for THA, 2) to provide insights into informed medical decision making, and 3) to support and guide efforts in THA care quality improvement.\n    Since 30-day unplanned readmission has become an increasingly serious problem and hospitals now bear the risk of CMS penalties, it is very important for hospitals to understand their THA surgical performance in real time. We obtained identified THA patient-level data records from an academic medical center in central Pennsylvania, United States. We proposed using machine learning algorithms to conduct patient risk stratification, and combining them with statistical process control to perform surgical outcome evaluation. The results indicate that random forest outperforms the most commonly-used risk-adjustment method, logistic regression, in identifying high-risk patients. Therefore, the control chart based on random forest provides more convincing results on surgical outcome evaluation. With our proposed risk-adjusted monitoring framework, the medical team can better target interventions on future high-risk patients, and diagnose potential care quality problems in a timely manner.\n    Due to the possible shortage of THA surgery in the next 15 years, it is important to take cost-effectiveness into account when determining the appropriate treatment option for each patient. We proposed a method for clustering hip arthritis patients and analyzing the cost-effectiveness of THA surgery for each patient subgroup. The results indicate that THA surgery is more cost-effective for relatively young patients with few co-morbidities, while it is not cost-effective for the oldest patient group in this study. With our proposed method, coupled with the characteristics of each patient subgroup, the medical team can better determine the optimal treatment option for each hip arthritis patient in order to improve patient outcomes.\n    Finally, when implementing medical or surgical interventions on THA patients, convincing evidence must show that a certain intervention really benefits the patients. The problem, however, is that relevant studies show mixed results on the effectiveness of a certain intervention. To address this issue, we used meta-analysis to deliver a valid and comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of an intervention and we analyzed pre-operative exercise as an example. The results indicate that while pre-operative exercise provides moderate benefits with respect to pain relief, physical function, and activity of daily living before surgery, these benefits diminish and become insignificant post-operatively. Therefore, our meta-analysis provides important insights into what medical or surgical interventions have proven effectiveness in improving THA care quality and patient outcomes, based on the mixed results of existing literature.\n    In conclusion, this data-driven approach to THA advances the translation of data science and engineering in healthcare, by using the increasingly available healthcare data to deliver insightful solutions. This approach can be used to facilitate efforts in THA care quality improvement, with the purpose of managing care quality and improving THA patient outcomes.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14734], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Yifeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yifeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet Nembhard", "Harriet Nembhard", "Conrad Tucker", "Ling Rothrock", "Naleef Fareed", "Andrea Yevchak-Sillner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harriet Nembhard, Dissertation Advisor", "Harriet Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Conrad Tucker, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Naleef Fareed, Outside Member", "Andrea Yevchak-Sillner, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["total hip arthroplasty", "risk-adjusted monitoring", "meta-analysis", "machine learning", "statistical process control", "cost-effectiveness", "Markov simulation model"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Hydrogen production catalyzed by earth-abundant metal complexes", "id": "18118", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8502", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The design of efficient electrocatalysts based on cheap first-row transition metals for the oxidation and production of H2 is important for the development of renewable energy sources.

A series of diimine-dioxime complexes, M(DO)(DOX)pn [(DO)(DOH)pn = N2,N2\u2032-propane-1,3-diylbis(2,3-butanedione-2-imine-3-oxime), (M=Fe, Co, Ni)] and dimethylglyoxime complexes, M(dmg2X1-X2) with proton- or BF2-bridging units X, are studied in acetonitrile and water solvents. Density functional theory is used to calculate MII/I reduction potentials and relative pKa values for ligand protonation. The calculated relative pKa\u2019s allow us to determine the likelihood of protonation and imply that O-H-O bridges but not O-BF2-O bridges can become protonated. The calculated MII/I reduction potentials indicate that the anodic shift due to ligand protonation is greater than the anodic shift due to the replacement of the O-H-O bridge with the O-BF2-O bridge for cobalt and nickel, but not for iron complexes. Even though the cobalt complex with two O-H-O bridges has the most positive MII/I reduction potentials, it would degrade based on experimental data. The overpotential required for H2 evolution often relates to the MII/I reduction potential for these types of electrocatalysts. Therefore, the prediction from this study shows that asymmetric cobalt, nickel, and iron complexes with strongly electron- withdrawing substituents containing only one O-H-O bridge are effective H2 evolution electrocatalysts with relative low overpotential in acetonitrile and water.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8400], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Yinxi ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yinxi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sharon Hammes Schiffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sharon Hammes Schiffer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogen production", "catalyst", "cobalt", "nickel", "iron"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "OVERREACTION OR UNDERREACTION? \nA REEXAMINATION OF THE ACCRUAL ANOMALY \n", "id": "7156", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6803", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study reexamines the evidence underlying the prior conclusion that investors overreact to accruals \u2013 accruals are negatively associated with subsequent abnormal returns (i.e., the \u201caccrual anomaly\u201d).

Dairy processing equipment is commonly cleaned using a four-step clean-in-place (CIP) procedure: rinse with water, wash with an alkaline solution, rinse with water again to remove alkaline residue, and then rinse with an acid sanitizer.   The chemicals used in CIP procedures of dairy processing equipment are usually handled and stored in concentrated forms, and may have adverse effects on the environment, and can cause skin or eye burns on contact.  Electrolyzed water is produced via electrolysis of a dilute sodium chloride solution, which results in a sodium hydroxide solution, called electrolyzed reducing (ER) water (pH ca. 11.0 and ORP ca. -850 mV), and an acidic solution, called electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water (pH ca. 2.5, ORP ca. 1168 mV and 80-100 ppm of chlorine).  Thus, electrolyzed water has the potential to serve as an alternative to CIP chemicals.  The antimicrobial efficacy of acid EO water has been demonstrated.  The efficacy of electrolyzed water used as cleaning and disinfecting agent for on-farm milking systems also has been demonstrated.  The use of acid EO water in CIP applications for dairy processing systems, especially those involving heat treatment of milk has not been evaluated.\nThe purpose of this research was to investigate the efficacy of electrolyzed water for CIP procedure of dairy processing equipment, specifically a refrigerated milk storage tank and a tank used for thermal processing of milk.  In this work, a pilot scale test system composed of a 15 liter (4 gallon) stainless steel test vessel was constructed and characterized to allow evaluation and optimization of electrolyzed water as CIP agent for dairy processing equipment.  Use of the test system was validated by pilot trials of CIP cleaning with conventional CIP detergent and sanitizer.  Using the same CIP procedure, electrolyzed water was successfully employed to clean the test vessel after soiling with milk at refrigerated temperatures (2-4\u00b0C).  The effectiveness of cleaning was assessed using a microbiological enrichment method, as well as ATP bioluminescence and residual protein detection assays.  Finally, use electrolyzed water for CIP procedures of the test vessel soiled by heating milk was evaluated using a response surface model to optimize temperatures and times for both alkaline ER water and acid EO water treatments.  Parameters for 4-step CIP procedures using electrolyzed water were: wash with alkaline ER water at 54.6\u00b0C for 20.5 min and sanitize with acid EO water at 25\u00b0C for 10 min.  The validation study demonstrated that a complete CIP procedure using electrolyzed water with optimal operational temperatures and time was capable of returning the surface of the test vessel to a satisfactory clean condition with non-detectable residual ATP and protein.  The study demonstrated the cleaning efficacy and potential application of using electrolyzed water for CIP procedures in dairy plant.  In contrast to conventional CIP chemicals that are usually prepared by diluting of concentrated chemicals, electrolyzed water has the advantage of on-site generation, dairy processing plants, especially small dairy foods manufactures, could benefit by reducing the risk and cost of storing and handling of concentrated CIP chemicals.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9644], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Yun ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yun", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert F Roberts"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert F Roberts, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["clean-in-place", "electrolyzed water", "dairy processing equipment"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONAL STUDIES OF HETEROTRIMERIC G PROTEIN BETA SUBUNIT, AGB1, IN SALINITY AND GUARD CELL RESPONSES", "id": "13397yxy151", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13397", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Heterotrimeric G-proteins are composed of G\u03b1, G\u03b2 and G\u03b3 subunits.

Other Na+/H+ antiporters and CBLs such as NHX1 and CBL10 are also involved in Na+ transport regulation. \nIn chapter 1, I review literature of Arabidopsis G proteins, plant salinity, and a receptor-like kinase (FERONIA), which is found in AGB1 associated proteins. \nIn Chapter 2, I showed that the knockout mutant of the agb1 is hypersensitive to salt, exhibiting a leaf bleaching phenotype. I showed that the hypersensitivity to salt tress in agb1 is due to the ionic toxicity component of salinity stress. agb1 mutants accumulate more Na+ and less K+ in both shoots and roots of hydroponically grown plants, as measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). agb1 plants have higher root to shoot translocation rates of radiolabelled 24Na+ under transpiring conditions, as a result of larger stomatal apertures and increased stomatal conductance. 24Na+ tracer experiments also show that 24Na+ uptake rates by excised roots of agb1 and wild-type are initially equal, but that agb1 has higher net Na+ uptake at 90 min, implicating possible involvement of AGB1 in regulation of Na+ efflux. Calcium alleviates the salt hypersensitivity of agb1 by reducing Na+ accumulation to below the toxicity threshold. My results provide an example of G proteins playing multiple roles in different tissues in stress tolerance. \nIn Chapter 3, to elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, I performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and mass spectrometry to identify the interactors of AGB1. Plasma membrane protein-enriched fractions obtained using the two-phase partitioning method were used for the co-IP assays. I performed co-IP using transgenic Arabidopsis expressing 35S::FLAG-AGB1 in the agb1-2 background and using wild-type Col plants as a control. After eliminating proteins present in the control IP, commonly identified contaminants, and organellar proteins, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated proteins were confidently identified. As expected, proteins with the highest frequency of occurrence in replicate experiments were G protein subunits. All of the G\u03b3 subunits (AGG1, AGG2 and AGG3), and most of the G\u03b1 subunits (GPA1, XLG2 and XLG3) were identified. I also found receptor-like kinases, Ca2+ signaling related proteins including Calmodulin 2, Annexin D4, and IQ-domain 31 protein, and 14-3-3-like proteins, which may couple with G protein signaling.\nIn recent years, there is increasing evidence that receptor-like kinases may couple G protein signaling. I found a receptor-like kinase, FERONIA (FER), in the AGB1 associated proteins, and confirmed the direct interaction between FER and AGB1 in BiFC assays. I also showed that FER does not interact with the G\u03b1 subunits (GPA1, XLG1, XLG2 and XLG3) in BiFC. Interestingly, FER has been shown to be involved in various responses, just as are G proteins. FER play roles in pollen tube reception, immunity response, mechanical sensing, and hormone regulation including ABA, auxin, ethylene and brassinosteroid. In order to study the genetic relationship between AGB1 and FER, wild-type, agb1, fer and the double mutant of agb1 fer were subjected to different physiological treatments. I found that both agb1 and fer have shorter hypocotyls and are hypersensitive to ABA inhibition of root growth, and that AGB1 and FER act synergistically in hypocotyl elongation and ABA caused leaf chlorosis and root growth inhibition at the seedling stage. However, in guard cell responses, FER is epistatic to AGB1 in ABA and RALF1 (Rapid Alkalinization Factor 1) regulation of stomatal movement. Specifically, agb1 is hyposensitive to ABA inhibition of stomatal opening and displays wild-type response to ABA promotion of stomatal closure. fer is hypersensitive to both ABA effects, and the agb1 fer double mutant resembles fer single mutants in both ABA responses. RALF1 acts as a ligand of FER that induces phosphorylation of FER and other proteins, alkalinizes the apoplast and inhibits cell expansion. I showed that RALF1 inhibits stomatal opening and promotes stomatal closure in wild-type plants. agb1 is hyposensitive to RALF1, and fer and agb1 fer are insensitive to RALF1 in both opening and closure responses. Furthermore, a null mutant of a central protein kinase in ABA signaling, SnRK2.6/OST1, is hyposensitive to RALF1 inhibition of stomatal opening, but shows wild-type response to RALF1 promotion of stomatal closure, suggesting cross-talk between RALF and ABA signaling. Unpublished results from the lab showed direct interaction between AGB1 and ABI1, which is a type A protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) that interacts with and deactivates OST1. In summary, the research demonstrates a complex genetic relationship between G proteins and FER, and shows that AGB1 is involved in RALF1 effect in guard cells, possibly through the interaction with FER and ABA signaling effectors. \nIn Chapter 4, I investigated the genetic relationship between AGB1 and FER in salinity tolerance, and the RALF1 effect on salt toxicity. Both agb1 and fer are hypersensitive to salt stress, and the kinase activity of FER is not required for salt tolerance. The agb1 fer double mutant shows salt hypersensitivity which is greater than the additive effect of agb1 and fer single mutants, suggesting synergism between AGB1 and FER. fer accumulated comparable amounts of Na+ as Col when grown hydroponically, although fer still showed hypersensitivity to NaCl treatment, suggesting that other mechanisms also contribute to the salt hypersensitivity of fer.  I then found that both agb1 and fer overaccumulate ROS in the shoot after 24 h of salt treatment, and both are impaired in salt-induced ROS production in the root after 15 min of salt treatment. And again, the double mutant show synergistic ROS imbalance in both shoot and root. These results suggest that the synergism between AGB1 and FER may occur through salt-induced ROS production. I further showed that RALF1 enhances salt toxicity via increasing Na+ accumulation, and that the kinase activity of FER is required for RALF1 inhibition of root growth, but not for RALF1 enhancement of salt toxicity. agb1 was slightly hyposensitive to RALF1 inhibition of root growth, but showed wild-type response to RALF1 effect on salt toxicity, suggesting that AGB1 may be partially involved in RALF1 effect in seedlings. In summary, this study shows that apart from the epistasis between AGB1 and RALF1 in guard cells, AGB1 does not directly function in FER signaling in salinity response. \nFinally, in chapter 5, I discussed the roles of G proteins in salinity response and the genetic interactions between G proteins and FER.

However, the current existing anode materials are still not satisfying for the practical application due to their low specific capacity or limited cycling life. Therefore, Chapter 3 and 4 focuses on development of phosphorus-based anode material for NIBs. In Chapter 3, phosphorus-graphene nanosheet (P/G) hybrid is synthesized by ball-mill method and show extremely high specific discharge capacity of 2077 mAhg-1 for the initial cycle as well as capacity retention of 95% relative to the second cycle after 60 cycles. Taking the facile and general method as well as the low cost starting materials into account, this promising P/G hybrid nanostructured anode has a great potential for practical application in high performance NIB. In Chapter 4, two phosphorus-carbon composites, P@carbon nanotube (P@CNT) and P@porous carbon, are developed. Nano-sized phosphorus particles have been deposited on the surface of two carbon hosts through well-controlled vaporization-deposition-conversion method. By confining P inside micropores of carbon host, P@porous carbon composite exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 1705 mAhg-1p (~ 852 mAhg-1composite) and superior capacity retention of 92% after 100 cycles and 46% after 1000 cycles, which is much better than that for P@CNT composite. \nAll the above mentioned work have been done by using organic liquid electrolyte. It is well known that severe safety issues exist in NIBs because of extremely high reactivity of sodium metal in volatile and flammable organic liquid electrolyte.

Improving the reliability of a transit system can have numerous potential benefits: increased transit ridership, decreased congestion (which further improves transit reliability), and decreased emissions. \nWith Automated Vehicle Location (AVL) and Automated Passenger Counter (APC) units becoming common on transit vehicles, some transit agencies have begun to provide real-time vehicle location and occupancy information as a means to improve perceived reliability from a user\u2019s perspective. However, what users need is more than real-time information. They need accurate predictions of how the system will evolve to better plan their trips. So far, the research of vehicle-level passenger occupancy prediction is missing and all current travel time prediction models overlook the variance of travel times and thus can provide a false sense of precision. \nThis paper aims at establishing regression models to predict passenger occupancies and travel times as well as the uncertainties associated with the predictions. To do this, linear models and survival models were applied in travel time modeling; linear models, count models, and quantile models were applied in passenger occupancy modeling. The impacts of several operational and weather variables were examined and transferability tests validated the models\u2019 predictive power across semesters. \nIn travel time models, only one stop pair along the bus route was picked due to some data issues.

Ovarian hormones estradiol and progesterone can modulate food intake and have shown possible effects on binge eating in both humans and animals. In addition, binge eating shares behavioral and neurobiological similarities with substance abuse.  Although estradiol generally inhibits food intake, it has been reported to increase the sensitivity of females to the rewarding effects of substances of abuse and promote the development of drug addiction in females. Those who binge may exhibit features of both homeostatic eating during non-binge times and hedonic addictive-like eating during binge times. Therefore, a series of studies was conducted to investigate the effects of ovarian hormones on ingestive behavior and neurological correlates of eating in rats maintained on a binge-eating protocol.\n  \nStudy one investigated the effects of the ovarian hormones estradiol and progesterone on food intake and body weight in binge rats. Three groups of hormone-treated ovariectomized (OVX) rats and three groups of oil vehicle rats were used. Within each hormone treatment condition, rats were divided into three feeding schedules: chow, low-restriction access to shortening (daily), and high-restriction access to shortening (binge). All of the rats were non-food-deprived throughout. The main finding was that binge size during the 1-h binge access period was tonically, but not cyclically, reduced in hormone-treated binge rats.  In contrast, daily total food intake was both tonically and cyclically reduced in hormone-treated binge rats. The results indicate that the normal cyclic inhibitory influence of ovarian hormones on eating, but not their normal tonic inhibitory influence, is disrupted by conditions leading to binge-type eating.\n\nStudy two investigated the individual roles of estradiol and progesterone on food intake and body weight in binge rats.  Two groups of estradiol-treated rats, two groups of estradiol and progesterone co-treated rats, two groups of progesterone-treated rats, and one group of oil vehicle rats were used. Within each hormone treatment condition, rats were divided into two feeding schedules: chow, and high-restriction (binge). Oil vehicle rats only had chow access. The main findings were that binge size was not different among the three hormone-treated groups (E, EP, and P) and was not cyclically reduced in any of the groups.  In contrast, daily total food intake was both tonically and cyclically reduced in E and EP rats but not in P and OIL rats. The results indicate that administration of E alone has the same effect as co-administration of E and P on feeding and body weight in binge rats. Progesterone alone had no effect on feeding and body weight in binge rats. \n\nStudy three investigated the effects of estradiol and progesterone on the inhibitory effect of the GABA-B agonist baclofen on binge fat intake. The first experiment of this study included the same six groups that were used in study one. Five doses of baclofen (0, 0.6, 1.0, 1.8, 3.2 mg/kg) were administrated to each rat. The main finding was that baclofen reduced fat intake percentage change at 3.2 mg/kg in EP-treated binge rats and at 1.8 and 3.2 mg/kg in Oil-treated binge rats, indicating that baclofen was less effective in the EP-treated binge rats. The second experiment included the same six groups that were used in study two (no oil group).  Four doses of baclofen (0, 1.0, 1.8, 3.2 mg/kg) were administrated to each rat. The main findings were that baclofen reduced fat intake at 1.0, 1.8 and 3.2 mg/kg in EP binge rats, but only at 3.2 mg/kg in P binge rats and was without effect in E binge rats. These results indicate that baclofen was even less effective in the rats treated with E-alone or P-alone. Taken together, the inhibitory effect of baclofen on binge fat intake was influenced by hormones in this way: OIL &#8805; EP > P > E.\n\nStudy four investigated the neural correlates of eating behavior in binge rats and the influences of estradiol and meal size by using c-Fos expression, a marker of stimulus-induced neural activation. The first experiment of this study included two groups of estradiol-treated rats (E2), another two groups of estradiol-treated rats (E4), and two groups of oil vehicle rats (O). Within each hormone treatment condition, rats were divided into chow, and high-restriction (binge) groups. After 6-weeks of binge training, rats had 50-min access to shortening and were perfused 30 min after the end of access. E2 and E4 rats were perfused on the day 2 and day 4 of hormone treatment cycles respectively. Brain tissues were collected and processed for c-Fos-like immunoreactivity (c-Fos-LI). Several findings are reported. First, there was more activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (Cg 1) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in BO than in CO and less activation in VTA, basolateral amygdala, arcuate and lateral hypothalamus in BE2 than CE2. These results indicate that a history of repeated binge behavior promotes the activation of reward-related neural circuitry and this activation appears to be subject to the modulation of estradiol. The second experiment included three groups of estradiol-treated rats and three groups of oil vehicle rats. All rats were binge rats in this experiment. Within each hormone treatment condition, rats were given 50-min access to 0g, 1g, or 3g shortening on the last day and then were perfused. Brain tissues were processed for c-Fos-LI.   The main findings include that there were main effects of meal size in CeA, VTA and midNTS but only meal size-dependant effects in the VTA of oil-treated binge rats. There were no hormone treatment effects on c-Fos response in any brain area.  The relatively small amount of food provided on the last day, as well as the perfusion of rats on day 4 of the treatment cycle may account for the negative effects. \n\nThe results of the present studies indicate that ovarian hormones, especially estradiol, may contribute to increased meal size during a binge and may reduce the therapeutic effect of baclofen.  These effects may be due to effects of estradiol on reward-related dopaminergic mesocorticolimibic circuitry. The results of the present research provide a preliminary understanding of the effects of estradiol on eating behavior and the neurobiology of binge eating in females, and may help explain the contribution of estradiol to binge vulnerability in females. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6982], "author_name_tesi": "Yu, Zhiping ", "last_name_ssi": "Yu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhiping", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rebecca L Corwin", "Rebecca L Corwin", "Barbara Jean Rolls", "Byron C Jones", "Erica Unger", "Nori Geary"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rebecca L Corwin, Dissertation Advisor", "Rebecca L Corwin, Committee Chair", "Barbara Jean Rolls, Committee Member", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member", "Erica Unger, Committee Member", "Nori Geary, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["binge eating", "estradiol", "progesterone", "rat"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Cooperative Lane Changing System", "id": "22419", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9798", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This paper proposes an improved automatic driving system for lane changing maneuver.

Chemical molecules, proteins, malware system-call dependencies and three-dimensional mechanical parts are all modeled as graphs. In this dissertation, we propose to mine and index those graph data to enable fast and scalable search.\nThere are two common search scenarios: subgraph search and supergraph search. In a subgraph search, given a query graph q, the algorithm searches for all graphs that have q as a subgraph, from a graph database. A supergraph search, on the other hand, retrieves all the database graphs that have q as a supergraph. Determining whether a graph is a subgraph (or supergraph) of another is an NP- complete problem. Hence, it is challenging to efficiently process graph queries on large databases. Graph indices are commonly built to fast process graph queries. Subgraph patterns are mined from the graph database to build such graph indices. It has been shown that both the index structure of the graph indices and the subgraph patterns that are selected for indexing determine the time of processing graph queries. We address the graph search problem by designing innovative index structures and proposing new subgraph pattern mining algorithms.\nFirst, we propose an index structure, Lindex, which organizes subgraph pat- terns in a lattice. As a novel index structure, Lindex (1) is effective in filtering false graphs, (2) provides fast index lookups, (3) is fast with respect to index construc- tion and maintenance, and (4) can be constructed using any set of substructure index patterns. These four properties result in a fast and scalable graph-querying infrastructure. Lindex is compatible with any choice of patterns. Empirically, we demonstrate that Lindex used in conjunction with subgraph patterns proposed in previous works outperforms other specifically designed index structures.\nSecond, we address the pattern mining problem by modeling it as a combinatory optimization problem. Instead of mining subgraph patterns based on heuristics as in previous works, we proposed a greedy algorithm, which mines index patterns that minimize the query-processing time with theoretical guarantee. Specifically for the supergraph search, previous algorithms are proposed to optimize either a filtering gain or a prefix-sharing gain. No single subgraph-mining algorithm considers both gains, although these two gains jointly model the savings of the query-processing time. We are the first one to mine subgraph patterns to optimize both the filtering gain and the prefix-sharing gain.\nFinally, we study the update of graph indices. All previous algorithms are mine- at-once algorithms in which the whole set of index patterns is mined in one run before building a graph index. Because of the change of environments, such as an update of the graph database and the increase of available memory, the index needs to be updated to accommodate such changes. Most of the mine-at-once algorithms are time-consuming because they involve frequent subgraph or subtree mining over the whole graph database. Also, constructing and deploying a new index involves expensive disk operations. Hence, it is inefficient to re-mine the patterns and rebuild the index from scratch. We propose an iterative mining algorithm and a one-pass mining algorithm to address the index-update problem. Both algorithms replace an old index pattern p\u2032 with a newly selected subgraph pattern p until the decrease of the query-processing time caused by the swap is lower than a threshold. The iterative mining algorithm always mines the new subgraph pattern p that maximizes the decrease of the query-processing time. And it can achieve an approximation ratio of 1\u22121/e. The one-pass mining algorithm, on the other hand, can choose any pattern p that meets a criterion f(p,p\u2032) > 0, where the function f(\u00b7) measures the advantage of indexing p over p\u2032. The one-pass mining algorithm have an approximation ratio of 1/4 with faster running-time than iterative mining.\nWe conduct extensive empirical studies to study the performance of our pro- posed algorithms. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms by showing their improvement over the state-of-the-art approaches over existing benchmark datasets.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9001], "author_name_tesi": "Yuan, Dayu ", "last_name_ssi": "Yuan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dayu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prasenjit Mitra", "Prasenjit Mitra", "C Lee Giles", "Daniel Kifer", "Zhenhui Li", "Jesse Louis Barlow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prasenjit Mitra, Dissertation Advisor", "Prasenjit Mitra, Committee Chair", "C Lee Giles, Committee Chair", "Daniel Kifer, Committee Member", "Zhenhui Li, Committee Member", "Jesse Louis Barlow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["data mining", "graph database", "query processing", "index structure", "information retrieval"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A SOLVENT-FREE COARSE-GRAINED MODEL FOR BIOLOGICAL AND \nBIOMIMETIC FLUID MEMBRANES", "id": "11093", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2313", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mechanics of biological membranes is involved in numerous intriguing biophysical and biological cellular phenomena of different length scales.  On the length scale much larger than the membrane thickness, fluid bilayer membranes or biomimetic membranes, from the mechanics viewpoint, can be simplified as \u201cthin fluid shells\u201d with their mechanical behaviors dictated by only a few effective mechanical properties such as bilayer membrane bending rigidity, area compression modulus, in-plane viscosity, line tension between two different components, and spontaneous curvature. Solving mechanics problems of the fluid membranes with complicated shapes or multi-components in static or dynamic conditions largely resorts to computer simulations. There are two approaches to establish a simulation model for fluid membranes at the large length scale. One is the numerical implementations of the continuum membrane models. The other is the highly coarse-grained inter-particle interaction-based membrane simulation models. One of the drawbacks of the former class of models is that extra or dedicated computational effort is needed to take into account the in-plane fluidity and topological changes. Conversely, the latter class of models can naturally capture the in-plane fluidity and viscosity, and simulate topological changes.  On the other hand, the disadvantage of the inter-particle interaction-based models is that they suffer length scale limitations due to the small intrinsic particle size, which is not the case for the former class of models. \n\nIn this study, we established a one-particle-thick fluid membrane model, where each particle represents a cluster of lipid molecules.  The model features an inter-particle pair potential with the interaction strength weighed by the relative particle orientations.  The model is solvent-free, and the orientation dependence of the inter-particle pair potential substitutes for the hydrophobic effect.  Particles can robustly self-assemble into fluid membranes with experimentally relevant membrane properties such as bending rigidity.  Three potential parameters separately and effectively control diffusivity, bending rigidity, and spontaneous curvature of the model membrane.  The high level of coarse-graining and the efficiency of the model enable the studies of large-scale membrane problems that are typically not accessible by previous coarse-grained models. \n\nThis model is well suited to study the mechanics of both homogeneous and heterogeneous fluid vesicles, such as morphology and shape changes in static or dynamic situations.  In order for this solvent-free membrane model to be biologically or experimentally relevant in the fluid vesicle case where the vesicle volume is controlled by the osmotic pressure, the membrane model is extended to the fluid vesicle case by incorporating a volume-control algorithm based on an external potential associated with vesicle volume.  The instantaneous volume of the vesicles is calculated via an efficient, accurate and robust local triangulation algorithm.  The shape transformation pathways produced by the present model agree strikingly well with previous experimental data. Furthermore, we have studied very first the non-equilibrium behaviors of fluid vesicles under different volume-change rate. The results show that both the intermediate and equilibrium vesicle configurations depend on the volume-change rate, which manifests the viscous effect of the fluid membrane.\n\nRecently, the membrane-mediated repulsive interactions between liquid-ordered domains in model membranes are believed to play important role in stabilizing the finite domain size. Using the membrane model, we studied the domain growth dynamics on a binary fluid vesicle. The both normal and slow domain growth dynamics observed in the experiments was reproduced in our simulations.  The results show that the repulsive interactions depend on domain size and domain curvature.  As budded domains grow bigger, the repulsive energy becomes comparable to the thermal energy and thus set an energy barrier to slow down approaching and further coalescence of domains.\n\nThe membrane model developed in this thesis research is mathematically and physically easy to follow, of the highest level of coarse-graining with the inter-particle interaction, and naturally includes the various key mechanics elements of fluid membranes such as in-plane fluidity and viscosity, out-of-plane bending rigidity, line tension, edge energy, topological changes, effective spontaneous curvature, thermal fluctuations. The model provides a computationally reliable and powerful alternative to experiments and continuum theories for the study of large-scale fluid membrane mechanics.

Moisture migration occurs in chocolate coated products with water-based filling. Moisture migration through fractionated palm kernel oil (PKO) based films under vapor-induced and liquid-induced conditions was investigated through measurement of unsteady-state diffusivity, steady-state permeability, and characterization of structure.\n\tWater sorption isotherms were determined at 25oC for sucrose, lecithin, cellulose, PKO, and fat-based coatings (PKO+lecithin, PKO+sucrose, PKO+cellulose, PKO+sucrose+lecithin, PKO+cellulose+lecithin) using a gravimetric method in a water activity range of 0.112-0.974.  Sucrose adsorbed much less moisture than lecithin and cellulose at water activities below its deliquescent point (0.85), but showed a sharp increase in water sorption capacity at higher water activities with phase change from crystalline to dissolved sucrose. Addition of lecithin, sucrose, or cellulose increased water sorption capacity of fat-based coatings. The two-parameter Lewicki and Oswin models were found to be suitable for describing the sorption isotherms of lecithin and cellulose in the entire water activity range. None of the models in the literature so far has been found to be able to describe the sorption isotherm of sucrose accurately in a water activity range of 0.112 \u2013 0.974. Additivity principle was used to predict sorption isotherms of fat-based coatings containing sucrose and cellulose on the basis of the sorption isotherm of pure components. The predicted sorption isotherm of PKO/lecithin coatings underestimated the moisture content of the mixture in comparison with experimental values, probably due to the formation of lecithin reverse micelles.\n\tAt a water activity gradient of 1.0 (aw1=0.0; aw2=1.0) across fat-based films, addition of sucrose, cellulose, and lecithin significantly reduced the unsteady-state diffusivity but increased the steady-state permeability under both vapor-induced and liquid-induced conditions. For fat-based films containing sucrose, the unsteady-state diffusivity (P=0.001) and permeability (P=0.00) were significantly higher under liquid-induced condition than those under vapor-induced condition at a water activity gradient of 1.0 (aw1=0.0; aw2=1.0). The absolute relative humidity on the high relative humidity side of the fat-based film had a significant effect (P=0.00) on the diffusivity and permeability of the fat-based films containing sucrose. No significant difference (P=0.63) between vapor-induced and liquid-induced conditions was observed in unsteady-state diffusivity and steady-state permeability at the water activity gradient of 0.8 (aw1=0.0; aw2=0.8). In the presence of moisture in fat-based films, permeability of the fat-based film increased (P=0.00), indicating that moisture migration occurred preferentially through the liquid phase. Moisture absorption by sucrose significantly (P=0.00) reduced the storage modulus of fat-based films at water activities higher than 0.85.\n\tFor pure PKO films, sucrose concentration of the aqueous phase (Diffusivity: P=0.98; permeability: 0.93) and presence of sugar ester (Diffusivity: P=0.76; permeability: P=0.12) in the aqueous phase had no effect on the diffusivity and permeability. For fat-based films containing sucrose, the unsteady-state diffusivity increased and the steady state permeability decreased (P=0.00) with increasing sucrose concentration of the aqueous phase. Addition of sugar ester in the aqueous phase increased the permeability of the fat-based films containing sucrose (P=0.00). During liquid-induced moisture migration, sucrose leached out from the fat-based films into the aqueous phase. The mass transfer coefficient at the surface of the fat-based films increased with sucrose content in the fat-based films (P=0.00). The diffusivity of sucrose within the fat films was found to increase with sucrose content in the fat films (P=0.00). The moisture diffusivity in liquid-induced moisture migration was also measured using a continuous weighing technique and compared with the time-lag method. The continuous weighing method gave a higher diffusivity than the time-lag method.\n\tThis research provides some guidelines for product development of chocolate products with water-based fillings or chocolate flavored ice-cream coatings in terms of formula development, sweetener selection, and shelf-life prediction. Bi-layer formulation of chocolate is recommended to retard moisture migration. Sweeteners in fat-based films or coatings should have a deliquescent point higher than that of water-based filling because moisture migrates mainly through liquid phase. Permeability data obtained under liquid-induced moisture migration should be used to predict the shelf life when the chocolate shell or coating has water soluble components. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5059], "author_name_tesi": "Yuan, Qingbin ", "last_name_ssi": "Yuan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qingbin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "William Hanselmann", "Gregory Ray Ziegler", "John L Duda", "Devin G Peterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Committee Chair", "William Hanselmann, Committee Chair", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Committee Member", "John L Duda, Committee Member", "Devin G Peterson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["moisture migration", "fat-based system"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Cooling Energy Saving Performance of Exterior Greenery System on Department of Energy Reference Buildings", "id": "14085sfy5058", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14085", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Exterior greenery system such as green roof and green wall can provide energy and environmental benefits to buildings.

Some of these problems, such as occupational injuries, quality of structure, and speed of construction project are affected by temporary structures (i.e. scaffolding, temporary support system, and formwork system). In many cases, these temporary structures are regarded as static structures without appropriate monitoring of temporal changes in their stability. To be specific, it is estimated that three quarters of the construction workers in the United States work on or near temporary structures. The improper management of temporary structures results in 100 deaths, 4500 injuries, and costs $90 million every year. While significant deployments are being made in the structural health monitoring of constructed facilities, such as bridges, dams and other civil infrastructure, inadequate attention has been paid to temporary structures. \n\nDevelopments in information and communications technologies, notably the advent of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), are changing the way in which structures are monitored. With the bidirectional coordination possible between physical artefacts and their virtual representations, CPS offers an approach that can facilitate the monitoring and active control of temporary structures in such a way as to prevent structural failures and safety hazards on the job site. This research focused on the development and validation of a Cyber-Physical Systems approach to safety monitoring of the temporary structures widely used on the construction job site. The objectives of the research include investigating CPS implementation in construction industry, assessing CPS applicability to temporary structures, reviewing safety regulations of temporary structures, developing a CPS-based prototype system for temporary structures monitoring, and evaluating the performance of the prototype CPS system.\n\nIn order to conduct the research, several research methods were utilized, including literature reviews, rapid prototyping, laboratory experiments, and an evaluation workshop. In particular, research problems were clarified through literature review. In reviewing the key features of CPS, enabling technologies and current applications in various industries were summarized to identify the opportunities for CPS use in tackling important problems in the construction industry. To establish the applicability of CPS in temporary structures, the safety issues of temporary structures were investigated to identify the failure patterns of some commonly used temporary structures. The potential benefits and barriers of CPS application to temporary structures were also explored. Based on the CPS applicability analysis, a CPS prototype system for temporary structures monitoring was designed and developed by linking the virtual model (based on the Navisworks Management platform) and the physical structures. This prototype system was tested through laboratory experiments under 5 failure scenarios and evaluated for performance by industry experts.\n\nThe evaluation of the developed CPS prototype system involved key industry experts and confirmed that CPS offers an effective approach to advanced monitoring of temporary structures; the developed CPS prototype system works effectively in the monitoring of temporary structures; and there are a number of benefits and barriers associated with CPS application to temporary structures. In addition to the safety monitoring of scaffolding systems, which was demonstrated as an example of temporary structures, various potential application areas have been identified for CPS application to temporary structures monitoring. While the proposed TSM method has provided an example of how to closely integrate the virtual model and the physical components of temporary structures for structural monitoring, more applications and extensible benefits can be realized based on it. \n\nIn general, this research explored and validated CPS application for the monitoring of temporary structures. It identified CPS benefits and applicability to the area of temporary structures monitoring, developed a CPS prototype for the monitoring of temporary structures, conducted experimental tests to check and refine the prototype system, and conducted workshop evaluation of the prototype system for performance analysis. By taking advantage of CPS, this research provides a new approach to assisting safety superintendents in the monitoring of temporary structures through bi-directional communication between physical structures and their virtual models. This research has contributed to a deeper understanding of the potential of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to address critical problems in the construction industry, using temporary structures monitoring as an effective example application.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13419], "author_name_tesi": "Yuan, Xiao ", "last_name_ssi": "Yuan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chimay J.

The postsynaptic clustering of these receptors is critical for the efficacy of synaptic transmission. Moreover, trafficking and targeting of GABAARs to the postsynaptic membrane is highly regulated, and this mechanism is thought to contribute to functional plasticity of GABAergic synapses. \n\nThe \u0192\u00d72 subunit contributes to the majority of GABAAR subtypes and is essential for clustering of GABAARs at postsynaptic sites, for recruitment of the submembrane scaffold protein gephyrin to postsynaptic sites, and for postsynaptic function of GABAergic synapses. Targeted deletion of the \u0192\u00d72 subunit gene leads to loss of major postsynaptic GABAAR subtypes in vivo (Essrich et al., 1998; Schweizer et al., 2003). And the fourth transmembrane region (TM4) of the \u0192\u00d72 subunit is thought to play an important role in this mechanism (Alldred et al., 2005). \n\nTo elucidate the mechanism by which the \u0192\u00d72 subunit contributes to trafficking of GABAARs, a yeast two hybrid screen was performed to identify novel proteins that interact with the TM4 and cytoplasmic region of the \u0192\u00d72 subunit. As part of my Ph. D. thesis I here report the isolation of calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) as a novel GABAA receptor-interacting protein. CAML is an integral membrane protein first identified as endogenous ligand for cyclophilin B, the receptor of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (Bram and Crabtree, 1994) and subsequently shown to be essential for the endocytic recycling of internalized epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) to the plasma membrane (Tran et al., 2003). Using yeast two-hybrid tests the \u0192\u00d72 subunit-interaction domain has been mapped to the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CAML. Conversely, both the 3\u00a1\u00a6 half of the major cytoplasmic loop domain and the TM4 domain of the \u0192\u00d72 subunit were required for interaction with CAML. This novel interaction between CAML and the \u0192\u00d72 subunit was verified by colocalization assays and immunoprecipitations in heterologous cells, by colocalization of transfected and endogenous proteins in neurons and by co-immunoprecipitation of native proteins from brain extracts. \n\nThe role of CAML in trafficking and clustering of postsynaptic GABAAR subtypes was analyzed by disrupting the function of CAML through RNA interference (RNAi) in cultured neurons and by conditional knock-out of a floxed CAML gene in cultured neurons and mice. Following knockdown of CAML by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) based RNAi, postsynaptic clusters of GABAARs were decreased concurrent with a similar reduction in immunoreactivity representing GABAergic presynaptic terminals. Inactivation of the CAML gene in mouse embryos (Emx1Cre x CAMLf/-) resulted in neonatal lethality and neurons cultured from corresponding embryos died in vitro. Postnatal deletion of CAML in CaMKIICre2834 x CAMLf/- mice resulted in loss of \u0192\u00d72 subunit-containing GABAARs as indicated by a reduction in 3[H]-flumazenil binding in brain sections analyzed by autoradiography. Tamoxifen-induced inactivation of CAML in neurons cultured from CAGGCre-ERTM x CAMLf/- embryos lead to a small but significant reduction in the number and size of \u0192\u00d72 subunit clusters. Biotinylation assays indicated normal endocytosis of GABAARs from the cell surface with, however, a significant deficit in recycling of endocytosed receptors to the cell surface. Eletrophysiological analyses of CAML-deficient neurons (tamoxifen treated CAGGCre-ERTM x CAMLf/- neurons and CAML shRNA-transfected neurons, compared to respective controls, revealed a significant reduction in GABA-induced whole cell current densities  as well as reduced frequency in spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. All together, our data suggest that CAML is critical for neural differentiation, for postsynaptic clustering, and for normal endocytic recycling of \u0192\u00d72 subunit containing GABAARs. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6712], "author_name_tesi": "Yuan, Xu ", "last_name_ssi": "Yuan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard W Ordway", "Bernhard Luscher", "Gong Chen", "Douglas Cavener", "Pamela Hankey Giblin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard W Ordway, Committee Chair", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "Gong Chen, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["calcium modulating cyclophilin ligand", "trafficking", "GABA-A receptor"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "METAL NANOPLATELET SYNTHESIS AND DISPERSION IN SUSPENSION: SILVER, COPPER, NICKEL AND RELATED ALLOYS\n", "id": "8031", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6940", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The synthesis and dispersion of metal nanoplatelets were investigated in the current work, driven by the demands of miniaturization and low cost in the multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) industry.  The specific materials in this Ph.D. dissertation include silver (Ag), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and copper/nickel (Cu/Ni) metal platelets.  Metal nanoplatelets were synthesized in the lamellar bilayer phase regime of the polyoxyethylene (POE) \u2013 water binary system.  The main focus is on determining the processing parameters related to high yield platelet synthesis, laundering the nanoplatelets while maintaining well dispersed particles, and the dispersion approaches associated with interfacial and colloidal chemistry of specific metal systems. \nA novel approach has been developed for the first time to statistically evaluate the morphology of the tabular shape nanoparticles using AFM analysis based on a relatively large population (n>200).  The novel approach uses color delineation in the 3rd dimension (i.e., thickness) to produce both thickness and face diameter in the semi-automated analysis of several hundred nanoplatelets to quantify physical dimensions as well as to assess the degree of dispersion.\nHigh yields of Ag nanoplatelets (20 g/liter) and Cu nanoplatelets (12 g/liter) were achieved in the POE-water bilayer system with controlled platelet morphology.  The influence of higher concentrations of metal precursors on the presence of a lamellar phase in the POE-water binary phase diagram was investigated.  Oxyethylene (EO)-water interactions decrease because of the influence of anion concentrations leading to dehydration of the POE head group.  Phase separation was induced when the ion concentration reached the upper limit.  Therefore, the [water]/[surfactant] molar ratio used in the synthesis was decreased to compensate for the dehydration of the POE head groups to maintain the bilayer phase structure.  In the Cu nanoplatelet synthesis, an elevated temperature was needed to increase the reaction rate.  The free energy (DGf) of the oxyethylene (EO) / water structure is proportional to the number of EO units.  As the temperature increased, the DGf decreased, resulting in a favorable EO/EO interaction instead of an EO/water interaction.  When the temperature reached the upper limit, phase separation occurred due to dehydration of water as the EO/water interactions become less favorable.  Similarly as anion concentration increases, dehydration of the EO-head group causes collapse of the bilayer leading to phase separation.  However, it is shown that so long as the bilayer structure is present even at relatively high anion concentrations, templated platelets are synthesized.  Thus, the reasonably high yields are obtained for both the Ag-POE-water and Cu-POE-water syntheses.\nA two-step protection-dispersion approach was investigated to stabilize Ag nanoplatelets in ethanol solution using a polyelectrolyte, polyethylenimine (PEI).  As a cationic polyelectrolyte, degree of ionization of PEI is low at a high pH, and increases as pH decreases.  To launder and concentrate Ag nanoplatelets without irreversible particle flocculation, PEI was used in initial washing iterations to form a protective polymer layer with a low charge.  For the final wash, the solution pH was adjusted to provide a positive charge and promote electrosteric dispersion.  The optimum PEI concentration and solution pH were investigated in ethanol.  PEI self-aggregation behavior as a function of concentration and pH were examined.  The PEI adsorption isotherm on silver was established to quantitatively evaluate the adsorption between particle surface and the polyelectrolyte.  It is shown that there is a range of pH values suitable for flocculation of the Ag nanoplatelets with PEI near the isoelectric point of the polymer, and a pH range for electrosteric dispersion of the Ag nanoplatelets defined at the lower pH, ~ pH 5.5, by PEI self-aggregation and at the higher limit, ~ pH 7.5, by PEI charge. \nPrior to the dispersion study, the dispersion issues of Cu nanoplatelets in ethanol-water (7:3, vol%) are discussed, including dissolution, oxidation and possible surface charge heterogeneity.  A passivation-dispersion approach was used to disperse Cu nanoplatelets in an ethanol-water (7:3, vol%) co-solvent.  In this approach, a complexing agent is applied to the particle surface to form a stable surface metal-ligand complex with negligible Cu solubility in the solution.  The formation of the stable complex is designed to protect against degradation, screen the possible charge heterogeneity in the solution, and provide a surface charge to promote reliable dispersion. Oxalic acid (HOx) and citric acid (HCit) were evaluated as dual passivation-dispersion agents.  Colloid chemistry and surface chemistry were involved in evaluating the dispersion effectiveness.  It was shown that HCit is an effective passivation-dispersion agent for stabilizing Cu nanoplatelets in an ethanol-water (7:3, vol%) co-solvent.  At 10-3 M HCit concentration with respect to the solid loading, citrate provided a zeta potential equal to -25 mV, which was sufficient for dispersion.  Sedimentation experiments and the electrostatic deposition technique verified that well-dispersed Cu nanoplatelet suspensions were obtained above pH 8. \nNi nanoplatelets were synthesized in POE-water bilayer system.  To maintain POE-water self-assembled lamellar structure, synthesis temperature needs to be controlled below ~ 60\u00b0C.  With the temperature constraint, synthesis of pure phase Ni was conducted by the application of Pd as the nucleating agent at a molar ratio of 5\u00d710-2 Pd/Ni.  Cu0.81/Ni0.19 bimetallic nanoplatelets have also been synthesized in the same system using Cu as the nucleating agent. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6937], "author_name_tesi": "Yuan, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Yuan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare", "Darrell Velegol", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair, Committee Chair", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["SILVER", "DISPERSION", "SYNTHESIS", "BILAYER", "NANOPLATELET", "COPPER", "NICKEL"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND ROBUST PARAMETER DESIGN IN MULTIPLE STAGE MANUFACTURING FOR NANO-ENABLED SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS\n", "id": "10119", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1198", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The advent of rapid and exciting scientific advances in nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing allows scientists and engineers to create new and sophisticated products. However, the quality and yield of these products is still limited. Based on a review of the literature, we recognized several opportunities to use statistically-based design of experiments (DOE) and robust parameter design (RPD) in this field.\nMore specifically, along with a team of Penn State researchers, we have been advancing a new multi-functional forceps-scissors (FS) instrument for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The lost mold rapid infiltration forming (LMRIF) process is being developed to fabricate the tiny tool. There are many technical and quality issues that need to be overcome. Furthermore, when this novel process is established in the laboratory and ready to transition to full scale manufacturing, its continuing repeatability and reproducibility must be assured. \nIn the experimentation to develop and refine the LMRIF process, there are restrictions on the randomization, by which we mean that the allocation of the experimental material and the order in which the individual trials of the experiment are to be performed are not randomly determined because certain process variables are \u201chard to change\" or \u201cexpensive to change\" due to the nature of the multiple stages that are involved in the process. Randomization, however, is one of the key principles in DOE. If the principle of randomization is violated, and the typical approach to data analysis is still employed, serious misinterpretation of the results may occur. This will lead to delays and/or diminished reliability in new product development. While there is a rich history and body of literature on DOE, there is a gap between the literature and the problem that we propose to address. \nIn this research, we develop the multistage fractional factorial split-plot (MSFFSP) design with the combination of split-plot and split-block structure. Some properties are derived and its application is demonstrated in the green-bar yield improvement of the LMRIF process. Furthermore, we develop a framework of DOE and RPD to expedite the transition of micro- and nano-scale technologies into robust products that can be produced with minimum variability and defects. \nTo maximize the information obtained from the MSFFSP design, we extend an algorithm from Bingham and Sitter (1999, 2001) to determine the optimal design under two general criteria: maximum resolution and minimum aberration. The algorithm is coded in MATLAB and is used to construct design catalogs for three and four stage experiments. An application to the LMRIF process is explored.\nIn order to reduce the variability in the LMRIF process when it is transferred from the laboratory scale to full scale manufacturing, we integrate the MSFFSP design with the RPD concept. We focus on addressing multiple stages and multiple sets of noise factors in this integration, which is convenient for the LMRIF process. A foundation for using the concept is laid out and an optimal design catalog based on modified minimum aberration criteria for the variation reduction is provided for two-stage experiments with two sets of controllable factors and one set of noise factors. A computer code in MATLAB is also constructed for this purpose, and it can be used for larger experimentation. An application of the model is also explored for the improvement of the fired FS yield of the LMRIF process.\nThe MSFFSP design and its integration with the RPD concept result in a more rapid understanding of the interaction among process conditions, product characteristics, and product reproducibility under constrained resources. This will not only advance the field of quality engineering in nanomanufacturing, but also has potential applications for other types of manufacturing.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1186], "author_name_tesi": "Yuangyai, Chumpol ", "last_name_ssi": "Yuangyai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chumpol", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard", "Harriet Black Nembhard", "Sanjay B Joshi", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "Mary I Frecker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard, Dissertation Advisor", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Sanjay B Joshi, Committee Member", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Member", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["two-level fractional factorial design", "split plot", "split block", "multistage experiments", "minimum aberration"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "How To Make Friends And Influence People On The Internet:A Dissertation On Popular Comments On Blogs\n", "id": "11709", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2440", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Blogs, specifically special-interest blogs, generate in-depth discussions.

Longitudinal ultrasonic waves (2.25 MHz) were used to follow the changes in dispersions of sugar crystals (i.e., lactose or sucrose) in different liquid phases (i.e., water or vegetable oil). In general, it was found that the ultrasonic attenuation measurements were more sensitive to the amount and size of the dispersed crystals while velocity measurements were more sensitive to the changes in total concentration (dissolved or undissolved). \n\nUltrasonic measurements were used to measure the compositions (e.g., concentration) of lactose solutions and aqueous suspensions of lactose crystals. The ultrasonic velocity in lactose-water mixtures (i.e., solution or dispersion) was independent of the state of lactose molecules (i.e., either dissolved or crystallized) and increased almost linearly with lactose concentration. In contrast to the ultrasonic velocity measurements, ultrasonic attenuation was relatively unaffected by changes of lactose concentration in solution, but increased with the amount of dispersed crystals. Similarly in lipid systems, attenuation was low in oil and increased with dispersed sucrose crystal concentration. Furthermore, it was also found in lipid systems that sucrose crystal aggregation (induced by adding water) increased ultrasonic attenuation.\n\nSince ultrasonic attenuation is more sensitive than velocity measurements to the presence of dispersed particles in a liquid, attenuation measurements were used to follow dynamic changes in the dispersed phase through dissolution and crystallization of lactose in aqueous environments. \n\nThe dissolution of lactose crystals (d~50 \u00a6\u00ccm) in stirred aqueous solutions was investigated using continuous on-line ultrasonic attenuation measurements and at discrete intervals by off-line refractive index measurements. Upon addition of powdered sugar into water or an under-saturated solution, air pockets between and around the crystal agglomerates strongly attenuated the acoustic signal, and obscured any changes resulting from the dissolution process until all air was removed. In order to minimize air incorporation, water was added to suspensions of lactose crystals in saturated lactose solution to produce an under-saturated solution and cause crystal dissolution. In this case the rate constant for lactose dissolution evaluated from on-line attenuation measurements (~700 \u00a6\u00ccs-1) was in reasonable agreement with off-line measurements and literature values.\n\nThe crystallization of lactose within gelatin gels was also monitored by ultrasonic attenuation measurements using a modified pulse-echo reflectometer as an immersion probe, and results were compared to turbidity and isothermal differential scanning calorimetry measurements. The gel environment prevented crystal sedimentation and hindered convection flow effects and secondary nucleation. The crystallization rate of lactose was increased with increasing degree of supersaturation, but relatively unaffected by gelatin concentration. The kinetic parameters for growth rate and induction time varied in a similar way with changes in lactose and gelatin concentration for all methods. Although it is difficult to make conclusions about the relative effects of gelatin-lactose interactions on lactose crystallization, ultrasonic measurements were able to differentiate between different crystallization conditions.\n\nFinally, the effects of dispersed crystal (de)aggregation on ultrasonic attenuation were studied using the model of sucrose crystals dispersed in oil (8-16 wt%). During the dispersing process, powder agglomerates are broken up and the viscosity of the suspension decreases (e.g., chocolate conching). It was found that the deagglomeration of sucrose crystals (i.e., dispersing the sugars in a liquid uniformly) in oil was much slower than in an aqueous environment due to the hydrophobic nature of the oil and the possible presence of small amounts of water at the crystal surfaces. Attenuation increased linearly with concentration, and also with increasing effective particle size. Additionally, when crystal aggregation was triggered by the addition of small amounts of water (\u00a1\u00dc1 %), the ultrasonic noise also increased, which may be due to either uneven distribution of agglomerates or the inhomogenity of the agglomeration process (i.e., diverse particle size distribution and morphology). Finally, the stirrer was switched off and the crystals and aggregated crystals were allowed to sediment out of suspension. The subsequent sedimentation kinetics, as followed at a certain height from the bottom of the container through the ultrasonic beam path, was used to provide further information about the state of agglomerated sucrose crystals. It was found that the addition of 1% (vol. water/wt. sucrose) decreased the total sedimentation time to half that of the water-free samples. In addition, the agglomeration process was shown to be inhomogeneous yielding uneven sedimentation profiles, as the degree of inhomogeneity was confirmed by micrometer measurements. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6383], "author_name_tesi": "Yucel, Umut ", "last_name_ssi": "Yucel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Umut", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John N Coupland, Ph D", "John Neil Coupland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John N Coupland, Ph D, Thesis Advisor", "John Neil Coupland, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sensor", "crystal dispersions", "ultrasound"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Properties of a Hydrophobic Solute in Emulsions: An EPR Study\n", "id": "12475", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13288", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Small quantities of certain lipophilic molecules (e.g., flavors, colorants, antimicrobials, phytochemicals) are added to food products to produce a desired functionality. These molecules are largely insoluble in aqueous food products and are often chemically labile leading to a broad need for encapsulation methods. Oil-in-water emulsions are attractive candidates as delivery systems for lipophilic ingredients. The lipid phase provides a reservoir of the lipophilic ingredients isolated from aqueous reagents, and it is possible to modify the properties of the delivery system by altering the structure of droplets. Early work on emulsion based delivery systems (EBDS) has expanded to include the use of fine, crystalline emulsion droplets (solid lipid nanoparticles, SLN). Crystalline droplets offer the potential for enhanced retention and chemical stabilization of lipophilic ingredients, as well as for ways to control ingredient release. However there are conflicting reports on the effects of droplet crystallization on distribution and reactivity of lipophilic ingredients. This is partly due to a lack of a suitable technique to characterize EBDS structures in situ. EPR spectroscopy offers great potential to characterize the properties of a solute within EBDS directly and non-destructively. However, this technique requires the use of an EPR-active molecule (i.e., spin probe), as a model for the properties of the real ingredient (e.g., bioactive molecules, pharmaceuticals).\n\nMy main goal was to show how changes in EBDS structure (i.e., droplet size, crystallinity, surface properties) affect the physical distribution and reactivity of lipophilic ingredients. In this work I developed an EPR method to measure the properties of a small-molecule hydrophobic spin probe (4-phenyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-imidazoline-1-oxyl, PTMIO) in different EBDS, and used it to develop a detailed model for the distribution behavior of PTMIO between phases.\n\nThe oil-in-water emulsions (10 wt%) were prepared by a hot homogenization technique, where n-tetradecane (C14) or n-eicosane (C20), or their blends, with PTMIO were homogenized into solutions of Na-caseinate (1 wt%, pH 7.0) or lecithin (70% phosphatidylcholine, PC75) + bile salt (taurodeoxycholic acid sodium) blend (2.4 wt% + 0.6 wt%, pH 7.0) to produce controlled size droplets (0.2, 0.6, or 1.3 &#956;m). Then, emulsions containing PTMIO (200 &#956;m) were cooled to, and stored, at 21.5 or 5 \u00c2\u00b0C where C14 is liquid and C20 is crystalline. The measured EPR spectra were deconvoluted into contributions from individual probe populations in different chemical environments by simulation of the spectra. The properties of the spin probe in each environment were evaluated from the parameters of the spectra:the hyperfine splitting constant (sensitive to the polarity of the probe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environment), the rotational correlation times (inversely related to the probe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobility), and the ratio of the two rotational correlation times (a measure of anisotropic effects). The relationship between the distribution behavior of the probe in EBDS and probe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reactivity was also measured as the rate of reduction of the probe to its EPR-silent form by the addition of iron/ascorbate blend to the aqueous phase.\n\nThe changes in the distribution behavior and reactivity of the spin probe were evaluated by systematically changing EBDS structure as three specific objectives: (1) to investigate the effects of droplet size and crystallinity, (2) to investigate the effects of liquid oil fraction and storage, (3) to investigate the effects of surface composition. \n\nIn Objective 1, the effects of droplet size and crystallinity on the distribution and reactivity of PTMIO were investigated. C14 and C20 emulsions (0.2, 0.6, and 1.3 &#956;m) were stored at 21.5 \u00c2\u00b0C and 5 \u00c2\u00b0C for 5 h or 24 h, and then analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. The EPR spectra revealed populations of probe in two discrete environments (i.e., aqueous and lipid). PTMIO is largely hydrophobic with 77% and 70% present in the coarse and fine liquid lipid droplets (i.e., tetradecane droplets), respectively. In the solid droplets (i.e., eicosane), all of the probe was excluded from the droplets into the aqueous environment. In all cases, the mobility of the probe in both lipid and aqueous environments was affected by the droplet surface. Moreover, the apparent rate constant for the reduction kinetics of the spin probe was proportional to the fraction of the spin probe in the aqueous phase. \n\nIn Objective 2, the effects of mixing liquid lipid (tetradecane) into solid lipid (eicosane) prior to homogenization on the distribution and reactivity of PTMIO as a function of storage time and temperature were investigated. The emulsions of blends of C14:C20, at weight ratios of 100:0 (100%C14), 10:90 (90%C20), and 1:100 (99%C20), and 0:100 (100%C20), stabilized with caseinate were stored at 21.5 or 5 \u00c2\u00b0C for 5 h and 24 h prior to EPR analyses. It was found that even a small fraction of liquid oil can significantly affect the solute properties in SLN. For example, in the SLN where 10% of C20 was replaced with C14 (90%C20), more than half of the PTMIO was still in the droplets even after storage at 5 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h, while in pure C20 SLN (100%C20) all the probe was present in the aqueous phase. The liquid lipid fraction is believed to surround the crystalline lipid core and is in close proximity of the immobilized surface layer which hinders the mobility of the spin probe. Moreover, the presence of C14 in C20 containing droplets affected the course of crystallization of C20, and thus the distribution of PTMIO in EBDS. The amount of aqueous probe population followed the sequence 5 h at room temperature < 24 h at room temperature < 24 h at refrigerated temperature. This time-dependency of C20 containing emulsions was attributed to the following mechanisms: (i) difference in nucleation frequency, (ii) the rate of rotator-to-solid transition, and (iii) solvent effects of C14 retarding crystal growth. The results obtained from the analyses of the EPR spectra were consistent with that of the probe reactivity (i.e., kapparent increases with aqueous probe fraction, and so droplet crystallinity). In the next objective the EBDS properties were modified by changing the interfacial region of droplets. \n\nIn Objective 3, the effects of surfactant type on the distribution and reactivity PTMIO in C14 and C20 emulsions was investigated. Lipid phase (10 wt% tetradecane or eicosane) was emulsified into caseinate solution (1 wt%, pH 7) or PC75+bile salt dispersion (2.4 wt% + 0.6 wt%, pH7), and samples were stored at 5 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to EPR measurements. In C14 emulsions stabilized with PC75+bile salt, three populations of PTMIO were observed: lipid core (~60%, aN ~13.9 G) and aqueous phase (~20%, aN ~15.4 G) with high mobility, and immobilized surface layer (~20%, aN ~14.2 G) with low mobility. However, in C14 emulsions stabilized by caseinate, two distinct populations of PTMIO were seen: lipid phase (~70%, aN ~13.8 G) and aqueous phase (~30%, aN ~15.5 G) with high mobility. In both C20 emulsions stabilized either with PC75+bile salt or caseinate, crystallization excluded PTMIO from the droplets. In PC75+bile salt-stabilized SLN the majority of the probe (~77%) was in the interfacial layer, while in caseinate-stabilized SLN all of the probe was in the aqueous phase. For both surfactant systems kapparent was greater for C20 emulsions than C14 emulsions.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12834], "author_name_tesi": "Yucel, Umut ", "last_name_ssi": "Yucel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Umut", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John N.

However, traditional analytical methods may not be accurate due to simplified assumptions, and are limited in their applications. Numerical simulation and history matching could be time and computation consuming.

We first reviewed the petroleum geology, petrophysical properties, and production history of the target field. We then evaluated current production histories with decline curve analysis, developed a numerical reservoir model through matching production and pressure data, and carried out parametric studies to develop an optimized waterflooding method based on ultimate oil recovery and economics. This study provides an addition to the list of carbonate fields available in the petroleum literature and also improved understandings of Smackover formation and similar analogous fields. \nTo improve the characterization of the target field, we then developed a fit-for-purpose PDA model which is capable of evaluating reservoir properties and forecasting well performance with improved accuracy and efficiency. This model adopted an innovative Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), and was couple with a single-well reservoir simulation model to evaluate reservoir properties and to predict future production. This PDA model has been validated with both synthetic simulation models and field data. It proves to be versatile, accurate, and efficient in production data analysis. The methodology helps other researchers to develop and apply more efficient production data analysis model.\nWith the successful model development, we then carefully applied the PDA model to the analysis of production data from the target field.

Additionally, we tested mechanisms mediating tolerance to multiple opioids, and to the prototypical cannabinoid \u03949-THC. CB2R agonists produce low levels of side effects and no tolerance relative to other opioid and cannabinoid agonists, making them an attractive pharmacotherapeutic target. This study assessed the anti-nociceptive effects of a selective CB2R agonist (JWH-133) in pathological pain using mice subjected to inflammatory pain using the formalin test. Furthermore, we examined several ways in which JWH-133 may interact with the activity of opioids in this model. \nJWH-133 produces dose-dependent anti-nociception during both the acute pain and inflammatory pain phases of the formalin test. This was observed in both male and female mice. However, a maximally efficacious dose of JWH-133 (1 mg/kg) was not associated with somatic withdrawal symptoms, motor impairment, or hypothermia. The efficacy of JWH-133 was blocked by application of a CB2R selective antagonist (SR144528).\nAfter eleven once-daily injections of 1 mg/kg JWH-133, no tolerance was observed in the formalin test. Conversely, wild-type mice become tolerant to \u03949-THC, morphine, and fentanyl within eleven days. Cross-tolerance for the anti-nociceptive effects of JWH-133 and morphine were assessed to gain insight into physiologically relevant CB2R and Mu opioid receptor (MOR) interaction. Mice made tolerant to the effects of morphine exhibited a lower JWH-133 response in both phases of the formalin test compared to vehicle treated morphine-na\u00efve animals. However, repeated daily JWH-133 administration did not cause cross-tolerance for morphine. Similar results were found for cross-tolerance between JWH-133 and fentanyl, suggesting opioid and CB2R cross-tolerance is unidirectional in this model. However, preliminary data suggests co-administration of JWH-133 with morphine modestly attenuates morphine tolerance in the formalin model. Furthermore, isobolographic analysis revealed that co-administration of a fixed-ratio combination of JWH-133 and morphine has an additive effect on anti-nociception in the formalin test. Overall these findings show that CB2R may functionally interact with MOR to modulate anti-nociception and tolerance in inflammatory pain, which suggests clinical utility.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16237], "author_name_tesi": "Yuill, Matthew Buchanan", "last_name_ssi": "Yuill", "middle_name_ssi": "Buchanan", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel James Morgan", "Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy", "Robert G Levenson", "John Ellis", "Jossee Guindon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel James Morgan, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy, Committee Chair", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member", "John Ellis, Committee Member", "Jossee Guindon, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CB2R", "morphine", "pain", "tolerance", "formalin", "JWH-133", "opioid", "cannabinoid agonist"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Algorithms to Identify Pareto Points in Multi-Dimensional Data Sets", "id": "6336", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4001", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The focus in this research is on developing a fast, efficient hybrid algorithm to identify the Pareto frontier in multi-dimensional data sets.

The general approach to the hybrid algorithm is to execute the following steps in order:\n1.\tExecute one pass of the SC algorithm through the data if merited\n2.\tExecute the DC algorithm, which recursively splits the data into smaller problem sizes\n3.\tSwitch to the SC algorithm for problem sizes below a certain limit\n\nIn order to determine whether Step 1 should be executed, and to determine at what problem size the switch in Step 3 should be made, estimates of both algorithms\u2019 run times as a function of the size of the data set, the dimension of the data set, and the expected number of nondominated points are needed. These are developed in the thesis.\n\nTo aid in increasing the speed and reducing the computational and storage complexity of the algorithm, and to enable the ability for the algorithm to adapt to the data, a canonical transformation of the data to a Lattice Latin Hypercube (LLH) form is developed. The transformation preserves the Pareto property of points but reduces storage space and algorithm run time.\n\nIn order to test the three algorithms, three different methods for creating randomized data sets with arbitrary dimensionality and numbers of nondominated points are developed. Each of the methods provides insight into the properties of nondominated sets, along with providing test cases for the algorithms. Additionally, a spacecraft design problem is developed to serve as a source of real world test data.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3975], "author_name_tesi": "Yukish, Michael ", "last_name_ssi": "Yukish", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson", "Mark Thomas Traband", "Mary I Frecker", "Soundar Kumara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson, Committee Chair", "Mark Thomas Traband, Committee Member", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Member", "Soundar Kumara, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pareto frontier", "efficient frontier", "dominance", "nondominance", "multi-objective", "design optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Quality of Service Provisioning in Clusters", "id": "5797", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3668", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-07-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cluster systems are becoming increasingly more attractive\nfor designing scalable servers with switched network\narchitectures that offer much higher bandwidth than the\nbroadcast-based networks.\nDesign of high performance cluster networks with Quality\nof Service (QoS) guarantees, therefore, becomes important\nto support a variety of multimedia applications, many of\nwhich have real-time constraints.\nMost commercial routers, which are based on the wormhole-switching\nparadigm, can deliver high performance, but lack QoS provisioning.\nTherefore, it would be advantageous if we could leverage off\nof the large amount of effort that has gone into the design\nand development of these wormhole routers and adapt them\nto support integrated traffic with minimal design changes.\nThe overall goal of this thesis is to design and\nanalyze cluster networks that can provide high\nand predictable performance.\n\nDesign and evaluation of QoS-capable cluster networks\nis the focus of this thesis.\nIn particular, we investigate various issues for efficient\nhandling of best-effort and real-time traffic in clusters\nbased on the wormhole switching paradigm.\nWe study five research issues in this thesis.\nFirst, a non-preemptive pipelined wormhole router, called\nMediaWorm, is proposed and investigated based on a\nbasic wormhole router architecture.\nSecond, to overcome the inflexibility of the MediaWorm router\nfor dynamic workloads, a preemptive pipelined router\narchitecture is proposed.

The resulting stable tyrosyl radical is used to generate a cysteine radical in the enzyme's R1 subunit, which in turn generates a substrate 3' radical during nucleotide reduction by the holoenzyme (R1\u2022R2) complex.  Extensive mutagenesis, kinetic, and spectroscopic studies of the reaction in the R2 protein from Escherichia coli, which were initiated by the Stubbe group in the early 1990s and carried forward by my predecessors and contemporaries in the Bollinger group, established that (1) acquisition of Fe(II) by the R2 apo protein to form the O2-reactive diiron(II) cluster is relatively slow and rate-limited by a unimolecular step, which is thought to be a conformational change by the protein; (2) addition of O2 to the reactive diiron(II) cluster is fast and produces as the first definitively detectable intermediate a state containing the Fe2(III/IV) complex designated \"cluster X\" and a cation radical (+\u2022) derived by one-electron oxidation of the near surface tryptophan (W) residue, W48; (3) reduction of the W48+\u2022 from solution leaves a state containing only cluster X; and (4) X oxidizes tyrosine 122 to the stable radical (Y122\u2022) in the last and slowest step of the reaction.  When I entered graduate school, a key unanswered question regarding the reaction was the nature of precursors to the X-W48+\u2022 state, which don't accumulate to levels sufficient for definitive characterization.  A \u00b5-(1,2-peroxo)diiron(III) complex was proposed to be one of the precursors on the basis of its accumulation in variants with the Fe1 ligand, D84, substituted by E and the detection of fleeting optical absorption and M\u00f6ssbauer features similar to those arising from the R2-D84E peroxide complex in the reaction of wild-type Fe(II)-R2 with O2, but definitive evidence for the intermediacy of such a complex in the reaction of a wild-type R2 protein was lacking.\n\tShortly before my enrollment, a study of O2 activation for tyrosyl radical (Y177\u2022) production in R2 from Mus musculus (mouse) had suggested that this reaction might be significantly different from the E. coli R2 reaction in kinetic detail, if not more fundamentally in chemical mechanism [Schmidt, P. P., Rova, U., Katterle, B., Thelander, L, Gr\u00e4slund, A (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 21463-21472].  The authors had proposed that \"mouse X\" does not generate Y177\u2022 but, rather, is \"an intermediate in a side reaction leading to a diferric center without forming the neighboring tyrosyl radical,\" suggesting that a different intermediate generates the radical in the reaction of this functionally homologous protein.  They had further proposed that the slowest step in the mouse R2 reaction is transfer of the electron into the adduct between the diiron(II) cluster and O2, a step that, in the E. coli R2 reaction, is initiated by the rapid (> 400 s-1 at 5 \u00b0C) oxidation of W48.  This hypothesis assigned to the electron-transfer step in the mouse R2 reaction a rate-constant at least 3300-fold less than that of the cognate step in the E. coli R2 reaction.  On the one hand, the hypotheses of Schmidt, et al. implied that conclusions reached by the Bollinger group in previous studies of the E. coli R2 reaction were specific to that R2 protein and reaction, diminishing somewhat their general significance.  On the other hand, the proposal that the electron-transfer step is much slower in the mouse R2 reaction implied that preceding intermediates that are \"kinetically masked\" in the E. coli R2 reaction might accumulate to high levels in the mouse R2 reaction, permitting significant new insight to be extracted from investigation of this system.  For these reasons, I decided to re-examine the kinetics and mechanism of O2 activation for Y177\u2022 production in mouse R2 as my Ph. D. thesis project.\n\tThe crucial evidence cited by Schmidt, et al. in support of their hypotheses was the failure of mouse X to accumulate under most reaction conditions and the observation that Y177\u2022 is slowed in variants with substitutions to either W103 (the cognate of W48 in E. coli R2) or D266 (the residue that bridges W103 and Fe1 ligand, H173, by hydrogen bonds).  In Chapter 2 of this thesis, we show by stopped-flow absorption and freeze-quench EPR and M\u00f6ssbauer experiments that mouse X does indeed accumulate in the reaction of the Fe(II)-R2 complex with O2, and we present evidence that it is indeed the Y177\u2022-generating intermediate.  We further show that generation of Y177\u2022 by mouse X is ~ 5-10-fold faster than generation of Y122\u2022 by X in the E. coli R2 reaction and that the slowest step in the mouse R2 reaction is acquisition of Fe(II) by the apo protein to form the O2-reactive diiron(II) cluster.  In Chapter 3, we present evidence that a peroxodiiron(III) complex that is indistinguishable spectroscopically from the complex characterized in the reactions of D84E variants of E. coli R2 accumulates in the mouse R2 reaction and is probably a precursor to X.  These experiments provide the most definitive evidence yet for the intermediacy of this complex in the reaction of a wild-type R2 protein.  In addition, the experiments resolve the rate constant for the electron transfer step during formation of X as either ~ 80 or ~ 110 s-1, further disproving the notion of rate-limiting electron transfer.  In Chapter 4, we show that the slowest step in Y177\u2022 production in the reaction of the Fe(II) complex of R2-W103Y, one of the variants studied by Schmidt, et al., with O2 is addition of O2 to the diiron(II) cluster rather than the electron-transfer step.  The results of this chapter debunk the final remaining evidence for the notion of slow electron transfer in the reaction of mouse R2.  They show that the primary effect of the W103Y substitution is the retardation of a step in which the residue in question has no obvious chemical role, presumably by a secondary effect on the structure or dynamics of the protein.  They thus provide a stark admonition that reactions of variant proteins must be thoroughly characterized for proper interpretation of the effect of the substitution.  Together, the results of this thesis imply that O2 activation for tyrosyl radical formation in mouse R2 proceeds by a mechanism much more similar to that of the E. coli R2 reaction than was indicated by the study of Schmidt, et al.  They thus consolidate our understanding of O2 activation by R2 specifically and by the diiron-carboxylate proteins in general.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1663], "author_name_tesi": "Yun, Danny ", "last_name_ssi": "Yun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Danny", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Squire J Booker", "Carsten Krebs", "Ming Tien", "Michael Thomas Green"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Chair", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Michael Thomas Green, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ribonucleotide reductase", "oxygen activation", "tyrosyl radical"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "POSTMODERN INTERROGATION OF CHILDREN\u00a1\u00afS LITERATURE \nAND POSSIBILITIES IN LITERACY EDUCATION\n BY MEANS OF POSTMODERN PICTURE BOOKS\n\n", "id": "8049", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1937", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The growing advent and presence of unconventional, postmodern picture books over the past two decades mirror the cultural and social changes effected by postmodern conditions. The process of reading and dialoguing with postmodern texts and narratives certainly situates readers in roles different from the ones we have been used to. Drawing upon the interconnected relations among children\u00a1\u00afs literature, social reality, and child readers, and by examining preservice teachers\u00a1\u00af reading, understanding, and assumptions about postmodern picture books, this study seeks to interrogate children\u00a1\u00afs literature through challenging the general assumptions about it. An expanded definition of children\u00a1\u00afs literature poses it not merely as a genre of literature but more as a space for connection, tolerance, compassion, and possibilities through releasing the reader\u00a1\u00afs imagination, a notion supported by data from preservice teachers and child readers. \nThe modes and resources of texts have become multimodal, particularly more visual-oriented cross-media hybrids than ever before. This phenomenon makes new and different demands on the reader, and thus the meaning of being literate also changes. Data from students in two summer camps indicate that children are able readers as well as active in the roles of coauthor and critic by making meanings, weaving stories, and bringing new and different perspectives into stories. The primary finding of this research is that postmodern picture books have the potential to help children develop a new and different literacy through their situating children in active roles with authority and agency as meaning-makers and designers. Play in these roles is crucial in forming multiliteracies. In addition, by presenting the authors\u00a1\u00af attempts to empower children by using picture books dealing with different traumas, this study offers a non-conventional perspective on children and children\u00a1\u00afs literature. This study contributes toward evincing how children\u00a1\u00afs literature, the meaning of being literate, and the notions of children and childhood are socially and culturally contingent and have aligned with one another over time and place. This understanding should prompt teachers, librarians, and parents to think about how to help children not only be literate but become literate as an ongoing process through using the ever-evolving resources of children\u00a1\u00afs literature.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1919], "author_name_tesi": "Yun, Eunja ", "last_name_ssi": "Yun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Eunja", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade", "Jamie Myers", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto", "Patricia Marie Amburgy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade, Committee Chair", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto, Committee Member", "Patricia Marie Amburgy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["children literature", "postmodernism", "postmodern picture books", "deconstructive approaches", "literacy education", "multiliteracies"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Adaptive Resource Allocation for D-TDD Systems in Wireless Multimedia Networks", "id": "6240", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3237", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-03-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In accordance with the demand for robust and spectrally efficient communications systems design for multimedia communication with heterogeneous traffic in fading channels, various adaptive approaches have been developed, recently. This dissertation examines how adaptive technologies can be used in real systems in order to bring reliable and spectrally efficient connections between wireless communication links. It addresses two different types of adaptation: (1) channel adaptation with adaptive modulation /coding, adaptive antennas, and automatic repeat request (ARQ) schemes; (2) bandwidth adaptation to the dynamic unbalanced network traffic with dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD) scheme.\nIn order to make the vulnerable wireless channel reliable and spectrally efficient, we adopt adaptive modulation/coding and ARQ schemes. We introduce an analytical method, which uses a finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) as an error model, for estimating the performance of adaptive modulation systems (AMS) combined with ARQ schemes in correlated slow fading channels. For the purpose of the throughput performance evaluation of wireless packet networks, fading channels have been assumed to have independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) statistics. This assumption of channel model may be suitable to represent fast fading channels. However, in slow fading channels, error rates of consecutive packets are highly correlated, and we cannot simply assume an independent error process for the purpose of performance evaluation. We propose a multi-state Markov error model for AMS in correlated fading channels, which is also described by a Finite-State Markov Chain (FSMC), and we present throughput estimation methods for AMS combined with ARQ, using the proposed Markov error model.  \nFor multimedia services, network traffic becomes heterogeneous; the network traffic is homogeneous for voice traffic only. It has been known that dynamic-TDD (D-TDD) scheme utilizes the spectrum more efficiently, adjusting the ratio of uplink and downlink available timeslots adaptively according to the traffic pattern. However, having different switching points in each cell causes severe co-channel interference between base stations. We present a statistical assessment of co-channel interference of D-TDD scheme when switched beam sector antennas are deployed at base stations, and we also present a cooperative co-channel interference avoidance algorithm in TDMA/D-TDD wireless cellular systems.\nFinally, with these channel and bandwidth adaptations, we propose adaptive resource allocation schemes considering joint parameters in the physical (PHY) layer and the medium access control (MAC) layer. We consider cases without co-channel interference and with co-channel interference, denoting as single and multi- cluster cases. For the single cluster case, we first allocate bandwidths for uplink and downlink based on the requested bandwidths for both links. Secondly, we allocate modulation format to each call based on the estimated channel state; this procedure makes some more channels available in the frame for the calls waiting in the queue. For the multi-cluster case, in addition to resource allocation procedures for the single cluster case, we have to allocate time slots to each call appropriately in a way of avoiding severe co-channel interference. By simulation results, we show that more calls (or users) can be serviced in D-TDD systems than fixed-TDD (FTDD) systems with (or without) adaptive modulation.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3224], "author_name_tesi": "Yun, Jungnam ", "last_name_ssi": "Yun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jungnam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad", "John Metzner", "John F Doherty", "David Jonathan Miller", "Natarajan Gautam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad, Committee Chair", "John Metzner, Committee Member", "John F Doherty, Committee Member", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member", "Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adaptive Modulation", "Resource Allocation", "D-TDD"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "NOVEL OPTICAL METAMATERIALS, ABSORBERS, AND FILTERS BASED ON PERIODIC NANOSTRUCTURES\n\n\n", "id": "11959", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5891", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research describes the design, fabrication, and characterization of novel optical metamaterials, absorbers, and filters based on periodic all-dielectric and metallo-dielectric nanostructures.

First, planar all-dielectric nanostructures were exploited to synthesize a mid-infrared (IR) filter and a mirror. An array of doubly periodic amorphous silicon (a-Si) blocks induced a guided mode resonance, resulting in a polarization insensitive and incidence angle tolerant single stop band at 3.0 \u00b5m.

Secondly, metallo-dielectric nanostructures were investigated to realize a zero index metamaterial (ZIM), a dispersion engineered metamaterial filter, and a metamaterial absorber. A free-standing optical ZIM, consisting of a gold-polyimide-gold tri-layer stack perforated by air holes, was synthesized at 1.55 \u00b5m with low absorption loss and a good impedance match to free space, verified through characterization using spectral holography.

This thesis seeks to understand how versions of Chilean identity differed, what tensions were evident among the various versions, what common ground existed between Chilean media and international visions of Chile, and how this moment operated within a historical context of Latin American visibility and invisibility for U.S. audiences. To approach these questions, the project analyzes several different types of discourse: Chilean and U.S. newspapers, governmental press releases, and direct quotes from actors who participated in the Chilean mining accident and rescue. By analyzing how these voices created distinctive narratives, this project participates in conversations within rhetorical studies and Latina/o communication studies about identity creation, invisibility, temporality, tokenization, iconicity, testimonio, and the effects of characterization in narrative. Further, examining the accident and the rescue through a rhetorical lens illuminates how Latin American leaders and the media utilized language and discourse to influence perceptions about Chile, and it helps us understand how the miners searched for their own agency within difficult circumstances. This analysis demonstrates that the media attention given to this moment temporarily shattered the invisibility of Latin American nations in the United States, forcing American and international audiences to recognize Chile. But while Chile forged a space for itself in the collective consciousness of the international community, this space did not last. In the end, the \u201cChilean Way\u201d advanced the political careers of a few Chilean officials, but the miners and the Chilean people could not escape either the stereotypes or lack of recognition that so often determines Latin America\u2019s relationship to the rest of the world.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11114], "author_name_tesi": "Yunis, Bernardita Maria", "last_name_ssi": "Yunis", "middle_name_ssi": "Maria", "first_name_ssi": "Bernardita", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kirtley Hasketh Wilson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kirtley Hasketh Wilson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chile", "Miners", "San Jose Mine", "Identity", "Chilean Identity", "Testimonio", "Media Analysis", "Chilean Miners", "Miners Accident 2010"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF EXTRACELLULAR AND INTRACELLULAR TARGETS IN TUMOR-INDUCED ENDOTHELIAL JUNCTION REGULATIONS", "id": "10826", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6251", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tumor metastasis is characterized by disassembly of endothelial junctions, which allows for tumor extravasation and migration through the endothelium.

They are also expressed in the skin and in certain populations of leukocytes.  Meprins have been implicated in several inflammatory diseases, such as renal ischemia, diabetic nephropathy, and inflammatory bowel disease, indicating a role for these enzymes in modulation of the immune response.  Prior to the initiation of this work, extensive information about the structure and in vitro behavior of the meprins was known, but little was known about their in vivo roles in immune modulation.  These studies are the first to demonstrate a relationship between the inflammatory response and the meprins in both systemic and bladder challenge models.\nThe aim of this work was to determine the role of meprins in the host response to gram-negative uropathic Escherichia coli (E. coli).  Initial studies demonstrated marked increases in meprin alpha expression in the urine of women with active urinary tract infections (UTIs), implicating meprin involvement in the host response to bacterial infections.  To examine further the role of meprins in the host response to UTI, meprin alpha knockout (alphaKO) and wild-type (WT) mice were challenged with a transurethral inoculation of uropathic E. coli.  In this localized model of inflammation, bladder myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, bladder weight, and bladder permeability were significantly less in alphaKO compared to WT mice after induction of UTI.  These data indicate that meprin A is pro-inflammatory, contributing to leukocyte infiltration, edema, and epithelial damage.  To determine whether the action of meprin A was the result of a direct interaction with E. coli, extensive in vitro studies were carried out.  Meprin A did not decrease the binding of E. coli to bladder cells in culture, nor did it degrade the pili that are responsible for the attachment of E. coli to the bladder epithelium.  No evidence of direct interactions between meprin A and E. coli has been found, indicating that the differential response observed in meprin alphaKO mice in comparison to WT is indirect and likely involves the immune system.\nA large component of the immune response to E. coli is directed toward lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the bacterial cell wall.  Therefore, the responses of meprin alphaKO, meprin beta knockout (betaKO), meprin alphabeta double knockout (alphabetaKO), and WT mice after intraperitoneal (i.p.) LPS challenge were examined.  Genotype-specific differences in response to LPS were observed as early as 1 h after challenge with 2.5 mg/kg i.p. E. coli LPS.  Meprin alphaKO mice displayed a decreased systemic response to LPS compared to WT mice and meprin betaKO mice, as indicated by lower blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, lower serum TNFalpha levels, and less severe hypothermia, implicating meprin in modulation of the host immune response to endotoxin.  These data are consistent with those from UTI studies, corroborating the proposition that meprin A is pro-inflammatory, contributing to the LPS-induced renal injury, loss of body temperature regulation, and stimulation of cytokine increase.  The LPS response of the meprin alphabetaKO mice consisted of a prolonged elevation of BUN levels and more dramatic hypothermia than the other three genotypes.  These results indicate that the meprin beta subunit attenuates the pro-inflammatory actions of the meprin alpha subunit, and that the balance between meprin alpha subunits and meprin beta subunits is important in determining the outcome of the host response.  Serum cytokine profiles were genotype-specific and confirmed a role for the meprins in the early phases of the host response, with markedly lower levels of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and CCL2/MCP-1 in the meprin alphaKO mice and higher levels of CCL3/MIP-1alpha in the meprin alphabetaKO mice versus WT mice, within 3 h after LPS challenge.\nMeprin alphaKO mice were also hyporesponsive to localized LPS administration to the bladder, with decreased bladder edema, leukocyte infiltration, and bladder permeability, again implicating meprin A in inflammation.  Increased bladder permeability in WT mice in contrast to meprin alphaKO mice challenged intravesically with LPS or E. coli can be attributed to the capability of meprin A to disrupt tight junctions, because active, soluble meprin A is capable of disrupting the junctional complexes in a kidney cell culture model without demonstrating cytotoxicity.  The results from the LPS bladder challenge were congruent with those from the E. coli challenge, confirming that LPS is a major factor in the host response to E. coli challenge.  Meprins\u2019 role in the modulation of the host response may be attributed to activation or degradation of cytokines/chemokines and/or leukocyte migration through extracellular matrix and/or remodeling of the tight junctions between cells.  Taken together, the data indicate a role for meprin A in the modulation of the immune response to infection, that the meprin protease isoforms have distinct functions in modulation of the host response to LPS, and that meprin A contributes to the pathogenesis of endotoxicity. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5130], "author_name_tesi": "Yura, Renee E.", "last_name_ssi": "Yura", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Renee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith S Bond", "Sarah Bronson", "Robert G Levenson", "Andrea Manni", "W.

Although there is a rich body of literature on human-livestock-environment interactions in sub-Saharan Africa, scholarship has tended to focus primarily on herding activities in rangelands where livestock graze under the supervision of men. Pastoral women\u2019s caretaking roles at home have tended to be overlooked, yet they are integral to decision-making about household economy. As such, I provide empirical evidence for pastoral women\u2019s contributions to livestock management by examining milking activities in bomas (homesteads). Specifically, I examine women\u2019s considerations to balance output (milk offtake for household needs) with investment (milk allocated toward young animals) and the spaces in which such decisions occur. Given that milk is a primary food source for much of the year, I find that women\u2019s decisions have crucial implications for food security and herd health. This dissertation is based on 14 months of fieldwork conducted from 2014 to 2015 in a Maasai community in southern Kenya. I used mixed methods, including structured household surveys, intra-household surveys, and semi-structured interviews with men and women to understand the gendered nature of livestock management. Through an in-depth focal household study over ten months, I also collected quantitative and qualitative data during hundreds of milking observations with women and herding events with men.\n\nThis dissertation presents several main findings. First, livestock management practices that determine livelihood outcomes occur within pastoral households in highly gendered, contested, and dynamic private spaces. Second, gendered, intra-household relations shape three central components of pastoral livelihoods: livestock productivity, food security, and adaptive and coping capacities. This means that intra-household relations, rather than grazing activities or household assets such as herd size, determine milk resources for individuals within households. Moreover, gender relations within households are co-produced through milking practices that emerge as women exercise their responsibilities to apportion milk and as men attempt to preside over these activities. Third, abilities to cope with and adapt to risks of climate change are gendered and vary within households. As evidence of this, an extreme drought in the region in 2014 resulted in milk yields dropping substantially, which forced most families to migrate some or all of their livestock. Based on a variety of intra-household dynamics, some individuals in certain households were left more food insecure and vulnerable than others. By applying a feminist methodology to the literatures on pastoral systems, livelihoods, institutions, and political ecology, this dissertation demonstrates the importance of focusing attention to women\u2019s roles in livestock management in scholarship and policy. More broadly, my findings suggest that examining gendered, intra-household variation can be key for understanding livelihoods and human-environment interactions for communities in the Global South.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15084], "author_name_tesi": "Yurco, Kayla Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Yurco", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Kayla", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian Hastings King", "Brian Hastings King", "Lorraine Dowler", "Karl Stephen Zimmerer", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian Hastings King, Dissertation Advisor", "Brian Hastings King, Committee Chair", "Lorraine Dowler, Committee Member", "Karl Stephen Zimmerer, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gender roles", "livestock", "Maasai women", "milk management", "Kenya", "pastoralism"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Modulating the response of optical nanostructure by integrating novel plasmonic building blocks", "id": "23324", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10482", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "      Plasmonic nanostructures are of great interest due to the broad range of applications from biodetection to metamaterial. The desired optical functionality of these nanostructures can only be realized if the designed geometries and constituent material quality are accurately reproduced experimentally. This dissertation research developed new fabrication methods to create planar and freestanding plasmonic nanostructures, including two-dimensional (2D) planar gold (Au) nanoparticle quasicrystals, one-dimensional (1D) Au nanoparticle arrays, and ring-loaded Au nanoparticle dimer nanoantennas. The measured and modeled optical properties of each type of structure were found to be in strong agreement with one another, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the fabrication approaches in reproducing the designed structure.\n      In Chapter 2, planar 2D plasmonic quasicrystal arrays composed of spherical Au nanoparticles were created by Au-enhanced oxidation of lithographically patterned stacks of evaporated amorphous silicon (a-Si) and Au thin films. In contrast to 2D periodic plasmonic structures, which can be accurately simulated for arbitrarily shaped nanoparticles, computationally efficient models for quasicrystals require spherical particle geometries. Using the process developed in this research, broadband Ammann-Beenker and multiband Penrose plasmonic quasicrystals were fabricated and optically characterized. The measured transmission spectra of the fabricated structures agreed well with simulation, thereby enabling an experimental validation of the modeled interaction between the plasmonic and photonic modes of the two structures.\n      In Chapter 3, freestanding 1D Au nanoparticle arrays encapsulated within a silicon dioxide (SiO2) shell were produced by Au-enhanced oxidation of Au-coated, surface modulated Si nanowires. This lithography-free process overcomes the linear relationship between nanoparticle diameter and interparticle spacing imposed by the Rayleigh instability, and provides accurate and reproducible control of both of these parameters over a wide range of particle diameters and spacings. The modeled optical properties of fabricated 1D arrays were confirmed experimentally by extinction measurements of a randomly oriented ensemble of wires as well as by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) electron energy loss spectra (EELS) and energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) analysis of individual wire arrays.\n      In Chapter 4, a nanoring-loaded dimer nanoantenna was designed to give a multiband optical plasmonic response. The center wavelength and bandwidth of the two bands was varied by modifying the nanoring inner diameter. A top-down process was optimized to reproducibly fabricate the ring-loaded nanoantenna with sub-10 nm wide gaps between the three particles and an inner/outer nanoring diameter of 30nm and 55nm, respectively. Electromagnetic modeling showed that the multi-band response originated from differences in coupling between the nanoring and nanoparticle building blocks for the long- and short-wavelength resonances.

Soon after its discovery (1914) the insects displayed ecotype or voltine diversity. ECB management and its cost may be influenced by the ecotype pattern within a region. Since 1996, the commercial use of transgenic corn hybrids reduced the uses of synthetic insecticides in corn fields dramatically. However, wider uses of Bt corn poses the risk of resistance development and threatens parasitoids of ECB. Several Integrated Resistance Management (IRM) practices were introduced to minimize this threat, but the lack of understanding of the biology and population dynamics of geographic ecotypes of ECB may hinder the success of the IRM program. This dissertation studies were design to compare life history parameters, Bt toxin susceptibilities, parasitoid impacts, and population patterns between univoltine and multivoltine ecotypes collected from Pennsylvania, USA. From 2002-2005 post-diapause ECB were field collected in central, north, and south Pennsylvania. Various populations were reared through several generations in the laboratory to determine differences between univoltine and multivoltine ecotypes. These research included life history parameters, Bt susceptibility and parasitoid impacts. \n\tCo-occurring univoltine ECB required higher degree-days to complete its life cycle than bivoltine ECB. Post-diapause univoltine pupal weights were significantly higher than multivoltine pupal weights, whereas the pupal weights of non-diapause ECB (F1) reared in controlled environmental conditions were not significantly different. This suggests a non-genetic basis of weight gain. No variation was observed in reproductive parameters. \n\tNo significant mortality differences were found between univoltine and multivoltine ECB when subjected to Cry1Ab and Cry1F Bt toxins.  A 1.5- to 2- fold increase in susceptibility for the LC50, LC95, and LC99 was observed in univoltine exposed to Cry1Ab. Sub-lethal effects were not significant for Cry1Ab, however, severe growth inhibition was observed in ecotypes when exposed to Cry1F toxin. These minor variations in susceptibility are unlikely to affect resistance. \n\tFour years of field and laboratory study strongly suggested that M. cingulum emergence was completely synchronized with the spring emergence of the multivoltine ecotype. Post-diapause univoltine populations face almost no impact from M. cingulum parasitism. Sex ratio differences observed in over-wintered ECB populations in the presence or absence of M. cingulum parasitism suggested differential parasitism between male and female larvae. \n\tOverall, experimental outcomes from this research suggested that in areas of co-occurrence, variation in ECB ecotypes is due to the synergistic effects of seasonal degree days, host plant stage, and perhaps parasitoid pressure. Further genetic structure studies of multi ecotype populations across several geographic areas may elucidate the general applicability of these findings.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4103], "author_name_tesi": "ZAMAN, MD.

To overcome the potential drawbacks, the study in Chapter 2 couples hydrologic processes with hillslope and channel sediment transport processes to form a new hydrologic-morphodynamic model (LE-PIHM) for regolith formation and landscape evolution. In Chapter 3 two scenarios with and without groundwater flow are presented to demonstrate the importance of this coupling. Comparison of the steady state landforms indicates that hillslopes are steeper and relief is higher with groundwater flow. Unlike many previous studies which simplified the hydrological processes, and thereby neglected the influence of landscape evolution on hydrology, this study emphasizes the importance of the co-evolution of the hydrological-morphological landscape system. The sensitivity of the numerical solution to mesh geometry is tested and it is shown that the model simulations maintain the characteristic features of a landscape over a reasonable range of maximum triangle area and minimum interior angle which are key parameters to generate unstructured triangular mesh for the model domain. To predict long-term landscape change, a morphological acceleration technique is presented and a method for choosing an optimal morphological scale factor is introduced. In the fourth study, the spatial distributions of the evolution of topography, regolith transport, and bedrock weathering of the Susquehanna Shale Hills Watershed (SSHW) at the watershed scale are estimated using LE-PIHM. The channel spacing and elevation relief of the simulated steady state landscape are consistent with the current SSHW, implying that the SSHW is close to morphological equilibrium, and the parameters derived from field measurements are representative of the current SSHW at the watershed scale. In the fifth Chapter a one dimensional steady state soil thickness profile derived from LE-PIHM is very similar to the soil thickness profiles of SSHW where the soil thickness thickens downslope. The spatial variation of morphological diffusivity in the Shale Hills watershed is also estimated by using a 1-D analytic model framework. In the sixth Chapter, LE-PIHM is also applied to a groundwater sapping landscape where groundwater dominates channel erosion. Unlike runoff dominated landscapes which develop fan-shaped channels, groundwater sapping landscapes evolve relatively straight main channel and very few tributaries. This study uses a 3-D modeling approach to understand the control of soil properties on the channel evolution. The numerical experiments reveal that the soil vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity Kv and Kh exerts the first order control on the channel pattern. Although sediment particle size was varied by two orders of magnitude, it exerted only a weak effect on channel pattern. With different combination of Kv and Kh, the channel evolution switches strong control from strong Kv control to strong Kh control or from strong Kh control to strong Kv control accordingly. The study also classifies three regions where surface runoff erodes landscape, groundwater sapping controls erosion and landscape with very mild fluvial erosion.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13714], "author_name_tesi": "ZHANG, YU ", "last_name_ssi": "ZHANG", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "YU", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy", "Christopher J Duffy", "Xiaofeng Liu", "Chaopeng Shen", "Rudy Slingerland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Chair", "Xiaofeng Liu, Committee Member", "Chaopeng Shen, Committee Member", "Rudy Slingerland, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["landscape evolution", "Hydrological processes", "Erosion and deposition", "groundwater seepage", "numerical modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "HYBRID PARTICLE/FINITE-VOLUME PDF METHODS FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL TIME-DEPENDENT FLOWS IN COMPLEX GEOMETRIES\n\n", "id": "6317", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6891", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Modeling of complex turbulent reacting flows is of great importance in efforts to reduce the fuel consumption and pollutant emissions of many practical devices. The transported PDF method offers the salient advantage that the chemical reaction and other one-point processes (e.g., radiative emission) can be represented exactly without modeling assumptions. To date the PDF method has been mostly applied to statistically stationary axisymmetric jet flames and other canonical flow configurations.\n\nThis  research has broadened the accessibility of PDF methods so that they can be brought to bear in complex engineering flows of practical interest, which usually require three-dimensional time-dependent simulations for complicated (unstructured and/or deforming) meshes. For these flows, it is desirable to integrate the particle-based solution schemes into existing grid-based research and engineering computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes with a hybrid particle/finite-volume PDF method. Key issues for further application of hybrid PDF methods to engineering flows include particle algorithms, particle/FV consistency and efficient algorithms for complex chemistry. In this thesis, an efficient, robust and accurate hybrid particle/FV method has been developed to tackle these three issues. \n\nThe developed consistent and computationally efficient hybrid particle/FV PDF methods have been used to simulate a homogeneous-charge compression-ignition engine. A sensitivity study on effects of variations in engine operating conditions has shown that the simulation results are reasonably close to the experimental measurements and correctly capture the trends.

The poetry books of two renowned literary figures Mehmet Basaran and Talip Apaydin were studied to investigate villagers\u2019 reactions and responses to various national changes. The literary work of these poets provided a glimpse into the experiences of both the poets and the villagers, and their communities\u2019 reactions, with respect to continuing national changes. These poets not only came from the same cultural village background as the villagers, but had also been educated through the Turkish Village Institutes (TVI) literacy campaign. They experienced the changes first-hand and moved into new roles as a result of their TVI education. Their poetry was analyzed using the theoretical/methodological frameworks of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). The analysis was complemented by a systematic coding process to elicit emerging themes and patterns from the data; this process entailed deciphering the linguistic properties of the text/discourse, as well as the various author/speaker choices employed in the production of the poetic discourse.\n\n   The analysis placed the poetic discourse in its various social, educational and political contexts to better understand its meaning. Four final themes emerged from my analysis of the poetry data:  (a) indifference of others to the problems of villagers; (b) a strong call to bring about a better and more just world; (c) feelings of homesickness; and (d) the power of art, especially poetry, as a means of critical analysis. These findings indicated that social changes only partially touched the lives of those in the countryside and barely influenced the social relationships or the living standards in the countryside. The poems called for the taking of individual responsibility and working collectively to create a more equitable nation for future generations. Several poems also described instances of emotional turmoil due to feelings of homesickness. These feelings referred to the TVI-educated poets\u2019 homesickness due to seeking careers in cities away from their family and village cultures, in addition to the homesickness of some members of the village communities who had to work far away for the survival of their families. The fourth theme indicated poetry\u2019s power in effectively voicing village realities to a larger audience and envisioning a better future through its creative expression. In conclusion, poetry discourse is a living testament to the experiences, hopes and goals of the TVI-educated poets and the village communities they came from.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4815], "author_name_tesi": "Zabitgil, Ozlem ", "last_name_ssi": "Zabitgil", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ozlem", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melody M Thompson", "Melody M Thompson", "John Daniel Marshall", "Patricia M Hinchey", "Ladislaus M Semali"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melody M Thompson, Dissertation Advisor", "Melody M Thompson, Committee Chair", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member", "Patricia M Hinchey, Committee Member", "Ladislaus M Semali, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["\"Turkish Village Institutes\" \"Poetry\""]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "mechanistic analysis of the tryptophan biosynthetic enzyme indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase", "id": "19225", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9211", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The design and production of enzymes that are capable of performing reactions in an industrial setting is of profound importance for the advancement of technologies including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, agriculture, and materials. While some natural enzymes have industrial relevance, the design of novel enzymes whose catalytic reactions are not found in natural systems would greatly enhance the scope and efficiency of industrial processes. The difficulty of engineering such enzymes is that it requires in depth knowledge of all factors of catalysis and how they affect the reaction, including an understanding of the natural enzyme scaffold to be used in new design. Indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS), a tryptophan biosynthetic enzyme that catalyzes the ring closure of 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose 5-phosphate (CdRP) to form indole-3-glycerol phosphate (IGP), is widely used as a scaffold in enzyme engineering studies. However, the rate enhancements of these engineered enzymes are much lower than those of natural enzymes. This work has analyzed the IGPS enzyme from the thermophile Sulfolobus sulfataricus (ssIGPS) and gained a more complete understanding of the kinetic and chemical mechanism for this enzyme that can be leveraged towards enzyme engineering applications. \nSteady-state kinetic assays were used to analyze wild type (WT) ssIGPS and variants. The results showed a temperature dependent change in the rate-determining step of the reaction; the ring closure is rate-determining at high temperatures and product release is rate-determining at low temperatures. These studies also showed that thermophilic ssIGPS and mesophilic IGPS from Escherichia coli (ecIGPS) have different rate-determining steps at their biologically relevant temperatures. \nIn addition to examining the temperature dependence of ssIGPS, amino acid substituted variants of ssIGPS were used to probe the chemical mechanism of the enzyme. While a proposed mechanism had been previously published, this analysis provides additional and important details that were formerly unknown. The general acid and base in the dehydration step of the reaction were reassigned to Lys53 and Glu51, as opposed to the previously assigned Lys110 and Glu159 (or Glu210). This assignment allowed for a more complete view of catalysis. First, Lys110 initiates the reaction by donating a proton to the C2\u2019 carbonyl of the substrate, which allows the ring closure to occur and form the fleetingly stable I1 intermediate, which then undergoes decarboxlation to form the I2 intermediate. The I2 undergoes a reorientation in the active site to properly align it for dehydration assisted by the general acid and base, Lys53 and Glu51. This step renders the product and leaves Lys53 neutral allowing for efficient product release. \nFinally, the role of the active site loop residues in ssIGPS catalysis was examined. Lys53, the general acid in the dehydration step, is located on the dynamic \u03b21\u03b11 loop, and Phe89, important for substrate binding, is on the \u03b22\u03b12 loop. Arg54 and Asn90, also on these loops, were found to be coevolving by statistical coupling analysis (SCA), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations predicted their motions were also correlated. To further assess the role of these residues, kinetic analysis of amino acid substituted variants was performed. The results show that the interaction between Arg54 and Asn90 is important for the dehydration step of the reaction, mainly in the correct function of the general acid and base, Lys53 and Glu51. The results also suggest that these residues play a role in conformational exchange, as the effect on catalysis is temperature dependent, suggesting that thermal energy at higher temperatures can help to overcome their detrimental effect on catalysis. Together, these results provide a more complete understanding of ssIGPS catalysis. The results can be leveraged towards the design of novel enzymes as well as in the development of new antimicrobials.\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9029], "author_name_tesi": "Zaccardi, Margot Joan", "last_name_ssi": "Zaccardi", "middle_name_ssi": "Joan", "first_name_ssi": "Margot", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David D Boehr", "Scott A Showalter", "Philip C.

Future generations of Ni-base superalloys with increased service lifetimes and higher efficiencies will require the development of more complex, multi-component alloys carefully engineered to meet specific materials properties specifications, such as high temperature creep resistance.  This can only come from an intimate knowledge of the exact effects of each individual alloying element on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the Ni-base superalloys.  In this dissertation, two computational techniques have been employed to understand the alloying effects of various transition elements in Ni and its alloys.  Thermodynamics and phase stability has been investigated through use of the CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) modeling technique, supplemented by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT).  To better understand the kinetics involved in materials transport, the self-diffusion in ferromagnetic fcc Ni is calculated by first-principles, followed by a systematic investigation of the effects of 26 alloying elements on dilute Ni-rich binary alloys.  Mechanisms causing specific diffusion behavior are explored, and the usefullness of such a database of knowledge is demonstrated by applying the generated data to a secondary creep rate model to show how each alloying element affects the creep behavior of the dilute Ni alloy systems.  Finally, the next frontier of diffusion coefficient calculations by first-principles is explored by extending the calculation to non-dilute impurity concentrations, employing the fourteen-frequency model applied to the Ni-Al system.\n\nTo aid in the process of narrowing down the large composition space for the design of future Ni-base superalloys, a thermodynamic model using the CALPHAD approach is developed, where Gibbs energy functions of individual phases are parameterized based on fittings to experimentally measured phase equilibria or thermochemical data and computationally predicted thermochemical data.  Multi-component Ni-base superalloys can be accurately described within the CALPHAD approach through the extrapolation of the Gibbs energy functions of the simpler sub-systems which are modeled where experimental and computational data is usually more abundant.  The Re-Y and Re-Ti systems, integral binary alloy systems in the Ni-base superalloy database, are modeled in the present work.  Since little thermochemical data was available for either system, first-principles calculations were used to improve the thermodynamic models of the solid solution phases and the compounds.  Both phase diagrams show excellent agreement with available experimental phase equilibria data.  To further demonstrate the utility of first-principles calculations, an investigation on the phase stability of the ReTi compound is performed, because it was reported to have one crystal structure through experimental measurements and different crystal structure through first-principles calculations.  To demonstrate the ability of the CALPHAD method for successful extrapolation to higher order systems, the Ni-Re-Y is modeled by combining the Re-Y system with the previously modeled constituent binaries.  Good agreement is found with an experimental isothermal prediction of a two- and three- phase boundary at 1000 K.\n\nIn addition to studying thermodynamic and phase stability properties of Ni-base superalloys, this thesis also highlights the importance of the kinetic properties of these materials through their diffusion coefficients.  Vacancy mediated self-diffusion coefficients are calculated on ferromagnetic and non-magnetic fcc Ni as a function of temperature.  Within Eyring's reaction rate theory, minimum energy pathways for the diffusing atom is calculated using the Nudged Elastic Band method.  It is observed that ferromagnetism is necessary for reproducing both Arrhenius and thermodynamic diffusion parameters, while the corresponding non-magnetic calculations show significantly poorer agreement.  It is also observed that the use of the Debye-Grunseisen model for calculating the finite temperature entropic contributions to the diffusion coefficient reproduces the experimental self-diffusion more accurately than phonon calculations based on the supercell approach.  Reasons for this surprisingly result are discussed in detail.\n\nBased on the success of the first-principles calculation of self-diffusion coefficient in pure Ni, the approach using ferromagnetic spin polarization and the Debye-Grunseisen model to calculate the entropic contributions to the diffusion coefficient are employed for 26 alloying elements including: Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hf, Ir, Mn, Mo, Nb, Os, Pd, Pt, Re, Rh, Ru, Sc, Si, Ta, Tc, Ti, V, W, Y, Zn, and Zr.  The five-frequency model is implemented to accommodate the various jump frequencies associated with impurity diffusion coefficients in fcc Ni.  The present work demonstrates that the mid-row 5d transition row element impurities have the highest activation barriers for impurity diffusion, and subsequently are the slowest diffusers in Ni.  The fastest diffusers in Ni coupled with the lowest activation barriers for impurity diffusion are demonstrated to be at the far left of the 3d and 4d transition element rows on the periodic table.  The present work also demonstrates that the primary mechanism driving the variation in the impurity diffusion coefficient from element to element is the migration barrier for impurity diffusion.  In addition, the correlation of the impurity diffusion coefficients is not found to be to the size of the element as previously predicted in the literature, but rather, that the impurity diffusion coefficients have a much stronger correlation to the compressibility of the associated Ni-X dilute alloy.  A charge density analysis on the transition state of six of the twenty-six systems shows how the impurity affects surrounding Ni atoms.  \n\nAssessments of the validity of the five-frequency model and the relaxation techniques for the treatment of the maximum energy point along the diffusion pathway are discussed using the Ni-Al system as a model case.  First, an analysis of the assumptions made for the relaxation scheme of the three saddle configurations are made.   It is shown that by using a new relaxation scheme, the calculated impurity diffusion coefficient can be improved with respect to experimental data.  Additionally, an alternate calculation of the correlation factor for the impurity diffusion coefficient calculation is performed that assumes interactions of the solute and vacancy go beyond the first nearest neighbor shell.  The alternate method includes the jump frequency associated with the migration of the host atom in the presence of an impurity at a second nearest neighbor position, as opposed to the original method which assumes this type of jump is analogous to self-diffusion in the host system.  The result shows an increased agreement with the experimental data in the case of the Ni-Al system.\n\nIn order to provide quantitative measures for the improvement of future generations of Ni-base superalloys, a model from the literature for the secondary creep rate typically applied to Ni-base superalloys is selected.  The impurity diffusion results as a function of temperature are combined with previous first-principles calculations of elastic and stacking fault energy properties to predict a creep rate for each of the 26 systems normalized to the creep rate of pure Ni.  Results from the application of the creep model reveal similar results to the impurity diffusion coefficients in fcc Ni.  Mid-row 4d and 5d transition row element impurities decrease the creep rate compared when to pure Ni.  In particular, Mo, Tc, Ru, and Re impurities cause the dilute alloys to retain more creep resistance at higher temperatures.  Four elements that show significantly faster impurity diffusion coefficients relative to self-diffusion in pure Ni are Hf, Ti, Nb, and Ta.  The creep rates of these four elements, however, are equal to or slower than the creep rate of pure Ni, indicating greater influence from stacking fault energy and elastic properties on these dilute alloys.\n\nFinally, the first-principles methodology for calculating dilute impurity diffusion coefficients in Ni-X alloy systems is extended further to impurity diffusion in more concentrated Ni-X alloys systems.  The fourteen-frequency model is a natural extension of the five-frequency model to take solute-solute interactions into account.  Using the Ni-Al system as a benchmark, all of the atomic jump frequencies as a function of temperature associated with the proposed fourteen-frequency model for diffusion in non-dilute systems are calculated using the ferromagnetic spin polarization and the Debye-Grunseisen model approaches.  Solute and solvent enhancement factors to show the effect of impurity concentration on the diffusion coefficient are calculated.  The impurity diffusion coefficient is fit to an empirical equation to show its dependence on composition in terms of the solute and solvent enhancement factors.  Trends in the migration barriers and atomic jump frequencies for all fourteen jump frequencies are examined.\n\nThe goal of the present thesis is to provide a better understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of Ni-base alloys to aid in the future development of more advanced Ni-base superalloy systems.  The methodology, results, and analysis presented in this thesis provide a better understanding of the effects of alloying elements on the diffusion properties of dilute and non-dilute Ni alloys, and establish a benchmark for effects and trends of impurity diffusion in other magnetic alloy systems, such as bcc Fe as the host matrix.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7468], "author_name_tesi": "Zacherl, Chelsey Leanne", "last_name_ssi": "Zacherl", "middle_name_ssi": "Leanne", "first_name_ssi": "Chelsey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu", "Zi Kui Liu", "Long Qing Chen", "Paul Raymond Howell", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Paul Raymond Howell, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ni-base superalloys", "thermodynamic modeling", "self-diffusion", "impurity diffusion", "non-dilute impurity diffusion", "first-principles"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ALLIANCE BY TREATMENT EFFECTS IN \nGENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER\n\n", "id": "9070", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5592", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The therapeutic alliance is often regarded as the quintessential common factor.

This work includes:\n\n\u2022\tA hydrodynamic formulation for three-phase flow in pipes\n\u2022\tA thermodynamic model capable of performing two-phase and three-phase flow calculations in an accurate, fast and reliable manner.\n\n\u2022\tA new theoretical approach for determining flow pattern transitions in three-phase (gas-condensate-water) flow, and closure models that effectively handle different three-phase flow patterns and their transitions.\n\nThe unified two-fluid model developed herein is shown to be capable of handling systems exhibiting two-phase (gas-water and gas-condensate) and three-phase (gas-condensate-water) flow. Model predictions were compared against field and experimental data with excellent matches. \n\nThe hydrodynamic model allows: 1) the determination of flow reduction due to the condensation of liquid(s) in the pipe, 2) assessment of the potential for forming substances that might affect the integrity of the pipe, and 3) evaluation of the possible measures for improving the deliverability of the pipeline. \n\nThis work develops the framework for a robust thermodynamic-hydrodynamic model capable of simulating two and three-phase flow in typical gas transmission pipelines. The flow model developed herein represents an outstanding tool that allows engineers to improve the design of lines, liquid collection, and separation facilities.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3233], "author_name_tesi": "Zaghloul, Jose ", "last_name_ssi": "Zaghloul", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jose", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Adebola Adewumi", "Mku Thaddeus Ityokumbul", "Turgay Ertekin", "Robert W Watson", "Osama O Awadelkarim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Adebola Adewumi, Committee Chair", "Mku Thaddeus Ityokumbul, Committee Member", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Robert W Watson, Committee Member", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Three-Phase Flow", "Multiphase Flow", "Flow in pipes"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "SOLID CORE-SHELL DRUG NANOPARTICLES FOR THERAPEUTIC DELIVERY \n", "id": "7437", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "383", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Solid core-shell drug nanoparticles are poised to offer a solution to the challenges faced with the conventional administration of therapeutic agents.  Engineering drug delivery carriers that can selectively target the diseased tissue, reduce systemic toxicity, increase drug absorption, and locally control the release of the drug are current unmet medical needs.  One area that has generated much interest in the past 25 years is the delivery of anti-cancer agents.  Core-shell drug nanoparticles can provide a new method in encapsulating anti-cancer agents within a polymeric nanometer sized shell while retaining the therapeutic agents\u2019 biological activity. \nThe focus of this dissertation was twofold: to fabricate solid core drug nanoparticles from water insoluble therapeutic agents and to encapsulate the nanoparticles within a polymeric nanometer scale shell, the nanoshell.  The nanoshell composed of multilayer polyelectrolytes serves as a reactive surface which can be chemically modified with targeting ligands to assist the carrier in overcoming biological barriers.  Nanoparticles of dexamethasone and paclitaxel, the chosen therapeutic agents, were prepared by a modified emulsification-solvent evaporation technique.  Size analysis of the solid core nanoparticles was determined by laser light scattering, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  These three methods confirmed that the size of the core was within a range of 100-200 nm and with approximately an average size of 150 nm.  This method in preparing solid core nanoparticles can be extended to additional therapeutic agents with limited water solubility for the treatment of other aliments.\nElectrostatic Layer-by-Layer self-assembly was used as a method for encapsulating solid core drug nanoparticles within nanoshells composed of multilayer polyelectrolytes. The surface and bulk morphologies of the encapsulated drug nanoparticles were determined by TEM indicated that a nanoshell composed of two polyelectrolyte layers of poly (allylamine hydrochloride) and poly (styrene sulfonate) was approximately 10 nm thick.  The nanoscale precision achieved with LbL assembly provides control of surface properties of the core-shell carrier, which is important in the design of an efficacious delivery system.\n The exterior surface of the nanoshell was functionalized with biocompatible polymer poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) to create a stealth drug delivery carrier.  In vitro studies were performed and results showed that a PEG modified nanoshell can reduce the uptake of core-shell nanoparticles after 24 hours of incubation with phagocytic cells.  In another in vitro study, the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel core-shell nanoparticles was retained upon fabrication and encapsulation within the polymeric nanoshells.  Prolonged treatment with paclitaxel led to cell death by apoptosis or necrosis as evidenced by confocal microscopy.  Finally, a targeted drug delivery system of core-shell nanoparticles was achieved by the chemical modification of a lipophilic nanoshell with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) protein.  This protein was chosen because its receptor has been found to be overexpressed in many disease states including high grade brain tumors.  The work presented in this thesis advances the field of nanotechnology by providing new strategies towards engineering surfaces on colloidal carriers for the selective and stealth delivery of water-insoluble therapeutic agents to diseased tissue.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [378], "author_name_tesi": "Zahr, Alisar ", "last_name_ssi": "Zahr", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alisar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Pishko", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Themis Matsoukas", "Andrew Zydney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Pishko, Committee Chair", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanoparticles", "drug delivery", "cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MODULATION OF THE NEONATAL T CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNE RESPONSE BY MATERNALLY DERIVED STRESS HORMONES", "id": "8480", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2315", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A simple National Library of Medicine title search for the term \u201cpsychological stress\u201d returns over 1400 titles, the majority of which address the impact of stress on the adult immune system.  Despite this plethora of psychological stress-related publications, only a handful address the impact of stress on neonatal immunity.  Neonates are vaccinated within hours of delivery to generate an immune response that is maintained in some instances for the remainder of the individual\u2019s life.  Neonates begin to receive vaccinations while they are almost entirely dependent on their mother for nutrition and care.  Maternally derived hormones, reflecting the mother\u2019s psychological and physical conditions, are passed to the neonate via the breast milk.  This passage could potentially expose the neonate to several immunomodulatory peptides, namely glucocorticoids and epinephrine.  These hormones are known to hinder the adult immune response in the context of infection.  The neonate is no exception, as exposure to maternally derived stress hormones hinders the primary T cell mediated adaptive immune response to herpes simplex virus type-1 infection (HSV-1).  Neonatal exposure to stress-like levels of glucocorticoids increased HSV-related morbidity and mortality via type II glucocorticoid receptor dependent mechanisms.  When examined ex vivo, this exposure 1) reduced overall splenic cellularity, 2) hindered the ability to CTL to expand clonally, 3) express adequate levels of IL2R&#945;, 4) lyse HSV-infected cells, and 5) produce pro-inflammatory cytokines.  The hindrance of the primary immune response to HSV-1 infection is extended to the CTL memory repertoire.  Moreover, these effects on the primary and memory HSV-specific T cell repertoires were reversed with the administration of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist.  The administration of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist prevented the HSV-related mortality.  These findings clearly demonstrate a role for glucocorticoids in the modulation of the neonatal immune system in response to infection.  These findings warrant an in-depth review of the clinical practices related to neonatal immunization.  Moreover, these findings also shed some light on the importance of managing post-partum maternal stress as exposure of the neonate to maternally derived hormones imprints the neonate\u2019s immune system with both immediate and lifelong consequences.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2300], "author_name_tesi": "Zahwa, Hassan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zahwa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hassan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ralph Lauren Keil", "Todd Schell", "Joan S Long", "Robert Harold Bonneau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "Joan S Long, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["stress", "neonatal immune", "T cell adaptive immunity", "Herpes Simplex Virus", "maternal stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Evolutionary Inference of the Human Facial Form: Insights from the Genotype-Phenotype Interface", "id": "2v23vt37b", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12661", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The human face contains important organs which perform vital functions such as eating and breathing, sensory functions such as seeing and smelling, as well as signaling sex, emotions, and identity.

In this dissertation, I have investigated the evolutionary genetics of certain aspects of the three-dimensional shape of the human face. In chapter one, I provide a literature review of the various hypotheses regarding the evolution of facial shape and the current evidence supporting them. In chapter two, I used a quantitative genetic framework to test the hypothesis that human variation in the shape of the nose seems to have been influenced by local adaptation to temperature. The results from this chapter suggest that the evolution of certain aspects of human nose shape, such as nostril size and nasal ridge may have been driven by local adaptation to temperature. In chapter three, I used an admixture mapping approach to identify three genomic loci associated with nose shape variation in a sample of individuals with mixed African and European ancestry. The nearest genes to the admixture peaks are LHX8 (LIM Homeobox 8), MITF (Micropthalmia-associated transcription factor), and, UACA (Uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats).

In generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), ToM is likely to be conditional on the degree of individuals\u2019 state worry, a hallmark symptom. However, no experiments have directly tested such interactional hypotheses, and used ToM as a framework to advance understanding of social cognition in GAD. This study aimed to address this gap by primarily examining the interactional effect of state worry and trait GAD. Method: 171 participants (69 GAD, 102 Controls) were randomly assigned to either a Worry or Relaxation induction and completed two well-validated ToM decoding (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test) and reasoning (Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition) tasks. Results: Clinical trait GAD significantly interacted with state worry to predict accuracy of overall reasoning, cognitive-reasoning, positive-reasoning, and negative-reasoning ToM. Worry, as opposed to relaxation, led GAD sufferers to display more accurate overall reasoning and cognitive-reasoning ToM than controls, especially for negative signals. GAD participants who worried, but not relaxed, were also significantly better than the norm at interpreting negative signals. These findings remained after controlling for gender, executive function, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms. For other ToM abilities, mean scores of persons with and without GAD who either worried or relaxed were normative. Limitations: The ToM reasoning measure lacked self-reference, and these preliminary findings warrant replication. Conclusions: Theoretical implications, such as the state worry-contingent nature of ToM in GAD, and clinical implications are discussed.

Scholars have equated contentment with passivity, resignation, and stagnation. However, this dissertation excavates an early modern understanding of contentment as dynamic, protective, and productive. Derived from the Latin contentus, which means both contained and satisfied, contentment is an affective state that holds the individual together\u2014a defense against fickle fortune and unruly passions. With roots in classical and medieval philosophy, contentment became newly significant because of the tremendous cultural changes wrought by the Reformation. Christian contentment became the lens through which to view the relationship between self and world more benignly than English Protestantism typically allowed. Through sermons, translations, and treatises, writers represented contentment as a means for the godly individual to endure and engage the outside world. These efforts to reform contentment in turn invited a response from playwrights, poets, and authors of prose romance. The dissertation argues that authors used pastoral to intervene in an extensive Reformation conversation about contentment that related the armature of the self to the architecture of society. Specifically, this dissertation shows that pastoral is the primary literary mode through which Renaissance authors engage contentment, resulting in strikingly different forms of the concept: Sidney\u2019s eroticized yet ethical contentment; Spenser\u2019s intertextual contentment; Shakespeare\u2019s communal contentment; and Milton\u2019s anti-imperialist contentment. The dissertation\u2019s focus on the pastoral mode and analysis of early modern texts in light of recent affect theory contribute to ongoing studies of literature, religion, and positive affect in the English Renaissance.

These narratives create the myths of national origins and seek to tell the story of a national community\u2019s evolution through time to its moment of self-awareness. Literature then, which is often composed of narratives, lends itself well to the telling of national histories and provides the means to create cultural meaning and aid in the construction of national communities. \n\nThe ascendant narrative of German nationhood during the first half of the nineteenth century was ethnocultural. Conceptions of nation and national community were based around notions of common ancestry and similarity of culture and language. This narrative was created out of a desire to resurrect a German national past which linked the German nationalist project to Protestantism through such figures as Martin Luther who fought against papal despotism and translated the Bible into German, and to middle-class, bourgeois values, since middle-class, intellectual men were the main proponents and champions of German nationalism. This also meant that German nationalism was conceived of in gendered terms, where ideally, men would occupy and have access to the public sphere and women would be relegated to the private sphere. \n\nThis dissertation aims to look at the proliferation of meanings of Germanness and investigate the diversity and fluidity of national belonging in the Vorm\u00e4rz period (1815-1848) of German history through the examination of three novels written by three different German women, Fanny Lewald, Ida Hahn-Hahn and Louise Aston. Writing in the Vorm\u00e4rz period leading up to the Revolution of 1848, these women writers offer an interesting cross-section of nineteenth-century German society. Their novels accentuate the intersection of gender, class and religion and thus provide a good model for examining difference among women writers, as well as, the creation of alternative narratives of German national identity. Through the examination of these texts, one can explore the ways in which marginal groups engaged and critiqued this dominant vision of national identity and how they attempted to write a place for themselves in the German nation. Thus, my analysis presents one with the range of meanings of Germanness and allows one to see the multiplicity of voices which are always present in any debate.    \n\nThis study aims to expand on the growing body of work which is being done on nineteenth century German women writers. It also attempts to synthesize issues, such as gender, class and religion in women\u2019s writing, which are often examined individually, but rarely in conjunction with one another. Further, it explores how women were able to create a public space for themselves through literature and engage in the culturally and politically charged discourses of the day. Feminist scholars owe much to the plight of these women and in analyzing their texts, one can gain a better understanding as to how diverse women positioned themselves vis \u00e1 vis an emerging nationalist discourse that sought to exclude them from political participation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5092], "author_name_tesi": "Zajdowicz, Rebecca Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Zajdowicz", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Greg Eghigian", "Dr Martina Kolb"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Chair", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member", "Greg Eghigian, Committee Member", "Dr Martina Kolb, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ida Hahn-Hahn", "Louise Aston", "Fanny Lewald", "nationalism", "German literature", "Vorm\u00e4rz"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Analytical Modeling and Thermodynamic Analysis of Thermal Response in Horizontal Wellbores", "id": "14498", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7427", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A comprehensive thermodynamic analysis is conducted to aid the interpretation of thermal responses from horizontal wells.

The thermal response model proposed by this study starts with Euler\u2018s fluid flow governing equations in their one dimensional, single-phase form. By utilizing all three mass, momentum and energy balance equations, and thermodynamic considerations, pressure and temperature responses are coupled. A solution procedure involving a semi-analytical approach is proposed for the prediction of temperature and pressure traces during fluid flow in a horizontal wellbore. In this study, steady-state, single-phase flow is considered during parametric studies. It is observed that fluid temperature response mimics the pressure profile in the wellbore regardless of the fluid type and sign of the JT coefficient. Water flowing temperature is shown to be the least sensitive to fluid flow conditions, closely followed by oil. Gas flowing temperature exhibits the largest sensitivity to flow conditions. Overall behavior is a strong function to the isentropic thermal coefficient of the fluid.

The experience of India and other countries shows that returning well-educated emigrants, despite their small numbers, can make a difference.\nThe first part of this dissertation builds a model of \"local\" knowledge spillovers, in which migration of a small number of highly skilled individuals greatly affects country-level human capital accumulation. All economic activity occurs in pairs of individuals randomly matched to each other. Each pair produces the consumption good; the skills of the two partners are complementary.\nAt the same time, the less skilled partner increases human capital by learning from the more skilled colleague. With poor institutions at home, highly skilled individuals leave the country seeking better opportunities abroad. On the contrary, improved institutions foster return migration of emigrants who have acquired more knowledge while abroad. These return migrants greatly amplify the positive effect of better institutions.\n\nIn the second part of the dissertation, I empirically analyze the propensity of US immigrants to return. Today, little is known about the returnees: who are they and how do they compare to those who did not return? How does their decision to return depend on economic situation at home? To identify return migration, I use the method adopted from Van Hook et.al. (2006). The method is based the U.S. Current Population Survey (CPS) which interviews households for two consecutive years. About a quarter of foreign-born individuals drop out of the sample between the first and the second years, due to various causes including return migration. After eliminating all other causes of dropout, I estimate the propensity of immigrants to return, depending on personal and home country characteristics. I find that the difference between recent immigrants and other immigrants is greater than the difference between men and women, or skilled and unskilled migrants. Thus, assimilation differentiates immigrants more in their decision to return than education or gender. In particular, distance to home country negatively affects return propensity of those who arrived over 10 years ago, and has no effect on recent immigrants.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5238], "author_name_tesi": "Zakharenko, Roman L", "last_name_ssi": "Zakharenko", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Roman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barry William Ickes", "Gordon F De Jong", "Andres Rodriguez Clare", "James R.

In addition, ROS/RNS are important members of cellular signaling pathways, particularly those leading to the inducible activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u00eaB).  NF-\u00eaB is a redox sensitive transcription factor, which is associated with the expression of various immediate-early genes including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The products of these enzymes, prostaglandins and NO, together with the acute phase cytokines regulate the initiation and duration of the inflammatory response. Thus, the excess production of ROS/RNS by macrophages may contribute significantly to the pathophysiology of inflammatory disorders if it is not carefully controlled by cellular antioxidant defense systems.\n\tTo further explore the role of selenium (Se) status in macrophage immune function, the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line was cultured in media deficient of or supplemented with sodium selenite. The activity of Se \u2013dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPx)  was monitored to confirm deficiency. At least an 8-fold difference in the enzyme activity was confirmed and maintained throughout several passages. Fluorescent labeling and flow cytometric analysis confirmed a higher degree of oxidative stress in the Se deficient group prior to any stimulus.\n\tFollowing stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, Se deficient macrophages were shown to express higher levels of the key inflammatory enzymes, COX-2 and iNOS as assessed by mRNA, protein and enzyme activity. To determine the role of NF-\u00eaB in the over expression of these enzymes, it was assessed at the level of nuclear translocation, binding and initiation of transcription. At three levels were NF-\u00eaB was up regulated in the Se-deficient macrophages as compared to the Se-supplemented cells, suggesting that it is involved in the up regulation of key enzymes associated with inflammatory response. To confirm NF-\u00eaB involvement, luciferase reporter constructs for COX-2 and iNOS were generated and assessed via transient transfection in both Se-deficient and Se-supplemented group. Deletion or truncation of NF-\u00eaB binding sites from the promoters resulted in significant decreases in luciferase activity. Furthermore, upstream mediators, MEKK1, NIK, IKKb and I\u00eaBa were detected at higher levels in the Se-deficient macrophages. A greater degree of  serine phosphorylation of MEKK1 and also serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of I\u00eaBa was observed in deficient conditions, as well. When the Se deficient macrophages were repleted with Se, restoration of  Se-GPx activity was observed, along with decreased levels of MEKK-1, p-I\u00eaBa and COX-2, comparable to that of the  Se-supplemented cultures.\n\tIn conclusion, these results suggest a role for Se in the regulation of NF-kB and subsequent expression of COX-2 and iNOS in a macrophage cell line. While the exact target or mechanism of Se regulation has not been fully identified in this model, the data suggest that it may be at the level of kinases upstream of NF-\u00eaB, notably MEKK1.  \n     These findings support the data of other studies in this field and highlight the importance of Se status in cellular redox signaling.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1926], "author_name_tesi": "Zamamiri-Davis, Faith Alexandria", "last_name_ssi": "Zamamiri-Davis", "middle_name_ssi": "Alexandria", "first_name_ssi": "Faith", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lorraine Sordillo Gandy", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Madhu Reddy", "Andrew Thomas Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lorraine Sordillo Gandy, Committee Member", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Committee Member", "Madhu Reddy, Committee Chair", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["inflammation", "free radicals", "transcription factor", "macrophage", "oxidative stress", "selenium"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Hydrocarbon cracking over a solid acid for endothermic fuel systems: A study of sub-micron particles and synthesized large zeolite crystals", "id": "14373taz131", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14373", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Storable liquid hydrocarbon fuels can undergo endothermic reactions and provide an additional heat sink to enable hypersonic flight without having to resort to cryogenic fuels such as liquid hydrogen.  In this dissertation, the endothermic potential of small n-alkane cracking over HZSM-5 was measured utilizing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The study of both propane and n-butane cracking over HZSM-5 revealed that a decrease in space velocity increased the paraffin to olefin (P/O) ratio. Longer exposure times of hydrocarbon to cracking temperatures allow for secondary reactions to take place, which produce products that tend toward the exothermic equilibrium products and decrease the endotherm. Results also show that the heat of reaction measured by mass balance/product distribution (indirect) and calorimetry (direct) are in close\u2028agreement as long as the carbon balance can be closed.\nSingle large-body zeolite crystals of MFI have been synthesized and studied for a fundamental understanding of their structure-function relationship. The nature of acid sites present in both sub-micron sized and the synthesized single-large body ZSM-5 crystals were characterized using 27Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) and Fourier transformed infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopies. For acid site density measurements, adsorption of simple amines including, isopropylamine (IPA) and pyridine were examined in both sub-micron sized and synthetic single-large body ZSM-5 crystals using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). For each amine, an adsorption state corresponding to a coverage of about one molecule per aluminum atom was identified. The Si/Al ratio of each sample was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and was in close agreement to the acid site densities measured using TPD-TGA. The spatial distribution of aluminum content was mapped in the synthetic single large-body ZSM-5 crystals using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) showing that Al is invariably concentrated in the rim portion of the crystals.  These results implied that the acid sites were accessible in single large-body zeolites so long as the probe molecule was small enough to fit inside the zeolite cavities independent of particle size.\nSingle large-body zeolite crystals of faujasite (FAU) have been synthesized and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed the presence of both cubic (FAU) and hexagonal (EMT) structural phases. While it is known that FAU and EMT components segregate into contiguous blocks in materials like Y, CSZ-1, CSZ-3, ZSM-2, ZSM-3, ZSM-20, ECR-35, ECR-30 and EMC-2, such intergrowth has not been previously reported in large synthetic crystals.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14961], "author_name_tesi": "Zaman, Taslima Ahmed", "last_name_ssi": "Zaman", "middle_name_ssi": "Ahmed", "first_name_ssi": "Taslima", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert M.
