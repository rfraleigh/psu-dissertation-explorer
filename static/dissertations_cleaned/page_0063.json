Other patients are also exposed to unloading from neurological disease, extended bed-rest, weight-bearing limitations associated with fractures, and aging. Together, osteopenia and sarcopenia result in decreased function, increased injury risk and higher morbidity rates once patients begin to re-ambulate and muscle and bone are reloaded. While countermeasures exist for bone loss or muscle loss in isolation, the developing concept that muscle and bone are intricately linked more than anatomically shows a clear demand for a better understanding of the bone-muscle inter-relationship. This may result in more effective treatments being developed against catabolic conditions, such as those experienced during spaceflight, for both tissues. \n\n\tThe relationship between bone and muscle is not well understood, but a growing field of research suggests it is more complicated than the shared physical interaction. The objective of this dissertation is to characterize bone-muscle interactions and determine their interdependence during exposure to stressors analogous to space travel, notably the catabolic environment of unloading, the increased exposure to space radiation, and during re-ambulation following a period of decreasing structure and function. To address these objectives, we utilized a murine model of ground based simulated microgravity referred to as hind limb suspension (HLS), in conjunction with simulated space radiation, and a non-invasive model of tibia compression loading. Our central hypothesis is that unloading induced sarcopenia is at least partially dependent on unloading induced osteopenia, and unloading induced osteopenia is at least partially dependent on unloading induced sarcopenia; similarly, recovery of muscle during reloading is at least partially dependent on bone, and recovery of bone during reloading is at least partially dependent on muscle. \n\n\tTo test our central hypothesis we examined three specific aims: 1) Determine if protecting against bone loss during HLS would also protect against muscle loss utilizing a bone SOST deficient mouse model; 2) Characterize the musculoskeletal changes in response to HLS in conjunction simulated space radiation; and 3) Determine the timeline of musculoskeletal changes during a re-ambulatory period with additional compressive loading to facilitate bone recovery.\n\n\tWe conducted specific aim 1 by utilizing a C57BL/6 background mouse globally deficient in the SOST gene, resulting in a Sclerostin deficiency. Tissues were collected from knockout (KO) and wildtype (WT) animals after undergoing 2 weeks of HLS unloading or regularly loaded ground control conditions. Results showed that SOST KO mice displayed a baseline phenotype with larger bone, less lean body mass and more fat body mass compared to WT mice. WT mice showed significant deleterious effects on bone, while SOST KO mice were protected from bone loss during HLS. However, the protective effect on bone did not transfer to muscle. SOST KO mice were sarcopenic at baseline compared to controls, and were not protected from further muscle loss during HLS. Interestingly, the decrease in protein synthesis provided by HLS was prevented in SOST KO mice, but this did not translate to the preservation of muscle mass. Mechanical testing showed greater failure strength and stiffness in SOST KO mice compared to WT, and no change in mechanical properties as a result of HLS in either group. These results show that while Sclerostin deficiency is effective in mitigating bone loss, it does not protect against muscle loss and may have a detrimental effect on body composition. This specific aim highlights a disconnect between muscle and bone during unloading. \n\n\tSpecific aim 2 examined the HLS model with the addition of simulated space radiation, conditions that more closely resemble the catabolic variables experienced by astronauts during spaceflight. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to proton radiation, and proton in combination with high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) (O16) radiation during HLS. Tissues collected after 2 weeks of unloading showed that HLS had substantial effects on both bone and muscle. 50 cGy of proton radiation had no additional effect on bone or muscle of mice that underwent HLS. However, 50 cGy proton in combination with 10 cGy O16 radiation did alter bone outcomes. For example, additional trabecular bone loss was observed for bone volume fraction (-20%), trabecular number (-12%), trabecular separation (+12%), connectivity density (-29%), and tissue mineral density (-13%) in mice receiving proton+HZE radiation compared to either the HLS alone or HLS+proton groups. In contrast, while protein synthesis and muscle mass were consistently lower in all three HLS groups compared to ground control (GC) groups (~40%), they were not affected further by radiation. These results indicate that radiation in representative amounts to 400 days of space flight can sensitize bone, but not muscle, to the catabolic effects on unloading. Therefore, specific aim 2 provides another example of a disconnect between bone and muscle during unloading and space radiation.\n\n\tSpecific aim 3 examined the time course of bone and muscle recovery during a re-ambulatory period following a period of unloading. Adult C57BL/6 mice underwent 2 weeks of HLS unloading before being returned to regularly loaded conditions. During reloading, the right limb of mice that had undergone HLS received additional mechanical compression loading to facilitate bone recovery, while the left limb served as a contralateral control and was not loaded. Tissues were collected at the conclusion of HLS (day 14), and during re-ambulation time-points (day 28, and day 56). Our data indicated that 2 weeks of HLS causes catabolic changes to both bone and muscle. For trabecular bone, these losses were partially recovered with re-ambulation alone, but were fully recovered with the addition of acute mechanical compression loading. For example, trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) showed a -50% decrease from baseline after HLS which was partially recovered (-37% from baseline) in the left limb and fully recovered to GC values in the right limb that was mechanically loaded. For cortical bone, we showed a delayed response to HLS observed during the re-ambulation period that has not been previously reported; these data indicated the catabolic insult of HLS on cortical bone is not detectable immediately following unloading. Furthermore, the catabolic changes in some cortical outcomes were mitigated by acute compression loading. In contrast, muscle mass recovery was not facilitated in the mechanically loaded limb and showed a decline with loading at the later day 56 time point. Specific aim 3 was a third example of an apparent disconnect between bone and muscle during a period of recovery. \n\n\tTo conclude, our results show that while Sclerostin deficiency is an effective method of preventing bone loss, it did not protect against muscle loss. We also showed that simulated space radiation and HLS unloading cause a cumulative loss for some bone outcomes, while muscle appears less sensitive to the additional catabolic insult of radiation. Finally, we described the time course of bone and muscle recovery following unloading. These results indicate that muscle recovers more quickly than bone during re-ambulation, similar to catabolic observations preceding bone loss during an unloading period. Furthermore, limbs receiving mechanical loading displayed facilitated bone recovery compared to the non-loaded limb, but aided recovery was not detectable in muscle. Data from specific aim 1, 2 and 3 interpreted together indicate a disconnect between bone and muscle in these examples of simulated spaceflight environments as well as re-ambulation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15612], "author_name_tesi": "Krause, Andrew Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Krause", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry Donahue", "Charles H Lang", "Patricia Mclaughlin", "Gregory Stephen Lewis", "Gail Doreen Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry Donahue, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles H Lang, Committee Chair", "Patricia Mclaughlin, Committee Member", "Gregory Stephen Lewis, Committee Member", "Gail Doreen Thomas, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hind Limb Suspension", "Space Radiation", "Unloading", "Mechanical Loading", "Sclerostin", "HLS", "Bone", "Muscle", "Compression"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Effects of Glycyrrhetinic Acid on Bone Loss Induced by Mechanical Unloading", "id": "21518", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9919", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Introduction: The societal factors in bone loss are numerous, ranging from old age to space flight.  Although several treatment themes are available for bone loss, there continues to be a demand for new ideas as well as a better understanding of the topic.  A novel treatment approach to attenuate bone loss has emerged in gap junction manipulation, specifically the knockout of bone specific connexin 43 proteins which make up gap junctions.  Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) has been shown as a non-specific gap junction inhibitor, and may also be an anti-inflammatory.  Thus, we hypothesized that GA may be an effective tool in attenuating bone loss during periods of bone unloading, as in bed ridden patients or spaceflight.  We hypothesized that GA administration at 20mg/kg would block gap junction function, and attenuate bone loss induced by hind limb suspension (HLS) unloading. \n\tDesign: A randomized controlled trial was designed with twenty five male wild-type C57C1/BJ mice of skeletally mature age (6 months), and placed into 5 groups: ground control, ground control GA treatment, HLS no treatment, HLS vehicle, and HLS GA treatment.  Experimental protocol utilized mechanical unloading based on a 3 week duration of HLS and GA intervention via subcutaneous injection; the ground control groups were not mechanically unloaded.\n\tAssessments: Animals were evaluated primarily using MicroCT scan to evaluate physical characteristics of bone in the femur.  Mechanical testing based on three point bending, and monitoring of basic body composition were also evaluated.\n\tConclusions: The original hypothesis predicted that GA treatment during HLS would result in an attenuation of bone loss.  HLS alone does cause significant changes in several microarchitecture parameters, such as a 60% decrease in trabecular BV/TV, when compared to ground control 38%.  However, our results did not show significant changes in MicroCT results between suspended control and suspended GA treatment groups; changes in bone characteristics were similar across all unloaded mice.  GA ground control mice did not show significant differences from ground controls not receiving GA.  Our hypothesis that GA would attenuate bone loss during unloading was not supported.      \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9651], "author_name_tesi": "Krause, Andrew Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Krause", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wesley Edward Donahue", "Patricia Mclaughlin", "Charles H Lang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wesley Edward Donahue, Thesis Advisor", "Patricia Mclaughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Charles H Lang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mechanical Unloading", "GA", "HLS", "Glycyrrhetinic", "bone loss"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Continuing Professional Education of Insurance and Risk Management Practitioners: A Comparative Case Study of Customer Service Representatives, Insurance Agents and Risk Managers", "id": "10416", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2036", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to understand how selected insurance practitioners learn and developed in their practices setting.

Such knowledge would substantially improve the prognosis and treatment of individuals subject to conditions causing loss of lean body mass.  Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to examine the mechanisms responsible for changes in protein metabolism underlying atrophy using a model of reduced skeletal muscle loading, hindlimb immobilization.  Rats were unilaterally casted for up to five days.  In the casted limb, gastrocnemius wet weight decreased after three days and thereafter remained constant.  Further analysis revealed that this loss of muscle mass was the result of integrated atrophy and growth failure, and demonstrated that there was no defect in the rate of protein synthesis and essential regulators of translation at day five.  This muscle atrophy was partially rescued in vivo with a potent proteasome inhibitor and was associated with enhanced mRNA expression of factors that contribute to ubiquitin - proteasome dependent degradation, including the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases MAFbx/Atrogin-1 and MuRF1.  The precise means by which the expression of these ubiquitin ligases is controlled is unknown.  For this reason, additional investigations using an in vitro model system of skeletal muscle were performed to expand upon the understanding of the cellular signaling events regulating their expression.  C2C12 myotubes were treated individually with several AMPK activators, resulting in a dose- and time-dependent modulation of mRNA content of MAFbx/Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 (characterized by an acute repression preceding a sustained induction).  These treatments in conjunction with dexamethasone produced a pronounced synergistic effect on ligase mRNA expression at later time points.  Stimulation of AMPK activity in vivo via AICAR injection recapitulated the stimulation of MAFbx/Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression observed in culture.  These data suggest AMPK may be a critical component of the intercalated network of signaling pathways governing skeletal muscle atrophy.  In total, the work completed within this thesis has enhanced the understanding of processes fundamental to protein balance (synthesis and degradation) during conditions of skeletal muscle atrophy and identified an additional signaling mechanism which may account for several of the phenotypes displayed by atrophic skeletal muscle.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [691], "author_name_tesi": "Krawiec, Brian ", "last_name_ssi": "Krawiec", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles H Lang", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Thomas C Vary", "Yuk Chow Ng", "Peter A Farrell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles H Lang, Committee Chair", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Committee Chair", "Thomas C Vary, Committee Member", "Yuk Chow Ng, Committee Member", "Peter A Farrell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["eukaryotic initiation factor", "translation", "disuse", "muscle", "protein synthesis", "proteolysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Cleanup of Biomass Gasification Effluent Using M-doped Ceria Catalysts", "id": "22556", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10152", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Biomass conversion to liquid fuels may be accomplished through gasification to syngas followed by fuel synthesis processes, enabling a renewable energy source of liquid fuels. Prior to fuel synthesis catalysis, the syngas must be cleaned of sulfur and tar species. In a Department of Energy forecast for 2012, approximately 50% of the cost to produce ethanol through biomass gasification is involved in syngas cleanup. A tar reforming catalyst that can operate at high gasifier effluent temperatures and tolerate or, ideally act as a sulfur sorbent as well would help to reduce this cost associated with syngas cleanup. Ceria-based mixtures have shown promise in being able to reform hydrocarbons and remove sulfur at high temperatures.\n\nThis dissertation employs computational chemistry methods to design a ceria-based catalyst that can reform hydrocarbons into CO and H2 as well as remove sulfur at high temperatures, thus making biomass gasification-based processes viable. Density functional theory (DFT+U) is used to generate structure-composition-function relationships for H2S adsorption and hydrocarbon conversion. Transition metals can be doped into ceria to alter its reducibility and hydrocarbon activity. Considering all of the transition metals, we find the methane adsorption energy correlates with the oxygen vacancy formation energy for M-doped CeO2. Using this correlation, the methane conversion rate follows a volcano relationship with surface reducibility. One of the dopants near the top of this volcano relationship is Mn, and to correctly represent the electronic structure of Mn-doped ceria, a correction to the energy of electrons in localized Mn d-states must be used. We utilized Mn-doped ceria as a system of focus to evaluate how this correction parameter, as well as the concentration and structure of Mn in the surface, affects the hydrocarbon activity. Employing the most stable structure of Mn-doped ceria and Zr-doped ceria, the reforming of propane over the surfaces are examined, along with developing an approach to model the complete oxidation of large hydrocarbons over an oxide.

The results show that people who currently smoke were more likely to have SPD (POR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.15-3.20) and smoke more cigarettes per day (POR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04), however place of residence was not a significant modifying factor for either (p= 0.56 and p=0.62, respectively).  No significant associations were found with smoking intensity and quit attempt status.

The dissertation aligns performance-art pedagogy with critical pedagogy investigating how it creates transformation and reflection for involved participants. It defines the parameters of an educational performance within a performance-art pedagogical space, clarifying the terms: unsettled space, unsettled content, liminal and performantivity, as they relate to the functioning model of performance-art pedagogy. The researcher used an Arts-based inquiry methodology entering the site as an artist/teacher/research.  \nThe philosophical frame aligns itself with radical pedagogical theory that believes education is not a place for the reinscription of knowledge but a place for individual engagement where personal narratives are in concert with ideas (past, present, future) in relation to current culture. The overall purpose of the work is to assist teachers in comprehending the foundational theory and supporting pillars of a performance art pedagogical space to assist educators in implementing similar strategies within their own classrooms.\n\nResearch Introduction\nThe researcher was invited to a central Pennsylvania high school to introduce performance-art to a group of 24 advanced studio art students for 1 hour a day for 15-days. The in-service consisted of 4 introductory workshops on movement/pathways, sound, tableaux and Happenings followed by additional studio days, culminating in three performance art pieces that were performed for the school. Post in-service the researcher interviewed 6 participants: 1 non-participating student, 2 participating students, 2 teachers and 2 administrators who were asked the following questions:\n\u2022\tWhat are the benefits of performance work in the classroom, what are the difficulties?\n\n\u2022\tHow do you feel the performances, enriched you, the students attending, the teachers the school administrators and the institution? For example, increasing the discussion between students about topics not normally discussed.\n\n\u2022\tWhat were your \"ah ha\" moments, whether pro or con, during your involvement in this project? Please consider these three areas of reflection: personal, curricular (what was being taught) and pedagogical  (how it was being taught).  \n\nThe interviewees' responses were then analyzed by using the following questions as filters:\n\u2022\tWhat elements are present in a performance-based pedagogy that distinguish it as\n a form of critical pedagogy?\n\n\u2022\tWhat aspects of a performed pedagogy open up dialogical arenas both personal and institutional? \n\n\u2022\tWhat constitutes an educational performance?\n\n\u2022\tWhat assists in the promotion of reflexivity?\n\nResearch Outcome\nThrough the analysis of the data a visual model emerged that highlights how the pedagogy forms a variety of non-static relationships that promote performative engagements toward transformation both personal and institutional. The secondary finding is the transparent nature of performance-art pedagogy both in use of media and method, which lays a foundation for the possibility of reflexivity by participants and audience members. The co-opting of the a/r/tography methodology is also applied to the student within this work showing how an additional layer of reflexivity can occur due to the student's engagement as an artist, teacher and researcher within the pedagogy.\n\n \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5103], "author_name_tesi": "Kredell, Renee ", "last_name_ssi": "Kredell", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Renee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius", "Vincent M Colapietro", "Charles Richard Garoian", "Christine Marme Thompson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Dissertation Advisor", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Committee Chair", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Member", "Charles Richard Garoian, Committee Member", "Christine Marme Thompson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["performance art", "radical pedagogy", "performance-based pedagogy", "public scholarship"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "URBAN POPULATION DYNAMICS IN A PREINDUSTRIAL NEW WORLD CITY:  MORBIDITY, MORTALITY, AND IMMIGRATION IN POSTCLASSIC CHOLULA", "id": "11044", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4261", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\nIt has long been argued that preindustrial cities were unhealthy environments that facilitated the transmission of infectious disease.  As a result, Early Modern London and other Old World cities were assumed to have had such high mortality rates that deaths greatly surpassed births, resulting in negative intrinsic population growth.  Consequently, preindustrial cities were believed to be \u201cpopulation sinks\u201d dependent on immigration from rural areas to increase in size.  While this vision of preindustrial cities has gained widespread acceptance, it has not gone unchallenged, on both theoretical and evidentiary grounds. \n\nThe current investigation contributes to this debate by examining urban population dynamics in the prehispanic New World urban center of Cholula, Puebla.  New World cities differed significantly from those of the Old World, not just in terms of their epidemiological environments, but also in terms of their social, political, and economic organization.  A paleodemographic and paleopathological study of 309 Postclassic human skeletons from Cholula was combined with strontium and oxygen isotope analyses in order to characterize morbidity, mortality, and immigration to this prehispanic Mesoamerican city. Several new methodological approaches, including the use of transition analysis, a parametric model of mortality, and a multistate model of health were incorporated into the paleodemographic and paleopathological analyses.  Strontium and oxygen isotope studies allowed immigrants in the population to be identified so that their impact on demographic processes in Cholula could be considered.  The results of this investigation suggest that the cultural and epidemiological environments of Cholula contributed to the formation of urban demographic patterns in this New World city that differed from those observed in the Old World.   \n&#8195;\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4235], "author_name_tesi": "Kreger, Meggan Miranda-Lee Bullock", "last_name_ssi": "Kreger", "middle_name_ssi": "Miranda-Lee Bullock", "first_name_ssi": "Meggan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Kenneth Gale Hirth", "George Robert Milner", "James William Wood", "Brian Hesse"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Chair", "George Robert Milner, Committee Member", "James William Wood, Committee Member", "Brian Hesse, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cholula", "paleodemography", "paleopathology", "urbanism"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Practical Modeling of Composite Slab Floor Systems With Dominant Slab Mode For Vibration Control", "id": "23201", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5689", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Design Guide 11 (Murray, T.M., et al. 1997), the most current design aid published by AISC (The American Institute of Steel Construction), provides engineers with basic principles and methods to evaluate floor vibration serviceability of steel framed floors.

Therefore, it may be used to transfer N and P from eutrophic water bodies to agricultural fields. In this work, dried duckweed was incorporated into agricultural soil in microcosm, column, and field tests to evaluate biological nitrogen cycling, nutrient retention, and crop yield compared to compost, diammonium phosphate (DAP), and an amendment-free control.

The goal of this research is to create that common language by developing a BIM Use Ontology.  A BIM Use (Use) is defined as a method of applying Building Information Modeling during a facility\u2019s life-cycle to achieve one or more specific objectives.  The BIM Use Ontology (the Ontology) provides a shared vocabulary that is applied to model (or express) the BIM Uses, including the type of objects (or terms), and concepts, properties, and relationships that exist. \nThe methods performed to develop the BIM Use Ontology included: 1) defining domain and scope, 2) acquiring domain knowledge, 3) documenting domain terms, 4) integrating domain terms, 5) evaluating (refining and validating) the BIM Use Ontology, and 6) documenting the BIM Use Ontology.  Overall, the BIM Use Ontology classified over 550 BIM terms into a defined ontological structure.  Before the BIM Use Ontology was finalized, this structure was validated through competency questions, term mapping, industry interviews, and focus group meetings. The research methodology implemented to develop the BIM Use Ontology was designed based on the following criteria: clarity, comprehensiveness, extendibility, minimal bias, and minimal ontological commitment.  \nThe BIM Use Ontology primarily classifies the BIM Uses based on the purpose of implementing BIM on a facility or within an organization; and secondarily classifies BIM Uses based on characteristics of the BIM Use.  The BIM Use Ontology classifies BIM Uses into five primary BIM Use Purposes: 1) Gather, 2) Generate, 3) Analyze, 4) Communicate, and 5) Realize.  After the BIM Use Purpose is determined, an implementer can identify more detailed BIM Use Characteristics such as facility element, facility phase, author discipline, or level of development.  Depending upon a particular implementation of BIM, the process, information, infrastructure, maturity, benefits, and references are determined.  The characteristics make the BIM Use Ontology applicable and usable by industry.  The BIM Use Ontology provides a structure for the purposes by which BIM can be implemented during the life-cycle of a facility.  \nThe BIM Use Ontology provides the fundamental terminology and organizational structure for the purposes for which BIM is implemented throughout the life-cycle of a facility.  The BIM Use Ontology can be applied within procurement language and BIM planning to define exact requirements of various parties.

The non-enzymatic oxidation of wine is thought to proceed by metal-catalyzed reactions capable of oxidizing phenolics and reducing oxygen to quinones and hydroxyl radicals, respectively. Previous studies have focused upon the important reactions that occur between quinones and other wine components, but the fate of oxygen radicals within the context of wine oxidation is less understood.\n \nEthanol is the prime target for hydroxyl radicals in wine due to its abundance (~2 M). I investigated the oxidative stability of model wine solutions with respect to major wine constituents after ethanol (i.e. phenolics, glycerol, and tartaric acid), knowing ethanol forms 1-hydroxyethyl radicals (1-HER) using spin trapping with phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) paired with electron paramagnetic spectroscopy (EPR). I then focused on the potential reaction between hydroxyl radicals and tartaric acid, and measured other important oxidative markers including hydrogen peroxide consumption and acetaldehyde formation, a known oxidation product of ethanol. As expected, 4-methylcatechol (4-MeC), a model phenolic, accelerated the oxidation of ethanol by hydroxyl radicals, and had resulted in higher 1-HER/PBN adduct formation. Glycerol, despite its presence at relatively high concentrations, did not significantly affect spin adduct formation, suggesting that it was not a major target of hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidation. Interestingly, tartaric acid, seemed to shift from slight antioxidant activity to pro-oxidant activity when oxygen was purged from the model wine system.\n\nI investigated the reaction between 1-HER and various wine-related phenolics and thiols, including gallic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3MH), cysteine (Cys), and glutathione (GSH) by using competitive spin trapping with detection by EPR and mass spectrometry. In addition, I measured the ability of these compounds to prevent the formation of acetaldehyde. The hydroxycinnamic acids, which include caffeic acid and ferulic acid, significantly inhibited 1-HER formation compared to treatment-free model wine by 69% and 55%, respectively. The thiol treatments, Cys, GSH, and 3MH also significantly inhibited 1-HER formation by 88, 87, and 96%, respectively. As expected, I observed similar trends when I measured spin adduct formation with mass spectrometry and when I measured final acetaldehyde yields. This confirms that hydroxycinnamic acids and thiols react with 1-HER under model wine conditions. I also measured the oxidative loss of 3MH, an important varietal thiol, in model wine resulting from either 2-electron quinone trapping or direct reaction with 1-HER.  I observed, for the first time, evidence that 1-HER reacts with 3MH; however, the well-known quinone trapping mechanism is likely the dominant mechanism for 3MH loss in wine.\n\nFinally, with the knowledge that 1-HER formation in wine is catalyzed by transition metals, I investigated the use of chelators as a means to control 1-HER formation. I focused on the effect of exogenous Fe(II) (bipyridine, Ferrozine) and Fe(III) chelators (EDTA, phytic acid) on 1-HER  and acetaldehyde formation using spin trapping with EPR and HPLC-PDA, respectively. I then investigated the ability for these chelator treatments to prevent the oxidative loss of the important aroma-active thiol, 3MH. The Fe(II)-specific chelators were more effective antioxidants than the Fe(III)-specific chelators during the early stages of oxidation, and completely inhibited 1-HER formation compared to the chelator-free control. However, while the addition of Fe(III) chelators was less effective or even pro-oxidative initially, the Fe(III) chelators proved to be more effective antioxidants compared to Fe(II) chelators over the course of the study. In addition, I show for the first time that Fe(II) and Fe(III) chelators can significantly inhibit the oxidative loss of 3MH in model wine. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8252], "author_name_tesi": "Kreitman, Gal Yosef", "last_name_ssi": "Kreitman", "middle_name_ssi": "Yosef", "first_name_ssi": "Gal", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wine oxidation", "3-mercaptohexan-1-ol", "thiols", "1-hydroxyethyl radicals", "electron paramagnetic resonance", "spin trapping", "chelator."]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "REACTION MECHANISMS OF TRANSITION METALS WITH HYDROGEN SULFIDE AND THIOLS IN WINE", "id": "7m01bk68h", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12916", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sulfidic off-odors due to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and low molecular weight thiols are commonly encountered in wine production. These odors are a serious quality issue in wine and may result in consumer rejection. Therefore, sulfidic off-odors are generally controlled prior to bottling, and are frequently removed by the process of Cu(II) fining \u2013 a process that remains poorly understood. Cu(II) is effective at binding with sulfhydryl functionalities and forming nonvolatile complexes thereby removing aroma associated with the compound. However, this technique leaves residual copper in the wine which catalyzes non-enzymatic wine oxidations. Furthermore, elevated copper concentrations are usually associated with increased sulfidic off-odors under anaerobic aging conditions.\n\tIn this work, I elucidated the underlying mechanisms by which Cu(II) interacts with H2S and thiol compounds under wine-like conditions. Adding Cu(II) sulfate to air saturated model wine containing H2S, cysteine (Cys), 6-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (6SH), or 3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3SH) led to a rapid formation of  ~1.4:1 H2S:Cu and ~2:1 thiol:Cu complexes. This resulted in the oxidation of H2S and thiols, and reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) without oxygen uptake. Both H2S and thiols resulted in the formation of Cu(I)-SR complexes, and subsequent reactions with oxygen led to the oxidation of H2S rather than the formation of insoluble copper sulfide, which has been previously assumed. The proposed reaction mechanisms provide an insight into the extent to which H2S can be selectively removed in the presence of thiols in wine.\nThe interaction of iron and copper is also known to play an important synergistic role in mediating non-enzymatic wine oxidation. Therefore, I assessed the interaction of these two metals in the oxidation of H2S and thiols (Cys, 6SH, and 3SH) under wine-like conditions. H2S and thiols were shown to be slowly oxidized in the presence of Fe(III) alone, and were not bound to Fe(III) under model wine conditions. However, Cu(II) added to model wine containing Fe(III) was quickly reduced by H2S and thiols to form Cu(I)-complexes, which then rapidly reduced Fe(III) to Fe(II). Oxidation of Fe(II) in the presence of oxygen regenerated Fe(III) and completed the iron redox cycle. This work had clearly demonstrated a synergistic effect between Fe and Cu at the oxidation of H2S and thiols. In addition, sulfur-derived oxidation products were observed, and the formation of organic polysulfanes was demonstrated. \nManganese has a modest catalytic activity in catalyzing polyphenol and sulfite oxidation in wine. Furthermore, manganese is known to have a catalytic activity at mediating thiol and H2S oxidation in aquatic systems. I investigated the interaction of manganese with iron and copper at catalyzing thiol and H2S oxidation. The reaction of thiols with Mn alone or in combination with Fe resulted in radical chain reaction paired with large oxygen uptake and generation of sulfur oxyanions. H2S did not generate free thiyl radicals, and had minimal interaction with Mn(II). When Cu(II) was introduced, Cu-mediated oxidation dominated in all treatments and Mn-mediated radical reaction was limited. Mn demonstrated a different reaction mechanism with thiols compared to Cu and Fe, and may generate transient thiyl radicals during wine oxidation.\nKnowing that Cu(II) addition to model systems containing H2S and thiols demonstrated the generation of polysulfanes, I investigated the formation of mixed disulfides and polysulfanes in model and white wine samples. I found that at relatively low concentrations of H2S and methanethiol (MeSH, 100 \u00b5g/L each), Cu(II)-fining resulted in the generation of MeSH-glutathione disulfide and trisulfane in white wine. The reduction of the resulting nonvolatile disulfides may then play a role in the generation of undesirable sulfidic off-odors. Therefore, I also investigated the ability of Fe and Cu in combination of bisulfite (SO2), ascorbic acid, and Cys to promote the catalytic scission of diethyl disulfide (DEDS). I found that the combination of SO2 along with Fe and Cu depleted more DEDS than the other treatments. Furthermore, a method for releasing volatile sulfur compounds from their precursors was investigated using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (a reducing agent) and bathocuproine disulfonic acid (a chelator). The addition of the reagents successfully released H2S and MeSH from red and white wines that were free of reductive faults at the time of addition.\nI have demonstrated the underlying reaction mechanisms of H2S and thiols with Cu, Fe, and Mn under wine-like conditions. I showed that Cu(II) is readily reduced by H2S and thiols, and that this complex remains redox active and can reduce oxygen. The reaction of Cu with H2S and thiols is further accelerated by the presence of Fe and Mn. While the initial Cu(II) fining process removes volatile sulfhydryl compounds, it generates disulfides, polysulfanes, and Cu(I)-SR complexes that remain in the wine. I showed that disulfide scission is accelerated by the presence of metals and reducing agents under wine conditions. Furthermore, I provide a strategy to quickly reduce or dissociate disulfides, polysulfanes, and metal complexes for the release of volatile sulfur compounds in both red and white wines. This can be used by winemakers to predict a wine\u2019s potential to exhibit sulfidic odors and take further action. Overall, a better understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms with H2S and thiols provides a foundation for future strategies to better control sulfidic off-odors in wine.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12643], "author_name_tesi": "Kreitman, Gal Yosef", "last_name_ssi": "Kreitman", "middle_name_ssi": "Yosef", "first_name_ssi": "Gal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias", "Ryan John Elias", "Joshua D Lambert", "John Neil Coupland", "Michela Centinari", "David Jeffery", "John Danilewicz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias, Dissertation Advisor", "Ryan John Elias, Committee Chair", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member", "John Neil Coupland, Committee Member", "Michela Centinari, Outside Member", "David Jeffery, Outside Member", "John Danilewicz, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["copper", "iron", "H2S", "oxidation", "reaction mechanisms", "thiols", "wine aroma", "reduction"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Plato's Prayer: Toward a Spiritual Reading of the Republic", "id": "14771ank144", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14771", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Plato\u2019s dialogues present the reader with a hermeneutic challenge: they are works of philosophy,\nwhich contain decidedly poetic elements (i.e., dramatic setting, narrative, myth, imagery,\nallegory, etc.).

However, these reconceputalized understandings of curriculum have not been broadly adopted by policy makers, school districts, and the public alike, and scholars and educators are still looking for ways to effectively translate expanded ideas of curriculum into concepts that are accepted more broadly and that are embodied in school practice and curricular reform. In this thesis, I attempt to help bridge this gap by offering an image of and model for reconceptualized ideas of curriculum in the form of the theater rehearsal process. By understanding rehearsal\u2014a rich space of play and participation\u2014as an image of a curriculum, I argue that we not only open up the possibilities for what curriculum is and could be, but we also increase the accessibility of such an understanding. In order to develop this robust image, I show how rehearsal embodies and enacts many of the primary characteristics of reconceptualized ideas of curriculum and then expand on this foundation to explore how rehearsal integrates numerous and diverse theoretical and pedagogical approaches into its flexible structure. Lastly, I show how these elements come together in lived-experience of rehearsal by using a narrative, phenomenological approach to reflect on and describe my experience as a participant in the rehearsal process. By offering this image and challenging myself and others to not only see rehearsal as curriculum, but also to imagine curriculum as rehearsal, I hope to invite stakeholders\u2014from scholars to the general public\u2014to envision curriculum in a new way that sparks the desire for change and inspires students, educators, and community members alike to re-encounter their entrenched ideas of what curriculum is and ought to be.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16500], "author_name_tesi": "Krempa, Jennifer Katherine", "last_name_ssi": "Krempa", "middle_name_ssi": "Katherine", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Marm\u00e9 Thompson", "Christine Marm\u00e9 Thompson", "Kimberly Powell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine Marm\u00e9 Thompson, Thesis Advisor", "Christine Marm\u00e9 Thompson, Thesis Advisor", "Kimberly Powell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Curriculum", "Theater", "Rehearsal"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Characterization of Functional Regions of OGFr", "id": "26247", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11357", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Opioid Growth Factor (OGF)-OGF receptor (OGFr) axis is present and tonically active in animal and human cancer cell lines, as well as human tumors. The OGF-OGFr pathway tonically mediates cell replication in cancer, with OGF serving as an autocrine-produced inhibitory pentapeptide. The inhibitory action of OGF on cell replication requires that OGF bind to OGFr, traffic into the nucleus to upregulate inhibitory kinases, p16 and p21 that act to stall the progression from G1-S phase of the cell cycle. Little is currently known about the functional regions required for this function.\nTo begin to characterize the functional regions of OGFr, mutations in OGFr identified in cancer samples were characterized. Two mutations identified in cancer samples, S378I and R444H, were characterized with respect to their effects on localization of the receptor, as well as their ability to alter DNA synthesis. R444H demonstrated a significant decrease in the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio while S378I showed no change. Both mutations demonstrated a loss of response to OGF and the long-acting opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (NTX) in growth assays. R444H also demonstrated a loss of inhibition in DNA synthesis, while S378I showed no significant change compared to OGFr in the BrdU assay. These data demonstrate that cancer mutations such as R444H are capable of altering the inhibitory function of OGFr, while other mutations such as S378I may be capable of altering the response to the ligand OGF or the antagonist NTX. These data contribute to the understanding of the functionally required regions of OGFr and warrant further characterization of mutations identified in cancer samples.OGFr has three nuclear localization signals (NLS) that have previously been characterized. OGFr requires at least two of the three NLSs for entry into the nucleus and for inhibition of cell proliferation. When NLSs were mutated, OGFr was excluded from the nucleus and proliferation inhibition was lost. The nuclear export of OGFr is currently unknown. In this study, endogenous OGFr, as well as exogenously expressed OGFr-EGFP, demonstrated significant nuclear accumulation in response to leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM1 dependent nuclear export, suggesting OGFr is exported in a CRM1 dependent manner. One leucine rich sequence fitting the consensus sequence for nuclear export signals (NES) was identified. To better characterize this sequence, the associated leucines, L217 L220 L223 and L225, were mutated to alanine in isolation as well as in combinations. All of the mutations resulted in decreased nuclear accumulation. In support of decreased nuclear localization, subNES demonstrated a loss of inhibition. When the proposed NES was fused to EGFP, NES-EGFP, it responded to LMB, indicating this sequence is capable of functioning as an export signal in isolation. To investigate why the sequence functions differently in isolation than in the context of the full-length protein, the localization of subNES was evaluated in the presence of MG132, a potent inhibitor of proteosomal degradation, and LMB. Neither MG132 nor LMB affected the localization of subNES. Finally, the tandem repeat region of OGFr was evaluated to determine its contribution to OGFr localization. Six of the 7 tandem repeats found in the C-terminal end of OGFr were removed creating deltaTR. DeltaTR localized exclusively to the nucleus indicating that the tandem repeats may contribute to the localization of the receptor. Similar to the loss of inhibition seenwith subNES, deltaTR also demonstrated a significant loss of inhibition on DNA synthesis indicating that the tandem repeats are required for receptor function. These experiments demonstrate that OGFr contains one functional NES, L217 L220 L223 and L225, and that OGFr can be exported from the nucleus in a CRM1 dependent manner. However, OGFr may be exported by additional methods, as seen by altered localization when 6 of 7 tandem repeats were removed.\nThe data presented in this thesis demonstrates that cancer mutations in OGFr are capable of altering the function of the receptor. Additionally, this work identifies on CRM1 dependent NES, L217 L220 L223 and L225, and demonstrates that the tandem repeats as well as the NES are required for DNA synthesis inhibition. The 7 tandem repeats are also demonstrated to contribute to the localization of the receptor.

Much research stems from the desire to activate these unfunctional groups to more reactive entities.  The heme-containing enzymes, cytochrome P450s (P450s) can do this chemistry with ease.  P450s are unique thiolate ligated heme enzymes responsible for detoxification in many organisms.  Recently, the active oxidant responsible for C-H bond activation by P450s, was trapped in high yield by the Green Lab.  This thesis delves into the structural and electronic characterization of this species and its comparison to a similar intermediate in the thiolate ligated heme peroxidase, chloroperoxidase.  To gain knowledge of this reactive intermediate we turned to Fe and sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy, variable temperature M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations.  Abstracts of each chapter are below.\nChapter 2\nP450s are of interest due to their ability to activate ubiquitous and inert C-H bonds.  Only recently has the active intermediate responsible for this reaction been trapped and characterized in the P450 CYP119.  Herein, we report the capture and spectroscopic characterization of a second high yield preparation of compound I in another P450, P450ST, in ~ 65% yield. We report that P450ST-I strongly resembles CYP119-I and CPO-I via UV/Visible stopped-flow and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopies.  Electron paramagnetic resonance studies of P450ST-I reveal a similar |J|/D (ratio of exchange coupling, J, over zero field splitting, D) as found in CYP119-I, both are elevated in comparison to the |J|/D found in CPO-I.\nChapter 3\nPrevious to the recent capture and characterization of P450 compound I (P450-I) in CYP119, most of our knowledge of the reactive intermediates in the P450 cycle was obtained from the study of chloroperoxidase (CPO).  Despite similar thiolate ligated heme active sites and the ability to perform P450 like chemistry, CPO is less reactive than P450.  The preparation of P450-I in high yield has afforded the opportunity for direct spectroscopic comparison of P450-I and CPO-I.  Rittle and Green determined that the |J|/D of CYP119-I was greater than that of CPO-I (1.30 versus 1.02).  The exact reasons for this difference were unknown but it was hypothesized that an increased value of |J| could be caused by a greater spin density on the sulfur and/or a shorter Fe-S bond. Using variable temperature M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, we have observed that DCYP119-I is ~1.6DCPO-I and |J|CYP119-I is ~2|J|CPO-I. To determine the factors that contribute to a greater value of |J|, we performed Fe K-edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy on both compound I species.   Analysis of EXAFS data revealed that the Fe-S distance in CYP119-I is 0.09 \u00c5 shorter than that in CPO-I.  DFT studies paired with analysis of Fe XANES also reveal a shorter Fe-S bond, which corresponds to a decrease in area of the Fe pre-edge feature.  A shorter Fe-S distance in CYP119-I could account for the increased reactivity of CYP119-I over CPO-I.\nChapter 4\nCompound I in thiolate ligated heme systems is best described as an Fe(IV) oxo anitiferromagnetically coupled to a radical that is delocalized over the porphyrin and sulfur ligands.  The amount of spin density on the sulfur is an important factor that contributes to |J|, the exchange coupling of the Fe(IV) oxo moiety and the ligand radical.  Axial ligand spin density may also contribute to the reactive nature of P450s.  It has been difficult to pin down the exact amount of radical character on the sulfur due to the previously low yield of P450-I.  Adding to the confusion were difficult techniques for radical quantification (advanced EPR techniques requiring expensive isotopes and ligand XAS) as well as unusual and conflicting theoretical predictions of sulfur spin density.  Herein, we have performed sulfur K-edge XANES to gain insight into the amount of sulfur radical in CYP119-I.  In accordance with the literature, a peak at 2468.4 eV, indicative of a sulfur-based radical, was seen.  Upon fitting this peak we have determined that there is 10-13% radical character on the sulfur in CYP119-I and less in CPO-I.  DFT calculations have been utilized to gain insight into these measurements. \nChapter 5\nRecently Yosca et al determined the ferryl pKa in compound II of CYP158A2 (CYP158A2-II) using M\u00f6ssbauer and stopped-flow UV/Visible absorption spectroscopies of samples of varying pH.  As part of his research he characterized both the high pH (unprotonated) and low pH (protonated) forms of compound II via EXAFS spectroscopy.  Briefly discussed were the Fe K-edge XAS data including the vast difference in pre-edge intensity between the two forms of compound II.  Herein, we have analyzed the Fe K-edge XANES as well as the S K-edge XANES of CYP158A2 ferric, unprotonated compound II, and protonated compound II via experiment and computation.   Calculations could reproduce experimental pre-edge features relatively well. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7896], "author_name_tesi": "Krest, Courtney Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Krest", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Courtney", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green", "Michael Thomas Green", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Carsten Krebs", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Thomas Green, Committee Chair", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Member", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cytochrome P450", "Compound I", "Purification", "EXAFS", "XAS", "Metal K-edge", "Ligand K-edge", "XANES", "M\u00f6ssbauer", "Exchange coupling"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Contestable John Brown: Abolitionism and the Civil War in U.S. Public Memory\n", "id": "12500", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "44", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abolitionist John Brown is a divisive figure in United States history. He features prominently in our national historical narrative, but his radical politics, religious fanaticism, and violent methods have led to polarized memories of his contributions to the abolitionist cause and his role in the coming of the U.S. Civil War. Some consider Brown a hero or a martyr of abolitionism, while others view him as a violent extremist, even a madman. Over time, Americans from across the political spectrum have mobilized Brown\u2019s memory to advance particular political and social causes, sometimes on opposing sides of the same issue. \n\nThis thesis examines three instances of public controversy over the memory of John Brown. In each of these case studies, Brown\u2019s public memory has been rhetorically constructed and vigorously contested. First, I explore a controversy over regionalist painter John Steuart Curry\u2019s depiction of Brown in the Kansas Statehouse mural, The Tragic Prelude. Some Kansans praised the mural for highlighting their state\u2019s radical past, while others were offended that Curry would link Kansas history with the life of a murderous madman. I argue that The Tragic Prelude acted as a site for these Kansans to contest their state\u2019s identity and its place in the larger narrative of Civil War history. Second, I will examine Brown\u2019s first appearance on the silver screen in the 1940 Hollywood film, Santa Fe Trail. I argue that this film re-envisioned the coming of the Civil War, casting Brown as a stereotypical Western villain. In the process, Santa Fe Trail oversimplified the complex coming-of-the-Civil War narrative, blaming the war almost entirely on Brown, and implying that it might have been avoided were it not for Brown\u2019s religious delusions and fanatical behaviors. Finally, I analyze a 1959 controversy over if and how the centennial of Brown\u2019s Harpers Ferry raid should be commemorated. Although Brown\u2019s raid was eventually remembered on its hundredth anniversary, the planners of the event took care to avoid celebrating the raid, especially in ways that might be taken as an endorsement of Brown\u2019s radicalism or of his violence. I argue that in the social and political context of the time, this rejection of Brown\u2014and of the liberal, abolitionist principles for which he stood\u2014functioned simultaneously as an expression of Cold War distaste for \u201cradicalism\u201d and as a repudiation of one of the historical memories underlying the civil rights movement. \n\nUltimately, these three case studies show how, when Brown\u2019s memory is invoked and contested, it typically has more to do with the politics of the moment than with discovering the \u201ctruth\u201d of the past. John Brown serves as an ideal vehicle for articulating public memories because he embodies such important moral quandaries. Thus, a study of his public memories lends insights into how Americans confront issues such as the morality of slavery, the justifications for violence, and the \u201clessons\u201d of the Civil War. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [45], "author_name_tesi": "Kretsinger-Harries, Anne Catherine", "last_name_ssi": "Kretsinger-Harries", "middle_name_ssi": "Catherine", "first_name_ssi": "Anne", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr J Michael Hogan", "James Hogan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr J Michael Hogan, Thesis Advisor", "James Hogan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rhetoric", "Abolitionism", "John Brown", "Public Memory"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Civil War Centennial Commemoration and the Rhetoric of the Civil Rights Movement", "id": "28847", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12463", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines rhetorical tensions between commemorations of the U.S. Civil War centennial and discourses of the \u201cshort\u201d civil rights movement from 1961 to 1965.

My primary argument is that civil rights activists mobilized a rhetorical strategy of co-opting the centennial moment, repurposing Civil War memories to advance their cause. Prior to the early 1960s, \u201cpublic memories\u201d of the war typically ignored the issue of slavery and the war\u2019s impact on black communities.

The extraction of thermal metrics is useful for correlation of microstructure for process monitoring and control of additive manufacturing. The thermal\nmetrics attained from the coaxial images include the thermal gradient at the solidus to liquidus region, the maximum temperature in the melt pool, the melt pool pixel area, and the length-to-width ratio of the melt pool. The current procedure for part qualification in additive manufacturing is through destructive methods. The use of thermal metrics in a 3D spatial reconstruction allows for a non-destructive means to distinguish material microstructure. For this reconstruction, two Ti-6Al-4V L-shaped parts were deposited with a 1-bead wide deposition on one leg of the build and 3-bead wide deposition on the second leg of the build. A filtering scheme of the coaxial thermal images is utilized to produce melt pools with distinguishable solidus to liquidus regions.

However, how these data are used and interpreted when proteins (and other biomacromolecules) are organized in three-dimensional structures (as in real biological systems) has been explored to a much lesser extent even though in such structural arrangements important and unique physicochemical effects exist.  In this Dissertation, the effects of such physicochemical properties, including microviscosity, bound water, and protein mobility, on the radiolytic and sonolytic denaturation of hen egg white were studied.  To improve our understanding of the molecular level effects of radiation and ultrasound on protein biomacromolecular gels (as a step towards complex biological systems), the thick fraction of egg white is used as a convenient and economical model system for the luminal mammalian mucous membrane as both are hydrogels (~90% water) that contain highly glycosylated, cysteine-rich and hydrated proteins.\n\tIn this Dissertation, measurement of rate constants for diffusion-controlled reactions were used to investigate the microlevel rheological properties of macromolecular aqueous solutions and protein gels; however, the kinetics of reactions with highly charged reactants were found to be complicated by ionic effects.  We developed a method to give a second order rate constant where these ionic effects were not operative (Krise et al. 2010. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 12: 7695).  As a precursor to studies in biological macromolecular aqueous gels (hen egg white thick fraction), we assessed the macro- and microscale rheological properties of a simple polymeric model system, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) solutions [up to 10% (w/w)], using diffusion-controlled reaction rate constants and electric conductivity measurements.  From these measurements, PVA aqueous solutions can be envisioned as dynamic systems comprising hydrated PVA molecules (two or less water molecules per OH group) and \u201cinterconnected water pools\u201d (located between macromolecules), the rheological properties of which are very similar to that of bulk water (Krise et al. 2011. J. Phys. Chem. B. 115: 2759).  These studies were extended to assess the physicochemical properties of the thick fraction of egg white.  Measurements of the rate constants of diffusion-controlled reactions occurring within the gel (and corresponding activation energies) and electric conductivity revealed that the thick fraction of egg white can be envisioned as a three-dimensional network comprising hydrated protein molecules (held by intermolecular S-S bridges) surrounded by water pools and channels (of non-uniform diameters) that have a microviscosity very similar to that of bulk water (Krise and Milosavljevic. 2011. Biomacromolecules. 12: 2351).  \nWith the physicochemical properties of the thick and thin fractions of hen egg white now more thoroughly characterized, a deeper understanding of early events in radiation chemistry observed in these proteinaceous matrixes was obtained.  From pulse radiolysis experiments, the hydrated electron absorption spectra (measured at the end of the pulse) and radiolytic yield indicate that bound water does not affect the hydrated electron yield.  Due to the very low microviscosity, hydrated electrons are as reactive and mobile in thick fraction hydrogel as in bulk water.  Steady-state gamma radiolysis studies on thick and thin fraction (a true protein solution) revealed that immobility of egg white proteins disfavors reactions that result in molecular mass change.  \nTo understand the effects of ultrasound on protein gels at the molecular level, the thick fraction of egg white was sonicated and its immeasurably high viscosity decreased significantly (to 2.5 \u2013 4.0 mPa\u2022s) with a 12 minute sonication, indicating that the three-dimensional protein network was degraded by ultrasound.  Differential scanning calorimetry, sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and turbidity measurements confirm that inter-protein S-S bridges rather than the primary structure of constituent proteins are disrupted by ultrasound.  Despite the relatively large concentration of hydroxyl radical produced in the sonication time range applied, no protein agglomeration or scission was observed which can be attributed to the antioxidant properties of glucose in the thick fraction; therefore, hydrodynamic sheer (from the collapse of bubbles produced by cavitation) was the operative mechanism of ultrasonic degradation of the thick fraction of hen egg white in the 55 kHz ultrasonic bath used.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3497], "author_name_tesi": "Krise, Keith Michael ", "last_name_ssi": "Krise", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael ", "first_name_ssi": "Keith", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bratoljub Milosavljevic", "Bratoljub Milosavljevic", "Alan James Benesi", "Philip C.

In this dissertation, we present three essays---the first two dealing with the pure theory of games and the third with an application of game theory to political economy. In the first\nessay, we consider the effect of unbounded communication between agents. Aumann and Hart (Econometrica, Nov. 2003) have shown that in games of one-sided incomplete information, the set of\nequilibrium outcomes achievable can be expanded considerably if the players are allowed to communicate without exogenous time\nlimits. Their research provokes (at least) three questions. The first is with regards to the structure of equilibrium payoffs when the player can communicate for large but finitely many periods. Is it true that the set of equilibrium payoffs stabilises (i.e. remains unchanged) if there are sufficiently many rounds of\ncommunication? The second is if the set of equilibria from communication which is unbounded but finite with probability one is the same as equilibria from communication which is just\nunbounded. The third question is whether any of these sets of equilibria are ``simple' and if so, is there an algorithm to compute them. We show that in the context of finite Sender-Receiver games, the answer to all three is yes if the game\nsatisfies a certain geometric condition. We then relate this condition to some geometric facts about the notion of bi-convexity and argue that if any of the questions has a negative answer then\nall three of the questions are likely to have a negative answer.\n\n\nIn the second essay, we study the effect of communication in two-person games of incomplete information. We show that any rational mediated communication mechanism outcome satisfying a\nNash domination condition can be implemented as the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of an extended communication game built from the original game and ends in finite time with probability 1.\n\n\nIn the third paper, we study a model of spatial voting where players have objectives different from the traditional Hotelling-Downs model. The players are rank maximisers and enter sequentially with a given order of entry and where k winners get a payoff v. If the players make their decisions and enter simultaneously, the resulting Nash equilibrium (with k winners) is the Greenberg-Shepsle k-equilibrium, which does not exist for all distributions of voters. We partition the set of distributions into 3 cells. The first of these cells consists of regular\ndistributions, wherein the set of SPE is isomorphic to the set Greenberg-Shepsle equilibria in the sense that every SPE generates an outcome which is a k-equilibrium and every k-equilibrium is the outcome of an SPE. The second type of distributions are called semi-clustered distributions. These have Greenberg-Shepsle\nk-equilibria but also have SPE that generate outcomes which are not k-equilibria. The remaining distributions are called clustered distributions. These distributions do not have\nk-equilibria. Nonetheless, they always have SPE with k entrants. We also give conditions to determine if a distribution has a k-equilibrium or not.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5361], "author_name_tesi": "Krishna, R.

The term muscle synergy has been widely used in the motor control literature without a clear operational definition. With the introduction of the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis, it has become possible to offer an operational definition: synergies are task-specific groups of control variables, which stabilize particular performance variables. \n\n\nThis approach provides a framework for the identification and analysis of synergies. The hypothesis assumes that the controller (the central nervous system, CNS) acts in the state space of control variables (CVs) and selects in this space a manifold (UCM) corresponding to a value of a performance variable, which needs to be stabilized. The CNS selectively restricts variability of CVs in directions that do not span the UCM as compared to those within the UCM.  If several attempts at a task are analyzed, variance per degree of freedom within the manifold is expected to be higher than orthogonal to such a manifold.\n\n\nThe UCM approach has been applied to kinematic and kinetic variables and has been successful in identifying important performance variables that are selectively stabilized in several tasks. This dissertation is the first attempt to extend the use of this approach to a more physiological variable, muscle activation recorded by electromyography (EMG).\n\n\nThis dissertation has two main parts. In the first part, we develop a method of using the UCM approach to identify muscle synergies during different postural tasks in stable standing. Our next goal has been to investigate the effects of standing on a surface with decreased area of support (unstable conditions) and of additional finger touch or hand grasp on the organization of muscle synergies. \n\n\nIn order to use the UCM approach to identify muscle synergies, the first step is to identify CVs manipulated by the controller. We have assumed that the CNS does not manipulate levels of activation of individual muscles, but unites muscles into groups within which the activity of the muscles is scaled in parallel with the help of CVs. In the first study, we identified three such CVs, which we called muscle modes or M-modes and have shown that these M-modes are very similar across subjects and several postural tasks performed on a stable support surface. \n\n\nIn the next study, we related changes in these three M-modes to shifts of an important performance variable in postural control, the center of pressure (COP). UCM analysis revealed that the three M-modes co-varied to stabilize a particular magnitude of the COP shift. An additional finding has been that there are separate synergies for COP shifts to the front and back.\n\n\nIn the second part of this dissertation, we focus on the effects of changes in the support surface stability and availability of additional touch or grasp on the formation of and interaction among M-modes. We first performed an experiment to investigate the effects of different types of touch on postural sway. It is known that even a mechanically inefficient finger touch is enough to stabilize posture. Results of our study show that both the availability of a stable reference point as well as modulation of contact forces play important roles in reducing postural sway. Further, it is not finger touch alone that has a stabilizing effect. Even touch to the side of the head or neck can reduce sway, possibly because of the high sensitivity of the receptors of the head and neck to shear forces. These results demonstrate the amazing versatility of the system for postural stabilization, which can use information from different sensory sources related to different mechanical interactions with external objects. \n\n\nSupport surface instability and availability of a finger touch or grasp have an effect on anticipatory changes in the activity of postural muscles prior to self-induced perturbations. We conducted an experiment to reveal the effects of these factors on the formation and co-variation of M-modes. We first compared M-modes during a postural task under four stability conditions: stable support surface with no touch, unstable support surface with no touch, unstable support surface with light touch, and unstable support surface with grasp to an external stable object. \n\n\nAcross all these conditions, there was a \u201cmenu\u201d of five modes from which three were chosen in any given condition in a subject specific way. Among the five modes, two modes showed reciprocal patterns of muscle activity that spanned all three major leg/trunk joints and resulted in displacement of the center of mass either forward or backwards (\u201cpush-forward\u201d and \u201cpush-back\u201d modes). The remaining three modes corresponded to joint-specific co-contraction patterns. Of the four conditions studied, the co-contraction patterns predominated over the reciprocal patterns during standing in unstable conditions with a hand grasp as compared to the other three conditions. UCM analysis failed to identify M-mode synergies in the three conditions studied: stable, unstable, and unstable with touch. This was possibly because there are no pre-existing synergies for the unstable conditions as these are not tasks that are commonly performed in everyday life. \n\n\nIn this dissertation we have shown that the UCM method can be used to identify muscle synergies using a physiological variable, that is, muscle activity measured by EMG. When subjects performed various postural tasks under stable standing conditions, we found that M-modes were robust across tasks and subjects. Further analysis, under different stability conditions revealed that the organization of M-modes and their co-variation to preserve a particular magnitude of COP shift is task and subject specific.  \n\n\nThe UCM method can be applied in the future to study abnormal synergies in postural disorders. The method can also be used to study the evolution of synergies across the lifespan as well as during the learning of novel tasks.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6457], "author_name_tesi": "Krishnamoorthy, Vijaya ", "last_name_ssi": "Krishnamoorthy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vijaya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Latash", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky", "Dr Toby Mordkoff", "Robert L Sainburg", "Dr John P Scholz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Latash, Committee Chair", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky, Committee Member", "Dr Toby Mordkoff, Committee Member", "Robert L Sainburg, Committee Member", "Dr John P Scholz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["muscle synergies", "M-mode", "posture"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH FOR PREDICTING VISCOSITIES OF HYDROCARBON SYSTEMS: DEFINED COMPOUNDS, DIRECT COAL LIQUID OILS AND LIGHT CRUDE OILS\n", "id": "11033", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6430", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A single parameter empirical method, based on the Effective Carbon Number (ECN) concept proposed by Allan and Teja (1991), was modified and extended to predict the viscosities of defined compounds (pure hydrocarbons and their mixtures) and undefined hydrocarbon liquids (petroleum fractions, crude oil, coal liquids, and coal liquid fractions) over a wide range of temperatures, pressures up to 700 bars, and compositions. Two correlations, n-alkane correlation and aromatic correlation, were developed to calculate the ECN for the liquid under investigation. The n-alkane correlation was obtained by correlating viscosity data of normal alkanes to their carbon number, while the aromatic correlation was obtained by correlating viscosity data of selected coal liquid model compounds with their carbon number. The aromatic correlation was used in calculating ECN only in certain cases. Andrade\u2019s equation [Reid et al (1987)] was used in obtaining the viscosity-temperature relationship. Viscosity-pressure relationships for ECN <12 and ECN &#8805;12 were obtained from high pressure n-alkane and synthetic crude oil data. Thus, viscosities over a wide range of temperatures and pressures up to 700 bars can be calculated with a single reference viscosity datum. \nThe model thus obtained was tested with viscosity data of 13 pure aromatics, 11 olefins, 28 alicylics, 7 defined hydrocarbon liquid mixtures at low pressures, 8 pure liquid hydrocarbons and mixtures at high pressures, and 53 undefined liquid hydrocarbon mixtures. The overall Average Absolute Error (AAE), which is defined as the average of the percent absolute difference between predicted and experimental viscosity data points, in predicting the viscosities of various categories of liquids was as follows: 6.28% for aromatics, 3.44% for olefins, 4.09% for alicyclics, 2.90% for defined hydrocarbon mixture at low pressure, 3.90% for pure hydrocarbons and mixtures at high pressures, 9.99% for coal liquids and 4.69% for crude oil and petroleum fractions. \nThe developed method compared favorably with the Generalized Corresponding State Principle (GCSP); a widely recognized model in predicting the viscosities of coal liquids. Moreover, the developed method was found to compare favorably with the method of Kabadi and Palakkal and the method of Sharma and Goel, for limited coal liquid data points. The distinguishing characteristics of the developed method over the method of Allan and Teja (1991) are their applicability to high pressure data and the prediction of viscosities for heavy coal liquid distillates.\nOverall, the model has been shown to be a powerful technique in predicting viscosities of defined and undefined compounds (light and middle distillates of coal liquid oils, and light crude oils and fractions) over a wide range of temperatures (253.15-673.15 K) and pressures (1.01-700 bars). However, the developed method should be used with caution when predicting viscosities of heavy distillates at low temperatures (<340 K) and light and middle distillates at very high temperatures (>673.15 K). \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6431], "author_name_tesi": "Krishnamoorthy, Vijayaragavan ", "last_name_ssi": "Krishnamoorthy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vijayaragavan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Fuel Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sharon Falcone Miller", "Sharon Falcone Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sharon Falcone Miller, Thesis Advisor", "Sharon Falcone Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["coal liquid oils", "correlation", "viscosity", "light crude oils"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Design and Simulation of a Lagged Cable Angle Feedback Control System for Helicopter Slung Loads", "id": "19073", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9116", "abstract_tesi": "A control design method to address stability and handling qualities issues associated with helicopter slung load operations in hover and low speed is presented.

Other fascinating developments include optical cloaking devices which involves bending of the electro-magnetic waves completely around the objects.

A tapered array of step-index cylindrical waveguides is the basis for the magnifying infrared fiberscope. Optimized designs have been presented for the proposed infrared fiberscope by numerical modeling. The fabrication of the fiberscope is based on a high pressure chemical fluid deposition technique to deposit precisely defined periodic arrays of semiconductor waveguides within the holes of a microstructured optical fiber made of silica. The optical properties of various waveguides (germanium, silicon, zinc selenide, silicon nitride) fabricated by this method have been characterized in the infrared regime.  The basic essential features of an imaging fiber bundle such as isolation between adjacent pixels, magnification, optical throughput and near-field image transfer characteristics have been investigated. The imaging concept is demonstrated at 1.55 \u00b5m, 3.39 \u00b5m and 10.64 \u00b5m using appropriate materials for fabricating the tapered array of waveguides to maximize the optical throughput.\nManipulation of the laser beam has been demonstrated using patterned ferroelectric domains in lithium tantalate. The linear electro-optic effect in ferroelectrics was utilized to demonstrate the proof of concept of two dimensional dynamic focusing, optical switching and laser beam shaping.

Hence it is important to adequately plan the architecture of the pipeline system for optimum operating strategy. The motivation behind this study is to comprehensively analyze a natural gas gathering and production system by developing a steady state gas pipeline network model which predicts the nodal pressures in the system for given flow rates and compressor operating conditions. In this study, a pipeline network model was developed and customized for the gas production and gathering system in Pennsylvania using fundamental principles of fluid mechanics.

This phenomenon is generic to all proteins.  As a consequence, protein adsorption is not found to vary significantly among diverse protein types.  Variations from this general trend may reflect deviations in protein geometry from simple spheres and/or tendency of some proteins to adopt a more spread/compact configuration in the adsorbed state.

Rare variant detection can be limited by an insufficient sample size and inadequate sequencing coverage. Candidate gene sequencing in a large sample may be a direct and effective method for the discovery of rare functional variants. The purpose of this study was to determine if rare sequence variants that are potentially associated with cholesterol-related phenotypes in the ClinSeqTM study tend to cluster in functional domains and if novel analytical approaches that leverage genomic and proteomic information may be useful in association analyses.\nA Fisher\u2019s Exact Test was applied to sequence variants in sixteen candidate genes to test for an association of these variants with the highest and lowest quartiles of low density lipid cholesterol, high density lipid cholesterol, and triglycerides. No variant obtained Bonferroni-level significance. Counts of rare variants (variants with a minor allele frequency < 5%) within genes found to be significantly associated with HDL-C from the Fisher\u2019s Exact Test were compared between patients lying within the highest and lowest quartiles of HDL cholesterol. Out of six genes tested: ABCA1, ABCG8, HMGCR, INSIG2, LDLR, and CETP-- the total number of rare variants in only one gene, ABCG8, was significantly different between the HDL-C extremes (p = 0.011). The total number of rare variants within exons, introns, and transcription factor binding sites were also compared. Significant differences in the total number of rare variants within exons were found for CETP (p=0.009) with suggestive differences for ABCG8 (p=0.056) and LDLR (p=0.066). Only ABCG8 had a significant difference in sums of rare variant counts in introns between high and low HDL-C (p=0.003). Only CETP had a significant difference in sums of rare variant counts in transcription factor binding sites (p=0.043). There were no significant differences in variants with minor allele frequencies less than 1% and 0.5% between individuals with extreme phenotypes in any functional domain classification.\nSeveral recently developed methods of rare variant association analysis were compared to evaluate the relative ability of each of these methods to detect both previously known putative causal variants and novel variants associated with LDL cholesterol level, HDL cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels. These methods, the Cohort Allelic Sums Test, Combined Multivariate and Collapsing method, the Weighted-Sum Method, and the C-Alpha method were applied to functional domains in a subset of candidate genes. The functional domain classifications considered were: exons, introns, transcription factor binding sites, DNase hypersensitivity sites, enhancers, silencers, and repressors. Most methods found a highly significant association of LDL-C with DNase hypersensitivity sites within LDLR.\nUtilizing multi-species conservation information in quantitative trait association analyses using the Variable Threshold method yielded significant associations of cholesterol traits with AP1M2, LDHB and LIPC.

For example, in breast cancer colonization of bone, osteoblasts (bone building cells) and osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells) are important cell types that make up the bone microenvironment.  This work concentrates on the role of bone microenvironment in the progression of breast cancer. Understanding the mechanisms that govern the process of metastatic colonization in specific secondary organs would help identify potential therapeutic targets. It is not known exactly why breast cancer cells target bone; but once colonization of bone occurs, an interconnected series of interactions between breast cancer cells and those of the bone microenvironment result in uncontrolled tumor growth. These interactions have been collectively interpreted in terms of the \u201cvicious cycle of bone metastasis\u201d which has become the central paradigm of cancer in bone. According to this model, cancer cells secrete pro-inflammatory factors that lead to osteoclast activation, through intermediary stimulation of osteoblasts. Osteoblasts increase production of inflammatory cytokines, which further stimulates osteoclasts to differentiate into mature, multinucleated osteoclasts that actively resorb bone leading to severe osteopathologies. A complete understanding of cancer in bone thus requires an in-depth knowledge of a network of biochemical signaling occurring between osteoblasts, osteoclasts and the breast cancer cells at tissue and cellular levels. \nI hypothesize that bone remodeling and its disruption during breast cancer colonization of bone can be studied in a bioreactor that permits the interaction of breast cancer cells with co-cultures of osteoblasts and osteoclasts under physiologically relevant conditions. This bioreactor can be used to create a unique in vitro system wherein biological complexity is carefully controlled by step-by-step addition of cellular components. Studying the three-cell type (osteoblast-osteoclast-breast cancer) interaction requires a shift in focus from isolated in vitro cell culture systems to a three-dimensional cell culture system that simulates major aspects of the in vivo bone microenvironment.\n\nWe have recently developed and validated a novel three-dimensional in vitro cell culture system (bioreactor) that circumvents many limitations imposed by conventional cell/tissue culture technology. The bioreactor, based on the principle of simultaneous-growth-and-dialysis permits growth/maintenance of mineralizing, collagenous connective tissue from an inoculum of isolated osteoblasts over extended culture periods; i.e. at least up to 10 months. We have used this bioreactor as an in vitro tool to determine how metastatic breast cancer cells affect normal bone physiology.\n\nOutcomes of this work have led a number of important \u201cfirsts\u201d that represent significant innovation in the aforementioned fields of endeavor. \n\n1.\t  Osteogenesis in vitro: from pre-osteoblasts to osteocytes: We have shown, for the first time, that macroscopic mineral deposits resembling bone (centimeter-scale pieces of white bone material chemically identical to real bone) can be grown from isolated bone cells in the bioreactor without the aid of any synthetic scaffolding materials. The cells morphology concomitantly evolve from spindle-shaped pre-osteoblasts through cobblestone-shaped osteoblasts to stellate-shaped osteocyte-like cells interconnected by many intercellular processes. Gene expression profiles parallel cell morphological changes, up-to-and-including increased expression of osteocyte-associated genes such as E11, DMP1 and sclerostin.\n\n2.\t  An in vitro mimic of bone-remodeling: We created an in vitro \u2018bone-remodeling\u2019 mimic to which metastatic cancer cells can be added and monitored over time. We have been able to add and differentiate osteoclasts from hematopoietic precursor cells isolated from mouse bone marrow. The pre-osteoclast cells when introduced onto the osteogenic tissue grown in the bioreactor, differentiated to form multinucleated mineral resorbing osteoclasts. The osteoclasts were functional and capable of digesting the osteoblast matrix. Re-infusing this co-culture system with pre-osteoblasts results in the re-filling of osteoclast resorption pits. Gene and protein expression data support the above observation that the degraded osteoblast tissue can be repaired by proliferating osteoblasts. \n\n3.\t  Challenging osteoblast tissue and osteoblast-osteoclasts co-cultures with breast cancer cells: Metastatic Breast cancer cells were added systematically to the osteoblast and osteoblast-osteoclast co-cultures. The osteoblast-breast cancer cell co-culture showed that important clinical hallmarks of cancer colonization of bone, including cancer cell penetration of tissue, colony formation and most importantly formation of single cell filing by cancer cells and alignment of cancer cells along the morphologically altered osteoblast tissue could be observed in vitro. When metastatic breast cancer cells were introduced onto the osteoblast-osteoclast co-culture (bone-remodeling mimic), the breast cancer cells migrated toward sites of active remodeling and clustered as an aggregation of cells that further degraded the osteoblast matrix. \n\nSystematic study of cancer cell interaction with \u2018biosynthetic bone\u2019 will yield novel insight into breast cancer colonization of bone. Apart from which, this model can also be used to study a wide array of osteopathologies such as osteoporosis and arthritis. Outcomes of the work will help clarify the etiology of cancer in bone and also create a much-needed in vitro tool for discovery of cancer therapeutics.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6458], "author_name_tesi": "Krishnan, Venkatesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Krishnan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Venkatesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrea Marie Mastro", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Erwin A Vogler", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Robert Paulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrea Marie Mastro, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Chair", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metastasis", "bone-remodeling-unit", "3D", "breast-cancer", "osteoclast", "osteoblast", "colonization of bone"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF THE THERMAL PROPERTIES OF \nZINC OXIDE USING THE ReaxFF REACTIVE FORCE FIELD\n\n", "id": "11497", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "581", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this paper is to determine the thermal conductivity of Zinc Oxide nanowire by equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD and NEMD) simulations using the ReaxFF reactive force field [19]. While EMD uses an equilibrated system and statistical averaging; NEMD uses cooling/heating rates in order to calculate the conductivity. The validity of the methods is first verified using Argon as a test case. The thermal conductivity of Argon thus calculated is compared with the results obtained by Bhowmick and Shenoy [69]. We then study the effects of system size using EMD method and effects of periodic boundary conditions - 1D, 2D and bulk variation of conductivity with temperature are analyzed using NEMD simulations. The results obtained compare favorably with those measured experimentally [46][47]. This indicates that the EMD and NEMD methods are reliable alternatives to the traditional Green-Kubo approach [51]; which is traditionally employed in MD-based thermal conductivity determination. In conjunction with ReaxFF, these methods are computationally cheaper than the Green-Kubo method and can be used to determine the thermal conductivity of materials involved in surface chemistry reactions such as catalysis and sintering.\n\nThe effect of chemistry on the thermal conductivity of Zinc Oxide is studied. Sintering is taken as the chemical process of interest and is simulated using ReaxFF force field for Zinc Oxide [58] in the presence of water. Effect of sintering temperature is also observed. A clear drop in the conductivity of Zinc Oxide due to the formation of hydroxyl grain-boundaries between the different Zinc Oxide clusters is noted. However, this deterioration is smaller when we use higher sintering temperatures. \n\nDue to a relatively small number of atoms (960) and the non-homogeneousness of the cluster; (mix of Zinc Oxide and water) the error bars on thermal conductivity are large.

In all of these applications, it is essential that the converter remain within the prescribed operating region, since unstable operation can often lead to catastrophic consequences. Thus, stability analysis of DC-DC converters is an extremely important task. Until now such analysis is usually performed using approximate models such as those obtained through averaging techniques, which have been shown to neglect significant parts of unstable behavior in many real-life systems. There are techniques that describe those phenomena more accurately, but require painstaking analytical derivation for each new system, which is very time-consuming, demands a high level of mathematical proficiency from the engineer, and can lead to errors.\n\nIn this dissertation a unified nonlinear technique is developed for finding periodic orbits and analyzing their stability in periodically switched DC-DC converter systems. The technique can be applied to systems of arbitrary complexity with possible multiple independently controlled switches and discontinuous topologies. The new approach, based on discrete nonlinear maps, is exact under the assumption of ideal switches and is easily programmable, which allows for quick analysis of a given DC power system under a wide range of input conditions. The exactness of the new method is a definite advantage over existing linear methods and other approximate techniques.\n\nThe developed method can also be used to analyze bifurcations in DC-DC converter systems. Based on the new approach, a systematic study is performed on loss of stability and bifurcations occurring in basic power converter circuits under current-mode control, including buck, boost, and buck-boost converters.

In addition, polyphosphazene/poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) blends were fabricated and the physical properties of these blends were characterized for tissue engineering applications. Chapter 1 outlines the basic fundamental principles of polymer chemistry with a detailed introduction to polyphosphazenes and their uses as biomedical materials. Chapter 2 discusses the synthesis of five novel polyphosphazenes with glycyl-glycine ethyl ester dipeptide side groups in multiple side group ratios, poly[(glycyl-ethyl glycinato)x(ethyl glycinato)yphosphazene]. The dipeptide side groups possessed two hydrogen bonding protons for interactions with other polymer systems. Polymer blends of these polyphosphazenes with poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) were fabricated and the miscibility was studied. Characterization of the polymer blends utilized differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Poly[(glycyl-ethyl glycinato)1.5(ethyl glycinato)0.5phosphazene] formed completely miscible blends with PLGA, irrespective of the composition of the PLGA.\nChapter 3 describes the synthesis of new dipeptide ethyl esters that were synthesized via the mixed anhydride solution phase peptide route. These dipeptide ethyl esters were utilized for covalent linkage to the polyphosphazene backbone. The design of these side groups required the amino acid to be covalently linked to the polyphosphazene backbone to generate steric hindrance at the \u00e1-carbon to decrease the hydrolysis rate of\niv\nthe polyphosphazene. The second amino acid needed limited steric hindrance to the amino proton, and the C-terminus had to be ester protected. Therefore, glycine ethyl ester was used. Thus, the amino acids alanine, valine, and phenylalanine were coupled with glycine ethyl ester during the peptide synthesis. The primary amino function of these dipeptides was covalently linked to poly(dichlorophosphazene) with the co-substituents glycine ethyl ester or alanine ethyl ester. The molecular structure was characterized by use of multinuclear NMR techniques and the physical characteristics were studied by DSC and GPC techniques. The hydrolysis mechanism of these polymers in various buffered aqueous media of pH=4.0, pH=7.0, and pH=10.0 was analyzed. It was determined that the phenylalanine ethyl ester substituted polyphosphazenes provided the most protection to the backbone and all the polymers were more stable in pH 10.0 medium. Chapter 4 describes dipeptide ethyl ester substituted polyphosphazenes blended with two different polyesters, PLGA and polycaprolactone (PCL). Fabrication of the blends was conducted by a solution casting process and by electrospinning. The miscibility of the polymer blends was examined by DSC and SEM techniques. These studies showed that polyphosphazenes substituted with alanyl-glycine ethyl ester or valinyl-glycine ethyl esters are miscible with PLGA when solution-cast. However, electrospinning of the blended solutions produced nanofiberous mats that were completely immiscible. There was no miscibility when these polyphosphazenes were blended with PCL, regardless of the processing technique that was utilized.\nv\nChapter 5 evaluates the use of tris(hydroxymethyl)amino methane (THAM), a biological buffer, covalently linked to the polyphosphazene backbone. The primary amino function of THAM was utilized for covalent linkage to the backbone, together with the co-substituents glycine ethyl ester or alanine ethyl ester. These polyphosphazenes formed very miscible blends with PLGA. Hydrolysis studies showed that the polyphosphazene did not significantly degrade within six weeks. Cells studies showed good biocompatibility of the blend surfaces after 14 days. Chapter 6 describes the synthesis of polyphosphazene block copolymers with poly(L-lactide), poly(trimethylene carbonate), and polycaprolactone. The organic blocks were designed to possess amino end functions that were utilized for covalent linkage to the growing polyphosphazene chain. Anionic ring opening polymerization conditions were utilized for the synthesis of the organic blocks, followed by deprotection of the amine terminus. The polyphosphazene chain was synthesized via the living cationic polymerization route. The molecular structures of the block copolymers were examined by 1H and 31P NMR techniques and molecular weights were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography.\nChapter 7 discusses the synthesis of phosphazenes substituted with the purines, guanine and adenine, and the pyrimidine cytosine. These side groups have a primary amino function that in principle should replace all the chlorine atoms within the phosphazene system. Hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene syntheses proved that full chlorine replacement could not be achieved. At the polymer level, the purine and pyrimidine side groups were used in a co-substitution synthesis pattern together with glycine ethyl ester,\nvi\nalanine ethyl ester, or ethylene glycol methyl ether. These polymers were found to provide good thermal stability and hydrolytic sensitivity. Chapter 8 contains a discussion of the utility of serine and threonine amino acids as substituents on polyphosphazene chains. Two different types of covalent linkage are exploited to influence the chemical and physical properties of the polymers. When the free amino terminus of serine or threonine ethyl ester was utilized, poly(L-lactide) was grafted from the free alcohol terminus linked to the \u00e1-carbon. This linkage also imparts hydrolytic sensitivity to the polymer skeleton. When the amino terminus was protected, the alcohol function was utilized for chlorine replacement with poly(dichlorophosphazene). The P-O-C linkage is more chemically stable than P-N-C units based on comparisons of polyphosphazenes substituted with amino acid ester side groups. Subsequent deprotection chemistry was utilized to fabricate polymers with free N- and C-termini from the amino acid side group. Polyphosphazenes that possessed the free N- and C-termini are soluble in water, regardless of the pH, and crosslinked hydrogels were obtained in the presence of calcium ions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4678], "author_name_tesi": "Krogman, Nicholas Ryan", "last_name_ssi": "Krogman", "middle_name_ssi": "Ryan", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock", "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Karl Todd Mueller", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock, Committee Chair", "Mary Elizabeth Williams, Committee Member", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymers", "biomedical materials", "polyphosphazenes", "polymer hydrolysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Aligning Business Strategy and Human Resource Management Practices on Organizational Outcomes", "id": "21500", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9959", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research explores the relationship between business strategy, human resource\nmanagement (HRM) practices, and organizational outcomes through two studies.

Because of the spatially complex nature of the global ecosystem, understanding major macroevolutionary events requires an understanding of the processes that control diversity and turnover at a variety of geographic and temporal scales.  This is of particular importance in the study of mass extinction events, which can eliminate established evolutionary lineages and ecologically dominant taxa, setting the stage for post-extinction radiation of previously obscure or minor lineages.  If the macroevolutionary consequences of extinctions and recoveries are to be understood and predicted, the spatial and temporal variations in diversity and turnover must be quantified and the processes underlying these patterns dissected.  \n\tHere, I analyze regional diversity and turnover patterns spanning the Late Ordovician mass extinction and Early Silurian recovery using a database of genus occurrences for inarticulate and articulate brachiopods, bivalves, anthozoans and trilobites.  Chapter 2 compares sampling standardized diversity and turnover trends for the paleocontinent of Laurentia to the global pattern derived from genus first and last appearances.  After accounting for variation in sampling intensity, we find that marine benthic diversity in Laurentia recovered to pre-extinction levels within 5 Myr, which is nearly 15 Myr sooner than suggested by global compilations. The rapid turnover in Laurentia suggests that processes such as immigration may be particularly important in the recovery of regional ecosystems from environmental perturbations.  \nChapter 3 explores variability in the dynamics of recovery at the regional scale, by expanding the database both by doubling the number of occurrences for Laurentia and including data from Baltica and Avalonia.  These data show that sampling standardized diversity trends for the three regions are variable.  Despite the expansion of the database, diversity continues to rebound to pre-extinction levels within 5 Myr of the extinction event in the paleocontinent of Laurentia.  However, diversity in Baltica and Avalonia requires 15 Myr or longer to reach pre-extinction levels.  This increased rate of recovery in Laurentia is due to both lower Late Ordovician extinction intensities and higher Early Silurian origination rates relative to the other continents.  Using brachiopod data, the Rhuddanian recovery was dissected into genus origination and invasion.  This analysis reveals that standing diversity in the Rhuddanian of Laurentia consists of a higher proportion of invading taxa than in either Baltica or Avalonia, indicating invading taxa were prominent in driving the rapid Laurentian rebound.  However, when invading taxa are excluded from diversity counts, Laurentian diversity still rebounds to pre-extinction levels within 10 Myr of the extinction event, suggesting genus origination rates were also higher in Laurentia than in either Baltica or Avalonia.  Higher rates of origination in Laurentia may be expected due to its large size, paleogeographic location, and environmental make-up.  Hypotheses explaining the increased levels of invasion into Laurentia remain largely untested and require further scrutiny.\nIn chapter 4, a phylogenetic analysis of strophomenid brachiopods was performed to explore the decoupling of ecological, evolutionary, and taxonomic severity resulting from the Late Ordovician mass extinction.  After calibrating the cladogram to the fossil record of strophomenids, the stratigraphic ranges of genera were adjusted and ghost lineages were added where applicable.  Many genera sampled only from the Silurian had their ranges extended into the Ordovician after phylogenetic correction.  Using lineages instead of genera resulted in only minor changes to counts of diversity and origination rates.  Lineage terminations were accurately recorded using genera, though proportional extinction patterns were altered due to the addition of Ashgillian lineages through the backwards extension of Silurian lineage ranges.  No monophyla were eliminated in the Ashgill, and surviving lineages were derived from throughout the phylogenetic tree.  This enabled strophomenids to diversify and fill many of the same ecological niches as they had prior to the extinction event.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [576], "author_name_tesi": "Krug, Andrew Zachary", "last_name_ssi": "Krug", "middle_name_ssi": "Zachary", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark E Patzkowsky", "Timothy Bralower", "Christopher Howard House", "Peter Daniel Wilf", "Alan Walker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark E Patzkowsky, Committee Chair", "Timothy Bralower, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member", "Peter Daniel Wilf, Committee Member", "Alan Walker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["recovery", "mass extinction", "Late Ordovician", "diversity"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Ccr4-Not complex regulates transcription elongation and chromatin modifications", "id": "11250", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2521", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although the Ccr4-Not complex regulates an array of cellular activities that control gene expression, its function in transcription initiation and elongation remain unclear.  Described many years ago as a potential regulator of pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation, it was more recently shown to be predominantly cytoplasmic, regulating mRNA degradation through multiple mechanisms.  The opposing roles of the complex in transcription and mRNA decay provide a challenge for interpreting the true function of the Ccr4-Not complex.  Our goal from the studies described below is to provide a comprehensive analysis of how Ccr4-Not contributes to gene expression and to clarify any misconceptions about its role in transcription.  Our studies regarding Ccr4-Not\u2019s function in transcription, regulation of chromatin structure, and genome-wide expression profiles ultimately converge to produce our working model.\nA direct role of this complex in transcription has not been clearly demonstrated.    Here we establish the Ccr4-Not complex as a positive elongation factor, which promotes elongation through direct interactions with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII).  We show Ccr4-Not is targeted to gene promoters in a transcription-dependent manner and remains associated throughout the body of the gene, likely \u201ctraveling\u201d with elongating RNAPII.  In vivo and in vitro studies confirm a direct interaction between Ccr4-Not and RNAPII, which is independent of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII\u2019s largest subunit, Rpb1.  We find that multiple subunits of the complex are required to promote elongation by RNAPII across the gene, and deletion of these subunits results in a \u201cpiling up\u201d of RNAPII.  This phenotype suggests RNAPII may be unable to progress through transcriptional blocks, such as those caused by negative elongation factors and/or DNA-bound proteins, like nucleosomes.  We additionally monitored the \u201clast round\u201d of RNAPII transcription through the gene following repression and observed that deletion of Ccr4-Not subunits results in a delayed run-off of RNAPII compared to wild type.  Taken together, our studies establish Ccr4-Not as a positive elongation factor and suggest a model that requires Ccr4-Not for resumption of elongation following a pause.\nOur second focus was to characterize Ccr4-Not\u2019s role in maintaining and resetting chromatin structure during transcription.  Previous studies have identified a role for the NOT genes in regulation of histone modifications.  Our results agree with the published reports, showing that deletion of NOT4 or NOT5 leads to significantly reduced levels of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3).  However, we additionally show that Ccr4, likely functioning with or parallel to the chromatin remodeling factor Isw1, collaborates to maintain the proper distribution of H3K4me3, a hallmark of active transcription.\nTo conclude our assessment of the Ccr4-Not complex, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of multiple Ccr4-Not subunits, with the hope of identifying transcription patterns of the complex as a whole, address how/which individual subunits regulate specific subclasses of genes, and discriminate the functions of the complex in transcription, deadenylation and decapping.  The addition of our genome-wide data to the studies described above provide the platform from which we build a comprehensive model that encompasses all of our observations regarding Ccr4-Not\u2019s role in transcription. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2502], "author_name_tesi": "Kruk, Jennifer Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Kruk", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph C.

Women\u2019s empowerment is a driving force behind educational programming in international development worldwide. Given the growing global migration crisis, this study analyzes responses to forced migration in Dadaab in the form of educational programs that aim to empower women and that are provided by NGOs. I analyze how women participants in educational programs experienced and conceptualized empowerment related to their involvement in the adult, non-formal learning environment. Using innovative visual and educational ethnographic methods, this research seeks to answer the following questions: How is empowerment interpreted, internalized, (re)appropriated, or contested by women learners in NGO educational programming in Dadaab? How do women participants in NGO programs interpret empowerment in their daily lives? How does their participation in NGO-led programming, as a social process, develop these experiences of empowerment, if at all? \nI conducted a visual educational ethnography of empowerment in educational programs, drawing on data collected in June - August 2014, May - June 2015, and April - June 2016.

This thesis examines enhanced structured stochastic global optimization algorithms for adaptive filtering, with focus on a novel algorithm named particle swarm optimization (PSO). PSO is a technique similar in function to the genetic algorithm (GA) but, unlike the GA, has not emerged in adaptive filtering literature. Population based algorithms, such as PSO and the GA, are envisioned to receive increasing attention as parallel computing technology continues to progress to the forefront of information processing.\nThis thesis explores structured stochastic algorithms with convergence enhancements, develops enhanced versions of PSO and hybrid algorithms, and assesses the relative performance of these algorithms for common IIR and nonlinear adaptive filtering structures and their applications.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1413], "author_name_tesi": "Krusienski, Dean Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Krusienski", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Dean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Kenneth Jenkins", "Kwang Yun Lee", "John F Doherty", "Walter Cede\u00f1o"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Chair", "Kwang Yun Lee, Committee Member", "John F Doherty, Committee Member", "Walter Cede\u00f1o, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Particle Swarm Optimization", "Evolutionary Algorithms", "IIR Adaptive Filters", "Nonlinear Adaptive Filters"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "An Exposure of Android Social Media Applications and the Data ISPs Can Collect", "id": "14730dek5156", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14730", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Social media applications play a key role in our day-to-day lives, using and handling sensitive/private data in their nature.

These NQDs have various novel applications in the electronic and photonic industry, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs) and flat-panel displays. In these applications, ultra-thin films of NQDs in the monolayer regime are needed to ensure optimal current transport properties and device efficiency. There is ongoing search to find a suitable method to deposit and pattern such ultra-thin films of quantum dots with few monolayer thicknesses. Several competing approaches are available, each with its pros and cons. This study explores mist deposition as the technique to fill this void.\n\nIn this study, ultra-thin films of quantum dots are deposited on diverse substrates and are characterized to understand the mechanics of mist deposition. Various applications of blanket deposited and patterned quantum dot films are studied. The results discussed here include atomic force microscopy analysis of the films to study surface morphology, fluorescence microscopy to study light emission and optical microscope images to study patterning techniques. These results demonstrate the ability of mist deposition to form 1-4 monolayers thick, uniform, defect-free patterned films with root mean square (RMS) surface roughness less than 2 nm. LEDs fabricated using mist deposition show a peak luminescence greater than 500 cd/m2 for matched red, yellow and green devices using Alq3 as the electron transport layer, and over 9000 cd/m2 for red devices using ZnO as the electron transport layer, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the experimental approach to study the process and explore potential applications, simulation and modeling are carried out to understand the various aspects of mist deposition. A mathematical model is presented which discusses the atomization process of the precursor solution, the physics involved during the deposition process, and the mechanics of film formation. Results of film morphology simulation using Monte Carlo techniques and process simulation using multi-physics approach are discussed.

The broad aim of this research is to establish a fundamental framework that exploits electronic spin states in semiconductors for the manipulation, transfer, detection and storage of information. We explore two complementary approaches towards the implementation of semiconductor spintronics:\n1. We use materials known as diluted magnetic semiconductors wherein itinerant charge carriers are exchange coupled with magnetic ions incorporated into the semiconductor lattice. This results in a spin polarization of both the carriers as well as the magnetic moments themselves.\n2. Alternatively,  we use optical techniques to introduce spin polarization into the Fermi sea in a conventional (non-magnetic)  semiconductor, and then subsequently monitor the coherent dynamic evolution of this spin polarization. This enables the study of electron spin coherence in semiconductors for applications where the quantum mechanical phase of a wave function is important.\n\nWe begin this dissertation by discussing the underlying basis for diluted magnetic semiconductors. We then follow this with a discussion of experimental studies of the crystal growth and physical properties of a ``canonical\" case: (Ga,Mn)As. We first review how the structural, electrical and magnetic properties of as-grown (Ga,Mn)As epilayers are substantially altered by post-growth annealing. We then highlight an important advance achieved during this dissertation, namely the identification of growth and annealing parameters that result in samples with consistently reproducible Curie temperatures up to 150 K. We also discuss experiments that show how the the proximity of a free surface influences the maximum attainable Curie temperature in a given sample architecture. In particular, we show that a GaAs capping layer as thin as a few monolayers can significantly suppress the enhancement of  the Curie temperature associated with annealing.\n\nWe next consider heterostructures that integrate (Ga,Mn)As with other materials, including the fabrication of (Ga,Mn)As on ZnSe(001) using a recrystallized GaAs template. It is found that n-doping of ZnSe using Cl does not affect the ferromagnetism of (Ga,Mn)As,  paving a pathway to potential applications with (Ga,Mn)As/ZnSe heterostructures. We then demonstrate efficient spin-polarization tunneling between a ferromagnetic metal and a ferromagnetic semiconductor using epitaxial magnetic tunnel junctions composed of a ferromagnetic metal (MnAs) and a ferromagnetic semiconductor [(Ga,Mn)As] separated by a non-magnetic semiconductor (AlAs). In this system, a large tunneling magnetoresistance up to 30% at low temperatures is observed. Analysis of current-voltage characteristics allow us to understand the nature of the tunnel barrier. The next experiment demonstrates the exchange coupling of (Ga,Mn)As with an epitaxially overgrown antiferromagnet (Mn). A clear shift in the magnetization hysteresis loop, as well as an enhancement of the coercivity, is observed when the heterostructure is cooled in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Both coercivity and the exchange field decrease monotonically with increasing temperature and vanish at the T_C of the ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As layer.\n\nFinally, we turn our attention to conventional non-magnetic semiconductor heterostructures in which spin polarization is introduced via optical pumping. The effect of different crystallographic orientations on spin relaxation processes in modulation-doped ZnSe quantum wells is examined. We describe the fabrication of modulation-doped ZnSe(110) quantum wells using a low-temperature-grown GaAs template. Time-resolved Faraday and Kerr spectroscopy probes the transverse spin relaxation times in these new heterostructures, revealing little orientation dependence in spin lifetimes. We finish this dissertation with a briefly discussion of the future direction of coherent control of electron g-factor using magnetic ZnSe parabolic quantum wells.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3616], "author_name_tesi": "Ku, Keh-Chiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Ku", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Keh-Chiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth", "Peter E Schiffer", "Jainendra Jain", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth, Committee Chair", "Peter E Schiffer, Committee Member", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["spintronics", "semiconductor heterostructures", "molecular beam epitaxy", "diluted magnetic semiconductors", "spin coherence"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "ROLE OF THE MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN IN THE REGULATION OF SKELETAL MUSCLE PROTEIN SYNTHESIS AND eIF2B EPSILON mRNA TRANSLATION FOLLOWING ACUTE RESISTANCE EXERCISE", "id": "6895", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4768", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the molecular basis of skeletal muscle protein synthesis and hypertrophy is critical to the development of targets for therapeutic intervention in muscle wasting conditions. There has recently been a great deal of investigation\nregarding the action of protein kinase B (PKB) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the regulation of mRNA translation initiation and subsequent global rates of protein synthesis following muscle contractions or resistance exercise. Previous work has also suggested that the activity of the rate-limiting eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is elevated concomitant with increases in protein synthesis following an acute bout of resistance exercise. The mechanisms regulating eIF2B activity following exercise are explored in the present dissertation, with an emphasis on potential interaction between PKB/mTOR signaling and eIF2B activity. It is demonstrated herein, that: 1) abundance of mRNAs encoding eIF2B subunits are increased late in the recovery period following an acute bout of resistance exercise, following the time period associated with an increase in protein synthetic rates, 2) PKB/mTOR signaling is rapidly, but transiently induced within the first hour following exercise prior to any observed increase in protein synthesis, 3) signaling through mTOR is required for increased muscle protein synthesis and efficient\ninitiation of mRNA translation following exercise, and 4) eIF2B? mRNA translation/protein expression is increased in a mTOR-dependent manner concomitant with elevated rates of protein synthesis. In the context of previous work in the currently\nemployed model of resistance exercise, these findings suggested that early activation of mTOR following exercise may result in translation control of pro-growth mRNAs, such as eIF2B?, that contribute to increased rates of protein synthesis later in the recovery time course. The novel role for mTOR in the regulation of eIF2B? mRNA translation may be a general mechanism for control of global rates of protein synthesis, as this result is also observed in response to leucine and IGF-1 in Rat 2 fibroblasts.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4746], "author_name_tesi": "Kubica, Neil ", "last_name_ssi": "Kubica", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Neil", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Peter A Farrell", "Scot R Kimball", "Charles H Lang", "Charles D Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Committee Chair", "Peter A Farrell, Committee Member", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Charles D Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["eIF2B", "mTOR", "PKB", "mRNA translation", "skeletal muscle"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Femtosecond Infrared Lasers Applied to Fundamental and Bio-imaging Studies in Time-of-flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry ", "id": "21954", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10042", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Strong field ionization by ultrashort IR pulses was applied to secondary neutral mass spectrometry.

The overwhelming consensus in the theoretical literature is that access to international risk sharing in the presence of uninsured TFP shocks induces a country to specialize more in its comparative advantage industries. In Chapter 1 of my dissertation I demonstrate that the effect of financial integration on production patterns depends on preferences and on the structure of the variance-covariance matrix of TFP shocks present in the economy. Using a variant of the standard 2x2 Ricardian model with TFP shocks by Helpman and Razin (1978), I show that if TFP shocks affect each industry in all countries the same way, the standard assumption, then financial integration indeed leads to a more specialized production structure. However, if shocks are not correlated across countries and affect all industries in a country the same way, then the effect of financial integration is ambiguous. I also show that in the absence of international risk sharing the Helpman-Razin model generally has (discrete) multiple equilibria - an overlooked phenomenon. I build a framework with a continuum of goods in the spirit of Eaton-Kortum and show how the multiple equilibria can be numerically bounded. Using this framework I explore the welfare effects of financial integration through its impact on the production structure. This work can be seen as a first attempt to bring together the discussion of international risk sharing and trade in the context of quantitative trade models of comparative advantage.\n\nChapter 2 is a joint work with Gary Lyn and Andres Rodriguez-Clare. This Chapter studies the implications for trading economies of industry-level external economies of scale, also known as Marshallian externalities. This fundamental question has received little attention in the recent trade literature because of the large number of equilibria that typically occur in trade models with Marshallian externalities. In this work we build a version of such a model that yields a unique equilibrium and a standard gravity equation. The underlying structure of our model is isomorphic to that of a multi-industry Krugman model of firm-level economies of scale and so our uniqueness result extends to this setting as well. The welfare analysis reveals that if the conditions for uniqueness are satisfied then all countries gain from trade even when the strength of scale economies varies across industries. Moreover, the presence of scale economies tends to decrease the gains from trade but increase the gains from trade liberalization.\n\nChapter 3 is devoted to a theoretical analysis of a model with a nested constant elasticity of substitution utility function and heterogeneous firms involved in price competition. Models of this type have become popular in the international trade literature in recent years. I show the continuity of the model as the elasticity of substitution between goods goes to infinity. This result contrasts with the conjecture of prior literature. Continuity of the model ensures consistency of its outcomes when the elasticity of substitution approaches infinity. Therefore, researchers who were reluctant to use this model because of the lack of proof of continuity can now rely on the result of my work to employ the model in their research.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11050], "author_name_tesi": "Kucheryavyy, Konstantin ", "last_name_ssi": "Kucheryavyy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Konstantin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Ross Yeaple", "Jonathan W Eaton", "Stephen Ross Yeaple", "Edward James Green", "James R.

The focus of the data gathering was Zelo\u2019s past and present experiences under various layers of oppression to explore the phenomenon and gain more insights. </p>\n<p>The major findings are related to two key inseparable phenomena: the nature of oppression and the dynamics of counter-learning. This study revealed that oppression is not only multi-layered, it is also multi-dimensional. In addition, oppression creates its own vital cultural components that play a crucial role in both feeding back the system of oppression and maintaining it, and also creating subjective and material conditions to resist the given ways of knowing, learning, sensing, feeling, and being. Some of the components are culture of creating a caretaker, culture of silence, culture of objectification, culture of double bind, and culture of learned-hopelessness. This study provided many insights into counter-learning. Zelo\u2019s narrative revealed that through her daily struggle and circumstances, she learned to conceptualize, problematize, and politicize daily oppressive occurrences. She usually did this without deliberate articulation of it. Engaging with counter-learning, Zelo also learned to make meaning out of seemingly innocent and apolitical experiences. For example, motherhood, in her hands, became subversive rather than submissive; collective rather than individual; and it has become empowering rather than empowered by third parties. Zelo also saw and felt the power of words and concepts. She began distinguishing words and giving them socio-political meaning. In addition, engaging counter-learning not only restored her self image that was derogated and damaged by the oppression but also increased her self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-respect. Furthermore, she experienced transformation, which manifested itself morally, spiritually, and politically. Finally, the data indicated counter-learning was emotional, symbolic and imaginative. Based on these findings, implications for adult education theory and practice are discussed.

Further research is needed into the implementation of extreme load-resistant technologies in the commercial building industry.\n\nThis thesis presents a developmental study that included full-scale experiments on wall systems against out-of-plane uniform loading. The main objectives of this study were (1) to research and develop blast resistant enhancement techniques for brick veneer walls with steel stud backup systems; (2) to design and build a pressure loading facility to test full scale wall specimens under out-of-plane loading; (3) to experimentally determine the static loading capacity of the developed wall system designs; and (4) to compare the experimental results to finite element modeling analysis.\n\nThe enhanced brick veneer on steel stud wall specimens were experimentally tested to failure with an out-of-plane load.  The custom designed uniform load testing facility used a high-strength pressure bladder and reaction panel frame to conduct testing of the wall panels. Four specimens in total were tested.\n\nComponent testing was also carried out to determine the reaction properties of the wall system fasteners.  To achieve the desired tension-membrane response to the out-of-plane loading, connections between components had to be experimentally verified prior to full-scale specimen design and construction.  Data collected for comparison during testing of the full-scale specimens included the load applied verses: deflection in the brick veneer, deflection in the steel studs, and load-distribution across the brick veneer ties.

Though the topology remains consistent throughout the population, the exact branching geometry is unique to the individual.

The Constant Shear Stress (CSS) model, derived from Murray\u2019s law, asserts that each vessel achieves efficiency by balancing the energy required by the heart to pump blood and the blood volume necessary to fill the vasculature. The Optimal Transport Network (OTN) model is an alternative hypothesis that suggests the vasculature minimizes power dissipation in response to both local and global sources with constraints on resource availability. The OTN model utilizes a parameter \u03b3 that describes the scaling between infrastructure and pumping expenses, ultimately determining the optimized network topology. In this study, two-photon microscopy was used to measure diameter and centerline red blood cell velocity simultaneously in pial arterioles and venules of the awake behaving mouse, allowing for subsequent volumetric flux, power dissipation, and wall shear stress calculations. The CSS and OTN models were applied individually to the CSS and OTN models and optimized by minimizing the chi square value. A comparison of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) values determined that the OTN model better explains the relationship between vessel diameter and centerline velocity in the cerebral arteriole and venule networks than the CSS model.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10778], "author_name_tesi": "Kudlik, D'anne Elyse", "last_name_ssi": "Kudlik", "middle_name_ssi": "Elyse", "first_name_ssi": "D'anne", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick James Drew"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick James Drew, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["transport network", "blood flow", "optimal transport network", "blood flow modeling", "cerebral vasculature", "pial vasculature"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "A Study of Laser and Pressure-Driven Response Measurements for Solid Propellants at Low Pressure", "id": "5839", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2136", "defended_at_dtsi": "2000-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work was part of a larger program aimed at understanding and modeling propellant combustion and its interaction with changes in pressure and velocity in a typical rocket motor.  A pressure driven combustion facility was developed and used to measure pressure-coupled amplitude and phase response during combustion of propellant samples at low pressure.  Laser-driven experiments were also performed in a different chamber to measure propellant response at atmospheric pressure.  A CO2 laser was used to ignite and sustain combustion during laser and pressure-driven combustion and also served as a source of oscillatory laser flux during laser-driven combustion.  The laser did not play a direct role in the pressure-driven response measurements.  The primary objective behind these laser-driven experiments was verification of the hypothesis in the literature that suggests the laser and pressure-driven propellant responses are analogous to each other.  \nAdvanced homogeneous propellants like HMX and heterogeneous AP composite propellants were tested under laser and pressure-driven experiments at pressures of 1, 2 and 3 atmosphere.  Erikson at BYU has developed a model that predicts the behavior of HMX propellants under oscillatory combustion conditions and efforts also focused on comparisons between the experimental and numerical data.  \nOne-dimensional energy balance analyses in addition to steady-state temperature measurements were used to evaluate the effects of condensed-phase heat release and gas-phase heat feedback on the propellant response amplitudes.  Steady-state species measurements were used to validate gas-phase chemical mechanisms for HMX and the AP/HTPB propellants.  These validated mechanisms were then used in a one-dimensional premixed flame code to obtain the steady and unsteady components of the gas-phase heat feedback.  \nAn analytical model developed by Culick was used to perform parametric studies to evaluate the effects of gas-phase heat feedback and condensed-phase heat release on the magnitude of the response functions.  An analytical model based on the work of Iribicu and Williams, and Roh, Apte and Yang was also used to obtain the response function as a function of gas-phase heat feedback and condensed-phase heat release and was compared to the experimentally measured response functions.  \nLaser-driven response experiments on HMX showed that the response amplitude decreased with an increase in pressure.  The unsteady component of the laser flux induces an unsteady component of the gas-phase heat feedback that is out of phase with the laser flux.  The laser-driven experiments measured the response of the propellant to this net unsteady flux that is incident on the propellant surface.  The increase in pressure increased the unsteady gas-phase heat feedback and hence decreased the net unsteady flux on the propellant surface and resulted in the lower response amplitudes.  The pressure-driven response amplitudes increased with the increase in pressure because these experiments measured the propellant response to the unsteady gas-phase heat feedback that increased with pressure.  Hence the laser and pressure-driven response experiments cannot be considered to be analogous for HMX.  Comparisons with the numerical data of Erikson showed that the numerical model predicted a laser-driven response that is three times lower than the measured laser-driven response and predicts a pressure-driven response that is 50-70% lower than the measured pressure-driven response.  Erikson believes this is due to poorly resolved condensed-phase kinetics and poor temperature sensitivity data.  The analytical model of Culick also under-predicted the measured pressure-driven response profiles for HMX.  Hence the analytical model of Iribicu and Williams was derived and provides reasonable agreement with the experimental values for pressure-driven response amplitude.  This expression of Iribicu and Williams allowed for experimental inputs for the condensed-phase heat release and the gas-phase heat feedback.  Clearly the difficulties in such experimental measurements reinforced the need for rigorous models that capture the appropriate physics.  Comparison of the pressure and laser-driven response data with the theoretical transfer function of Son et al. showed that the transfer function severely under-predicted the experimental data at two and three atmospheres and slightly under-predicted the experimental data at one atmosphere.  The simplifying assumptions to the ZN approach result in only limited use to this transfer function and hence it is ill advised to use this transfer function to predict pressure-driven response based on laser-driven response data.  \nLaser and pressure-driven response amplitudes for the MURI 4 and 5 propellants decreased with an increase in pressure and laser flux due to the increase in the condensed-phase exothermicity and the decrease in the unsteady components of the net flux and gas-phase heat feedback incident on the propellant surface.  The increase in pressure resulted in lower pressure-driven response amplitudes because the pressure change did not affect the gas-phase heat feedback but increased the exothermic heat release in the condensed-phase.  The analytical model of Culick showed qualitative agreement in trends for the pressure-driven response function but continued to under-predict the experimentally measured values for the pressure-driven response function.  The transfer function of Son et al. under-predicted the experimental data at both laser fluxes for the MURI 4 and 5 propellants.  Clearly the limitations of the ZN approach results in limited use of this transfer function.  The data clearly shows that the transfer function should not be used to obtain pressure-driven response data based on laser-driven experiments.  \nLaser-driven response amplitudes for the AP/energetic propellants showed no change with the increase in laser flux, while the pressure-driven response amplitudes decreased with the increase in laser flux.  The changes in mean laser flux had different effects on the laser and pressure-driven response amplitudes and suggest different driving mechanisms.  Hence the laser and pressure-driven response functions should not be considered as analogous experiments.  Laser-driven response amplitudes for the HTPE propellants increased with the increase in laser flux, while the pressure-driven response amplitudes decreased with the increase in laser flux.  Once again the different effects of laser flux on the laser and pressure-driven response functions suggests different driving mechanisms and hence disproves the hypothesis that the two experiments are analogous to each other.\nHence pressure-driven experiments coupled with detailed numerical models are essential towards obtaining predictive response functions for the advanced propellants.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2116], "author_name_tesi": "Kudva, Gautam Narendra", "last_name_ssi": "Kudva", "middle_name_ssi": "Narendra", "first_name_ssi": "Gautam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stefan Thynell", "Thomas Litzinger", "Vigor Yang", "Michael Matthew Micci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stefan Thynell, Committee Member", "Thomas Litzinger, Committee Chair", "Vigor Yang, Committee Member", "Michael Matthew Micci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["laser-driven", "response measurements", "solid propellants", "pressure-driven"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "PROSUMER-CITIZENSHIP AND THE LOCAL:\nA CRITICAL CASE STUDY OF CONSUMER REVIEWING ON YELP.COM\n\n\n", "id": "12069", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3515", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past few years, content developers searching for new markets have found a potentially lucrative consumer base in local and location-based services as new media platforms have begun to \u201cexpand\u201d their focus to hyper-local place-based communities. This shift to \u201clocal 2.0\u201d has given birth to \u201clocal listing sites,\u201d an emerging social medium that converges the content of traditional Yellow Pages, consumer-generated content and the interactive features of social network sites. Such sites harness the productive power of \u201cprosumers,\u201d the hybrid subjectivity of new media users who simultaneously produce and consume online content (Tapscott & Williams, 2006). These sites capitalize on the productivity of users who create discourses through and about local consumption by voluntarily rating and reviewing local businesses and services, challenging the power of institutions traditionally responsible for the production of consumer culture and reputation management (e.g., local business owners, marketers, advertisers, professional critics).\n\tTheoretical perspectives on the power of prosumption vary across academic scholarship; on the one end of this debate are techno-utopians who believe prosumption empowers consumers whose choices have been long constrained by a top-down corporate culture and marketing industry (e.g., Bruns, 2008; Jenkins, 2007). On the other end, critical scholars position consumer-generated content as a form of free labor and thus tend to view prosumption as an inherently exploitative practice (e.g., Andrejevic, 2007; Cohen, 2008; van Dijck, 2009). Yet while the theoretical positions on prosumption are divisive, empirical research on these debates is comparatively limited \u2013 particularly as it pertains to how prosumers negotiate their role as content producers in the digital economy. \nThis dissertation aims to fill the lack of empirical prosumption research with an investigation of the practice of consumer-reviewing as a form of prosumption on the local listing site Yelp.com \u2013 a social networking site and local listing guide that allows consumers to rate and review local businesses and services in their community.  This project aims to understand how consumers-as-media-producers experience and make sense of their productive activity through this emerging social media format, as well as the mediating role that localism plays in this process. Yelp offers up a unique opportunity to not only appropriate prosumption as a form of consumer-citizenship but to reconnect people through a local, place-based identification through social and political action. Thus, this research also explores how prosumption in the \u201cvirtual\u201d impacts offline behaviors in the \u201creal.\u201d\nThis project is a study in three parts; the first section begins with a critical discourse analysis of Yelp\u2019s promotional campaign and site architecture that investigates how the site rhetorically and structurally enables and delimits prosumer agency and power. The second section offers a textual analysis of consumer reviews in order to demonstrate how Yelp structures participation to primarily articulate prosumers as customers over [local] citizens; the third part analyzes interviews conducted with active Yelpers and argues that consumer reviewing, as a form of prosumption, is a complex and conflicting practice. While consumer reviewing is not inherently empowering or exploitative, its potential to serve as a form of consumer-citizenship is decidedly limited. Interviews reveal that although Yelpers negotiate and contest the discursive constraints placed on prosumption by the site\u2019s architectures of participation, these same users also rationalize and identify with the site\u2019s exploitative tendencies. As such, Yelp is ultimately treated as \u201cnot the place\u201d for articulating the politics of consumption which suggest limitations in the transformative capabilities of this prosumption practice. While counter-discourses are at times employed, Yelpers ultimately work to reproduce hegemonic discourses of consumption. \n \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3498], "author_name_tesi": "Kuehn, Kathleen Mary", "last_name_ssi": "Kuehn", "middle_name_ssi": "Mary", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick Robert Parsons", "Patrick Robert Parsons", "Michael Elavsky", "Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Michelle E Day"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick Robert Parsons, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick Robert Parsons, Committee Chair", "Michael Elavsky, Committee Member", "Matthew Paul Mcallister, Committee Member", "Michelle E Day, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["new media", "web cultures", "prosumer theory", "prosumer citizenship", "consumer reviewing", "user generated content", "prosumption", "consumer citizenship", "citizen-consumer", "consumer-citizen", "the politics of consumption", "Yelp", "social network", "social media", "consumer generated content", "participatory consumption", "Internet", "localism", "hyperlocal media", "Web 2.0", "local 2.0", "local listing sites"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Kinetics of Oxygen-enhanced Water Gas Shift on Bimetallic Catalysts and the Roles of Metals and Support", "id": "11599", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3184", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The post-processing of reformate is an important step in producing hydrogen (H2) with low carbon monoxide (CO) for low temperature fuel cells from syn-gas. However, the conventional process consists of three steps, i.e. two steps of water gas shift (WGS) and preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO, and it is not suitable for mobile applications due to the large volume of water gas shift (WGS) catalysts and conditioning and/or regeneration necessary for these catalysts. Aiming at replacing those three steps by a simple one-step process, small amount of oxygen was added to WGS (the reaction called oxygen-enhanced water gas shift or OWGS) to promote the reaction kinetics and low pyrophoric ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts were employed for stable performance in this reaction. \nNot only CO conversion, but also H2 yield was found to increase by the O2 addition on CeO2-supported catalysts. The characteristics of OWGS, high H2 production rate at 200 to 300oC at short contact time where unreacted O2 exists, evidenced the impact of O2 addition on surface species on the catalyst. Around 1.5 of reaction order in CO for various CeO2-supported metal catalysts for OWGS compared to reaction orders in CO ranging from -0.1 to 0.6 depending on metal species for WGS shows O2 addition decreases CO coverage to free up the active sites for co-reactant (H2O) adsorption and activation. \nAmong the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts, Pt-Cu and Pd-Cu bimetallic catalysts were superior to monometallic catalysts in OWGS. These bimetallic components were found to form alloys where noble metal is surrounded mainly by Cu to have strong interaction between noble metal and copper resulting in high OWGS activity and low pyrophoric property. The metal loadings were optimized for CeO2-supported Pd-Cu bimetallic system and 2 wt% Pd with 5 \u2013 10 wt% Cu were found to be the optimum for the present OWGS condition. In the kinetic study, Pd in Pd-Cu was shown to increase the active sites for H2O dissociation and/or the subsequent reaction with chemisorbed CO as well as Pd keeps Cu in reduced state. Cu was found to keep Pd dispersed, suppress H2 activation on Pd, and facilitate CO2 desorption from catalyst surface. \nWhile composition and structure of metal have large impacts on OWGS performance, CeO2 was shown to create new sites for H2O activation at metal-ceria interfacial region in concert with metal. These new sites strongly activate H2O to drive OWGS and WGS compared to the pure metallic sites which are present in majority on Al2O3-supported catalyst. The observed two regimes of turnover rate, the one dependent on catalyst surface area and the other independent of surface area, strongly suggested bifunctional reaction pathway where the reaction rate is determined by activation of H2O and by association of chemisorbed CO and H2O. The associative route was also evidenced by pulse response study where the reaction occurs only when CO and H2O pulses are supplied together, and thus pre-adsorbed species such as formate and carbonate identified by FT-IR are proven to be spectators. No correlation between WGS rate and isotopic exchange rate of molecularly adsorbed D2O with H2 showed H2O dissociation is necessary for WGS to occur. \nLong duration tests revealed CeO2-supported Pd-Cu, Pt-Cu and Cu catalysts are stable in OWGS condition compared to Pt, Pd, and Al2O3-supported Pd-Cu catalysts which exhibited continuous deactivation during about 70 hours of test. The addition of Cu prevents agglomeration of monometallic Pd and carbonate formation on monometallic Pt during the reaction. The better activity and stability of Pd-Cu and Pt-Cu bimetallic catalysts in the realistic OWGS condition were ascribed to the unique active sites consisting of highly dispersed Pd in Cu or Pt in Cu on CeO2, which are good for H2O activation with low reaction inhibition by the product gases. Pt monometallic catalyst showed and highest activity in OWGS in the absence of product gases, but this was found vulnerable in the presence of product gases due to strong adsorption of H2 and CO2 on this catalyst.\nThe present thesis has shown large benefits of OWGS over WGS both in fundamental understanding of the reaction and in practical applications. OWGS enabled observation of kinetic feature of WGS which is strongly limited by high CO coverage of the active sites. O2 addition to WGS decreases CO coverage to open up the subsequent H2O activation/reaction processes and to make it visible in kinetics. The kinetic results in turn evidenced the bifunctional route. The rate was well fitted to Langmuir-Hinshelwood model when the function of CeO2 is sufficient, which confirmed the reaction occurs through association of the reactants on the catalyst surface. In the practical view point, OWGS enhanced CO shift to H2 at low temperature and CeO2-supported Pd-Cu bimetallic catalyst provided high activity and low pyrophoricity in OWGS, which are promising for mobile low temperature fuel cell application.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3172], "author_name_tesi": "Kugai, Junichiro ", "last_name_ssi": "Kugai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Junichiro", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Chunshan Song", "Yaw D Yeboah", "Yongsheng Chen", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Dissertation Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Committee Chair", "Yaw D Yeboah, Committee Member", "Yongsheng Chen, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Oxygen-enhanced Water Gas Shift (OWGS)", "Water Gas Shift (WGS)", "Pd", "Cu", "Metal Catalyst", "CeO2-supported Pd-Cu", "Bimetallic catalyst"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "A New Design Methodology for Modular Broadband Arrays Based on Fractal Tilings\n\n", "id": "6095", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6591", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "       In this thesis, a new and innovative technique based on the theory of fractal tilings is introduced for the design of modular broadband arrays.  These arrays are unique in the sense that they possess a fractal boundary contour that tiles the plane without gaps or overlaps.  The first of these new array configurations that will be considered is directly related to the family of space-filling and self-avoiding fractals known as Peano-Gosper curves. The elements of the fractal array are uniformly distributed along a Peano-Gosper curve, which leads to a planar array configuration with parallelogram cells that is bounded by a closed Koch curve. These unique properties are exploited in order to develop a design methodology for deterministic arrays that have no grating lobes even when the minimum spacing between elements is increased to at least one-wavelength. This leads to a class of arrays that are relatively broadband when compared to more conventional periodic planar arrays with square or rectangular cells and regular boundary contours. This type of fractal array differs fundamentally from other types of fractal array configurations that have been studied previously that have regular boundaries with elements distributed in a fractal pattern on the interior of the array.  \nAn efficient iterative procedure for calculating the radiation patterns of these Peano-Gosper fractal arrays to arbitrary stage of growth P is also introduced in this thesis.  Moreover, we note that Peano-Gosper arrays are self-similar since they may be formed in an iterative fashion such that the array at stage P is composed of seven identical stage P-1 sub-arrays (i.e., they consist of arrays of arrays).  This lends itself to a convenient modular architecture whereby each of these sub-arrays could be individually controlled.  In other words, the unique arrangement of tiles forms sub-arrays that could be designed to support simultaneous multibeam and multifrequency operation.  Finally, several other examples of fractal tilings that lead to broadband array configurations will be considered including terdragon and 6-terdragon arrays.  \n\tThis thesis also introduces several new self-scalable arrays that can be generated by repeated application of a ring subarray generator, including pentagonal, octagonal, and honeycomb arrays.  These arrays have the advantage that they can be recursively generated, allowing development of rapid algorithms for calculating their radiation patterns.  They are also shown to possess relatively low sidelobe levels.  Lastly, the radiation characteristics of some basic three-dimensional volumetric fractal arrays generated using concentric sphere subarrays will be briefly considered. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6589], "author_name_tesi": "Kuhirun, Waroth ", "last_name_ssi": "Kuhirun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Waroth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner", "Raj Mittra", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Pingjuan Li Werner", "Brian Lewis Weiner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Chair", "Raj Mittra, Committee Member", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member", "Pingjuan Li Werner, Committee Member", "Brian Lewis Weiner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fractal", "Broadband Arrays", "Irregular", "Fractile"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Affinity Propagation for Computer-aided Detection of Lung Cancer in 3D PET/CT Studies", "id": "14658tkk3", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14658", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bronchoscopic biopsy of suspicious sites is a critical component of lung-cancer staging.  \nPhysicians use PET/CT studies to provide structural and functional information important to diagnosis, staging, and bronchoscopy procedure planning.\nIn this thesis, we aim to develop an automatic robust and time-efficient method for detection of PET-avid thoracic regions of interest (ROIs) in 3D PET/CT studies.\nThe method presented in this thesis uses a PET histogram of the thoracic cavity to automatically select thresholds to apply to the PET study.\nWe detect PET ROIs using thresholds from affinity propagation clustering on the PET histogram after  smoothing using kernel density estimation and exponential smoothing.\nDetected ROIs are subsequently filtered using false positive reduction techniques based on physical constraints of the PET image volumes and empirically chosen volume and intensity restrictions.\nThe method achieves a 68.3\\% true detection rate, 40.1\\% positive predictive value, and an average of 7.6 false positives per case, evaluated over a dataset of 17 cases.\nThe average computation time for the method is 7.1 seconds.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15682], "author_name_tesi": "Kuhlengel, Trevor Keith", "last_name_ssi": "Kuhlengel", "middle_name_ssi": "Keith", "first_name_ssi": "Trevor", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Evan Higgins", "Robert Collins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Evan Higgins, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Collins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PET/CT", "PET", "CT", "affinity propagation", "lung cancer", "automated detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Anti-Humanist Modernism: Thinking Beyond the Human in Early Twentieth-Century Literature\n", "id": "10350", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1772", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation, titled _Anti-Humanist Modernism: Thinking Beyond the Human in Early Twentieth-Century Literature_, explores the concept of anti-humanism within the historical context of modernism in order to show modernism\u2019s complex co-development with specific anti-humanist modes, and to recover a version of modernism that is as invested in representing exteriority and interrelationality as interiority and subjectivity.  While literary modernism tends to be thought of in terms of formal experiments that heighten access to the human subject or to \u201clife itself,\u201d such as impressionism and the stream-of-consciousness novel, this study considers the various critiques mounted by modernist writers of an autonomous human subject claiming to be the agent of history.  In _Anti-Humanist Modernism_, I argue that these critiques of humanism emergent in the modernist period were not limited to writers who were sympathetic to fascism or other authoritarian movements \u2013 rather they proliferated among writers interested in considering the potential of life outside the constraints of the strictly human and addressing the possibility that even if we agree that humans are not innately good (as humanism supposes) it does not necessarily follow that they should be controlled by some super-human figure or structure.\n\nThrough readings of W.B.

This study reconsiders the history of anti-humanist thought as a whole, by suggesting through these specific readings that the formation we know as anti-humanism is not simply a branch of French poststructuralism, but a system of thought complete with its own literary traditions and tactics that continued to develop from its beginnings in the works of Friedrich Nietzsche throughout the modernist period.  While anti-humanism has long persisted on the edge of modernism and modernist studies, this study argues that anti-humanism is a larger formation that informed modernism much more broadly than has previously been suggested; further, anti-humanism connects modernism \u2013 the first half of the twentieth century \u2013 to poststructuralism, postmodernism, and our own contemporary moment.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1757], "author_name_tesi": "Kuhn, Elizabeth ", "last_name_ssi": "Kuhn", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janet Wynne Lyon", "Janet Wynne Lyon", "Michael Francis Berube", "Mark Stewart Morrisson", "Jeffrey Nealon", "John Philip Christman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janet Wynne Lyon, Dissertation Advisor", "Janet Wynne Lyon, Committee Chair", "Michael Francis Berube, Committee Member", "Mark Stewart Morrisson, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Nealon, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["interrelationality", "anti-humanism", "modernism"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "UNDERSTANDING ONLINE STUDENT SUCCESS THROUGH THE USE OF ASTIN\u2019S IEO MODEL", "id": "13978mlm629", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13978", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study will survey undergraduate students who pursue higher education exclusively online and are enrolled at a large public research university that is recognized for providing superior online education, Penn State University World Campus.

The environments in these massive star-forming regions (MSFR) can affect how stars form and whether the young stellar clusters remain bound after star formation ends, both of which are questions that have received considerable attention from researchers.  \n\nStudies of stellar populations in Galactic MSFRs are made difficult due to large numbers of fields stars in the Galactic Plane, large areas of the sky that must be surveyed, high optical extinction from dust, and nebulosity in the the optical and infrared. The Massive Young Star-Forming Complex Study in Infrared and X-ray (MYStIX) uses multiwavelength observations to overcome some of these difficulties, providing some of the most complete, clean membership lists for 20 MSFRs within 3.6 kpc of the Sun. I described X-ray catalogs and mid-infrared catalogs that were used in this survey. \n\nThe spatial distribution of young stars in 17 MYStIX regions are used to probe the origin and dynamics of the young stellar clusters. Intrinsic stellar surface-density maps are made for each region, which reveal complex structures with dense subclusters. I examine in detail one of the nearest MYStIX young stellar clusters, W~40 (d=500 pc), which has properties similar to many of the subclusters in more massive and more distant star-forming regions. The cluster in W~40 has a simple structure with mass segregation, indicating that it has undergone dynamical evolution, even though its young age (~0.8 Myr) is insufficient for relaxation from two-body interactions. This apparent contradiction may be evidence of more rapid dynamical evolution accelerated by the merger of subclusters. \n\nOverall,  142 subclusters of young stars are found in the 17 MSFRs using the statistical \"finite-mixture model\" cluster analysis method, and the intrinsic stellar populations for these clusters are inferred using \"initial mass functions\" and \"X-ray luminosity functions.\" Four structural classes are seen in MSFR: linear chains of subclusters, clumpy structures, core-halo structures, and simple isolated clusters. The subclusters do follow the structure of the molecular clouds, but do not appear to be coeval with each other. There is strong evidence in the subcluster properties for gas expulsion and subcluster expansion (e.g., the density~radius and age~radius relations), and evidence that is consistent with subcluster mergers (e.g., the ellipticity distribution and the number~density}$ relation). \n\nThe cluster analysis provides evidence to support hierarchical models of stellar cluster formation, which have been theorized to explain mass segregation and dynamical relaxation in very young clusters. The ~1 Myr age spreads in the subclusters of a MSFR appear to require slower star-formation in giant molecular clouds with continually driven turbulence, rather than clouds with rapidly decaying turbulence.  And, the diverse range of stellar surface density environment in MSFRs will have implications for models of cluster survival after gas removal.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10062], "author_name_tesi": "Kuhn, Michael Ascher", "last_name_ssi": "Kuhn", "middle_name_ssi": "Ascher", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric D Feigelson", "Konstantin V Getman", "G Jogesh Babu", "Leisa K Townsley", "Kevin Luhman", "Richard Alan Wade"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric D Feigelson, Dissertation Advisor", "Konstantin V Getman, Dissertation Advisor", "G Jogesh Babu, Committee Member", "Leisa K Townsley, Committee Member", "Kevin Luhman, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Wade, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Astronomy", "Star Formation", "Star Clusters", "X-ray Astronomy", "Infrared Astronomy"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Community dynamics of streamside forests: Lessons from the Conestoga River drainage, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, USA\n\n\n\n", "id": "7259", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5197", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "                                                                 Abstract\n\n\tRiparian zones have come to be recognized as providers of critical ecosystem functions in watersheds, namely water pollution mitigation, erosion and flood control, wildlife habitat, carbon storage, recreation and aesthetics.  Relatively few studies have focused on riparian systems in the northeastern United States where habitat degradation has been severe since settlement.  The drainage of the Conestoga River in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania was selected for study, as this intensely farmed area is an extreme case in which very erodable soils and inadequate riparian buffers have resulted in the transport of remarkable loads of silt and agricultural enrichment into the watershed.   Conservation of limited streamside forests and creation of new ones is vital for the region.\n\tThis study focuses on four areas of streamside forest ecology:  1) The impacts of past land use from presettlement to the present on the forest community, 2) The composition of the present community and changes that have occurred over the last ten years, 3) The effects of climate on the growth of nine common riparian species, comparing growth responses of trees at streamside with that of trees at a distance from the stream, and 4) The effects of floods on the woody riparian community.\n\tInformation on the presettlement forest was obtained from witness trees recorded in the early 18th century metes and bounds land surveys. Dramatic changes were seen when comparing the early forest inferred from the witness trees with the modern  \nstreamside forest.  At settlement, the Lancaster County streamside forests were dominated by Quercus alba, Q. velutina and Carya, spp.   Today Quercus alba and Q. velutina combined make up only 2% of the community in the same area.  The forest is now dominated by early successional species, namely Acer negundo, A. saccharinum, Platanus occidentalis and Fraxinus pennsylvanica. \n\tTo determine the composition and structure of the modern forest, 46 sampling locations were established throughout the Conestoga River drainage to include, where possible, all tributaries and all existing stream classes.  Over 8000 trees were included in the study.  Two distinct streamside communities were identified, associated with the two contrasting physiographic provinces in the study area.  The more species rich northern community, an environment of first and second order streams, was dominated by Acer rubrum, F. pennsylvanica, Liriodendron tulipifera and P. occidentalis, with the late successional species Acer saccharum and Fagus grandifolia occurring prominently in the understory.  P. occidentalis, A negundo, A. saccharinum and F. pennsylvanica dominate the southern community along the mainstem of the lower Conestoga River and lower reaches of the major tributaries. The effects of severe flooding limit this community to early successional and flood resistor species.\n\tRadial growth of nine common tree species was evaluated using a dendroclimatological approach, comparing growth responses in the streamside and contiguous upland environment for each species.  Radial growth was correlated with Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and temperature and precipitation separately.  Three guilds of trees emerged in the streamside environment:  L. tulipifera and   \nF. pennsylvanica correlated positively with climate variables (grew best in wet and warm conditions); P. occidentalis, A saccharum, A. saccharinum, A. negundo and Ailanthus altissima correlated negatively (grew best during the worst droughts); and A. rubrum and Celtis occidentalis showed weak and mixed correlations. These correlations were usually not seen with these species in the upland environments.\n\tThe lower Conestoga River drainage is a region shaped by an extreme historical event, the Hurricane Agnes flood of 1972.  Seven sites were selected in the lower drainage to represent a range of potential flood velocities, inferred from channel morphology.  Tree core analysis revealed that most of the trees in the floodplain of the highest velocity sites dated to the Agnes event.  In the lowest velocity site no evidence of this establishment pulse was seen.  There is a gradient in between.  A major release event is documented in the tree ring records of those trees that established prior to 1972 and survived the flood.  Patterns seen in this study can be applied to other systems to infer flood histories and stand dynamics in the absence of hydrological records.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5172], "author_name_tesi": "Kuhn, Robert Jeffrey", "last_name_ssi": "Kuhn", "middle_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marc David Abrams", "David Eissenstat", "Kim C Steiner", "Alan Taylor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marc David Abrams, Committee Chair", "David Eissenstat, Committee Member", "Kim C Steiner, Committee Member", "Alan Taylor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["riparian", "floods", "forest ecology", "dendrochronology", "witness trees"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A LEPIDOPTERAN AMINOACYLASE, A HYDROLASE OF FATTY ACID AMINO ACID CONJUGATES\n", "id": "11459", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1705", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fatty-acid amino acid conjugates (FACs) in caterpillar oral secretions elicit plant defense responses during herbivory. The levels of these FAC elicitors within the caterpillar appear to be controlled by two enzymes, one in the gut tissue membranes that synthesizes FACs and the second in the gut lumen that hydrolyzes them. Since FACs are persistent despite obvious fitness costs, it is believed that they are important to the performance and/or survival of the caterpillar.   \nThe FAC hydrolase was purified by liquid chromatography, and was identified as an aminoacylase by Edman degradation and tandem mass spectroscopy.  In mammals, orthologous enzymes are cytosolic and posses several strikingly different characteristics that suggest caterpillars may have evolved a slightly different use for this aminoacylase.  Furthermore, closely related species differ in their activity levels of this enzyme, apparently due to different levels of transcription.  Two or three isozymes appear to be present in species with high levels of aminoacylase activity, which suggests that the protein may possess post-translational-modifications.\nIn order to further understand the role of caterpillar FAC hydrolase, feeding studies were used to examine the effect of increased hydrolase activity in vivo on the performance and nitrogen uptake of caterpillars reared on sub-optimal diets.  Although caterpillar performance was greatly diminished on poor diets, transcript levels of aminoacylase did not appear to be affected.\nIt is still unclear what the role of FACs and aminoacylase in caterpillars is, however the aforementioned experiments have paved the way for future examinations of this metabolic pathway.  From this work, we know the nucleotide and amino acid sequences that code for aminoacylase from three species.  We have developed primers for amplification of these genes and quantitative real time PCR.  Lastly, we have determined that the enzyme abundance varies between closely related species that differ in their life strategies. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1691], "author_name_tesi": "Kuhns, Emily Hohlfeld", "last_name_ssi": "Kuhns", "middle_name_ssi": "Hohlfeld", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "Andrew George Stephenson", "Ming Tien", "Consuelo M De Moraes", "Gary Felton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Committee Chair", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Consuelo M De Moraes, Committee Member", "Gary Felton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heliothis virescens", "Heliothine", "Protein Purification", "Lepidoptera", "Aminoacylase", "Liquid Chromatography"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Effect of Exercise Muscle Temperature on Renal and Sympathetic Responses to Isometric Exercise in Humans\n\n", "id": "8435", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4726", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The renal vasculature helps maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function during exercise and thermal stress.

Therefore, to characterize the influence of muscle temperature on renal blood flow during exercise three studies were conducted: 1) the influence of muscle temperature on renal vascular responses to isometric exercise; 2) the interactive effect of aging and muscle heating on renal vascular responses to isometric exercise; and 3) the effect of ACE-inhibition on renal vascular responses to isometric exercise at hyperthermic muscle temperatures.

In Chapter 2, a new separation scheme was devised to allow resolution of 24 compounds of interest.  This was accomplished by precisely controlling the amount of base added to the background borate/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer, which optimized the resolution of the separation, and then calculating the pH.  Here, I focused on measurements of six of the analytes that are thought to be involved in the response to alcohol: dopamine, salsolinol, norsalsolinol, N-acetyloctopamine, octopamine, and N-acetyldopamine.

The effects of pigment from the relatively large fly eyes on the separation were examined to find that the red pigment from the compound eye masks much of the electrochemical signal from biogenic amines.  The brains of <i>white</i> mutant flies, which have characteristically low pigment in the eyes, have a significantly simplified separation profile in comparison to the red-eyed, wild-type, Canton S fly.  However, the <i>white</i> mutant flies were also found to have significantly lower amounts of dopamine, l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), salsolinol, and N-acetyltyramine in their dissected brains when compared to dissected brains of Canton S flies.  In addition, significant variation was observed in the dissected brains between individual flies that might be related to changes in neurotransmitter turnover.  The transgenic tyrosine hydroxylase-green fluorescent protein (TH-GFP) fly line, for which the overall profile of biogenic amines is not found to be significantly different from Canton S, was then used to visualize the location of and to dissect dopamine neurons.

Drying for too long produced low signals possibly due to sample loss, while long freezer storage times led to samples with red pigment from the eyes being extracted into the brain.  Freeze-drying fly heads makes the outer walls of the cuticles hard and brittle while also freeing the brain from the inner walls of the cuticle.  This significantly decreased the time needed to dissect a fly brain and enabled larger numbers of brains to be homogenized to make a sample.  The number of brains in a homogenate was increased, effectively concentrating the sample, which helped to increase the signal and resolution.  Biogenic amines were then quantified in samples containing fifteen freeze-dried brains.  N-acetylserotonin, N-acetyltyramine, N-acetyldopamine, L-DOPA, and tyramine were discovered to all correspond well with previous dissected studies.  \n</dd></p>\n<p><dd>CE-EC is a powerful technique for the analysis of neuromodulators offering low limits of detection and high selectivity against background signals in biological samples.

Readmission following colectomy has become an important metric for measuring quality of care. Our aim was to investigate the impact of patient and hospital characteristics on 30-day readmission rates among patients undergoing colectomies in Pennsylvania.\n\nMethods.  Data were obtained from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4), which included all patients undergoing colectomy during 2011 (n=10,155). Characteristics of non-readmitted and readmitted patients were compared with univariate tests. The primary outcome was 30-day readmission, which was modeled using multivariable logistic regression.\n\nResults.  Of the 10,155 patients who underwent colectomy, 1,492 (14.7%) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Readmission was influenced by the underlying diagnosis (P<0.001). Additionally, readmission was more likely with a Charlson Comorbidity Index \u22652 (OR=1.57, P<0.001), emergent admission (OR=1.26, P=0.001), an in-hospital complication (OR=1.46, P<0.001), lowest quartile for surgeon volume (OR=1.24, P<0.001), and construction of an ileostomy (OR=2.31, P<0.001). Factors associated with decreased likelihood of readmission included laparoscopic surgery (OR=0.73, P<0.001). No association with hospital volume was found.\n\nConclusions.  30-day readmission following colectomy is influenced by numerous patient and surgeon-related factors. Reducing in-hospital complications, and improving patient education following ileostomy construction, provide substantial targets for intervention. Our data also suggests that there may be a critical range of colectomies performed annually by surgeons, greater than which, no additional benefit is conferred in reducing readmissions, but below which, there is increased risk of readmission. Further research is needed to determine the influence of laparoscopic surgery in reducing readmission in equally matched patient populations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10840], "author_name_tesi": "Kulaylat, Afif N", "last_name_ssi": "Kulaylat", "middle_name_ssi": "N", "first_name_ssi": "Afif", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Hollenbeak", "Peter W Dillon", "Kristen H Kjerulff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Hollenbeak, Thesis Advisor", "Peter W Dillon, Thesis Advisor", "Kristen H Kjerulff, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Readmission", "colectomy", "PHC4", "surgeon volume", "comorbidities", "complications"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Shared Decision Making in Elective Colorectal Surgery: Cost Utility Analysis of Smoking Cessation Programs", "id": "13754als571", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13754", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Smoking is a behavior that involves many underlying psychological, physiological, and socioeconomic drivers.

It is observed that when 30\\% of shale gas production is achieved, up to 70\\% of the depleted gas volume is expected to be replaced by carbon dioxide.\n\nThe storage capacity of the depleted shale gas reservoir can be increased by injecting carbon dioxide at a rather low rate. A low rate injection of carbon dioxide will increase its residence time in the flow domain increasing its chances for adsorption.\n\nIf the SRV zones of the production and injection wells are not in direct communication, it is not expected to see carbon dioxide breakthrough at the producing well. It is also investigated that contribution of carbon dioxide in enhancing the shale gas recovery is negligible. \n\nThe study includes developments of four artificial neural network tools that have different production of methane and injection of carbon dioxide constraints. \nThese four forward tools can produce production and injection profiles of a given system within an error range of 3.83\\% to 5.23\\%. \nThis part of the study also includes four additional artificial neural network tools that predicts wellbore design and hydraulic fracture characteristics within an error range of 8.24\\% to 9.93\\%.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9815], "author_name_tesi": "Kulga, Ihsan Burak", "last_name_ssi": "Kulga", "middle_name_ssi": "Burak", "first_name_ssi": "Ihsan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Zhen Lei", "Savas Yavuzkurt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member", "Zhen Lei, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PSU-SHALECOMP", "numerical model", "CO2 injection", "shale gas", "artificial neural network", "stimulated reservoir volume", "srv", "ann"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Daytime and Nighttime Passenger Car Operating Speed Models for Two-lane Rural Highways", "id": "21182", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9845", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Operating speed models need to be developed to understand how traffic control and geometric features affect driver\u2019s speed selection. Once operating speed models are developed, they can be incorporated into the geometric design process to ensure that roadways are designed to maintain consistency and anticipated operating speeds coincide with the design speed. While it is well known that driving at night poses a significant risk, it is not well understood how drivers behave at night. There is a significant body of research on passenger car operating speeds, which focuses on daytime and ideal conditions, but very little research has focused on nighttime operating speeds. To discover some of the potential differences between operating speeds during the daytime and nighttime, three-stage least squares (3SLS) regression was used to estimate both the speed magnitude (mean speed) and speed dispersion (speed deviation) during the daytime and nighttime.\n\nThe models for estimating mean speed and speed deviation were then compared to each other to determine if there were differences, and the result of a transferability test shows that the two models are different. The comparison of the coefficients in the models and the transferability test show that there are differences between how drivers select their operating speeds during the daytime and nighttime, and these differences should be considered during the geometric design process. At higher approach speeds, there may be less of a concern about design consistency and more of a concern about vehicles exceeding the design speed during the nighttime since the models show that drivers maintain a speed closer to their approach speed through the curve more so during the night than day. Possible ways to lower operating speeds during the nighttime and have them more closely match operating speeds during the daytime are to reduce approach speeds since drivers maintain a more constant speed entering a curve during the nighttime than daytime or increase the delineation of the curve so drivers can judge the geometric layout of the curve better. This research can also be expanded upon to explore other potential differences between operating speeds during the day and night. Based on the additional analysis that is done and the coefficients of additional variables, it may be found that there are other variables that have a significant difference on operating speeds during the daytime and nighttime, and these differences should be considered in geometric design policy and processes.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9582], "author_name_tesi": "Kulis, Philip Nicholas", "last_name_ssi": "Kulis", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "first_name_ssi": "Philip", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Todd Donnell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Todd Donnell, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Operating speed models", "Nighttime speeds", "Rural highways", "Three-stage least squares", "ordinary least squares"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Jean-Luc Godard: The Evolution of a Radical", "id": "8058", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "372", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation aims to study four recent films by French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard. Although most of Godard's early work of the 60s and 70s has received considerable attention from researchers, fewer studies focus on his more recent films such as Nouvelle vague (1990), JLG/JLG: Autoportrait de d\u00e9cembre (1994), For Ever Mozart (1996) and \u00c9loge de l\u2019amour (2000). Several scholars have made observations stating that Godard\u2019s later work is very contemplative. Others opine that this body of work concentrates more on the notion of beauty, and still others see Godard\u2019s later work as distinct from his earlier work, especially with respect to its content. \n\nAlthough I agree with observations stating that Godard\u2019s later work is much more self-reflective and contemplative than his earlier work, I would not agree with those who see it as being distinct in content or being in a \u2018consistent digression\u2019 because of this. In fact, as I argue in the chapters that follow, much of Godard\u2019s later work follows a steady pattern of reflection and autocritique of his earlier work. Several of Godard\u2019s central concerns from his earlier films return in his later films and he reworks his strategies and positions vis-\u00e0-vis these same concerns in his new reflective phase. \nConsequently then, Godard\u2019s work of the late 80s and 90s is not distinct in its concerns but rather in its response to those same concerns of the 60s. It is therefore of particular importance that his later films be studied in comparison with his earlier films to trace the changes and evolution in Godard\u2019s thought process through the span of more than 40 years of filmmaking. \n\nEach of the four chapters of this dissertation explores one recent film in connection with one earlier film discussing a similar concern. A detailed comparative analysis of the issue as seen in both films demonstrates a similarity in concerns but significant difference in outlook in Godard\u2019s later work. Needless to say, this study cannot be only thematic, for aesthetics play an extremely important role in Godard\u2019s cinema and for that matter, in the cinema of any serious filmmaker. Along with a discussion of the major themes of these films, I will also discuss Godard\u2019s use of form and different cinematic techniques and their interaction with the content of the films that I will be comparing. It is, in fact, impossible to discuss one without the other. \n\nWith these aims in mind, I have chosen four of Godard\u2019s more recent and little researched films, viz. Nouvelle vague (1990), JLG/JLG: Autoportrait de d\u00e9cembre (1994), For Ever Mozart (1996) and \u00c9loge de l\u2019amour (2000) for the purpose of this dissertation. I study a central theme in each new film and I compare it to an earlier film focusing on the same theme. My analysis demonstrates that although Godard has become much more reflective in his later work, and less volatile and reactionary, he has certainly not become less radical in his thoughts. In fact, he has become more groundbreaking than before, albeit in a slightly less visually jarring way. \n\nThe aim of this dissertation is thus threefold: first, to bring further attention to Godard\u2019s recent films; secondly, to demonstrate that these films occupy a privileged space within Godard\u2019s work wherein he takes a marked autocritical stance and looks back upon his earlier works; and lastly, to demonstrate that Godard\u2019s reflective stance in his later films does not imply a more mellow or resigned outlook but rather an equally, if not more far-reaching one than in his earlier films.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [367], "author_name_tesi": "Kulkarni, Amruta ", "last_name_ssi": "Kulkarni", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amruta", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Allan Inlow Stoekl", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "Monique Yvonne Yaari", "Sanford Ray Schwartz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Allan Inlow Stoekl, Committee Chair", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Committee Member", "Monique Yvonne Yaari, Committee Member", "Sanford Ray Schwartz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Jean-Luc Godard", "French cinema", "New Wave films", "Motion pictures"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "From Michelangelo to Mussolini: Devotion, Attribution, and Appropriation in the Cultural Biography of the Piet\u00e0 di Palestrina", "id": "24783", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10960", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Near the end of January 1657, the Barberini governors of Palestrina, Prince Maffeo Barberini (1631-1685) and Anna Colonna-Barberini (1601-1658), began the construction of a new church dedicated to the plague saint Santa Rosalia of Palermo in response to the lifting of the plague that had recently devastated their princely fief. About a decade later, Maffeo\u2019s uncle, Cardinal Francesco Barberini I (seniore, 1597-1679), installed the unfinished marble sculpture group known today as the Piet\u00e0 di Palestrina on the altar of the family\u2019s new burial chapel. With this act, the Piet\u00e0 first enters the known historical record. Over the intervening three centuries (and more), this enigmatic group was destined to be repeatedly attributed, and then de-attributed, to the hand of Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564). Michelangelo\u2019s well-known mastery of this subject in great pieces of marble sculpture \u2013 some of them famously unfinished, like the Palestrina group itself \u2013 prompted the desire to see it as yet another specimen of his work in this mode. As a result of this continuous (and to some extent, still continuing) attributional back-and-forth, it comes as no surprise that almost all of the extant scholarship has been devoted to its supposed relationship to the Florentine master and his oeuvre. But, as this dissertation endeavors to show, there is much more to learn from the intriguing \u201clife story\u201d of this group than its apparently dubious relationship to Buonarroti. Indeed, a fresh look at the records of its long and often contested history shows that this object has lived not one, but several, distinct cultural \u201clives.\u201d \n\nIn the course of these lives the Piet\u00e0 has been subject to a variety of conflicting and even paradoxical meanings. This dissertation provides a critical and contextual account of the changing fortunes of the Palestrina Piet\u00e0 through new archival documentation. I trace the piece from its shadowy origins to its installation in the Barberini chapel at Santa Rosalia and its ultimate rise-and-fall during the twentieth century. My research chronicles the events from the Piet\u00e0\u2019s \u201crediscovery\u201d by culturally minded travellers to Palestrina at the beginning of the century, to its sudden removal from its provincial home to public display in Rome and Florence. In the process, I reveal the behind the scenes maneuvers that lead to the \u201crestoration\u201d of the piece and its appropriation to serve the agendas of Liberal and later, Fascist, authorities. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10543], "author_name_tesi": "Kulpa, Pierette Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Kulpa", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Pierette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian A Curran", "Charlotte Marie Houghton", "Robin Lemuel Thomas Ii", "Sherry Lynnette Roush"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian A Curran, Dissertation Advisor", "Charlotte Marie Houghton, Committee Member", "Robin Lemuel Thomas Ii, Committee Member", "Sherry Lynnette Roush, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Michelangelo Buonarroti", "Barberini", "Palestrina", "Fascism", "Renaissance", "Cultural biography", "Reception history", "Art appropriation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Compiler-based Memory Optimizations for High Performance Computing Systems", "id": "18832", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8954", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parallelism has always been the primary method to achieve higher performance. To advance the computational capabilities of state-of-the-art high performance computing systems, we continue to rely on increasing parallelism by putting more processors into systems and integrating more cores and more logic into the processors. However, the returns from increasing parallelism are diminishing. Putting more chips, more cores, more logic already started to bring less and less improvements in performance. The primary cause of this behavior is memory. The scalability problem of memory systems translates into a discrepancy between the increase in processor performance and the improvements in memory bandwidth, latency, and energy efficiency. The memory systems in high performance computers are no longer able to provide data to the parallel computational units at a fast enough rate, with a low enough latency and energy. This memory problem plagues the design of high performance systems, and scaling trends show that managing and accessing memory efficiently is one of the most crucial challenges for realizing exascale systems.\n\nThis dissertation focuses on compiler-based methods to address these memory issues. Specifically, various compiler-based memory optimizations to improve the memory behavior of application-specific and general purpose high performance computing systems are proposed and evaluated. \n\nThe first part of this dissertation identifies the memory scalability problem in the design of application-specific hardware accelerators and proposes a compiler-based automatic memory partitioning method to address this issue. This method generates energy efficient, high bandwidth, low latency memory systems and enables the generation high performance accelerators that can scale up to a huge number of custom-designed chips.\n\nThe second part of this dissertation targets general purpose systems and attacks the memory latency and bandwidth problem in many-core processors that are used as building blocks for general purpose high performance computing systems. It presents compiler generation of software prefetching and streaming store instructions and shows their effectiveness in hiding long memory latencies and saving precious memory bandwidth on a cutting edge many-core processor.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8792], "author_name_tesi": "Kultursay, Emre ", "last_name_ssi": "Kultursay", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Emre", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Padma Raghavan", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Qian Wang", "Kemal Ebcioglu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Dissertation Advisor", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Chair", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Committee Member", "Kemal Ebcioglu, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Compilers", "memory optimizations", "high performance computing", "application-specific hardware accelerators", "many-core processors"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ENHANCED DIFFUSION OF ENZYME-FUNCTIONALIZED PARTICLES\n\n\n", "id": "9858", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4769", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, I explore and discuss the possibility of designing a nanomotor which converts the energy of an asymmetric enzymatic reaction to mechanical motion.

Carbodiimide chemistry was used for enzyme coupling. Protein loading was determined by total nitrogen content. Also, the activity of the enzymes was measured before and after the coupling procedure. The activity of the enzymes significantly decreased upon immobilization. Then, the diffusion of enzyme-functionalized particles was studied in the presence and absence of substrate using light scattering microscopy. Based on the experimental results, the activity of the enzymes significantly decreased upon immobilization, and enhanced diffusion of enzyme-functionalized particles was not observed regardless of the presence of substrate. According to the literature, large particle size and low catalytic activity of immobilized enzymes could retard particle motion. I have proposed two strategies for improving motor design: decreasing particle size and improving catalytic activity of immobilized enzymes by introducing a linker between the enzyme and the particle. \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4747], "author_name_tesi": "Kulyba, Natallia ", "last_name_ssi": "Kulyba", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Natallia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen", "Ayusman Sen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen, Thesis Advisor", "Ayusman Sen, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["enhanced diffusion", "catalytic nanomotor"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Producing The Cause: Branded Social Justice, Hip-Hop and the Promotional Public Sphere", "id": "18977", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9167", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many contemporary forms of culturally based civic engagement\u2014including what might be called \u201chip-hop\u201d activism\u2014blur the lines between entertainment, activism, and corporate efforts. Such civic and cultural activities prompt several questions: What constitutes effectual communicative action in the contemporary public sphere? What are\nthe limits of hip-hop activism and branding in helping organizations respond to the contradictory pressures of the promotional public sphere? What dimensions of meaning, participation, advocacy, protest, and human relationship slip through the brand's dynamic processes of enclosure? Ultimately, what is the social and cultural significance of\ndifferent forms of hip-hop activism in the age of social media and branding? This dissertation explores these issues and others through a comparative case study of the social-change efforts of two organizations, 1Hood and Street King (SK). While the organizations under analysis operate on very different understandings of what\nconstitutes substantive social change, they both deploy heavy use of social media, the rhetoric of \u201cmovement,\" the promotional capital of hip-hop celebrities, the language and techniques of branding, and the communicative tools of the hip-hop genre. 1Hood is a Pittsburgh-based, media savvy, grassroots coalition led by political hip-hop artists Paradise \u201cthe Arkitect\u201d Gray and Jasiri \u201cX\u201d Smith. The coalition uses the texts and tactics of hip-hop activism to address a variety of injustices including local and national police brutality and murder, economic inequality, unequal media representation, and other civil rights issues. Simultaneously, local and national political issues serve as platform for the \u201chip-hop careers\u201d of both artist/activists. The intentional development of 1Hood as a brand assists these artists in mobilizing the efforts of an ideologically diverse range of local and national organizations, but also may complicate its relationship with\nother constituent organizations working on similar goals.\nAlternatively, SK offers a model that its founders claim will eliminate the need for \u201cinefficient\u201d progressive coalitions like  1Hood. Associated with Hip-Hop artist and entrepreneur Curtis \u201c50 Cent,\u201d and a brand of energy drink, SK promises to donate 1 meal to a child in Africa for each energy drink sold.

In addition to working to overcome the inherent contradictions of corporate, \u201cbling\" philanthropy, the brand is also strongly tied to Jackson's entertainment career rebranding. After exploring theoretical concepts related to the promotional public sphere, the brand commodity, promotional capital, and constitutive rhetoric, this study uses a combination of political economy, textual analysis, interviews and participant observation to examine and compare the historical and ideological origins, specific branding practices, creative and cultural work, and constitutive rhetoric of the two cases. The study argues that conceiving of complex sets of social relations as brands helps activists, entertainers, and corporate actors to gain leverage in the promotional public sphere. But the promotional mandate and discourse of the brand can quickly become predatory and all encompassing, foreclosing critical questions, fully democratic participation and alternative solutions to important social challenges.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8986], "author_name_tesi": "Kumanyika, Chenjerai ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumanyika", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chenjerai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Charles Elavsky", "Matthew Frank Jordan", "Nicole Sheree Webster"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Paul Mcallister, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles Elavsky, Committee Chair", "Matthew Frank Jordan, Committee Member", "Nicole Sheree Webster, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Branding", "Popular Cultural", "Activism", "Cultural Industries", "Hip-Hop", "Social Movements", "Cultural Studies", "Social Media"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "MEASUREMENTS AND CONTROL OF SINGLE MOLECULES AND THEIR NANOSCALE ASSEMBLIES TO DEVELOP MOLECULAR MACHINERY\n\n\n", "id": "10883", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "512", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We explore functional molecules and assemblies on substrates.

We engineered the molecular design to suppress excited-state quenching from metal substrates and to form rigid assemblies of single tethered azobenezene molecules in the domains of the monolayer to limit steric constraints, and tip-induced and stochastic switching effects.  \nWe prepared one-dimensional chain assemblies of azobenzene-functionalized molecules in the domain boundaries of n-alkanethiol matrices.

The development of computational designs for the biosynthesis of xenobiotics being the goal of this dissertation, we discuss and demonstrate solutions to two key challenges. The first challenge we identify is in the pace of extraction of metabolic knowledge i.e. directly using the data in the way it was published. Difficulties in directly using data from genome-scale metabolic models (GSMs) as well as semi-curated databases such as BRENDA1, KEGG2, and MetaCyc3, EcoCyc4, BioCyc3. The difficulties arise from the incompatibilities of representation, duplications, and errors i.e. with a single metabolite annotated with multiple names across different data sources. Also, in many cases, the same metabolite is annotated with multiple structures. This ambiguity gravely slows down the pooling of information across data sources. As a consequence, duplications in reaction information would not reveal otherwise (synthetic) lethal gene deletions. Such ambiguity affects the quality of predictions related to overall metabolic potential of an organism. In addition, non-standard metabolite names and ids prevent the direct comparisons needed to identify reactions that overlap multiple data sources. This would also lead to fragmented/disconnected datasets that would provide smaller reaction domains for pathway traversal algorithms. The second challenge we identify is in the capacity of various algorithms and computer-aided design (CAD) tools to conceive novel biosynthetic pathway designs while syncretizing various engineering challenges. To systemize the engineering calculations needed for designing biosynthesis of high-value\niii\nchemicals, existing CAD tools explore the complex biochemical reaction space and enumerate metabolic engineering strategies for the heterologous production of target chemicals from substrates with native or engineered enzymes. Existing CAD tools are however limited and approximate in their design elements i.e. they do not consider all the metabolic engineering paradigms in an integrated fashion5. The design elements such as reaction rules, network size, non-linear pathway topology, mass-conservation, cofactor balance, thermodynamic feasibility, chassis selection, toxicity, yield, and cost have never been unified into a single scheme in current CAD tools, until this work. In the first chapter, we present the novel reaction rule based pathway design (CAD) tool and demonstrate with results i.e. biosynthetic designs to three pharmaceuticals namely phenylephrine, epinine and naproxen. The second chapter presents a novel atom mapping algorithm, which heavily uses the concept of prime factorization.

Epitaxial strain is currently being pursued to design \u201cferro-electromagnetic\u201d films which can demonstrate coupling between polarization and magnetism.\nThe central focus of this thesis work is to develop an understanding of coupling between spin, charge and lattice strain in multiferroics and strained ferroelectrics. For this study, we utilize two techniques: nonlinear optics  and  scanning probe microscopy. Optical second harmonic generation, a nonlinear optical technique, is shown to be an excellent tool to probe polar and magnetic symmetries in multiferroics while also allowing us to probe the  nature of coupling between the two order parameters. Nonlinear optical spectroscopy has been employed to reveal spin-charge coupling in multiferroic BiFeO3 through the study of magnon sidebands which are otherwise difficult to probe using linear optical spectroscopy.  A combination of nonlinear optics and scanning probe microscopy have been utilized to reveal domain dynamics and explore the nature of ferroelectricity in strained ferroelectrics. Second harmonic generation has been utilized to demonstrate that the symmetry of pure elastic lattice distortion in the antiferrodistortive phase in SrTiO3 is isomorphic to a magnetic point group and phase transitions involving octahedral tilt rotations can be probed successfully using this technique. Confocal SHG microscopy has been used to visualize domain structures in the well known ferroelectric BaTiO3 and evidence of monoclinic distortion is observed near strained fields in the tetragonal phase.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [411], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Amit ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkatraman Gopalan", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Clive A Randall", "Long Qing Chen", "Nitin Samarth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Venkatraman Gopalan, Dissertation Advisor", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multiferroics", "Strained Ferroelectrics", "Spin-charge coupling"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Tailoring Defect Free Fusion Welds Based on Phenomenological Modeling", "id": "7029", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "511", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the last few decades, phenomenological models of fusion welding have provided important understanding and information about the welding processes and welded materials. For example, numerical calculations of heat transfer and fluid flow in welding have enabled accurate quantitative calculations of thermal cycles and fusion zone geometry in fusion welding. In many simple systems such as gas tungsten arc (GTA) butt welding, the computed thermal cycles have been used to quantitatively understand weld metal phase compositions, grain sizes and inclusion structure. However, fabrication of defect free welds with prescribed attributes based on scientific principles still remains to be achieved. In addition, higher fabrication speeds are often limited by the occurrence of humping defects which are characterized by periodic bead-like appearance. Furthermore, phenomenological models have not been applied to tailor welds with given attributes. The goal of the present work is to apply the principles of heat transfer and fluid flow to attain defects free welds with prescribed attributes.\nSince there are a large number of process variables in welding, the desired weld attributes such as the weld geometry and structure are commonly produced by empirically adjusting the welding variables. However, this approach does not always produce optimum welds and inappropriate choice of variables can lead to poor welds. The existing transport phenomena based models of welding can only predict weld characteristics for a given set of input welding variables. What is needed, and not currently available, is a capability to systematically determine multiple paths to tailor weld geometry and assess robustness of each individual solution to achieve safe, defect free welds. Therefore, these heat transfer and fluid flow based models are restructured to predict the welding conditions to achieve the defect free welds with desired attributes. Systematic tailoring of weld attributes based on scientific principles still remains an important milestone in changing welding from almost an empirical art to a mainstream science-based technology. The ability to determine multiple welding variable sets to achieve desired weld attributes, based on scientific principles, would be an important step to achieve this goal. Furthermore, no comprehensive unified theoretical model exists today that can predict the formation of commonly occurring humping defects considering the effects of important welding variables such as the arc current, voltage, welding speed, nature of the shielding gas, electrode geometry, torch angle and ambient pressure. In this research work, a model is developed to achieve desired weld attributes and avoid high speed weld defects like humping. \nThree main requirements are desirable in a model for systematic tailoring of weld attributes. First, the procedure should embody an adequate phenomenological description of the complex physical processes in welding. Although the heat transfer and fluid flow models use time-dependent equations of conservation of mass, momentum and energy, the predictions of temperature fields and thermal cycles do not always agree with experimental results because the models require many input variables all of which cannot be prescribed with certainty.  For example, the reported values of arc efficiency vary significantly for minor differences in the surface characteristics that are difficult to characterize for every welding process. Second, the models are designed to calculate the temperature and velocity fields for a given set of welding variables.  However, very often what is needed is to determine the welding variables required to achieve a given weld attribute such as the weld geometry, cooling rate and the microstructure.  The current generation of unidirectional heat transfer and fluid flow models are designed to calculate temperature and velocity fields from welding conditions and are incapable of determining welding conditions. Finally, the welding system is highly complex and involves non-linear interaction of several welding variables. As a result, a particular weld attribute such as the geometry can be obtained via multiple paths, i.e., through the use of various sets of welding variables. The current generation of numerical heat transfer and fluid flow models cannot determine alternative pathways to achieve a target weld attribute. \nIn this thesis, a new structure of the phenomenological models is developed by combining numerical heat transfer and fluid flow models with a suitable optimization algorithm in the form of genetic algorithm. The combined model has new capabilities for bi-directional simulation where either the traditional input or the output variables can be specified. The new formulation also allows determination of multiple solutions to attain a specified weld attribute. Genetic algorithms (GA) can systematically search for multiple combinations of welding variable sets that comply with the phenomenological laws of welding physics and obtain a population of solutions following certain rules of evolution. This research represents the very first effort to adapt transport phenomena based models along with genetic algorithm based optimization model to attain defects free welds with desired attributes during gas metal arc fillet welding. Through uncommon synthesis of appropriate concepts from transport phenomena, optimization and data mining, this research work outlines a completely new direction of exceptional promise.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [508], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Amit ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tarasankar Debroy", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare", "Long Qing Chen", "Kenneth K Kuo", "John W Elmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tarasankar Debroy, Committee Chair", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Kenneth K Kuo, Committee Member", "John W Elmer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gas Metal Arc fillet welding", "Heat transfer and fluid flow", "Optimization", "Neural network", "Humping defects", "Reliability of calculations"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "MODELING AND CONTROLLING NANAOSCALE SELF-ASSEMBLY OF EPITAXIAL QUANTUM DOTS", "id": "9743", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1175", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Semiconductor quantum dots offer possibilities of novel electronic, optoelectronic and computing devices. Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are 3D nanostructures or nanocrystals formed as a result of growth of single crystal film on a single crystal substrate, such that there is a lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. The growing film acquires the lattice structure and orientation of the substrate. After an initial layer-by-layer growth, a transition from 2D growth to 3D growth takes place. The growth mode resulting in the formation of SAQDs is referred to as the Stranski-Krastanow (SK) growth mode. This growth begins with morphological perturbations on the surface of the strained film, where the strain results from the lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. Typical, among others, semiconductor quantum dots grown on semiconductor substrates include SiGe on Si, InAs on GaAs and PbSe on PbEuTe. The self-assembly of quantum dots poses a major challenge of controlling the fluctuations in size and shape of the quantum dots, and spacings between the quantum dots. \n\nMany potential devices either need a periodic array of quantum dots with uniform sizes or require quantum dots to be placed at precise locations. Self-assembly of quantum dots is the most preferable method to produce large number of quantum dots in an easy way. However, self-assembly is a stochastic process and results in an array of quantum dots with somewhat non-uniform sizes and spatial distribution. Better control of self-assembly is desirable for potential device applications of SAQDs. Techniques, such as substrate patterning or growing multiple layers of quantum dots have been used to control the size and spatial distribution of SAQDs. In an endeavor to better understand the basic mechanism of formation and ordering of SAQDs, this work is aimed at improving existing continuum models and using various statistical tools to probe the morphology of quantum dots and their ordering phenomenon in self-assembly, and to evaluate and understand a case of directed self-assembly. As a consequence it is necessary to develop tools that can be used to predict and quantify the morphology and order of SAQDs with greater accuracy. Various parameters that characterize the formation, morphology and order of SAQDs are identified and results are presented to depict the effect of these parameters on SAQD formation and ordering. Additionally, the results of this work are meant to inform future experiments and numerical models, and aid in developing more advanced and accurate models that can both help understand and predict the trends in SAQD formation.  In particular, in this work, the formation, morphology and ordering of quantum dots formed as a result of self-assembly and thermal-field directed self-assembly have been studied in detail, and models have been developed for quantitative assessment using parameters that can control order and morphology in SAQDs. All calculations are performed for Ge dots grown on a Si substrate. The presented work addresses three aspects of SAQD formation and order.\n\nFirst, thermal field directed self-assembly is studied as a potential technique for controlling the position and uniformity in size and spacings of the quantum dots by applying a spatial temperature distribution on the surface of the film. Three cases of spatial heating are studied, namely, uniform heating, periodic heating and a Gaussian shaped focused heating. A finite element model for the growth of Ge dots on Si is used. It is shown that periodic heating is an effective means for producing a periodic array of quantum dots with uniform size. It is also shown that a gaussian heating can effectively place a distinct quantum dot at a desired location. It is thus shown that thermal-field directed self-assembly may be an effective means for controlling the order of SAQDs. Results have been reported in the Journal of Applied Physics.\n\nNext, self-assembly of quantum dots is studied using a linear elastic stochastic model with focus on the effects of elastic heterogeneity on the formation, morphology and ordering of SAQDs. A procedure is laid out to include both elastic heterogeneity and elastic anisotropy in the continuum model for SAQD growth. It is shown that models that ignore elastic heterogeneity between the film and the substrate can introduce significant errors in the calculations relating to instability of a strained epitaxial film layer and also in the calculations relating to order of SAQDs formed as a result of this instability. Average film height is identified as a parameter influencing the formation, morphology and order of SAQDs. Various parameters characterizing the formation, morphology and order of SAQDs are identified and their trends with respect to the average film height is studied. These calculations also lay down the premise for the development of advanced models, for example, spectral model for quantum dot multilayers. Results have been reported in the Journal of Applied Physics.\n\nFinally, the ordering phenomenon in quantum dot multilayers is studied by developing a 3D dynamic linear stochastic spectral model for multilayers. Multilayering of quantum dots can lead to more uniformly sized and spatially ordered array of quantum dots. Several continuum models based only on energetics already exist which mostly focus on qualitative assessment of the arrangement of SAQDs. Here, a continuum model is developed that takes into account both the energetics and the dynamics to quantitatively assess the enhancement in vertical and lateral order of the quantum dots and to study the effect of various SAQD multilayer parameters like, layer to layer thickness, elastic anisotropy, growth time and number of deposited layers on the order of SAQDs. Linear elastic calculations are performed to find the elastic energy density distribution in a multilayered quantum dot structure. A stochastic model is developed to calculate the power spectrum and correlation functions corresponding to film height  in different layers. The power spectrum and correlation functions  are then used to characterize the morphology and order of SAQDs in quantum dot multilayers. It is shown that it is possible to tune the parameters to achieve a highly ordered array of SAQDs. The multilayer model predictions are compared with analogous experimental observations. Few other predictions on pattern formation and order enhancement are made that have to be corroborated by future experiments and similar non-linear calculations.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1163], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Chandan ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chandan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lawrence H Friedman", "Lawrence H Friedman", "Francesco Costanzo", "Joseph Paul Cusumano", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lawrence H Friedman, Dissertation Advisor", "Lawrence H Friedman, Committee Chair", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thermal Field Directed Self-Assembly", "Multilayer", "Spectral Analysis", "Surface Diffusion", "Stochastic", "Self-assembly", "Quantum Dot", "Elastic Heterogeneity"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Computational Rational Design of High-performance Multi-component Catalysts", "id": "14756gzk123", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14756", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There has been a recent surge of interest in multicomponent catalysts that combine properties of chemically diverse materials.

This dissertation investigates the fundamental rationale for multi-component materials and describes several classes of materials that offer promise for improving activity and selectivity in catalysis. Our focus is on illustrating how recent advances in the ability to prepare precisely controlled nanostructures have the potential to enhance the capability to design highly active and selective catalysts.\nIn particular, Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used in conjunction with collaborators\u2019 experimental characterization and reactivity studies to underline the principles governing the limitations and potentials of multi-component catalytic systems.

Unfortunately, many potential coalbeds have limited permeability and thus are often marginal for economic methane extraction or limited in CO2 injectivity in the case of enhanced coalbed methane production or CO2 sequestration. Microwave energy has been shown to induce fractures in coal in the absence of confining stress. Here, creation of new fractures and increasing existing cleat apertures via short burst, high-energy microwave energy was evaluated for both hydrostatically stressed and unstressed North American bituminous coal cores. A microwave-transparent argon gas pressurized (1,000 psi) polycarbonate vessel, simulating hydrostatic stress of 1,800 foot depth, was utilized. Cleat frequency and distribution were examined via X-ray computed tomography before and after short burst microwave exposure for two cores with and without the application of hydrostatic stress. Optical microscopy was performed for tomography cleat aperture calibration and also to examine any lithoptypes influences on fracture: initiation, propagation, frequency, and orientation. It was confirmed that new fractures are induced via high-energy microwave exposure in the unconfined core and that the aperture increased in existing cleats. Cleat/fracture volume, determined from micro-focused X-ray computed tomography, following microwave exposure increased from 1.8% to 16.1% of the unconfined core volume. Similar observations of fracture generation and aperture enhancement were determined for the stressed coal, for the first time. After the short microwave-bursts cleat/fracture volume was increased from 0.5% to 5.5% under the application of hydrostatic stress of 1000 psi. Optical microscopy indicated that fracture initiated likely occurred, in at least some cases, at inertinite. Presumably this was due to the open pore volumes and potential for bulk water presence or steam pressure buildup in these locations. For the major induced fractures, they were mostly horizontal (parallel to the bedding plane) and often contained within lithotype bands, unlike natural cleats. Cleat aperture enhancement were observed for both cores being on the order of 400% for unstressed core and lower values of around 100% for the single cleat in the cores while exposed under stress. Thus, it appears likely that microwaves have the potential to enhance the communication between bore and existing cleat networks in coal seams at depth for improved gas recovery or CO2 injection.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2261], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Hemant ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hemant", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan P Mathews", "Jonathan P Mathews"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan P Mathews, Thesis Advisor", "Jonathan P Mathews, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fracture", "Bituminous coal", "Microwave", "Coalbed Methane"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF A MATHEMATICAL HUMAN\u2013SENSOR MODEL UTILIZING MULTIAGENT BAYESIAN LEARNING FOR TEAM COLLABORATION IN EXTREME EMERGENCY OR DISASTER EVENTS ", "id": "10392", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2344", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis a probabilistic mathematical model human sensor software agent has been illustrated followed by interaction with a team of heterogeneous multiagent team of human and normal mobile or immobile sensors deployed in the field for tracking a target.

Injection is advantageous because it may both enhance the production of CH4 and significant volumes of CO2 may be simultaneously stored. Key issues for enhanced gas recovery and geologic sequestration of CO2 include (1) Injectivity prediction: The chemical and physical processes initiated by the injection of CO2 in the coal seam result in significant changes in permeability/porosity (2) Up scaling: Development of a full-scale coupled reservoir model to predict the enhanced production, associated permeability changes and quantity of sequestered CO2. (3) Reservoir Stimulation: Coalbeds are often stimulated by hydraulic fracturing with proppants typically placed into the fractures to retain the improved permeability, however permeability evolution over the long-term remains poorly understood. These issues are largely governed by dynamic coupling of adsorption, fluid exchange and transport and modulated by water content, stress regime, fracture geometry and physicochemical changes in coals which are triggered by CO2 injection. This thesis investigates these complex interactions in coal and in shale through laboratory experiments with full reservoir scale models developed to address key issues. \nChapter I of this dissertation explores the effect of gas pressure and stress on the permeability evolution of coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs infiltrated by carbon dioxide. Typically the recovery of methane induces coal shrinkage and the injection of CO2 induces coal swelling respectively increasing or decreasing permeability for constrained coals. Permeability evolution was quantified for moisture equilibrated and partially dried bituminous coal samples together with the transitions caused by sequential exposure to different gases. The experimental measurements of permeability evolution was conducted on a  coal from the Uinta basin infiltrated by helium, methane and carbon dioxide under varying gas pressure (1-8 MPa) and moisture content (1-9% by mass) while subjected to constant applied stresses (10 MPa). Permeability decreases with increased moisture content for all the gases (He, CH4 and CO2). The decrease in He permeability may be as high as ~100 folds if the moisture content is increased from 1% to 9% by mass. Swelling induced by sorption of CH4 and CO2 in the coal matrix reduces permeability by 5 to 10 fold depending on the gas injected and the moisture content. Swelling increases with gas pressure to the maximum (strain based estimation 5%) at a critical pressure (~4.1 MPa) corresponding to maximum adsorption capacity. Beyond this threshold effective stress effects dominate. Permeability evolution was determined in bituminous coal for various moisture contents, effective stresses, and gas pressures to propose a mechanistic model. Also, this model explains the published data for permeability evolution on water saturated Pennsylvanian anthracite coal. This model was used to investigate the performance of prototypical ECBM projects. In particular the effect of the permeability loss examined with the injection of CO2. This response is defined in terms of two conditions: reservoirs either above (under-) or below (above-) the saturation pressure that defines the permeability minima in the reservoir. For oversaturated reservoirs withdrawal will always result in decreased permeability at the withdrawal well unless the critical pressure is transited. Similarly permeability will decrease at the CO2 injection well unless the pressure increase is sufficiently large to overcome the reduction in permeability due to CO2 - typically of order of one to a few MPa. For undersaturated reservoirs the permeability will always increase at the withdrawal well and can only increase at the injection well if the critical pressure is transited and further exceeded by one to a few MPa. These observations provide a rational method to design injection and recovery strategies for ECBM that account for the complex behavior of the reservoir including the important effects of moisture content, gas composition and effective stress. \nChapter II of this dissertation explores the effect of CO2 injection on production, permeability evolution and permeability variability using a full scale reservoir model. Enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) can be recovered by injecting a gas such as carbon dioxide into the reservoir to displace methane. The contrast between density, viscosity, and permeability of the resident and displacing fluids affects the efficiency of ECBM recovery. The prediction of earlier breakthrough becomes complex as the permeability may vary by orders of magnitude during gas injection and methane recovery. Predominantly, the reservoir permeability is modulated by the pore pressure of the sorptive gas (CH4 and CO2) and effective stresses. Here we explore the possibility of early breakthrough and its implications for managing coalbed reservoirs during CO2 assisted ECBM. A coupled finite element (FE) model of binary gas flow, diffusion, competitive sorption and permeability change is used to explore the effect of CO2 injection on net recovery, permeability evolution and injectivity in uniform and homogeneously permeable reservoirs. This effect is evaluated in terms of dimensionless pressure\u3016 ( p\u3017_D), permeability ( k_D) and fracture spacing (x_D) on the recovery of methane and permeability evolution for ECBM and non-ECBM scenarios. We have considered two scenarios (4MPa and 8 MPa) of constant pressure injection of CO2 for ECBM. The increase in production rate of CH4 is proportional to  k_D but inversely proportional to x_D. \nFurther, a reservoir with initial permeability heterogeneity was considered to explore the effect of CO2 injection on the evolution of permeability heterogeneity \u2013 whether heterogeneity increases or decreases. The evolution of permeability heterogeneity is investigated for the same two CO2 injection scenarios. For the specific parameters selected, the model results demonstrate that: (1) The injection of CO2 in coalbed reservoirs increases the production nearly 10 fold. (2) At higher injection pressures the recovery is rapid and the production increases dramatically - the production increases 2 fold on increasing the CO2 injection pressure from 4 MPa to 8 MPa (3) However, CO2 breakthrough occurs earlier at higher injection pressures. (4) The permeability heterogeneity in the reservoir is reduces after a threshold time (~500 days) although the overall heterogeneity is increased relative to the initial condition is overall increased for both non-CO2 and CO2 injection scenarios. This indicates that the homogenizing influence of CO2-sorption-swelling is outpaced by CH4-desorption-shrinkage and effective stress influences. This leaves the reservoir open to short-circuiting and earlier breakthrough of CO2 rather than having this effect damped-out by the homogenizing influence of swelling.  (5) The cumulative volume of CO2 produced and stored in the reservoir is proportional to the injection pressure.\nChapter III explores the effect of proppant embedment on permeability evolution in artificial fractures created by hydraulic fracturing. Proppant are often placed in hydraulic fractures to retain the enhanced permeability for extended periods.  However, the permeability enhancement may be mitigated due to proppant embedment into the natural/artificial fractures of coalbed methane reservoirs. The reduction in fracture aperture occurs either when CO2-induced coal softening causes proppant penetration into the coal fracture surface or coal swelling encroaches into the propped facture during CO2 assisted enhanced coalbed methane recovery. While coal swelling is a well-established phenomenon, there is limited investigation into coal softening under stressed conditions. Here we investigate permeability transformations at simulated insitu conditions through a suite of laboratory experiments conducted on selected high-rank coals and a granite cores with an artificial saw-cut fracture containing proppant. The permeability of the artificial fracture is measured for both non-sorbing gas (He) and a sorbing gas (CO2) at constant confining stress of 10MPa. Permeability was also measured with an idealized case of a uniform monolayer of #70-140 mesh proppant sand within the fracture. The increase in He permeability may be as high as ~10 fold if monolayer proppant is sandwiched in the coal or granite fracture. Similar increase is observed in the case of sorptive gas (CO2) permeability. An exponential increase in permeability is observed with gas pressure for both coal and granite without proppant as expected. However, the permeability decreases due to coal swelling and then increases due to reduced effective stress with gas pressure in case of propped fracture on injection of CO2. Optical profilometry pre- and post experimental suite is used to quantify proppant embedment, if occurs, in the coal fracture surface. Infrequent and isolated pits, similar to the size of a sand grain, were observed post experimental suite. Sparsely distributed surface indentation on completion of experimental suite, suggests an insignificant contribution of coal softening towards permeability reduction. Thus, a large reduction in permeability can only be attributed to coal swelling. The increase in surface roughness post exposure to CO2 by about a fraction of microns indicates a slight irreversible structural rearrangement with CO2 uptake and loss. A mechanistic model is developed to explain the permeability evolution in a propped artificial fracture on injection of CO2. The permeability evolution trends alike \u2018U-shape\u2019 with gas pressure at constant confining stress. The excellent fit between model and experimental observations indicates a robustness of the model however more work is needed for the model to run in predictive capacities.\nChapter IV reports measurements of permeability evolution in shales infiltrated separately by non-sorbing (He) and sorbing (CO2) gases under varying gas pressures, confining stresses and deviatoric stresses. Experiments are completed on Pennsylvanian shales containing both natural and artificial fractures under non-propped and propped conditions. We use observations for permeability evolution in other sorbing media (coal, Kumar et al., 2012) to codify the response for shale. It is observed that for a naturally fractured shale, the He-permeability increases by ~15% as effective stress is reduced by increasing the gas pressure from 1 MPa to 6 MPa at constant confining stress of 10 MPa. Conversely, the CO2-permeability reduces by a factor of two under similar conditions.  Permeability of the core recovers to the original magnitude when the core is resaturated by a non-adsorbing gas, despite prior CO2 exposure. A second core is split with a fine saw to create a smooth artificial fracture and the permeabilities measured for both non-propped and propped fractures. The He-permeability of a monolayer sand-propped artificial fracture is ~2-3 fold that of a non-propped fracture. Upon increasing the gas pressure, the He-permeability of the propped fracture increases under constant confining stress. Conversely, the CO2-permeability of the propped fracture decreases by between one-half to one-third as the gas pressure increases from 1 to 4 MPa at a constant confining stress. We attribute the reduction in permeability to sorption-induced swelling in the organic material of the shale.  The permeability of the non-propped shale fracture increases with gas pressure, at constant confining stress, due to the absence of rock bridges that commonly occur in naturally fractured samples. Although the permeability evolution of non-propped and propped artificial fractures in shale are found to be similar to those observed in coal, the extent of permeability reduction by swelling is much lower in shale due to its lower organic content. The surface roughness and peak-to-valley differential for the artificial fracture surfaces are quantified by optical profilometry. Initial values of surface roughness and peak-to-valley differential height are 4.1 \uf06dm and 77.9 \uf06dm, respectively, which increases to 6.1 \uf06dm and 122.4 \uf06dm at completion of experiments - indicating the significant influence of proppant indentation into the surface of the fracture in shale. A mechanistic model representing permeability evolution in sorbing media is applied to describe permeability evolution in shale. This model characterizes the 'U-shaped' variation of permeability with gas pressure typical for sorbing media and apparent for shales. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8413], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Hemant ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hemant", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Derek Elsworth", "Jonathan P Mathews", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Chris Marone", "Denis Pone"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth, Dissertation Advisor", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Chair", "Jonathan P Mathews, Committee Member", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Member", "Chris Marone, Committee Member", "Denis Pone, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coal", "Shale", "Permeability", "Proppant", "Modeling", "Simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "ELECTROCHEMICAL CORROSION BEHAVIOR OF NICKEL ALLOYS IN SULFATE-CONTAINING MOLTEN SALTS AT 700 \u00b0C", "id": "15328kxk1023", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15328", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hot corrosion on nickel based alloys has been the focus of extensive research due to their applications in high temperature operations such as gas turbines, petrochemical, and fossil fuel power engines. The demand for good mechanical and corrosion-resistant properties in construction materials for high temperature components has led to the development of several nickel-based superalloys. While these novel alloys are well known to exhibit sufficient mechanical properties, they lack corrosion resistance. As a result, components in high temperature processes do not exhibit the necessary degree of durability. During operation, the combustion zone in high temperature engines contains contaminants including sulfur (S) and sodium chloride (NaCl), which enter due to contamination in oil and polluted air. As a result, molten sulfate salts (e.g. sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate) are formed within the combustion zone, which accelerate degradation reactions on metallic surfaces. To provide higher stability against the corrosive effect of alkali sulfates, a protective metallic coating is applied over the components in these high temperature environments. Corrosion behavior of metallic coatings is reported in the literature using burner-rig tests, exposure tests, and thermodynamic calculations; however, a fundamental study on the electrochemical corrosion behavior of nickel-based alloys has yet to be performed. Therefore, this dissertation aims to provide an outlook on the corrosion properties of nickel-based metallic coatings in corrosive environments.\n\nSpecifically, an electrolyte composition \u2012 LiCl-KCl-Na2SO4 (53.3-36.7-10 mol%) was used to elucidate the corrosion reactions at 700 \u00baC. During molten sulfate induced corrosion (hot corrosion), metal elements undergo oxidation reactions coupled with the reduction of sulfate ions. To further our understanding of the corrosion properties of metallic coatings, it is important to investigate the reduction mechanism of sulfate ions in hot corrosive environment. In a three electrode electrochemical cell configuration, sulfate ions were observed to undergo reduction reactions at sufficiently large negative overpotentials (< \u20121.1 V vs. Ag/Ag+) under inert argon atmosphere. It was found that sulfate ion reduction reactions produce elemental sulfur (S) and sulfide (S2\u2012) species, with charge-controlled,  sluggish kinetics. Cyclic voltammograms remained invariant on switching the argon atmosphere to O2-0.1%(SO2+SO3), suggesting that electrochemical reduction potential of sulfate ions is not dependent on the gaseous environment . However, the open circuit potential became more positive by ~0.60\u202fV upon switching the argon atmosphere to oxidizing O2-0.1%(SO2+SO3) gas, implying the presence of stronger oxidants [O2, SO2, SO3] which can be coupled with the metal corrosion reactions during the hot corrosion processes. \n\nTo evaluate the corrosion behavior of nickel alloys in sulfate ion containing solutions, electrochemical measurements with pure nickel in LiCl-KCl-Na2SO4 solution were performed under gaseous atmospheres of inert argon, pure O2, and O2-0.1%(SO2+SO3). In inert argon, nickel corrosion developed an adherent NiO passive layer, resulting in a decreasing trend in open circuit potentials, and a low corrosion rate (~0.26 mA/cm2). In oxidizing atmospheres, Ni rapidly degraded due to the instability of NiO, which formed a dispersed NiO-NiSx phase, and showed significantly higher corrosion rates (7\u201212 mA/cm2). \n\nWith the baseline behavior of pure nickel established, oxygen active elements (e.g. Al, Cr) were alloyed with nickel to substitute the NiO passive layer with alumina (Al2O3) and chromia (Cr2O3). Hot corrosion studies with \u03b2-NiAl (BCC phase) demonstrated a strong corrosion resistance under inert gaseous environment due to the formation of an adherent and protective alumina scale. However, oxidizing gaseous atmospheres led to localized damages in the alumina layer. Particularly, in the SO2-SO3 containing environment, the Al2O3 layer showed several cracks, which led to a corrosion rate ~35 times higher in comparison to that under inert argon. Upon the addition of 5 at% Cr in \u03b2-NiAl, the passive layer consisted of a bi-layer structure: pure Al2O3 on the alloy surface and Al2O3\u2012Cr2O3 solid solution on the outer part. The lower corrosion current densities of the Ni-Al-Cr alloys compared to \u03b2-NiAl under pure O2 as well as O2-0.1%(SO2+SO3) environments suggested the beneficial effect of Cr addition in \u03b2-NiAl.\n\nConsidering the fact that Cr addition in \u03b2-NiAl improves the corrosion resistance, Cr content was varied in Ni-Al-Cr alloys. It was observed that a small fraction of Cr is sufficient to improve the integrity of passive layer [Al2O3-Cr2O3] under a pure O2 environment. Moreover, corrosion current densities decreased with higher Cr content in Ni-Al-Cr alloys [\u03b2-NiAl: 0.78 mA/cm2, NiAl-10Cr: 0.30 mA/cm2], In general, the corrosion properties of Ni-Al-Cr alloys improved with increasing content of Cr in hot corrosive environments containing pure O2. To elucidate the effect of sulfur oxides in corrosion behavior of Ni-Al-Cr alloys, similar measurements were performed under a O2-0.1%(SO2+SO3) environment.  It was observed that Cr addition helps in repassivating the damaged sites on alloy surfaces. However, the repassivation time was dependent on Cr content. With increasing Cr, the recovery time decreased. Furthermore, corrosion potential measurements in SO2-SO3 containing environments demonstrated an increasing trend of stability up to Cr = 5 at%; with any more addition of Cr reducing the magnitude. In agreement with the passivation stability predicted by corrosion potentials, Ni-Al-Cr alloys with Cr = 5 at% showed the least corrosion current density (~0.09 mA/cm2), which was approximately two orders of magnitude lower in comparison to \u03b2-NiAl. As a result, NiAl-5Cr is considered a prime composition for further enhancement of Ni-Al-Cr alloys in SO2-SO3 containing hot corrosive environments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16692], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Kuldeep ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "first_name_ssi": "Kuldeep", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hojong Kim", "Hojong Kim", "Kwadwo Osseo-Asare", "Zi-Kui Liu", "Barbara Shaw", "Ismaila Dabo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hojong Kim, Dissertation Advisor", "Hojong Kim, Committee Chair", "Kwadwo Osseo-Asare, Committee Member", "Zi-Kui Liu, Committee Member", "Barbara Shaw, Outside Member", "Ismaila Dabo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nickel alloys", "Hot corrosion", "Molten salts", "Electrochemical corrosion measurements", "Passivity", "High temperature corrosion", "Nickel-aluminum", "Chromium addition in nickel alloys", "Sulfate reduction", "Potentiodynamic polarizations", "LiCl-KCl-Na2SO4"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Toward a Hydrologic Modeling System\n", "id": "9870", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4418", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Surface water, plant water, soil and groundwater, and the atmosphere are all linked components of the hydrologic continuum. Understanding the interaction between these components and the ability to predict the availability, variability and quality on large scale, requires an accurate and efficient solution strategy. Here we present the underpinnings of a framework referred to as Hydrologic Modeling System (HMS), to couple physics, numerics, data and computation, with the goal to simulate coupled hydrologic process interactions at multiple spatio-temporal scales. The primary component of the framework is a physics-based, spatially distributed, fully coupled, constrained unstructured mesh based Finite-Volume model that simultaneously solves integrated hydrologic processes in heterogeneous, anisotropic domains. The holistic approach developed here, emphasizes the need for efficient simulations through spatially adaptive domain decomposition strategies, use of multi-processor clusters, and seamless and dynamic flow of data between data-management systems and hydrologic models. The modeling framework has been applied from hillslope (10-100m) to catchment (100-1000m) to synoptic scales (>100km) by using different number and approximation of process equations depending on model purpose and computational constraint. Examples will demonstrate how this model provides insight into the influence of drainage from unsaturated zone on delayed water table drawdown, the role of water table position on infiltration and surface runoff, and the interaction of overland flow-groundwater exchanges in relation to the dynamics of infiltrating/exfiltrating surfaces on the hillslopes. Large scale implementation of the model in Little-Juniata Watershed (845 km2) unfolds a range of multiscale/multiprocess interactions including the influence of local upland topography and stream morphology on spatially distributed, asymmetric right-left bank river-aquifer interactions, and, the role of macropore and topography on ground water recharge magnitude, time scale and spatial distribution. Finally, the computational challenges posed by using such complex model will be addressed, along with an outlook for future efforts along these lines.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4388], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Mukesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mukesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy", "Christopher J Duffy", "Patrick M Reed", "Thorsten Wagener", "Padma Raghavan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Chair", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Member", "Thorsten Wagener, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Surface Water", "Domain Partitioning", "Domain Decomposition", "Data Model", "GIS", "Distributed Hydrologic Model", "FIHM", "PIHM", "Groundwater", "Evaporation", "Numerical Modeling", "Hydrologic Modeling System", "Finite Volume"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Electrical properties of superconducting and hybrid superconductor-ferromagnet nanowires", "id": "9334", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4795", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-01-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Superconductivity in reduced dimensions has attracted a lot of attention in last few decades. According to Mermin-Wagner theorem, no long-range order can be possible in strictly one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. Strong phase fluctuations are expected to destroy superconductivity in quasi one-dimensional superconducting nanowires. This results in dissipation or resistive behavior both near and below the superconducting transition temperature. Previous electrical transport measurements in thin superconducting nanowires have reported dissipative behavior due to thermal and quantum fluctuations. However, most of the experimental and theoretical works done so far has focused mainly on studying the nature of dissipation in superconducting nanowires. The overall purpose of this research was to investigate the interaction of dissipative superconducting nanowires with its environment and vice versa. \n\nOne of the objectives of this work was to study the influence of bulk superconducting environment on the electrical properties of quasi one-dimensional superconducting nanowires. We have used electrochemical techniques to fabricate nanowires of various metals with high crystal quality, uniformity and diameters well below the superconducting coherence length. Electrical transport measurements on Zn nanowires indicate that bulk superconductor significantly increases the dissipation in nanowires, which can result in suppression of their superconducting characteristics. These results demonstrate that the superconducting properties of nanowires are highly influenced by their environment.\n\nIn another scenario, we studied the interaction between superconducting and ferromagnetic environment in the case of hybrid superconductor-ferromagnet systems. The competition between the spin asymmetry properties of a ferromagnet and the correlations induced by superconductivity has made hybrid S-F systems an active area of research. Earlier works were done on layered two-dimensional S-F systems with granular and amorphous morphology. The second objective of this research was to explore the quasi one-dimensional hybrid S-F systems fabricated using high crystal quality nanowires. Spin polarized transport resulted in unusual magnetoresistance behavior in ferromagnetic nanowire attached to bulk superconductors. Contrary to the three-dimensional behavior, a long-range proximity effect was observed in ferromagnetic nanowires attached to superconducting electrodes. Electrical measurements were also performed on axially modulated nanowires fabricated by electrochemical deposition. Ferromagnetic properties of nanowires were observed to be strongly affected by the superconducting environment.

Currently, detection of biomolecules like proteins and DNA is done by fluorescence detection, however, enhancing detection sensitivity and increasing signal to noise ratio still remains a major challenge. Novel techniques are presently required which can provide reliable, low cost, and ultra-sensitive detection of proteins and DNA. This thesis will focus on two approaches in this context: the use of diblock copolymer templates and zinc oxide nanorods, with an aim to provide rapid, sensitive and accurate biomolecular detection. While complementary, these approaches are not necessarily interlinked.\n\nFirst approach will focus on utilizing the microphase separation behavior of diblock copolymers to pattern proteins with nanometer periodicity. The structural variety and chemical heterogeneity of polystyrene-block-poly(methylmethacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) and polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-PVP) template surfaces were successfully exploited to spontaneous formation of self-assembled, linear and hexagonally-ordered protein arrays that exhibit repeat spacings in a nanoscopic dimension. More importantly, protein molecules on the polymeric templates maintained their natural conformation and activity for several months. Our results demonstrate that self-assembling, chemically heterogeneous, diblock copolymer templates can be used as excellent, high payload, high density protein templates making them highly suitable as functional substrates in many proteomics applications.  \n\nSecond approach will focus on the remarkably enhanced optical detection of DNA and proteins which is enabled by the use of nanoscale zinc oxide platforms. Using model protein and nucleic acid systems, we demonstrate that engineered nanoscale zinc oxide nanostructures can significantly enhance the detection capability of biomolecular fluorescence. Without any chemical or biological amplification processes, nanoscale zinc oxide platforms enabled increased fluorescence detection of these biomolecules when compared to other commonly used substrates such as glass, quartz, polymer, and silicon. We also demonstrate the easy integration potential of zinc oxide nanostructures into periodically patterned platforms which, in turn, will promote the assembly and fabrication of these materials into multiplexed, high-throughput, optical sensor arrays.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4773], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Nitin ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nitin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jong In Hahm", "Darrell Velegol", "Jian Xu", "Andrew Zydney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jong In Hahm, Committee Chair", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biomolecular fluorescence detection", "diblock copolymers", "protein arrays", "zinc oxide nanorods"]}]
