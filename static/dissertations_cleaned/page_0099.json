If the warning time is decreased to less than half-an-orbit in advance, the problem becomes more complex. Typically, the maneuver (assumed to be impulsive) would be placed at perigee or apogee and oriented in the direction that allows for a fuel-optimal maneuver to be performed well before the predicted collision. Instead, for rapid collision avoidance scenarios, finite burn propagation was applied to determine the thrust duration and direction required to reach a desired minimum collision probability. Determining the thrust time and direction for a wide range of orbits and spacecraft properties results in a semi-analytical solution to the collision avoidance problem anywhere in Low-Earth Orbit. The speed at which this method can be applied makes it valuable when minimal time is available to perform such a maneuver.\nFor many spacecraft missions, even the slightest change in the orbit of the spacecraft may significantly affect its ability to perform to its required specifications. With the high volume of debris in orbit, debris-creating events could occur with no advanced notice, making rapid collision avoidance scenarios a real possibility.  Care must be taken to ensure that any potential collision is avoided while minimizing the effect of the maneuver on the spacecraft\u2019s mission performance. Assuming perfect knowledge of the states of all objects and that the possible collisions occur at high relative velocities, the required thrusting time to achieve a desired collision probability is found. Varying the desired collision probability, the resulting changes in the required thrust duration time (and, thus, fuel use) can be observed, providing options for trading the fuel use and likelihood of a collision. Additionally, both of these variables contribute directly to the ability of the spacecraft to perform to the desired mission specifications. As the collision probability threshold and required burn time increase, the mission performance decreases. The level of robustness necessary in the mission specifications can be used to limit the desired collision probability threshold. This is accomplished by determining the time and fuel required to perform the collision avoidance maneuver to the desired probability level and analyzing the effect of the time spent away from the mission orbit and the quantity of fuel required to perform the maneuver on the mission performance. It was found that, for notification times less than around 20 minutes, it is best to decrease the collision probability as much as the available fuel will allow without regard for the time duration of the maneuver. As the notification time increases past 20 minutes, more emphasis can be placed on the time required to perform the entire maneuver and it was found that simultaneously minimizing the maneuver time and collision probability outweighed the slight extra fuel required for such a maneuver. Such analysis would prove significant in real-time spacecraft operations when determining an optimal collision probability threshold (typically a subjective variable) for rapid collision avoidance scenarios.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11725], "author_name_tesi": "Reiter, Jason A", "last_name_ssi": "Reiter", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Spencer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Spencer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["astrodynamics", "collision avoidance", "debris", "trade studies", "optimization", "trajectory", "mission design"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Viability of embedded ultrasonic sensors for structural health monitoring of concrete cracking", "id": "15504", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7561", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Concrete infrastructure is an integral part of a transportation system.

Single gene studies provide a great deal of information but are difficult to extrapolate to other genes. Genomics is probably the only way to address this question, by examining hundreds of genes concurrently. However, traditional genomic assays lack the resolution to see the precise organization of regulatory complexes furthermore most genomics studies focus only on one aspect of transcription, thus lacking the natural context in which gene regulation occurs. This dissertation presents an approach to integrate and analyze high-resolution data to understand the principles\nthat govern gene regulation.\nThe 137 ribosomal protein genes (RPG) of Saccharomyces provide an excellent model to study gene co-regulation. Here, we examine the positional and functional organization of RPG regulators (Rap1, Fhl1, Ifh1, Sfp1, and Hmo1), the transcription machinery (TFIIB, TFIID and RNA polymerase II), and chromatin at near-bp resolution using ChIP-exo, as RPGs are coordinately reprogrammed. We found that wherever Hmo1 is enriched, Fhl1, Ifh1, Sfp1, and Hmo1 crosslink broadly to promoter DNA in an RPG-specific manner. Importantly, Hmo1 extended 20-50 bp downstream of Fhl1. Upon RPG repression, Fhl1 remained in place. Hmo1 dissociated, which was coupled to an upstream shift of the +1 nucleosome, as reflected by the Hmo1 extension and core promoter region. Fhl1 and Hmo1 may create two regulatable and\npositionally distinct barriers against which chromatin remodelers position the +1 nucleosome into either an activating or a repressive state. Consistent with in vitro studies, we found that specific TFIID subunits, in addition to crosslinking at the core promoter, made precise crosslinks at Rap1 sites, which we interpret to reflect native Rap1-TFIID interactions. Our findings suggest how sequence-specific DNA binding regulates nucleosome positioning and transcription complex assembly >300 bp away, and how co-regulation co-evolved with coding sequences.\nBased on the concepts learned with RPGs, I propose a computational pipeline to discover similar regulatory architectures genome-wide using ChIP-exo data. The pipeline proposed in this dissertation aims to perform an integrative analysis of high-resolution ChIP-exo data that would: (a) allow us to get mechanistic insights about the regulation process; (b) help us understand gene regulation in a natural context; and (c) identify focal points in the complexes to deconvolve the regulatory architecture. The pipeline re-capitulated the RPG regulatory complex thus validating the approach and furthermore discovered a new regulatory architecture at tRNA genes.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11690], "author_name_tesi": "Reja, Rohit ", "last_name_ssi": "Reja", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rohit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie", "Shaun A Mahony", "Dr Yu Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Dissertation Advisor", "Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie, Committee Chair", "Shaun A Mahony, Committee Member", "Dr Yu Zhang, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ChIP-exo", "gene regulation", "ribosomal protein genes", "architecture"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Assessing the Usefulness of Philippine Rice Extension Materials\n\n\n\n", "id": "9258", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5456", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Knowledge products (KPs) as a traditional extension delivery method and the emergence of the Open Academy for Philippine Agriculture (OPAPA) as ICT-mediated extension strategy in Philippine rice agriculture were examined.

The study used concepts from the uses and gratifications theory (U&G theory), non-gratification factors from salient theories, and sociodemographic variables to examine the usefulness of KPs and OPAPA. \n\nThe study used a descriptive-correlational design. A questionnaire was developed and organized into two sections to address KPs and OPAPA. A total of 135 respondents were interviewed from February to March, 2008 in Northern Luzon, Philippines. Of the 135 respondents, 131 were aware and had used KPs while 110 were aware and had used OPAPA.\n\nWith regard to uses and gratification factors, findings indicated that SOCIAL gratification was highly correlated with usefulness of KPs while SOCIAL and FUTURE PLANS gratifications had substantial significant positive relationships with usefulness of OPAPA. Further, results showed that low to substantial significant positive relationships were found between gratification variables and usefulness of KPs and OPAPA. On the other hand, CONTENT was found to have the highest positive significant correlation with usefulness of KPs and OPAPA compared to the remaining non-gratification variables that showed low to moderate significant positive relationships with usefulness of KPs and OPAPA.

Discovered in 1888, the Hofmeister series is a recurring trend that originally ranked cations and anions by their ability to precipitate proteins from aqueous salt solutions.  Over the course of the 21st century however, the Hofmeister effect was found to extend well beyond protein precipitation studies and occurs in myriad bio-chemical and physico-chemical systems. Today, the field remains an active area of research and has gained the attention of many researchers due to the elusiveness in developing a theoretical framework for predicting ion specific effects in water. Only recently has a unified molecular picture began to emerge. Moreover, utilizing the proper techniques and model systems is key. In this dissertation, we have employed model protein backbones in a set of salt solution studies using NMR, FTIR and thermodynamic phase transition measurements to elucidate both the molecular level and macroscopic details of the Hofmeister effect.\nFirst, we investigate the interactions of Hofmeister anions with a thermoresponsive polymer, poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) (PDEA). This amide based polymer lacks an NH moiety in its chemical structure and serves as a model to directly test if anions can bind to amide moieties in the absence of an NH site. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PDEA was measured as a function of concentration for eleven sodium salts in aqueous solutions and followed a direct Hofmeister series for the ability of anions to precipitate the polymer. More strongly hydrated anions (CO32-, SO42-, S2O32, H2PO4-, F-, Cl-) linearly decreased the LCST of the polymer with increasing salt concentration. Weakly hydrated anions (SCN-, ClO4-, I-, NO3-, Br-) increased the LCST at lower salt concentrations and salted the polymer into solution, but salted the polymer out at higher salt concentrations. Proton NMR was used to probe the mechanism of the salting-in effect and showed apparent binding between weakly hydrated anions (SCN- and I-) and the \u03b1-protons of the polymer backbone. Additional experiments performed by FTIR found little change in the amide I band, which is consistent with limited, if any, interactions between the salt ions and the carbonyl moiety of the amide. These results support a molecular mechanism for ion-specific effects on proteins and model amides that does not specifically require an NH group to interact with the anions for salting-in to occur.\nNext, the binding sites of a 600 residue protein polymer, (VPGVG)120, were elucidated using a combination of NMR and LCST measurements. It was found that the salting-in effect of large soft anions such as SCN\u2212 and I\u2212 is due to direct interactions at glycine residues within the polypeptide backbone via a hybrid binding site that consists of the amide dipole and the adjacent \u03b1-carbon. The hydrocarbon groups at these sites bear a slight positive charge, which enhances anion binding without disrupting specific hydrogen bonds to water molecules. The hydrophobic side chains do not contribute significantly to anion binding or the corresponding salting-in behavior of the biopolymer. Cl\u2212 binds far more weakly to the amide dipole/\u03b1-carbon binding site, while SO42\u2212 is repelled from both the backbone and hydrophobic side chains of the polypeptide. The Na+ counterions are also repelled from the polypeptide. The identification of these molecular-level binding sites provides new insight into the mechanisms of peptide\u2212ion interactions. Moreover, the location of the amide, whether in a protein backbone or on a polymer side chain, has no appreciable influence on the ability of weakly hydrated anions to bind. \nTo further explore the glycine residue binding site interaction with anions, we employed triglycine (GGG) along with two variants of the peptide as model systems. These small peptides allowed for the investigation of the influence of size on ion binding as well as the effect of electrostatic interactions of ions with charged termini. We demonstrated by means of NMR and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy that the Hofmeister series for anions changes from a direct to a reversed series upon uncapping the N-terminus of the peptide. Weakly hydrated anions, such as I- and SCN-, interact with the amide backbone, while strongly hydrated anions like SO42- are repelled from it. In contrast, a reversed order of ion interactions was observed at the positively charged, uncapped N-terminus. This by analogy should also be the case at side chains of positively charged amino acids such as lysine and arginine. Overall, the small GGG peptides displayed over an order of magnitude weaker binding compared to the large ELPs mentioned above. These results demonstrate that the specific chemical and physical properties of peptides and proteins play a fundamental role in ion specific effects and provides a route for exploiting these interactions by tuning protein size and the number of basic amino acid residues on the surface. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10235], "author_name_tesi": "Rembert, Kelvin B", "last_name_ssi": "Rembert", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Kelvin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Cremer", "Scott A Showalter", "William George Noid", "Craig Eugene Cameron"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Cremer, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott A Showalter, Committee Chair", "William George Noid, Committee Member", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hofmeister Series", "Ions", "Polymers", "Water", "NMR", "LCST", "FTIR"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Using the Fullan Leadership Model to Determine the Meaning of Leadership for Four Teacher Leaders\n", "id": "6160", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1081", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-08-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to explore the ways that four individual teachers experienced the change in their role and daily teaching practice as they implement a teacher leadership program called Model Classrooms.

In recent years, however, teacher leaders have begun to move to the forefront of school change (Duke, 1994). The Model Classrooms program focuses on teacher leadership and professional development as method to improve collaboration and collegiality among colleagues. \nOriginally, five self-selected teachers, under the guidance of the district assistant superintendent, designed this school reform effort in 2000 to improve teacher leadership skills and model best practices. These five teachers began their efforts in the place in which they had the most control, their own classrooms. The resulting framework contained four major components: planning and preparation, the environment, instruction, and assessment. In September 2002, an additional five teachers were added to the leadership team.  \nThe goal of the program is to provide a network of teachers who are available to model best practices, provide an environment of greater teacher collaboration, and build local capacity to facilitate change.

First, it assesses the long term risk of homelessness among individuals exiting prison.  Second, it examines whether there are different forms of homelessness among ex-inmates.  The conceptual and analytical models are drawn from various theoretical traditions including criminology, life course sociology, and social stratification.  Administrative data from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and Philadelphia\u2019s Office of Supportive Housing are used to estimate (1) event history models establishing the risk of homelessness among ex-inmates for 94 months post-release, and (2) latent class models assessing whether statistically distinct types of homelessness exist among ex-inmates.  \nTwo main findings emerge from the analysis.  First, the results show that ex-inmates are at risk for homelessness long after release from prison, many becoming homeless for the first time years later.  While ex-inmates are at the greatest risk of homelessness shortly after release, approximately 44% of those who became homeless first had this experience two or more years after release.  Second, there is considerable heterogeneity in homelessness experiences among ex-inmates.  In contrast to prior work which suggests that homelessness is primarily a reentry problem for ex-inmates, I find that ex-inmates who became homeless shortly after release were most likely to be chronically homeless throughout the observation period.  I also find two types of delayed homelessness; some experienced a delayed, short spell while others experienced prolonged homelessness beginning years after release.  A final group experienced homelessness intermittently throughout the observation period.  \nA variety of factors explain the risk of homelessness among ex-inmates.  Health behaviors, including mental illness and drug use, significantly complicate the reintegration process.  Being older and being African American represent additional obstacles.  Regarding the incarceration experience, full sentence completion is also a risk factor.  Moreover, a history of homelessness prior to incarceration is a strong predictor of homelessness post-release.  In contrast, marriage, a high school diploma, longer than average sentences, and parole appear to buffer ex-inmates from homelessness.  Similar factors distinguish between different forms of homelessness.

Adhesively bonded joints are one of the best options for joining composite materials. However, adhesive bonds are subject to damage such as adhesive defects, e.g. disbonds, and cohesive defects, e.g. porosity. Ultrasonic guided wave techniques are regarded as promising methods for bond condition inspection. Ultrasonic guided waves can travel long distances without too much attenuation. The large number of propagating modes that correspond to different displacement distributions provides the possibility to characterize different types of defects. Adhesive defects are the focus of this thesis. \nThe objective of this thesis is to extend recent research on inspection of isotropic adhesive bonds to composite adhesive bonds. The mode conversion that occurs at waveguide transitions will be studied. Analysis methods that are similar to those used with isotropic materials are employed and their performance will be evaluated. The similarities and differences when selecting effective modes for inspection of isotropic and anisotropic materials will be studied. \nChallenges associated with inspection of bonded region can be summarized as finding a mode sensitive to adhesive defects and successfully exciting that mode. Mode selection takes both of these aspects into consideration.\nA simplified skin-stringer system is considered. Both skin and stringer are carbon fiber reinforced polymer with a [0/45/90/-45]S2 stacking sequence. Dispersion analysis is conducted on skin and bonded region waveguides. A wave structure based method gives the candidate modes and frequencies that are sensitive to adhesive defects. Wave structure matching and the normal mode expansion method are utilized to study the mode conversion at waveguide transitions. Mode selection is carried out based on the requirements of sensitivity and excitability. \nFurther optimization is necessary for practical reasons. The attenuation and skewing propagation direction could affect the inspection considerably. The choices for mode selection have been further narrowed down by choosing modes in the low frequency range and having small skew angles. \nFinite element simulation performed to demonstrate the excitation of an effective mode shows that the resultant displacement field in the bonded region satisfies the requirement of having a large in-plane displacement at the interface. \nExperiments have been conducted on the adhesively bonded skin-stringer with artificial defects. Defects are simulated by inserting Teflon film between the skin and the adhesive layer. Experimental results show that the effective modes have good sensitivity to the adhesive defects while another mode that is expected to have poor sensitivity to the defect does not show the capability to detect the defects. One optimal mode detected bonds in terms of frequency content. The other optimal mode could distinguish the good bond from defected bonds by their peak amplitudes. The results from a mode with poor sensitivity does not show the ability to tell good bonds from defected ones considering either frequency content or peak amplitude. \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [891], "author_name_tesi": "Ren, Baiyang ", "last_name_ssi": "Ren", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Baiyang", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ultrasonic guided wave", "nondestructive evaluation", "adhesive bond", "carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Modal Content Based Damage Indicators and Phased Array Transducers for Structural Health Monitoring of Aircraft Structures using Ultrasonic Guided Waves", "id": "26460", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11773", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Composite materials, especially carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP), have been widely used in the aircraft industry because of their high specific strength and stiffness, resistance to corrosion and good fatigue life. Due to their highly anisotropic material properties and laminated structures, joining methods like bolting and riveting are no longer appropriate for joining CFRP since they initiate defects during the assembly and severely compromise the integrity of the structure; thus new techniques for joining CFRP are highly demanded. Adhesive bonding is a promising method because it relieves stress concentration, reduces weight and provides smooth surfaces. Additionally, it is a low-cost alternative to the co-cured method which is currently used to manufacture components of aircraft fuselage. Adhesive defects, disbonds at the interface between adherend and adhesive layer, are focused on in this thesis because they can be initialized by either poor surface preparation during the manufacturing or fatigue loads during service. \nAircraft need structural health monitoring (SHM) systems to increase safety and reduce loss, and adhesive bonds usually represent the hotspots of the assembled structure.  There are many nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods for bond inspection. However, these methods cannot be readily integrated into an SHM system because of the bulk size and weight of the equipment and requirement of accessibility to one side of the bonded joint. The first objective of this work is to develop instruments, actuators, sensors and a data acquisition system for SHM of bond lines using ultrasonic guided waves which are well known to be able to cover large volume of the structure and inaccessible regions. Different from widely used guided wave sensors like PZT disks, the new actuators, piezoelectric fiber composite (PFC) phased array transducers0 (PAT), can control the modal content of the excited waves and the new sensors, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) arrays, which can extract modal information from the received waves. Also, the PATs and array sensors have broad frequency bandwidth and can easily excite and receive high order guided wave modes which are not possible using PZT disks. \nCurrently, many guided wave SHM techniques employ the fundamental guided wave modes below the first cut-off frequency because of their low dispersion in this frequency range. Such a practice ignores the possibility of using higher order modes which sometimes have much better sensitivity to defects. A frequency domain finite element model is created in this work to study the behavior of the interaction between guided waves and a disbond. The sensitivities of modes are classified into three levels, namely, good sensitivity, intermediate sensitivity and no sensitivity. The novel damage indicators, wave modal amplitude and wave modal composition, are proposed to increase the sensitivity to disbonds. \nThe effects of environmental operational conditions (EOC) are presenting great challenges to reliable SHM practice because they may influence the wave amplitude and time of flight. The use of fundamental modes shows poor sensitivity to the disbond; but the use of higher order modes shows good sensitivity.  The experiments demonstrate that the new damage indicators have excellent sensitivity to disbonds even with elevated temperatures and have the capability to characterize the size of a disbond. Additionally, the detection of other types of defects like notches on aluminum plates and disbonds in adhesively bonded aluminum plate are also demonstrated using the proposed damage indicators. The use of the new damage indicators for SHM applications relies on the capability of resolving the modal content of wave signals which is enabled only by using PFC PATs and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) array sensors. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11236], "author_name_tesi": "Ren, Baiyang ", "last_name_ssi": "Ren", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Baiyang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Joseph Paul Cusumano", "Edward C Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member", "Edward C Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Structural health monitoring", "Nondestructive testing", "Ultrasonic guided waves", "Phased array", "Adhesive bonds", "Fiber composites"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A Study of Selected Issues in Android Security", "id": "b5644r534", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12859", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mobile devices such as smartphones have become an integral part of society today, shaping people\u2019s daily life, changing the landscape of how business operate and how industries are powered today.

The ensilage process, which is a traditional crop storage method for ruminants in winter, is proposed as a preservation method for corn stover. Since cell wall saccharification and sugar fermentation occur naturally during the ensiling process, preserving corn stover as silage is expected to benefically pretreat the feedstock for downstream bioconversion. In this study, cell wall degrading enzymes and chemicals were added to stover silage in order to reduce pH and/or encourage lactic acid fermentation. \nThrough this study, the effect of size reduction was examined for coarse (as harvested), medium (<10mm), and fine (<5m) ground stover, with and without enzyme or chemical treatments. The pre-processing cost and the efficiency of enzyme attachment to corn stover will be influenced by stover size. To reduce the cost of enzyme additives, the lowest effective enzyme concentration was determined first. The purified enzyme mixture was applied at rates of 6.7, 13.4, 26.3, 53.4, and 106.9 international units (IU) hemicellulase activity per gram stover dry matter (DM). Relative to the lowest rate, the rate of 13.4 IUg-1 DM resulted in a significant decrease in pH and increase of lactic acid concentration, and shifted the dominant microbial regime from clostridia to Lactobacillus spp. The highest water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content and hemicellulose degradation levels were obtained with coarse size stover, although the improved effect in coarse size was from the natural hydrolysis instead of the enzyme addition. The benefits of industrial enzyme mixtures were compared with those of purified enzymes, with similar results to the purified enzymes at a much lower cost. To reduce enzyme costs, the industrial enzyme prouducts were used for the following study.\nThere are numerous industrial enzyme mixtures available commercially, derived from different microbial sources and containing different enzyme components. The impacts of seven commercial enzyme mixtures were examined on corn stover preservation and pretreatment, with different combinations of microbial source and enzyme components. These enzymes were produced by Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma reesei, and Trichoderma longibrachiatum. Treatments included three size grades of corn stover, two enzyme levels (1.67 IU g-1 DM and 5 IU g-1 DM based on hemicellulase), and various ratios of cellulase to hemicellulase (C:H) in products derived from each microbial source. Higher lactic acid content and lower pH were obtained with increasing C:H ratios, especially with Trichoderma reesei enzymes. The highest C:H ratio tested, 2.38, resulted in the most effective fermentation, with lactic acid the dominant product. Significant cellulose and hemicellulose degradation was observed in these high C:H ratio enzyme mixtures derived from Trichoderma reesei, indicating the additive rates could be reduced if preservation is the primary goal.  \nThe positive effect of enzyme addition was demonstrated on a pilot scale and in an extended preservation period. Corn stover at the three different particle size ranges was ensiled with and without a commercial enzyme mixture in 20 L mini-silos. Triplicate silos were destructively sampled and analyzed on days 0, 1, 7, 21, 63, and 189. On days 0, 21, and 189, the triplicate samples were mixed evenly and assembled into particleboard using 10% ISU 2 resin, a soy-based adhesive. Enzymatic addition improved the ensiling process, as indicated by sustained lower pH, higher WSC concentration, and increased lactic acid production. The middle particle size range (<10 mm) demonstrated the most promising results during the ensiling process. Compared with fresh stover, the ensilage process increased the internal bond strength of stover particleboard by 32.6% and decreased water adsorption at 2 hr boiling and 24 hr soaking significantly. Particleboard panels produced from substrate ensiled with enzymes showed a significant reduction in water adsorption of 12.1% during 2 hr-boiling testing. \nCompared with enzymes, chemical additives are currently more ecomonical. The effect of five chemicals, including sulfuric acid, formic acid, formaldehyde, ammonia, and urea, was evaluated for corn stover preservation and pretreatment. Treatments included 2, 4, and 8 g kg-1 DM of sulfuric acid, formic acid, and formaldehyde and 4, 8, and 16 g kg-1 DM of ammonia and urea, with each of these 15 chemical treatments applied to three different particle sizes of stover. Sulfuric acid, formic acid, and formaldehyde increased lactic acid concentration and decreased acetic acid concentration. Clostridia activities were inhibited at the 16 g kg-1 DM level of urea and ammonia.  Sulfuric acid, commonly considered as an economical and effective pretreatment reagent, was reexamined as a preservation and pretreatment additive over a 63 day period.  The long term trial of sulfuric acid-treated silage showed that WSC increased over 63 days at the 16 g kg-1 DM level, although fermentation was almost inhibited at this level. Sulfuric acid, formic acid, formaldehyde, and ammonia increased sugar yield in enzymatic hydrolysis when compared to fresh stover and to control samples ensiled without chemical additives.\nA mathematical model of corn stover silage was developed to predict the effect of enzyme addition on stover preservation. Cellulose degradation was first simulated by a hydrolysis kinetic model and integrated into a previous silage model developed by other researchers. A parameter to account for cellulose structural features, \u0192\u00dc, was estimated as 0.56, implying 56% of cellulose was in the non-hydrolysable region and unavailable for enzymatic hydrolysis. With the integrated silage model, dynamic responses of several important chemical components of corn stover silage were predicted, including the concentration of cellulose, total water soluble carbohydrates, degraded sugars, and lactic acid. Acceptable predictions for these chemical constituents were obtained with the exception of lactic acid. \nEnsiling with enzyme and chemical treatments has been demonstrated as a safe and effective preservation method with beneficial pretreatment effects for downstream bioconversion, such as particleboard manufacturing and sugar production. Integration of an improved ensiling process with a more efficient pretreatment method is required to increase the sugar yield of ensiled stover. If the crosslink in cell walls can be broken down by integrating pretreatment during the preservation period, bioconversion of corn stover can be carried out immediately without additional pretreatment. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2348], "author_name_tesi": "Ren, Haiyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Ren", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Haiyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Lehman Richard", "Ali Demirci", "Dennis Buckmaster", "Gabriella Anne Varga", "John Michael Regan", "Roy Edward Young"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Lehman Richard, Committee Chair", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member", "Dennis Buckmaster, Committee Member", "Gabriella Anne Varga, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Roy Edward Young, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["preservation", "bioconversion", "ensilage", "corn stover", "water soluble carbohydrate", "enzymes"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SURFACE AND DEEP LEVEL FAULTLINES AND NETWORK TIES IN MULTICULTURAL TEAMS\n\n\n", "id": "8568", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2362", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study applies faultline, diversity and network perspectives to understand the functioning of multicultural teams (MCTs). Specifically, this study explores the effects of faultlines on the process and performance of multicultural teams while at the same time taking into account team members\u2019 actual network ties.

I particularly examine faultlines based on both cultural values and surface-level attributes (e.g., demographics), as well as faultlines based on both cultural values and deep-level attributes (e.g., differences in beliefs and attitudes). I also examine how network ties that span cultural subgroups created by faultlines influence these same process and outcome variables. A cross-sectional and longitudinal investigation of more than 100 research teams at a major research university provides evidence for a complex pattern of the impact of faultlines and network ties. The results demonstrate that faultlines alone do not contribute to team processes or performance. Instead, their effects depend on the social interaction patterns that cut across them. Specifically, team performance improved when friendship ties cut across subgroups formed by cultural faultlines, but relationship conflict increased and team performance decreased when animosity ties cut across these subgroups. Overall, the results highlighted the importance of taking into account team members\u2019 actual network patterns while studying the effects of team composition on team process and performance.

This has led to the development of several novel materials with high performance. It is the objective of this thesis to explore and expand these new opportunities. Especially, we will investigate and develop innovative approaches to address three applications: \nIn chapter 2 and chapter 3, the energy harvesting using both the electrostrictive PVDF based polymers and 1-3 single crystal PMN-33PT/Epoxy composite are investigated.  In addition to the high elastic energy density and high electromechanical conversion efficiency of these active materials, this study also explores the approaches of using smart electronics to significantly enhance the efficiency of the energy harvesting process. As an example, we demonstrate that when a properly phased and externally applied electric AC field is superimposed on the mechanical cycle, an output electrical energy density of 39mJ/cm3 and mechanical-to-electrical conversion efficiency of about 10% can be obtained from the P (VDF-TrFE) based electrostrictive polymers. For 1-3 single crystal PMN-33PT/Epoxy composite, under a mechanical stress of 88.9 MPa at 4 Hz, a harvested energy density of near 0.1 W/cc can be achieved.\nIn chapter 4, the Braille actuators suitable for refreshable full page display and graphic display using the electrostrictive PVDF-based polymers are investigated.

BESs have undergone tremendous development resulting in substantial advances in performance during the past decade, in terms of increases in energy output, feasibility of scaling-up the reactors, and reduction in system costs. However, optimization of system operation and the development of evaluation methods are needed to facilitate commercialization of BESs for wastewater treatment. The research findings reported here addressed several different aspects of BES operation and performance for wastewater treatment: examination of what factors affected power production of multi-electrode microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with hydraulic and electrical connections; investigation of how substrate competition between exoelectrogens and other microorganisms affected coulombic efficiencies (CEs) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals in MFCs; development of an energy-efficient, high-quality wastewater treatment system that combined MFCs with a secondary treatment system; and the use of a high-throughput screening method to evaluate chemical effects and wastewater treatability.\nThe power production of four hydraulically connected MFCs was compared with the reactors wired using individual electrical circuits to that obtained when the anodes and the cathodes were wired together. Based on the polarization tests, the same power was produced by the combined and individual circuit MFCs when operated in fed-batch mode. In continuous flow mode, where the acetate concentration significantly affected MFC performance, slightly lower power was produced by the MFCs containing the electrodes wired together compared to those with individual circuits. Parasitic current flow between adjacent MFCs showed no appreciable impact on reactor performance. These results demonstrated that the acetate concentration differences had more of an effect on the performance of multi-electrode systems than parasitic current, and thus that there was no need for electrolyte isolation between adjacent reactors. \nThe competition for acetate through current generation by exoelectrogens and aerobic microbial respiration was examined in single-chamber air-cathode MFCs by measuring COD removals at different current densities. COD removal was always first-order with respect to COD concentration, even under open circuit conditions. As a result, the COD lost to non-exoelectrogenic processes was not constant over time, but instead decreased with COD concentration. With current generation, substrate was consumed at a faster rate, reducing the bulk COD concentration faster and therefore reducing the rate that COD was lost to aerobic respiration. Thus, the COD degradation rates and CEs improved with increases in current densities due to the greater substrate uptake by exoelectrogens. This demonstrated that exoelectrogens could outcompete aerobic heterotrophs for acetate at high current densities, resulting in increased COD removal rates and CEs that were achieved by operating the MFCs at lower resistances.\nA two-stage laboratory-scale treatment process, consisting of multiple MFCs followed by an anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor (AFMBR), was examined for the treatment of domestic wastewater at ambient temperatures. Four multi-electrode MFCs were separated into two flow lines, with two MFCs connected hydraulically in series, avoiding large COD changes in each reactor that has been shown to adversely affect power generation. The MFC-AFMBR produced a high-quality effluent (COD, 16 mg/L; TSS, < 1mg/L), with no need for membrane cleaning even after 50 d of operation, at a high flux of 16 L/m2/h. The energy produced by the MFCs (0.0197 kWh/m3) was theoretically sufficient to meet the energy demands (0.0186 kWh/m3) for the system operation. These results showed that a two-stage MFC-AFMBR system could be used to effectively treat domestic wastewater at ambient temperatures, with a low energy requirement. \nMini-microbial electrolysis cells (mini-MECs) were tested as a high-throughput method to examine the effects of different chemicals on current production and the treatability of different wastewaters. Amorphous ferric hydroxide [Fe(OH)3] addition increased current densities for both mixed cultures and pure culture of Geobacter sulfurreducens in a bicarbonate buffer. Scanning electron microscopic images and electrochemical tests showed that this improved performance resulted from formation of a highly porous structure on the cathode surface, which reduced the cathode overpotential and its diffusion resistance. Tween 80 did not increase the current in MECs, although it has previously been shown to improve power production in MFCs. The addition of DNA also did not improve MEC performance.\nVarious refinery wastewater samples, with appreciably different solution characteristics, resulted in large differences in current production and treatability in mini-MECs. All de-oiled wastewater samples showed good performance, with one sample producing results comparable to those obtained using domestic wastewater. The other refinery wastewater samples produced less current or even failed to generate any current, due to low biodegradability or high initial pH.

Much previous work has been done by scholars to utter the importance of college rankings as they will affect student choice and institutional behavior. Previous research has shown that a causal link between rankings and subsequent admission factors does exist (Bowman & Bastedo, 2009). Ranking now is considered to be an indicator of academic prestige and a predictor of application, admission and enrollment. The US News & World Report College Rankings is one of the most influential ranking systems in United States; it gives information to students, families, alumni, staff and faculty. This paper, motivated by Monks and Ehrenberg (1999), attempts to use multivariate regression model, as well as a new and larger data set, to investigate how rank changes affect institutional admission behaviors over the first decade of 2000s.\nIn this study, I find that institutional selectivity is impaired while institutions receive unfavorable ranking. With ranking number increasing by 1, the admission rate of current year will increase by 0.1 percentage point, the enrollment rate of current year will decrease by 0.2 percentage point, the 25th percentile freshmen SAT score of current year will decrease by 0.871 points, and the 75th percentile freshmen SAT score of current year will decrease by 0.706 points.

This virus infects over 20 million people worldwide with about 1 million of HTLV-1-infected patients developing ATL. ATL is a highly aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and currently there is no effective therapy for this type of leukemia and lymphoma. The viral genome encodes three main structural gene products including Gag, reverse transcriptase (Pol/RT) and envelope protein (Env), together with several viral regulatory proteins such as Tax (Tax-1). Tax is a known viral oncogenic protein that plays a central role in transforming CD4+ T lymphocytes by deregulating oncogenic signaling pathways. Expression of Tax is critical for promoting survival of HTLV-1-infected T cells, which is required for initiation of oncogenesis. Notably, Tax activates I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex in the cytoplasm, resulting in persistent activation of NF-\u03baB, a transcriptional factor that plays key roles in the pathogenesis of human cancer. This action increases NF-\u03baB responsive gene expressions that are crucial for T cell survival and cell cycle progression. Tax is predominantly distributed in the nucleus with a perinuclear Golgi distribution pattern, shuttling between these two subcellular compartments in HTLV-1-transformed T cells. \nMy thesis project is to study the molecular mechanism of the retroviral oncoprotein Tax in promoting T lymphocyte survival and proliferation. The central hypothesis of my thesis project is that \u201cmodulating I\u03baB kinase activity by Tax is critical for HTLV-1-mediated oncogenesis\u201d. I proposed to study three specific aims. Aim1 was to investigate the oncogenic activation of the Tax protein in human primary CD4+ T cells in a prospective approach. Aim2 was to evaluate the mechanism and function of Tax-mediated autophagy during T cell immortalization and transformation. Aim3 was to explore the possibility of utilizing Tax as a molecular tool to generate T cell subtype cell lines and to develop T-LGL leukemia model.\nMy previous work demonstrated that Tax is a viral lipid raft protein that can hijack the IKK complex into its lipid rafts for persistent activation. It is known that T cell receptor engagement results in activation of IKK and PI3KC1, and induces autophagy that is important for T cell survival. Similarly, Tax activates both IKK and PI3KC1. Although these two kinases have been reported to exhibit opposing activities in regulating autophagy, I observed that HTLV-1-infected T cells exhibit constitutively high level of autophagy. These experimental results strongly suggest that autophagy is beneficial for HTLV-1-mediated oncogenesis. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are closely related, sharing strikingly similar structure. HTLV-2 infection is prevalent among intravenous drug users and Tax-2 is highly homologous to Tax-1. However, the link between HTLV-2 infection and leukemia has not been established. My proposed research is to understand the survival mechanism of HTLV-1-transformed T cells. Therefore, the proposed study is highly significant not only for a better understanding of HTLV-1 pathogenesis but also for developing molecular therapeutics targeting the oncoprotein Tax. \nWe found that Tax is a determining factor for dysregulation of autophagy in HTLV-1-transformed T cells and Tax-immortalized CD4 memory T lymphocytes. Tax facilitated the autophagic process by activating IKK complex, which subsequently recruited an autophagy molecular complex containing Beclin1 and Bif-1 to the lipid raft microdomains. Tax engaged a crosstalk between the IKK complex and the autophagic molecular complex by directly interacting with both, thereby promoting assembly of LC3+ autophagosomes. Moreover, expression of lipid raft-targeted Bif-1 or Beclin1 was sufficient to induce formation of LC3+ autophagosomes, suggesting that Tax recruitment of autophagic molecules to lipid rafts is a dominant strategy to deregulate autophagy in the context of HTLV-1 transformation of T cells. Furthermore, depletion of Beclin1 resulted in impaired growth of HTLV-1-transformed T cells, indicating a critical role of Tax-deregulated autophagy in promoting survival and malignant transformation of virally infected T cells. \nThe general approach in my thesis project was to investigate the oncogenic activity of Tax in a prospective way, using HTLV-1-transformed T cell lines as controls. Human primary T lymphocytes were isolated and transduced with lentivirus carrying Tax-GFP expression cassette. The transduced cells exhibited green fluorescence after in vitro culture for one month. Although all tranduced cells passed typical senescence period (about three weeks at normal culture conditions), two Tax-1-GFP-transduced and four Tax-2-GFP-transduced cell lines were established for long-term growth in culture (more than one year). These cell lines, therefore, represent useful tool cell models for investigating the role of Tax in promoting T cell survival. This approach allows analysis of oncogenic events during the process of T cell immortalization and transformation. Lentivirus transduction in human primary T cells was highly efficient, with about 40-60% of cells able to be transduced. 4 out of 12 Tax-2-GFP transduced cells were capable of maintaining long-term growth in culture. These immortalized cells were consistent with CD4+ memory T lymphocytes demonstrating a CD3/TCR\u03b1\u03b2/CD4/CD25/CD45RO/ CD69 immunophenotype. In comparison to normal CD4 T cells, Tax-2-GFP-immortalized cells exhibited constitutive activation of PI3K/Akt, IKK/NF-\u03baB, MAPK and STAT3. The level of Mcl-1, a pro-survival Bcl-2 family member, was increased. Disruption of these oncogenic pathways caused apoptotic cell death of the Tax-2-established T cell lines. I observed that in Tax-2-immortalized T cells, a high level of autophagy occured which was critical for supporting T cell survival. Further analysis showed that the IKK complex played a key role in Tax-2-induced autophagy.\nSome leukemia types that are difficult to be cultured in vitro include CLL, T-LGLL and TPLL. For CLL, a JVM-3 cell line was developed by EBV infection of primary CLL cells. Establishment of T-LGLL cancer model remains to be a challenging task. The Tax protein immortalizes predominantly CD4 T cells and is not able to immortalize normal CD8 T cells. We developed a strategy that can prolong in vitro growth of primary T-LGL leukemia cells. Primary CD8+ populations from T-LGL leukemia patients were stably transduced with the retroviral tax gene derived from HTLV-2. Expression of Tax-2 overrided replication senescence and promoted clonal expansion of the leukemic CD8+ T cells. These cells exhibited features characteristic of T-LGL leukemia, such as resistance to FasL-mediated apoptosis, sensitivity to inhibitors for sphingolipid kinase and IKK as well as expression of cytotoxic gene products including granzyme B, perforin and IFN\u03b3. Collectively, these results indicate that the immortalized CD8+ cells from T-LGL leukemia patients are T-LGL leukemia-like cells, and this leukemia model can duplicate the main phenotypes of the clinical isolates of T-LGL leukemia. The establishment of the T-LGL leukemia model is useful for investigating molecular pathogenesis of the disease and for developing novel therapeutics.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8401], "author_name_tesi": "Ren, Tong ", "last_name_ssi": "Ren", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\"", "Hua Cheng", "John Warren Wills", "Todd Schell", "Xin Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\", Dissertation Advisor", "Hua Cheng, Dissertation Advisor", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "Xin Liu, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HTLV;Tax;Autophagy;CTL;Lipid rafts"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "SINGLE MOLECULE FRET STUDY OF\nCLAMP LOADING IN BACTERIOPHAGE T4\n", "id": "11222", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6622", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The assembly of bacteriophage T4 leading strand polymerase holoenzyme is accomplished with coordination of multi-proteins.

Finite element analyses of a strip footing bearing on unreinforced and reinforced clay are performed to evaluate and quantify the effects of several material (e.g., soil and reinforcement properties) and geometric (i.e., those pertaining to reinforcement layout) parameters on load-settlement response of the footing. A nonlinear elastic, perfectly plastic constitutive model obeying a non-associated flow rule is used to represent mechanical behavior of clay. geogrid reinforcement is modeled as a linear elastic material. Soil-reinforcement interaction is modeled using cohesive interface elements above and below the reinforcement layers. The clay constitutive model is also used as the material model for the cohesive interface element and a contact interaction model is utilized to define the connection between the cohesive interface and reinforcement layer. \nResults show that settlement influence factor, which can be used for calculation of immediate settlement under varying net stress applied at the footing base, reduces with increase in number of reinforcement layers and with increase in undrained shear strength of clay. An increase in plasticity index of clay causes an increase in immediate settlement and the same can be significant for foundations bearing on clays with high plasticity.

Current antidepressant drug treatments suffer from limited efficacy, and slow therapeutic onset. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism of MDD and development of new drugs, therefore, are in urgent need. \nIncreasing evidence points to alterations in \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic mechanism of neurotransmission as being intimately associated with MDD. Evidence for GABAergic deficits include reduced GABA concentrations in various brain areas, altered expression of GABAAR subunit genes and GABAA receptor benzodiazepine binding sites, as well as reduced expression of genes selectively expressed by GABAergic interneurons. In addition, mice with genetic ablations of the \u03b32 subunit gene have been established as model animals of major depressive disorder. As for deficits in glutamatergic neurotransmission, evidence from patients includes altered glutamate concentration and metabolism, changed gene expression of receptor subunits, and reduced expression excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT). Importantly, a single subanesthetic injection of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, has been shown in clinical trials to have rapid antidepressant effects in MDD subject that are resistant to conventional pharmacotherapy. Similar antidepressant effects have been reported for other NMDAR antagonists, including the GluN2B-specific NMDAR antagonist Ro25-6981, indicating that the effect of ketamine is indeed mediated by NMDA receptors. \nGABAAR \u03b32 subunit heterozygous knockout mice (\u03b32+/- mice) exhibit modest defects in GABAergic transmission, and they show behavioral, cognitive, cellular neuroendocrine, and pharmacological alterations expected of a model animal for major depressive disorder. In addition, adult born neurons of the hippocampus of these mice display deficits in maturation of dendritic spines, suggesting possibly altered glutamatergic neurotransmission. \nIn the current study, we used \u03b32-deficient mice and neuron cultures to explore possible links between GABAergic and glutamatergic deficits that are associated with the depressive-like brain state of \u03b32+/- mice. In cortical cultures derived from \u03b32-/- and \u03b32+/- embryos, we found drastic reductions in the cell surface expression of AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and the postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule neuroligin 1 (NL1). Moreover, whole cell excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by either AMPARs or by NMDARs were reduced in \u03b32-/- and \u03b32+/- neurons compared to wild type (WT) neurons, indicating that changes in the cell surface expression of these receptors are functionally relevant. Chronic treatment of wild type cortical cultures with the GABAAR  antagonist bicucullin for 24h induced cell surface reductions in NMDA and AMPA receptors similar to those in \u03b32+/- compared to WT cultures, suggesting that the down regulation of glutamate receptors in \u03b32+/- mice represented a form of homeostatic adaptation induced by GABAAR deficit induced hyperexcitability. These findings suggest that coordinated, homeostatic reductions in GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission contribute to the etiology of MDD. \nTo further probe the role of glutamatergic deficits of \u03b32+/- mice for the depressive-like phenotype of \u03b32+/- mice, we next analyzed the effect of ketamine in \u03b32+/- cultures. In previous studies of rats, ketamine had been shown to enhance the function of glutamatergic synapses, concomitant with an increase in NMDA and AMPA receptor levels in synaptosomes and an enlargement of synaptic spines. We found that treating \u03b32+/- cultures with ketamine for 3-4h normalized the surface level of NL1, GluN1 and GluA2/3, and this elevation of protein levels was much more prominent in \u03b32+/- neurons compared with WT. Thus, ketamine appears to reverse a homeostatic maladaptation of AMPA and NMDA receptors induced by GABAergic deficits. These changes include the cell adhesion molecule NL1, which is important for trafficking to and accumulation of NMDA receptors at glutamatergic synapses. Moreover, the time course of the effect of ketamine on NMDAR cell surface expression preceded the effect on AMPARs. Ketamine-induced changes in markers of glutamatergic synapses were also evident in situ, as shown by an increase in the density of punctate immunoreactivity for the pre and postsynaptic markers of glutamatergic synapses, vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). Importantly, treating neurons with the highly specific competitive NMDAR antagonist APV or the GluN2B specific NMDAR antagonist Ro25-6981 had effects on cell surface expression of glutamate receptors similar to ketamine, thereby confirming that ketamine acted at least in part by blocking NMDA receptors. Despite the prolonged antidepressant effect of ketamine observed in MDD patients, ketamine induced modulation of glutamate receptors was relatively transient in neuronal cultures. That is, in ketamine washout experiments the level of surface GluN1 dropped back to basal levels in less than 2 hours after the removal of ketamine. Lastly, the effect of ketamine on glutamate receptors was abolished by treatment with the GABAAR antagonist bicuculline, thereby indicationg that GABAA receptor activity is essential for ketamine induced increases of glutamate cell surface expression. Consistent with this observation, ketamine treatment of \u03b32+/- cultures increased the cell surface expression of the GABAergic synapse marker NL2, indicating that ketamine induced effects may also involve enhancement of GABAergic synaptic transmission.\nTo further explore whether our findings are relevant in vivo, we measured the cell surface levels of glutamate receptors in brain slices. Similar to results obtained with cortical cultures, the cell surface expression of NMDA receptors and NL1 were reduced in cortical (anterior cingulate cortex and prelimbic cortex) and hippocampal slices of \u03b32+/- compared to WT mice, although AMPAR surface expression was not measurably affected. Importantly, a single dose of ketamine treatment resulted in significantly increased cell surface expression of NMDARs in both cortex and hippocampus, analyzed 24 h post injection. AMPAR cell surface expression was measurably increased only in hippocampus. While the change in NMDAR expression was only evident in cell surface fractions, the increase in cell surface AMPAR expression was paralleled by a prominent increase also in total extracts, suggesting a transcriptional and/or translational mechanism. These observations, together with the in vitro data, indicate that ketamine functions to reverse a maladaptive homeostatic reduction in glutamate receptor expression triggered by chronic GABAergic deficits. \nIn summary, GABAAR deficits induced depressive states involve homeostatic down-regulation of glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and anterior cingulate/prelimbic cortex. Downregulation of glutamate receptor in the \u03b32+/- model may be enhanced by the fact that homeostatic upregulation of GABAergic inhibition is limited by limited expression of the \u03b32 subunit. Acute treatment with ketamine lastingly reverses this down-regulation of glutamate receptors and may in some cases also enhance GABAergic transmission. However, in the \u03b32+/- model homeostatic enhancement of GABAergic transmission is likely restricted by limited expression of the \u03b32 subunit.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10533], "author_name_tesi": "Ren, Zhen ", "last_name_ssi": "Ren", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher", "Bernhard Luscher", "Melissa Rolls", "Douglas Cavener", "Timothy J Jegla", "Pamela Hankey Giblin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher, Dissertation Advisor", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Chair", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Timothy J Jegla, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Major depressive disorder (MDD)", "ketamine", "glutamate receptors", "GABAA receptors", "homeostatic adaptation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "HYDROGEN AND ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION FROM CELLULOSE AND MICROBIAL CHARACTERIZATION IN MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS", "id": "8505", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7008", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    Cellulosic biomass, including waste products of agricultural and industrial activities, is one of the most unused and abundant renewable energy resources in the world. The direct production of hydrogen and electricity from cellulose offers the potential of integrating the treatment of cellulosic waste and the production of clean fuel and power resources. \nThe fermentation of cellulosic materials presents a sustainable means of biohydrogen production, but few studies supplied comparable data on cellulose conversion and hydrogen yield. Six mesophilic Clostridium species were quantitatively characterized in standardized batch experiments using MN301 cellulose, Avicel, and cellobiose. Results showed clostridia varied in H2 production, substrate degradation, biomass accumulation, and fermentation product distribution. Of the species tested, C. cellulolyticum and C. populeti catalyzed the highest H2 production with cellulose, with H2 yields of 1.69 and 1.64 mol H2/mol hexose on MN301 and 1.57 and 1.44 mol H2/mol hexose on Avicel, respectively. This standardized comparison provides a quantitative baseline for improving H2 production from cellulose through medium and process optimization and metabolic engineering.\n    Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) convert biodegradable materials into electricity, potentially contributing to an array of renewable energy production strategies tailored for specific applications. Compared with soluble substrates, cellulose is unique because it requires a microbial consortium that can both metabolize insoluble cellulose from suspension and reduce the insoluble anode. Since no known microorganisms can do both functions, the conversion of cellulosic biomass to electricity requires a synergistic microbial community. Electricity was generated from cellulose in an MFC using a defined coculture of the cellulolytic fermenter Clostridium cellulolyticum and the electrochemically active Geobacter sulfurreducens. In fed-batch tests using two-chamber MFCs, the coculture achieved maximum power densities of 143 mW/m2 (projected anode surface area) and 59.2 mW/m2 from 1 g/L carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and MN301 cellulose, respectively. Neither pure culture alone produced electricity from these substrates. Cellulose conversion to electricity was also demonstrated using an uncharacterized mixed culture from activated sludge, and bioaugmentation was achieved by adding Clostridium to enhance cellulose degradation.\n    The microbial ecology of the defined coculture of C. cellulolyticum and G. sulfurreducens in cellulose-fed, two-chamber MFCs was further analyzed. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed that when particulate MN301 cellulose was used as the sole substrate, most Clostridium cells were found adhered to cellulose particles in suspension, while most Geobacter cells were attached to the electrode. By comparison, both bacteria resided in suspension and biofilm samples when soluble CMC was used. The biofilm in both systems were thin and patchy. This distinct function-related distribution of the bacteria suggests an opportunity to optimize reactor operation by settling cellulose and cellulose-adhered cellulolytic bacteria and decanting supernatant to extend cellulose hydrolysis and improve cellulose-electricity conversion. \n    Microorganisms that have extracellular electron transfer capability are not only important in MFCs, but also have broaden significance in biogeochemical cycles and bioremediation. There is emerging evidence that this capability is phylogenatically widespread, yet the culture collection of these exoelectrogens is rather limited. Conventional dilution-to-extinction techniques for isolating such microorganisms are very labor and time intensive. A simple plate technique using an overlay of insoluble hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) as the electron acceptor was developed to isolate presumed dissimilatory metal reducers, which produce a clear zone in the HFO overlay. Using acetate plus lactate as electron donors, three pure cultures and one coculture were isolated from anaerobic sludge. All of these isolates reduced HFO in liquid culture and also showed electrochemical activity in MFCs, indicating this technique can serve as a surrogate for isolation of electrochemically active bacteria. This technique allowed an alternative way to isolate microorganisms that have extracellular electron transfer capabilities, allowing researchers to increase the available variety of microbial phenotypes.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7005], "author_name_tesi": "Ren, Zhiyong ", "last_name_ssi": "Ren", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhiyong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Regan", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "Fred Scott Cannon", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Peggy Ann Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Regan, Committee Chair", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Member", "Fred Scott Cannon, Committee Member", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microbial Fuel Cell", "Cellulose", "Hydrogen", "Hydrous Ferric Oxide"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Investigation of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Devices", "id": "19223", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9224", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A host of fundamentally and technologically intriguing phenomena can be observed in ferromagnetic systems, ranging from Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) to spin structures that approximate the non-zero entropy state of water ice.  In this dissertation, we consider systems of self-assembled MnAs nanoclusters in a doped GaAs matrix, a magnetically-doped topological insulator material, and magnetotransport devices constructed as artificial spin ices.  We performed magnetic, structural, and electronic measurements in each of the projects herein to discover unique materials properties that range from new phase diagrams to electronic structure breaking and intriguing electrical characteristics that seem to defy the symmetry of the system that manifests them.\n\nWe first explore the impact of co-doping a GaAs semiconductor matrix with magnetic and non-magnetic dopant ions (Mn and Be, respectively) and forcing phase separation to occur during the sample growth stage.  The result of this phase-separated co-doped growth was the identification of two distinct materials classes:  Type I materials, in which the phase separation produces ferromagnetic zinc blende (Mn,Ga)As nanoclusters with a narrow distribution of small diameters within a weakly Be-doped GaAs matrix, and Type II materials, in which an abrupt mixing of large NiAs-type MnAs nanoclusters and the small (Mn,Ga)As nanoclusters occurs.  These two states are shown to also have accessible intermediate states in the case of a doped substrate and buffer layer.  Magnetic measurements are performed to determine the dynamics of the unmixed Type I and the mixed Type II materials.  Structural characterization is done at the nanoscale in a variety of instruments to precisely determine the likely growth dynamics during sample synthesis and the resultant structures.  The materials are found to be superparamagnetic with 10 K (Type I) and approximately 313 K (Type II) blocking temperatures with a strong dependence on Mn content during growth determining the type of material grown.\n\nWe next discuss measurements performed on the magnetically doped topological insulator candidate material Bi2Se3:Mn.  The effects of Mn doping on Bi2Se3 are explored using structural and magnetic characterization techniques and the band structure is probed using Angle-Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy.  The material is determined to be successfully breaking time-reversal symmetry at its surface at least partially due to its suppression of the Dirac node at the gamma point of its band structure.  It also shows an interesting magnetic character wherein the bulk of the material is a low temperature ferromagnet (Tc ~ 5 K) with an in-plane easy axis and the surface exhibits ferromagnetism above 100 K with an out-of-plane easy axis.\n\nThe final project described here concerns an electrically continuous network of permalloy nanowires designed as an artificial spin ice.  We discuss electrical measurements of these cleanroom-fabricated devices and compare the experimental results to micromagnetic simulations.  We are able to successfully model the longitudinal signals seen in experiments through our simulations and also observe transverse signals in both our computations and our experiments.  The latter prove to be more difficult to model computationally but we show through our computational work that the transverse signal may be analyzed in a more simplistic way than previous works have suggested.

These mutations result in elevated nuclear levels of the \u03b2-catenin transcriptional co-activator.  In the nucleus, \u03b2-catenin associates with the T-cell factor/Lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/Lef) family of sequence-specific transcription factors at Wnt-responsive DNA elements (WREs) to increase target gene expression.  Aberrant expression of these genes by oncogenic Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling leads to the formation of small, benign adenomas.  The c-MYC (MYC) proto-oncogene is a direct \u03b2-catenin target gene that is required for Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-mediated intestinal tumorigenesis.  However, the molecular mechanisms underlying \u03b2-catenin regulation of MYC expression are not fully defined.  The work described within this thesis aimed to further define these molecular mechanisms by addressing the involvement of nuclear AXIN2 and the MYC 3\u2019 WRE in controlling oncogenic MYC gene expression.\n\nAXIN2, a scaffolding protein and component of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, was recently demonstrated to localize to the nucleus.  The function of AXIN2 within this subcellular compartment, however, was unknown.  By constitutively localizing AXIN2 to the nucleus, we demonstrate that nuclear AXIN2 forms a complex with \u03b2-catenin/TCF and represses MYC gene expression by binding the MYC gene locus.  These results indicate that nuclear AXIN2 functions as a molecular rheostat to maintain a \u201cjust right\u201d level of MYC necessary for tumorigenesis in CRC.  Similar to nuclear AXIN2, we find that the MYC 3\u2019 WRE, which maps 1.4-kb downstream from the MYC transcription stop site, drives oncogenic MYC gene expression in CRC cells.  Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology, we generated a knockout CRC cell line in which a single TCF binding element within the MYC 3\u2019 WRE was deleted.  Deletion of this element decreased \u03b2-catenin/TCF occupancy at the MYC 3\u2019 WRE and MYC gene expression.  The observed decrease in MYC gene expression corresponded to diminished cellular proliferation and growth of the knockout cells.  Together, our studies have uncovered new mechanisms for regulation of MYC gene expression by oncogenic Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, and suggest that approaches to target nuclear AXIN2 or the MYC 3\u2019 WRE would be effective strategies for the treatment of individuals suffering from CRC.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11340], "author_name_tesi": "Rennoll, Sherri Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Rennoll", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Sherri", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gregory Yochum", "Gregory Yochum", "Laura Carrel", "Sergei A Grigoryev", "Lisa M Shantz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gregory Yochum, Dissertation Advisor", "Gregory Yochum, Committee Chair", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member", "Sergei A Grigoryev, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MYC", "beta-catenin", "AXIN2", "colorectal cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Psychosocial Adjustment to Diabetes: An Integrative Model for Glycemic Control and Quality of Life", "id": "10709", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5211", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "AIM: This study examined relationships among psychosocial predictors of diabetes-specific quality of life (DM-QOL) and glycemic control, through an integrative framework of psychosocial adjustment to chronic illness, which was anchored in the Self-Regulation Model and stress and coping theories.\nMETHODS:  A sample of 111 adults with diabetes (DM), ages 21 to 81, completed questionnaires that measured components of adjustment (illness representations, sense of coherence, psychological distress, chronic illness resources, and obstacles to diabetes management), as well as their quality of life; HbA1c levels were determined by blood samples.  Hierarchical regression analyses tested the association of the adjustment-related variables to glycemic control and DM-QOL. \nRESULTS: DM-QOL was significantly associated with type of DM and illness representations.  Adults with better DM-QOL attributed fewer symptoms to diabetes, believed diabetes to have fewer negative consequences and to be unpredictable/cyclical, and had fewer emotional reactions to their experiences.  The effect of illness representations on DM-QOL was partially mediated by psychological distress. The model significantly explained 69.8% of the variance in DM-QOL, with 49.9% explained by adjustment-related variables.  Better glycemic control was significantly associated with older age, type 2 DM, no insulin use, more comorbid illnesses, and greater use of resources. The model significantly explained 48.7% of the variance in glycemic control, with 33.6% due to demographic and/or disease variables and 15.1% to adjustment-related variables. \nCONCLUSION: The relationships found among psychosocial variables, DM-QOL, and glycemic control supported the framework of adjustment to chronic illness. This approach further clarifies the psychosocial determinants of these two important diabetes outcomes and informs future conceptualizations of diabetes management.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5186], "author_name_tesi": "Renosky, Ronda J.", "last_name_ssi": "Renosky", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Ronda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jan Ulbrecht", "Jan Ulbrecht", "Linda Ann Wray", "Frank Martin Ahern", "Brandon B Hunt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jan Ulbrecht, Dissertation Advisor", "Jan Ulbrecht, Committee Chair", "Linda Ann Wray, Committee Chair", "Frank Martin Ahern, Committee Member", "Brandon B Hunt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["diabetes", "psychosocial adjustment", "quality of life", "glycemic control", "psychosocial adaptation", "sense of coherence"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Direct Object Clitic Placement Preferences in Argentine Child Spanish", "id": "25864", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11414", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines Spanish Direct Object clitic pronouns in Argentine spoken Spanish of adults and children (ages 4;0-7;0). It concentrates on (Finite verb + Nonfinite verb) constructions that allow both pre-verbal (Proclisis) and a postverbal (Enclisis) clitic placement. Previous corpus studies have shown that lexical (finite verb), semantic (animacy of the referent), and discourse (topicality) factors constrain variable clitic placement. A corpus study of Argentine Spanish shows that, in agreement with previous research, clitic placement is lexically conditioned in the first place (whereas some finite verbs favor Enclisis, other disfavor it). Additionally, inanimate and low-topicality referents favor Enclisis. This corpus study is used to test the grammaticalization accounts which hypothesize that more grammaticalized and frequent finite verbs should disfavor Enclisis. A construction which meets the two requirements but which still favors Enclisis (tener que \u2018have to\u2019) is identified. Drawing on measures of relative frequency and assuming cummulative knowledge of contexts of use, a tentative proposal to account for the distribution of Enclisis in tener que is put forward and tested with the most frequent verbs. The results suggest that speakers\u2019 knowledge of relative frequencies of use of verbs could inform clitic placement in variable contexts. In the second section, two versions of an Elicited Imitation (EI) task and two Elicited Production (EP) tasks test children\u2019s use of clitics in variable structures with three frequent verbs in order to explore if children displayed evidence of the strongest constraints reported for the adults (i.e. lexical and semantic). The results of the EI tasks show that accuracy increases in Proclisis compared to Enclisis. Crucially, finite verb and animacy of the referent have a significant effect on inaccurate imitations consisting of repositioning clitics. The results of the EP tasks also show evidence for finite verb and animacy of the referent impacting particpants\u2019 responses.

These tasks were performed using different numbers of instructed fingers, a subset of which were subjected to transient spatial perturbations. Subjects utilized visual feedback to produce a constant target force with index, index and middle, index, middle, and ring, and all four fingers; after reaching this target force, the visual feedback was removed and the subjects were instructed \u201cdo not interfere\u201d while their index fingers (and, in some conditions, ring fingers) were perturbed by the \u201cinverse piano\u201d apparatus. Results were analyzed in the space of finger forces as well as hypothetical finger commands (modes), which reflect the inter-dependence of force production by each digit (enslaving). The main results were: (1) Inter-trial variance during steady states, in the space of modes and forces, was higher in directions which did not affect total force production (within the uncontrolled manifold or UCM); (2) Perturbations resulted in large deviations of finger forces and modes within the UCM (i.e. large motor equivalent, or ME, displacements were observed); (3) Deviations in forces and modes resulting from the perturbation showed larger variances within the UCM. Strikingly, no significant effect of the number of fingers involved was seen for any condition, including the single-finger condition, despite the apparent differences in system redundancy in each condition. Together, these results suggest that all tasks carried out with the whole hand are effectively four-finger tasks with only quantitative differences in the involvement of instructed and non-instructed fingers. Additionally, high volatility of enslaving was observed as a result of transient perturbations, which led to significantly higher enslaving in certain conditions.

The stability of our actions guaranteed by the healthy central nervous systems (CNS) is therefore a highly informative object of study. This dissertation investigates effects of various modalities of sensory feedback on the stability of isometric multi-finger action through a number of experiments which alter various combinations of sensory modalities. Stability of action is quantified using across-trials variance analysis techniques in the space of performance variables which subjects were instructed to maintain, which include (for different experiments) total force produced by the fingers, computed moment of force produced by the fingers, and relative contribution to total force for various fingers. In addition, stability of multi-finger action is quantified in the space of theoretical control variables relating to the coordinated spatial activation patterns of muscles which result in referent coordinates and apparent stiffnesses quantifiable for individual fingers and the hand as a whole. These latter variables are assessed both in terms of their effects on performance variables (descending synergies) as well as their situation in an assumed hierarchy of control (ascending synergies). Visual feedback on salient performance variables exerts a strong influence on the stability of action quantified at a task level, while manipulations of other feedback modalities are seen primarily when visual feedback is not available. Despite the effects of visual feedback at the task level, synergies in the space of control variables showed less modulation during visual manipulations and some ascending synergies even increased when visual feedback was removed. Together, these results reflect the high specificity of CNS in stabilizing certain aspects of task performance and suggest that such behaviors come about by altering inter-finger coordination without modifying certain basic aspects of the control of individual fingers.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16350], "author_name_tesi": "Reschechtko, Sasha ", "last_name_ssi": "Reschechtko", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sasha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Latash", "Mark Latash", "Robert L Sainburg", "Jonas Rubenson", "Andris Freivalds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Latash, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Latash, Committee Chair", "Robert L Sainburg, Committee Member", "Jonas Rubenson, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Motor Control", "Multi-Finger Coordination", "Sensory Feedback", "Isometric Force Production", "Uncontrolled Manifold Hypothesis", "Referent Configuration Hypothesis", "Synergy"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Immunization and vitamin A status as factors modulating an invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced lung and a non-invasive Citrobacter rodentium gut infection in mice", "id": "16176", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8048", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vitamin A (VA) is necessary for healthy immune function, as deficient populations have greater incidence of all cause mortality. Pneumococcal pneumonia disease claims millions of lives annually and occurs when gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae, a commensal of the nasopharyngeal tract, turns pathogenic and invades the lungs. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli are also responsible for significant global morbidity and mortality. Citrobacter rodentium is a gram-negative bacterium that is closely related to these strains of E. coli and is a natural mouse pathogen, causing non-invasive infection in the large bowel. VA status in human populations, as measured by serum retinol, decreases during active infection. VA status alterations have not been elucidated in animal models of invasive and non-invasive bacterial infection. \n\tAlthough there are over 90 different serotypes of S. pneumoniae, each with a unique capsular polysaccharide, the current approved immunizations target the capsule type in order to create immunogenicity. The polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (PCV7), Prevenar\u00a9 manufactured by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and the 23-polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23-PPV), Pneumovax\u00a9 manufactured by Merck protects against serotypes included in the vaccine, but once carriage decreases in the population, new serotypes become common and problematic. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the effects that adjuvants and VA status have on the outcome of pneumonia disease through the utilization of animal models. We hypothesize that VA deficiency will cause more severe pneumonia disease due to the inability of VAD mice to make protective primary antibodies and a loss of lung epithelial integrity that is characteristic in VA deficient animals. Additionally, we hypothesize that VAD mice will have more severe C. rodentium-induced gut infection owing to decreased lymphocyte homing to the gut and a loss of gut epithelial integrity.  \n\tIn the second chapter, I describe the pneumococcal pneumonia model used to study disease in the acute and resolution phases of infection. Mice were inoculated intranasally with virulent S pneumoniae serotype (ST) 3, with and without prior immunization with pneumococcal polysaccharide ST 3 (PPS3), or co-immunization with PPS3 and with a low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Primary PPS3 specific antibody production was upregulated in PPS3-immunized mice, which coincided with decreased bacterial recovery the lung and blood at 24 and 48 h post inoculation (p.i.) and increased survival. Microarray analysis of whole lung RNA revealed significant changes in the acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) between non-infected and infected mice, which were attenuated by immunization. SAA transcripts were higher in the liver and lungs of infected controls, and SAA protein was elevated in serum, but decreased in PPS3-immunized mice. A murine model of virulent pneumonia rescued by immunization with PPS3 and LPS, is described, which significantly decreased lung bacterial burden and systemic dissemination, thus promoting resolution of an otherwise deadly infection.\nIn the third chapter, pneumonia infection during VA deficiency was evaluated at 2 days p.i. with S. pneumoniae ST 3 in vitamin A adequate (VAA), vitamin A deficient (VAD), and vitamin A deficient mice repleted with an oral supplement of retinyl palmitate (VAD + S) or retinoic acid (VAD + RA) diet groups; mice were immunized with PPS3 or vehicle PBS control. Immunization with PPS3 increased serum IgM levels in VAA, VAD and VAD + S diet groups at 2 days p.i., which was protective against systemic infection as VAD and VAD + S immunized groups had less bacteremia in comparison to infected controls. Additionally, vehicle-immunized infected VAD mice displayed upregulated hepatic Saa1 gene expression in comparison to non-infected mice, further supporting the potential use of SAA as a biomarker of pneumonia severity. Mouse VA status does not affect pneumococcal polysaccharide immunization efficacy or the severity of a virulent pneumonia infection.  \n\tIn the fourth chapter, the role of VA status in relation to infection outcome was investigated in a non-invasive gut infection. VAD, VAD + RA or VAA mice were inoculated with C. rodentium by oral gavage and monitored throughout primary and secondary infection. Greater bacterial shedding was observed at day 23 p.i. in VAD mice in comparison to VAD + RA mice, but conversely, VAD mice had lower shedding on the first day of secondary infection in comparison to VAA mice. Serum and lung retinol and lung retinyl esters decreased at the peak of infection in comparison to non-infected controls. Liver retinol decreased at the peak and remained depressed after infection, while retinyl ester stores increased after clearance of infection. Although mucin mRNA expression decreased during the peak of infection, no difference between diet groups was observed in colon by histopathological analysis. In a mouse model of enteropathogenic gut infection, VA status does not affect infection outcome, but rather, the infection alters VA status in VAA mice. \n\tThis dissertation has three focal points: 1) the development of a viable model of virulent murine pneumonia infection by immunization, 2) the assessment of the severity of invasive lung and non-invasive gut infection during VA deficiency, 3) the evaluation of VA status alterations during lung and gut bacterial infection. Although adequate VA status does not influence infection severity, VA status alterations were observed in response to pneumococcal pneumonia and gut infection.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7993], "author_name_tesi": "Restori, Katherine Hritz", "last_name_ssi": "Restori", "middle_name_ssi": "Hritz", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Michael Henry Green", "Mary J Kennett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross, Dissertation Advisor", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Chair", "Michael Henry Green, Committee Member", "Mary J Kennett, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Immunization", "Vitamin A", "Pneumonia infection", "gut infection"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Public Perceptions of Spatial Analogs for Climate Change: A Survey of Centre Region, Pennsylvania Residents\n", "id": "12083", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1533", "abstract_tesi": "People discount projected impacts of climate change that they see as spatially or temporally remote.

Using an interactive map of sea level rise in Sarasota, Florida and an accompanying online survey, it considers how college students from nearby and far away from Sarasota, and with different views about climate change, vary in: 1) their ability to read information about sea level rise flooding from the map; and 2) their risk perceptions for this flooding.

In Cameroon, the P and S wave velocity structure of the upper mantle and transition zone discontinuities, imaged using body wave tomography and receiver function analysis, reveal a linear, low velocity anomaly \nin the upper mantle that extends to at least 300 km but does not extend to mantle transition zone depths. Temperatures within the anomalous mantle, inferred from the tomographic models, are \n&#8764;280-560 K higher than normal. These results \nsuggest that the Cameroon Volcanic Line is caused by a linear, tabular thermal upwelling in the mantle, possibly related to eddy-&#64258;ow edge-convection induced by temperature differences between colder and thicker lithosphere of the Archean Congo Craton and the thinner lithosphere of the Proterozoic mobile belt north of the craton. The results of this study are not consistent with the formation of \nthe Cameroon Volcanic Line by a plume or decompression melting associated with thinned lithosphere.

Since the 1950\u2019s, ship builders have investigated the use of thermal forming as a flexible and cost-effective replacement for rolling, blacksmithing, and creep forming. Thermal forming involves the application of heat in order to generate permanent plastic strains in sheet or plate to produce the desired shape. Historically, the heating pattern, or location of the heat lines, has been determined by skilled artisans employing heuristic rules and experience. \n\nAutomated determination heating paths that will generate the deformations required to produce a desired shape is a complex task.  A critical aspect of such a system is that it must be able to predict the deformation resulting from a prescribed heat path.  To produce a desired shape, an automated thermal forming system must also incorporate an algorithm that can determine the location and parameters of heat lines that will generate the required curvature. \n\nTo provide fast and robust solutions to each of these problems, the following approach has been taken:\n\n1. Develop and demonstrate an automated iterative thermal forming algorithm, loosely based on conventional manual techniques, that relies on simple empirical relations and sensor feedback to determine heat paths necessary to form a desired shape,\n\n2.

The primary addictive ingredient in cigarettes is nicotine, and smokers smoke to self-administer nicotine (CDC, 2001b).  Additionally, adolescents consume ethanol more than any other drug of abuse, and binge drinking among teens has become increasingly popular over the years (CASA, 2011; SAMHSA, 2002).  Adolescents abuse tobacco and ethanol more than any other combination of illicit drugs and females are particularly vulnerable use of these drugs (Bobo & Husten, 2000; Denning et al., 2013). \nNicotine and ethanol activate the mesolimbic dopamine pathway and increase synaptic dopamine levels in the NAc (Blomqvist et al., 1997; Corrigall et al., 1994).  Although the mechanisms are different, both substances stimulate nAChRs on DA neurons in the VTA (Jones et al., 1999; Soderpalm et al., 2000).  Because of the way in which these drugs of abuse activate the reward pathway, chronic exposure to nicotine and ethanol can result in neurobiological alterations that may lead to disordered behaviors.  This is especially true for adolescent females as they undergo extensive psychological development and gross neuroanatomical changes during this period and are prone to use of these two drugs, respectively (Spear, 2000a). \nThe purpose of this dissertation was to 1) examine the effects of nicotine exposure on subsequent binge ethanol drinking behavior and blood ethanol concentration in adolescent female C57BL/6J mice and 2) use autoradiography to examine density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes in different reward pathway regions that may drive any changes seen in binge ethanol consumption between nicotine exposed mice and control mice. All mice (N= 38) had access to 3 drinking bottles for 7 days and each mouse was placed 1 of 3 nicotine conditions: water only, choice nicotine, or forced nicotine.  At the end of 7-day treatment period, mice were exposed to a 4-day drinking in the dark (DID) protocol.  Results from this study found that adolescent mice exposed to high concentrations of nicotine (i.e., forced nicotine mice) consumed a significantly higher ethanol consumption (g/kg) and displayed higher BECs than control mice.   \nAutodradiography was then used in a subset of the first experiment\u2019s mouse brains to examine the neurobiological underpinnings of increased ethanol consumption by investigating nAChR density in regions of the reward pathway in mice exposed to nicotine compared to control mice.  Using 4 different radiolabeled isotopes, results from this experiment found that exposure to high concentrations of nicotine increased \uf061\uf034\uf062\uf032\uf020nAChR expression in frontal, orbitofrontal, outer, and inner cortices.  These results suggest that nicotine exposure may induce increases in binge ethanol consumption through alterations in nAChRs activated reward-based decision making pathways in cortical regions.  Additionally, BEC was a significant predictor of \uf061\uf037\uf020nAChRs in the cingulate cortex, striatum, and dorsal tegmental area.  Thus, ethanol exposure may modulate firing of the reward pathway through stimulation of these receptor types.\nOverall, findings from this dissertation study support the hypothesis that exposure to high levels of nicotine during adolescence may increase subsequent binge ethanol consumption through increased nAChR density in higher functioning brain regions in female C57BL/6J mice, and these changes may ultimately enhance activation of the reward pathway.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9774], "author_name_tesi": "Revitsky, Alicia Rose", "last_name_ssi": "Revitsky", "middle_name_ssi": "Rose", "first_name_ssi": "Alicia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Laura Klein", "Laura Klein", "Byron C Jones", "Helen Kamens", "David John Vandenbergh", "Stephen Jeffrey Wilson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Laura Klein, Dissertation Advisor", "Laura Klein, Committee Chair", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member", "Helen Kamens, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member", "Stephen Jeffrey Wilson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nicotine", "Ethanol", "Adolescence", "Reward Pathway", "Mice"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Left Out of the Equation: Older Immigrants and Health Insurance Coverage", "id": "15461", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7844", "abstract_tesi": "The older immigrant population has increased from 2.7 million in 1990 to 4.6 million in 2010 (US Census).

Specifically, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 redefined eligibility for public programs by citizenship status.

Rather than limit analysis to coverage at one point in time, I use discrete-time hazard models to examine how health insurance coverage and changes in coverage are related to immigration status and factors that distinguish a heterogeneous immigrant population. \nResults suggest that immigrants are less likely than native-born to have health insurance at first observation, with immigrants from Latin America being least likely to be covered.  Older immigrants are less likely to gain coverage and more likely to lose the coverage they have during a two to four year period of observation.

To entice potential teachers other than through pay, the national government has traditionally provided high levels of job security for teachers. Financial bonuses for teachers to work in rural, remote, and often isolated regions of the country are often used as incentives. Such strategies for enticing teachers to the profession have been highly effective at filling teaching positions in schools around the country. Coupled with investment in schoolhouse construction, these efforts have allowed even the most rural and remote students to attend public school. Indeed, Peru had achieved nearly universal school enrollment, regardless of a students\u00b4 gender, socio-economic status, or place of residence by the early 2000s. However, providing access to schooling for Peru\u2019s children has not translated into improved student learning outcomes. Despite high enrollment, student examinations reveal stark inequalities in student achievement, particularly between rural and urban areas. To improve education quality, the Peruvian government passed the Teacher Career Law in 2012, aiming to improve student learning outcomes by targeting teacher performance. However, this law effectively curtails teachers\u2019 employment stability by substituting job security with a compensation scheme based on performance evaluations that foster competition among teachers. While academic studies have focused on the shortcomings of teacher training, teachers\u2019 motivations for entering the career, and teachers\u2019 school placement policies, little is known about teacher perceptions associated with the changes introduced by this law. It is important to understand teacher perceptions because their compliance and understanding of the law will determine its ability to affect student learning outcomes. This study fills this gap by shedding light on how teachers in urban and rural areas perceive this law, how it might shape their roles as teachers, whether there are differences between urban and rural teacher perceptions, and the factors that motivate teachers. Identifying the factors that motivate teachers is important for understanding whether the 2012 Career Law offers incentives that teachers themselves identify as effectively increasing educational quality and student learning outcomes. Based on qualitative fieldwork conducted with 70 teachers in Cajamarca, the findings of this study show that few teachers perceive that the 2012 Teacher Career Law will increase educational quality or improve learning outcomes for students. Furthermore, the study identifies how teachers perceive their roles as teachers, their motivations for entering the profession, and finds variation in rural and urban teachers\u2019 perceptions of the law. From a policy perspective, this study provides insights into how to better evaluate and incentivize teachers to improve their performance in the classroom.

This decline may be especially critical for adolescent girls, given the\nlong-term implications of reduced calcium and vitamin D intake. Roughly 35-40% of children\u2019s\ndaily nutritional needs are met at school, thereby suggesting that a healthy school food\nenvironment is crucial to encourage healthy eating habits (Larson, Story et al. 2006). Recent\nchanges to the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) nutritional standards limit flavoring to\nonly skim milk and calories to 150 per serving (7 CFR 210.21). While the nutritional standards do\nnot specifically restrict added sugars, sugar content cannot exceed 20 g/serving without\nsurpassing the calorie limit. While evidence suggests recent reformulation of flavored milks has\nnot resulted in a further drop in milk intake, these reformulations have also failed to increase fluid\nmilk intake (Yon and Johnson 2015).\nTo remedy this, we optimized flavored milks using novel blends of nutritive and\nnonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) to increase sweetness while minimizing adding sugars and thus\ncalories. Extant data suggest children prefer sweeter solutions than do adults, with optimum\nsweetness around 19.2% \u00b1 0.7% (w/v) sucrose (e.g., (Pepino and Mennella 2005), and focus\ngroups with children in grades 5-7 (n = 72) found \u2018taste\u2019 was the main determinant for whether or\nnot they would consume any beverage (Henry 2015). While some prior work has explored\nconsumption and waste related to NSLP reformulated milk (Yon and Johnson 2013, Yon and\nJohnson 2015), there is currently a knowledge gap in the literature regarding hedonic testing of\nthe reformulated flavored milks. We aim to address this gap here.\nWe recently tested a wide range of approved sweeteners to quantify potential synergy\nusing the response surface methodology from pharmacology (Berenbaum 1985, Suhnel 1992),\nand successfully identified novel combinations that exhibit true synergy. Understanding the \nv\nperceived intensity of blends can help product developers reduce caloric content of foods and\nbeverages, especially when using NNS. Finding sweetener pairs that elicit the same level of\nsweetness can help reduce ingredient usage, thereby reducing total calories and undesirable side\ntastes associated with NNS such as bitter and metallic sensations (Allen, McGeary et al. 2013,\nAntenucci and Hayes 2015).\n Because of increasing consumer desire for products that deliver great taste with fewer\ncalories, the commercial demand for improved zero- and reduced-calorie sweetener technologies\nwill continue. NNS generally differ in taste from bulk nutritive sweeteners (e.g. sucrose) in the\nfollowing ways: lower maximal intensity, undesirable side tastes, slower rates of onset, and\npersistence of sweetness (i.e., linger) (DuBois 2011). We investigated these qualities in sucrose\nand in NNS using a novel method called temporal check-all-that-apply (TCATA) to identify\nstrategies for overcoming these sensory profile issues. Using TCATA, we were able to\ncharacterize the temporal taste and flavor profiles of commercially relevant NNS.\nUse of NNS potentially raises the issue of negative consumer beliefs and attitudes that\nlikely influence intake, independent of scientific data on their safety. Accordingly, we\ninvestigated such beliefs using conjoint analysis in girls aged 12-19. Girls (n>400) were recruited\nnationally for an online study; they rated preference of various attributes, including milk flavor,\nsweetener type, added sugar content, caloric content, and messaging, prior to answering 21\nchoice-based conjoint (CBC) tasks. For each CBC task, girls evaluated 5 full profile choice sets\nand were told to choose which set they preferred. They then completed questionnaires on eating\nbehavior, NNS attitudes, and demographics to provide additional insights into underlying\nmotivations for their choices. From this study, we have gained insight into the ingredients,\nnutrient information, and messaging that is salient teenage girls, which can be used to formulate\nflavored milks that will most appeal to this nutritionally vulnerable population. \nvi\nAccordingly, we propose to leverage the insight gained from our previous synergy,\nTCATA, and conjoint studies to formulate flavored milks that a) have high acceptability, b) low\nenergy density, and c) meet NSLP guidelines. The overall objective of our project is to a develop\nlower calorie chocolate milk for the NSLP that is highly acceptable to adolescent girls.\nFlavored milks were formulated using a three-component mixture design with varying\nlevels of sucrose, stevia, and cocoa. Participants (n = 112) evaluated these milks for overall liking\nand attribute intensity; the most liked sample was then used for the paired preference study\nconducted in Bald Eagle Area Middle and High School. Participants (n = 161) were given 2 oz\naliquots of milk and asked which sample she preferred.

When enzymes required for biosynthesis of HSPGs are inhibited through mutations of RNA interference, a variety of morphological and electrophysiological defects are observed at the NMJ. These defects included changes in the post-synaptic specialization of the muscle (the SSR), loss of mitochondria from the sub-synaptic cytosol, and abnormal mitochondrial morphology. Identification of autophagic regulation as the mechanism by which HSPGs influenced synaptic properties was the foundation of this dissertation.\nThe present work more fully characterizes the influence of HSPG function on autophagic markers in muscle tissue. Confocal microscopic and Western blot analysis of both endogenous proteins and ectopically expressed reporter constructs was used to assess the level of autophagic degradation in muscle tissue. RNA inhibition of sfl and ttv, two HS biosynthetic enzymes, influenced these measures of autophagy in a direction that indicated an overall increase in autophagic flux.\nHSPGs are ubiquitously expressed, and have a variety of critical functions throughout the organism. Similarly, autophagy is a globally important catabolic pathway. To better understand the significance of this novel regulatory role for HSPGs, we extended our analysis into a second tissue. Drosophila fat body tissue is an energetically sensitive tissue in which autophagy is commonly studied. Using many of the same assays, we identified a similar increase in autophagy in response to HSPG biosynthetic inhibition that was non-cell autonomous.\nWhile autophagy is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis throughout the organism, certain cell types are more reliant on this pathway than others. Neurons are one such autophagy sensitive cell type, and failure of neuronal autophagy is closely associated with neurodegenerative disease. When HSPGs were inhibited in the brain of adult flies, an increase in autophagic degradation was once again identified. This increase in autophagy protected against the accumulation of oxidant-damaged cellular components after environmental exposure to hydrogen peroxide, and reduced neuronal death in a model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These findings indicate that the regulation of autophagy by HSPGs is of high clinical relevance to human health.\nThis thesis also describes an attempt to develop a Drosophila behavioral assessment protocol intended to provide biological validation of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) candidate genes. Sequencing and microarray analysis of individuals with Autism spectrum disorders has implicated an overwhelmingly large pool of candidate genes. Thorough assessment of the functional contributions of these genes to neurobehavioral development in model organisms is most drastically hindered by the generally low rate of recurrence in genetic changes affecting each candidate gene.\nBehavioral screening in the inexpensive and genetically facile model D. melanogaster was attempted using RNA interference (RNAi) to model genetic changes associated with human ASD and identify high-throughput behavioral methods suitable for providing the lacking biological validation for these genetic models. Three behavioral methods were selected based on their compatibility and straightforwardness, with consideration for evidence of previous successful use in established fly models of Autism. While the pilot run of this study was able to identify a few phenotypes of potential interest, the majority of the data indicated that these methods were not well-suited to the use of RNAi.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15733], "author_name_tesi": "Reynolds, Claire Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Reynolds", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Claire", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott Brian Selleck", "Scott Brian Selleck", "Joseph C.

The urgency of these efforts is apparent when we think about the limited amount of oil and fossil fuel combined with the rapid increase of the world\u2019s population, and even more rapid increase in energy demand. An additional advantage of using renewable sources for energy production is the associated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. With biomass, the oxidation of organic matter will produce carbon dioxide, a natural product that can be fed back into the natural carbon cycle and converted back into more biomass through photosynthesis. \nElectricity can be directly generated by bacteria in microbial fuel cells (MFC) from a variety of biodegradable substrates, including cellulose. Biomass that contains complex and simple carbohydrates is widely available, so the use of MFCs to produce electricity from these sources is potentially very promising. The limited study on using complex biomass in an MFC is mainly due to the low degradation rate of these materials. \nA sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC) produces electricity through the bacterial oxidation of organic matter contained in the sediment. The power density is limited, however, due in part to the low organic matter content of most marine sediments. To increase power generation from these devices particulate substrates were added to the anode compartment. Three materials were tested:  two commercially available chitin products differing in particle size and biodegradability (Chitin 20 and Chitin 80), and cellulose powder. Maximum power densities using chitin in this substrate enhanced sediment MFC (SEM) were 76 \u00b1 25 mW/m2  and 84 \u00b1 10 mW/m2 (normalized to cathode projected surface area) for Chitin 20 and Chitin 80, respectively, versus less than 2 mW/m2 for an unamended control. Power generation over a 10-day period averaged 64 \u00b1 27 mW/m2 (Chitin 20) and 76 \u00b1 15 mW/m2 (Chitin 80). With cellulose, a similar maximum power was initially generated (83 \u00b1 3 mW/m2), but power rapidly decreased after only 20 hours. Maximum power densities over the next 5 days varied substantially among replicate cellulose-fed reactors, ranging from 29 \u00b1 12 to 62 \u00b1 23 mW/m2. These results suggest a new approach to power generation in remote areas based on the use of particulate substrates. While the longevity of the SEM was relatively short in these studies, it will be possible to increase operation times by controlling particle size, mass, and type of material needed to achieve desired power levels that could theoretically be sustained over periods of years or even decades.\nI examined the effect of three different chitin particle sizes on MFC power generation and longevity. The results demonstrated that an increase in particle diameter from the smallest (0.28 mm) to largest (0.78 mm) size tested resulted in an increase in longevity from 9 to 35 days. Coulombic efficiency based on removal of chitin was also increased from 18% for the smallest particles to 56% for the largest ones. However, the maximum power generation was lower for large particles (201 mW/m2) as compared to the small and medium size (0.46 mm) (301 and 285 mW/m2). Measured MFC longevity was explained by the fractal particle degradation model a mass transfer equation. \nCellulases are used to achieve rapid conversion of cellulose to sugar for ethanol production, but these enzymes have not been previously tested for their effectiveness in MFCs. It was not known if cellulases would remain active in an MFC in the presence of exoelectrogenic bacteria or if enzymes might hinder power production by adversely affecting the bacteria. Electricity generation from cellulose was therefore examined in two-chamber MFCs in the presence and absence of cellulases. The maximum power density with enzymes and cellulose was 100 \u00b1 7 mW/m2 (0.6 \u00b1 0.04 W/m3), compared to only 12 \u00b1 0.6 mW/m2 (0.06 \u00b1 0.003 W/m3) in the absence of the enzymes. This power density was comparable to that achieved in the same system using glucose (102 \u00b1 7 mW/m2, 0.56 \u00b1 0.038 W/m3) suggesting that the enzyme successfully hydrolyzed cellulose and did not otherwise inhibit electricity production by the bacteria. The addition of the enzyme doubled the Coulombic efficiency (CE) to CE=51% and increased COD removal to 73%, likely as a result of rapid hydrolysis of cellulose in the reactor and biodegradation of the enzyme. These results demonstrate that cellulases do not adversely affect exoelectrogenic bacteria that produce power in an MFC, and that the use of these enzymes can increase power densities and reactor performance.\nWhen cellulose is used as the substrate, electricity generation requires a microbial community with both cellulolytic and exoelectrogenic activity. This was not previously demonstrated in pure culture without the provision of an exogenous mediator. Using a specially designed U-tube MFC, I enriched a consortium of exoelectrogenic bacteria capable of using cellulose as the sole electron donor. After 19 dilution-to-extinction serial transfers of the consortium, 16S rRNA gene-based community analysis using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and band sequencing revealed that the dominant bacterium was Enterobacter cloacae. An isolate designated E. cloacae FR from this enrichment was found to be 100% identical to the type strain Enterobacter cloacae 13047 based on partial 16S rRNA sequence. In polarization tests using the U-tube MFC and cellulose as a substrate, strain FR produced 4.9 \u00b1 0.01 mW/m2 compared to 5.4 \u00b1 0.3 mW/m2 for strain 13047. These results demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to generate electricity from cellulose using a single bacterial strain without the need for exogenous mediators. \nIn order to use cellulosic feedstocks like switchgrass that will be annually harvested, there needs to be a low-cost method for their storage year round. Ensilage was previously shown to have potential as a low-cost method for corn stover storage as well as simple pretreatment prior to ethanol production. Before using ensiled feedstock for ethanol fermentation with pH neutral microorganisms, the organic acids that were generated during ensilage will need to be removed or neutralized. Production of organic acid during ensilage was previously modeled for different crops. In this research, the model was used to predict the organic acid generation during ensilage of switchgrass.  Observed data was highly correlated with predicted values (r>0.85). While these organic acids are problematic for fermentation, they are a potentially valuable byproduct. Conversion of these acids to electricity in a microbial fuel cell was analyzed as one such alternative. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1962], "author_name_tesi": "Rezaei, Farzaneh ", "last_name_ssi": "Rezaei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Farzaneh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Tom Richard", "Thomas Lehman Richard", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "Ali Demirci", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Tom Richard, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Lehman Richard, Committee Chair", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Chair", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biofuel", "complex biomass", "Microbial fuel cells", "cellulose"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Essays on Optimal Feasible Taxation", "id": "6365", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "870", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the first essay, we study the following question: If the provision of public good is financed by property (wealth or endowment) taxes,\nwhat is the optimal tax mechanism when agents have private information about his own endowment?\nEmploying the state-dependent implementation model, under incentive compatibility and feasibility constraints, we provide the full characterization of an optimal tax mechanism with two agents and its properties.

In addition, mothers\u2019 postpartum mood problems such as depression and anxiety, which have been known to be associated with postpartum sleep deprivation and disruptions, have been found to have negative influences on mothers\u2019 early parenting quality.  To date, few studies have examined longitudinal links between parental sleep, mood, and parenting in early infancy, and in particular studies that focus on both level and dynamics of parental daily mood in relation to sleep and parenting in early infancy are non-existent. Especially, mothers\u2019 daily mood volatility may reflect an underlying self-regulatory capacity that may be predictive of parenting competence. This dissertation aimed to elucidate the daily associations between parental sleep and maternal mood (Study I), and the predictive linkages of maternal daily mood dynamics to early parenting quality, with particular attention on the emotional quality of parenting during infants\u2019 bedtimes (Study II). \nData for both studies were drawn from a larger NIH-funded study of 167 families (Project SIESTA, R01HD052809). Study I used actigraphy assessments of parental sleep and daily diary data for maternal mood in multilevel modeling to examine how both mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 daily sleep and mothers\u2019 daily mood were associated across 21 days of infants\u2019 first six months. Fathers\u2019 and mothers\u2019 greater sleep efficiency, mothers\u2019 longer sleep duration, and less sleep fragmentation during the previous night predicted better maternal mood the following day. Furthermore, mothers\u2019 overall distress, in addition to its negative direct effect on their daily mood, moderated the daily link between parental sleep and maternal mood. More distressed mothers tended to report significantly worse mood than less distressed mothers, even on days when they had less fragmented sleep and when fathers slept longer the night before. Study II used multilevel modeling to explore how dynamics of mothers\u2019 daily mood, within-person variability as well as level of daily mood, were associated with maternal bedtime EA across infants\u2019 first six months, after controlling for the effects of daily sleep dynamics.

Recently, executive function (EF) skills, a set of inter-related abilities used in coordinated, goal-directed behavior, have been highlighted as integral components of young children\u2019s growing competence. However, very little is known about the role children\u2019s early context and experiences within the family play in the emergence of EF skills. The goal of the present study was to examine how demographic and familial risks at 2 and 6 months related to EF competence at 36 months in a large, diverse sample of primarily low-income, non-urban families from Pennsylvania and North Carolina. This study used an innovative person-centered methodological approach, latent class analysis (LCA), to model profiles of infants\u2019 home environment in order to: 1) better understand how various combinations of ecological risks predicted future EF skills, and 2) more accurately identify sub-groups of young children who were most at-risk for EF deficits. Given the diversity within our sample, we also explored how these associations varied across ethnic groups.\nResults showed that the following six ecological risk profiles best captured the diverse experiences of these families: 1) Married, Low Risk, 2) Married, Stressed & Depressed, 3) Poor & Married, 4) Poor & Unmarried, 5) Poor & Single, and 6) Poor, Single, Multi-Problem. Membership in the early risk profiles was meaningfully associated with EF skills at 36 months. Specifically, profiles characterized by poor, unmarried mothers were at the highest risk for future EF problems. Mediation analyses revealed that much of the influence of early demographic and familial risks on later EF skills may be transmitted through low parental sensitivity and responsiveness to their children during infancy and children\u2019s emerging language skills during toddlerhood. However, important differences across ethnic groups were found for some mediators, including maternal negative intrusiveness and children\u2019s language skills.\niv\nThe findings suggest that the early home environment may prove to be an especially fruitful context for the promotion of future EF skills. Additionally, positive parenting behaviors, including positive engagement and responsivity, should be emphasized and targeted to families that are poor and having an unmarried caregiver.

On average, a one-percentage point increase in ROA increases the CEO\u2019s cash compensation by 3.6 percent.

Specific musical features evocative of ancient eras appear throughout his works, suggesting that the conception of an idealized past was a significant part of his aesthetic. In fact, Debussy was a pivotal participant in a larger cultural fascination with all things ancient that began in the last half of the 1800s. Sparked by a sharp increase in archaeological discoveries and further fueled by widespread disillusionment with the new industrial society, the ancient world became a popular setting for fantasies of a lost paradise. Archaic settings became vehicles for the collective imagination to project various commentaries on modern society, thus allowing for controversial and forbidden subjects to be approached under the guise of \u201chistory.\u201d Thus, the portrayals of the ancient world in the late 19th century did not depict true history, but rather a highly romanticized version of the past that represented a longing for simpler times. \nThis particular aspect of Debussy\u2019s musical personality found its most convincing voice through Pierre Lou\u00ffs\u2019 poetry about a fictional Greek poetess named Bilitis. Throughout his career, Debussy composed a number of works based on these poems: the vocal work Trois chansons de Bilitis in 1897-98, incidental music for the performance of the poetry in 1901, and the piano duet Six \u00e9pigraphes antiques in 1914. Debussy\u2019s writings reveal that he was acquainted with the character of Bilitis as early as 1894, with evidence suggesting that she may have influenced the well-known orchestral composition, Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune.\nDebussy\u2019s continual return to Lou\u00ffs\u2019 poems during a twenty-year time span suggests that Bilitis served as a mythical muse that inspired his musical nostalgia. Her influence can be found in numerous instrumental compositions that evoke a similar archaic mysticism yet have no text from which to derive meaning\u2014the \u201cancient\u201d subtext is communicated entirely by a set of compositional features that have established associations with a particular conception of the past. Specifically, I have identified three categories of intervallic, melodic, harmonic, and textural features that form a particular compositional idiom that I have labeled as Debussy\u2019s \u201cAncient Persona.\u201d These features draw upon and add to the musical conventions associated with antiquity that were established by his predecessors and comprise a significant aspect of Debussy\u2019s overall compositional style. In that respect, Debussy\u2019s musical aesthetic can be viewed as having a symbiotic relationship with its historical context: it shaped his vision as much as he contributed to it.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10816], "author_name_tesi": "Rhodes, Kristen Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Rhodes", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Kristen", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Music Theory and History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Taylor Aitken Greer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Taylor Aitken Greer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Claude Debussy", "Bilitis", "Trois Chansons de Bilitis", "Canope", "Ancient Greek music"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Diversity and Coping Mechanisms of Life Inhabiting the Hypersaline Dead Sea\n", "id": "12464", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4105", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Salinity has been shown to be a highly important determinant in microbial community composition.  Consequently the mechanisms and genes that allow microorganisms to cope with salinity are fundamental for understanding microbial biogeography and evolution.  At a salinity approaching 350\u2030, or approximately ten times that of the Earth\u2019s oceans, the Dead Sea represents one of the most saline naturally occurring bodies of water on our planet.  When combined with a slightly acidic pH, near toxic magnesium levels, and the dominance of divalent cations, the Dead Sea becomes a truly inhospitable ecosystem.  Nevertheless, the Dead Sea is home to a select few halophilic microbes and with a roughly 33% decrease in the salinity of its surface waters, the Dead Sea teems with microbial life.  Here we employ \u201cnext generation\u201d metagenomic and bioinformatic techniques to explore the limits and evolution of hyperhalophilic life inhabiting the Dead Sea and other hypersaline bodies.  \n     To that end we extracted and/or obtained DNA from the March 2007 Dead Sea, four artificial Dead Sea blooms, and cryopreserved samples from both June and September 1992.  We amplified and sequenced portions of the 16S rRNA gene for all samples and sequenced metagenomes for both the March 2007 and September 1992 samples.  The amplicons revealed a significant population shift between the 1992 samples.  Most striking was the virtual disappearance of the major bacterial lineages that were present in the June sample.  The amplicons also revealed major differences between all bloom samples and the residual 2007 population.  This indicates that the archaeal taxa capable of surviving under the most extreme conditions are not the ones that flourish under relatively mild hypersaline conditions.\n     The shift in populations between the bloom and non-bloom environments was also observable in the translated amino acid profiles of both environments.  Many hyperhalophiles balance the osmotic gradient present in their native environments with multi-molar quantities of KCl necessitating radical protein alterations.  These alterations were more prevalent in the 2007 metagenome.  We analyzed the metagenomes of a number of hypersaline environments, including both Dead Sea metagenomes and found that the degree of protein alteration plots linearly with salinity, suggesting its use as a salinity proxy.  We also utilized the protein alterations inherent in hyperhalophilic proteins in combination with the amplicon data sets to identify both lateral gene transfer events involving hyperhalophilic organisms and a number of bacterial lineages with putative hyperhalophilic members.\n     From there we chose to delve deeper into lateral gene transfer amongst the Halobacteria.  Halobacteria are notorious for lateral gene transfer and lateral gene transfer has played a significant role in their evolution.  We analyzed over 1,000 genomes for instances of lateral gene transfer and discovered that the Halobacteria in contrast to other microbial lineages often participate in lateral gene transfer with non-halophiles.  This paints the picture of the Halobacteria as the consummate opportunists, utilizing DNA from all sources they encounter.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4083], "author_name_tesi": "Rhodes, Matthew E", "last_name_ssi": "Rhodes", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Howard House", "Christopher Howard House", "Jennifer Macalady", "Mark E Patzkowsky", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Howard House, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Chair", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Chair", "Mark E Patzkowsky, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lateral Gene Transfer", "Haloarchaea", "Halophile", "Dead Sea", "Metagenomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Former Street-involved Children in Rural Central Kenya: Uncovering an Understudied Population", "id": "18979", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9073", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the past decade, programs have been established in developing countries to help reintegrate former street-involved children.

Health insurance coverage has historically varied across places and groups of people. For example, rural areas and large sections of the South have been plagued with persistently low rates of coverage due to unique structural and compositional characteristics. Racial/ethnic disparities \u2013 particularly among blacks and Hispanics \u2013 also persist given socioeconomic and policy barriers to accessing coverage. Using county-level insurance coverage estimates for non-elderly adults from Enroll America and demographic, socioeconomic, and labor market variables from the American Community Survey, I examine a number of research questions related to the role of Medicaid expansion and county characteristics on changes in adult (ages 18 to 64) health insurance coverage rates. There are several noteworthy findings with important implications for research, policy, and practice. \nFirst, compared with counties located in states that did not expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA, counties located in states that did expand Medicaid experienced significantly larger improvements in overall adult health insurance coverage rates between 2013 and 2014, net of several other county characteristics. Second, in states that did not expand Medicaid, counties with larger shares of vulnerable residents (e.g., poor adults, foreign born residents, and adults with low educational attainment) experienced smaller improvements in coverage compared to counties with comparatively smaller shares of these vulnerable groups. However, counties in states that did expand Medicaid were protected from the disadvantage of having larger shares of vulnerable residents. Third, compared to large metropolitan counties in the South, small metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties in the South experienced significantly smaller improvements in coverage from 2013 to 2014. Fourth, almost all counties experienced declines in racial/ethnic (white-black; white-Hispanic) disparities in coverage rates. However, counties in states that did expand Medicaid to at least 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level experienced significantly larger declines in the white-black and white-Hispanic coverage gap compared to counties in states that adopted lower Medicaid thresholds. The findings from this study have important implications for county and state governments both in states that did and did not expand Medicaid as they are faced with the risks associated with persistently low coverage rates, including high rates of uncompensated care, declining population health and worker productivity, and struggling healthcare systems.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12094], "author_name_tesi": "Rhubart, Danielle Christine", "last_name_ssi": "Rhubart", "middle_name_ssi": "Christine", "first_name_ssi": "Danielle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shannon Monnat", "Shannon Monnat", "Leif Jensen", "Diane McLaughlin", "Stephen Matthews"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shannon Monnat, Dissertation Advisor", "Shannon Monnat, Committee Chair", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "Diane McLaughlin, Committee Member", "Stephen Matthews, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Affordable Care Act", "Medicaid Expansion", "Health Insurance", "Spatial Disparities"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "INTERACTIONS OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WITH STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES", "id": "13801bar242", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13801", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the interactions of Career and Technical Education (CTE) teachers with students, that they were in charge of teaching, who have disabilities.

Chapter 2 seeks to find whether exporting helps to reduce a firm's sales volatility by means of diversifying aggregate shocks in its domestic market in an economy with no capital markets and in which exporting is costly. This is a partial equilibrium model with monopolistically-competitive, risk-averse firms that are heterogeneous with respect to their productivity, capital stock and exporting status and that face idiosyncratic as well as aggregate uncertainty. Firms become exporters primarily because of the positive impact to mean profits, even if it means experiencing higher volatility of sales. However, firms take advantage of the possibilities to diversify their revenues, as firms are more likely to become exporters when the correlation between domestic and external aggregate shocks is low and when risk aversion is high.\n\nChapter 3 builds a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of industry evolution for a small open economy in order to understand the link between trade liberalization, technology adoption and wage inequality. Monopolistically-competitive firms use skilled and unskilled labor, decide whether to export or not, and choose what technology to operate. The technology that a firm employs determines the stochastic process for skilled labor productivity, so that larger, more productive firms tend to be more skill-intensive, as observed in the data. The model is estimated using a Simulated Method of Moments estimator, and fitted to plant-level data from the Mexican manufacturing sector after the trade liberalization of 1985.

In an effort to bridge this gap in the literature, and to further existing knowledge of Spring Break, this study sought to gain a deeper understanding of the Spring Break phenomenon, by seeking answers to the following questions: \u201cWhy do college students go on Spring Break?\u201d and \u201cHow do spring breakers perceive the Spring Break experience?\u201d \nFourteen undergraduate students from a large Mid-Atlantic North American University, who were going on their first Spring Break experience, were selected via random purposeful sampling, and interviewed before and after Spring Break. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and the resulting transcripts were analyzed using the software program NVivo\u00a9 version 7.0 until a clear picture of the spring breakers\u2019 experiences emerged. \nThe results revealed a stark contrast between the participants\u2019 perceptions of what Spring Break is and the reality of their own Spring Break experiences. Participants\u2019 perceptions of Spring Break, in consonance with the media-propagated image of this phenomenon, were defined by words such as \u201cdrinking\u201d, \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201cgirls\u201d, \u201cbeach\u201d, \u201cbikinis\u201d, and \u201cparty\u201d.

It is further proposed that, rather than regarding Spring Break as an excuse to drink, have unprotected sex, etc., without restrictions, college students merely see Spring Break as the continuation of practices that they already engage in during the rest of the year, lending support to the notion of a tourism-leisure behavioural continuum.

Findings also dispute the notion of Spring Break as a rite of passage for college students, suggesting instead that Spring Break behaviors are but a continuation of practices that college students already engage in during the rest of the year.

The weld geometry and fast welding speed of hybrid welding make it a good choice for application in ship, pipeline, and aerospace welding.  Heat transfer and fluid flow influence weld metal mixing, cooling rates, and weld bead geometry.  Cooling rate affects weld microstructure and subsequent weld mechanical properties.  Fluid flow and heat transfer in the liquid weld pool are affected by laser and arc energy absorption. The laser and arc generate plasmas which can influence arc and laser energy absorption.  Metal vapors introduced from the keyhole, a vapor filled cavity formed near the laser focal point, influence arc plasma light emission and energy absorption.  However, hybrid welding plasma properties near the opening of the keyhole are not known nor is the influence of arc power and heat source separation understood.  A sound understanding of these processes is important to consistently achieving sound weldments.  By varying process parameters during welding, it is possible to better understand their influence on temperature profiles, weld metal mixing, cooling rates, and plasma properties.  The current literature has shown that important process parameters for hybrid welding include: arc power, laser power, and heat source separation distance.  However, their influence on weld temperatures, fluid flow, cooling rates, and plasma properties are not well understood.  Modeling has shown to be a successful means of better understanding the influence of processes parameters on heat transfer, fluid flow, and plasma characteristics for arc and laser welding.  However, numerical modeling of laser/GTA hybrid welding is just beginning.  Arc and laser welding plasmas have been previously analyzed successfully using optical emission spectroscopy in order to better understand arc and laser plasma properties as a function of plasma radius.  Variation of hybrid welding plasma properties with radial distance is not known.  Since plasma properties can affect arc and laser energy absorption and weld integrity, a better understanding of the change in hybrid welding plasma properties as a function of plasma radius is important and necessary.  Material composition influences welding plasma properties, arc and laser energy absorption, heat transfer, and fluid flow.  The presence of surface active elements such as oxygen and sulfur can affect weld pool fluid flow and bead geometry depending upon the significance of heat transfer by convection.  Easily vaporized and ionizable alloying elements can influence arc plasma characteristics and arc energy absorption.  The effects of surface active elements on heat transfer and fluid flow are well understood in the case of arc and conduction mode laser welding.  However, the influence of surface active elements on heat transfer and fluid flow during keyhole mode laser welding and laser/arc hybrid welding are not well known.  Modelling has been used to successfully analyze the influence of surface active elements during arc and conduction mode laser welding in the past and offers promise in the case of laser/arc hybrid welding.  A critical review of the literature revealed several important areas for further research and unanswered questions.  (1) The understanding of heat transfer and fluid flow during hybrid welding is still beginning and further research is necessary.  (2)  Why hybrid welding weld bead width is greater than that of laser or arc welding is not well understood.  (3)  The influence of arc power and heat source separation distance on cooling rates during hybrid welding are not known.  (4) Convection during hybrid welding is not well understood despite its importance to weld integrity.  (5) The influence of surface active elements on weld geometry, weld pool temperatures, and fluid flow during high power density laser and laser/arc hybrid welding are not known.  (6) Although the arc power and heat source separation distance have been experimentally shown to influence arc stability and plasma light emission during hybrid welding, the influence of these parameters on plasma properties is unknown.  (7) The electrical conductivity of hybrid welding plasmas is not known, despite its importance to arc stability and weld integrity.\nIn this study, heat transfer and fluid flow are analyzed for laser, gas tungstent arc (GTA), and laser/GTA hybrid welding using an experimentally validated three dimensional phenomenological model.  By evaluating arc and laser welding using similar process parameters, a better understanding of the hybrid welding process is expected.  The role of arc power and heat source separation distance on weld depth, weld pool centerline cooling rates, and fluid flow profiles during CO2 laser/GTA hybrid welding of 321 stainless steel are analyzed.  Laser power is varied for a constant heat source separation distance to evaluate its influence on weld temperatures, weld geometry, and fluid flow during Nd:YAG laser/GTA hybrid welding of A131 structural steel.  The influence of oxygen and sulfur on keyhole and weld bead geometry, weld temperatures, and fluid flow are analyzed for high power density Yb doped fiber laser welding of (0.16 %C, 1.46 %Mn) mild steel.  Optical emission spectroscopy was performed on GTA, Nd:YAG laser, and Nd:YAg laser/GTA hybrid welding plasmas for welding of 304L stainless steel.  Emission spectroscopy provides a means of determining plasma temperatures and species densities using deconvoluted measured spectral intensities, which can then be used to calculate plasma electrical conductivity.  In this study, hybrid welding plasma temperatures, species densities, and electrical conductivities were determined using various heat source separation distances and arc currents using an analytical method coupled calculated plasma compositions.\nAs a result of these studies heat transfer by convection was determined to be dominant during hybrid welding of steels.  The primary driving forces affecting hybrid welding fluid flow are the surface tension gradient and electromagnetic force.  Fiber laser weld depth showed a negligible change when increasing the (0.16 %C, 1.46 %Mn) mild steel sulfur concentration from 0.006 wt% to 0.15 wt%.  Increasing the dissolved oxygen content in weld pool from 0.0038 wt% to 0.0257 wt% increased the experimental weld depth from 9.3 mm to 10.8 mm.  Calculated partial pressure of carbon monoxide increased from 0.1 atm to 0.75 atm with the 0.0219 wt% increase in dissolved oxygen in the weld metal and may explain the increase in weld depth.  Nd:YAG laser/GTA hybrid welding plasma temperatures were calculated to be approximately between 7927 K and 9357 K.  Increasing the Nd:YAG laser/GTA hybrid welding heat source separation distance from 4 mm to 6 mm reduced plasma temperatures between 500 K and 900 K.  Hybrid welding plasma total electron densities and electrical conductivities were on the order of 1 x 10^22 m^-3 and 3000 S/m, respectively.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [654], "author_name_tesi": "Ribic, Brandon David", "last_name_ssi": "Ribic", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Brandon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Tarasankar Deb Roy", "Tarasankar Debroy", "Christopher Muhlstein", "Long Qing Chen", "Jian Xu", "Todd Palmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Tarasankar Deb Roy, Dissertation Advisor", "Tarasankar Debroy, Committee Chair", "Christopher Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member", "Todd Palmer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluid flow", "heat transfer", "surface active elements", "numerical modeling", "laser-arc hybrid welding", "plasma properties", "keyhole mode welding"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Mission Matters: Presidential Perspectives on the Role of Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the Higher Education System\n", "id": "7224", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5143", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The study explores the mission of historically black colleges and universities from the perspectives of four-year presidents.

Variations in the isotopic composition of CAS during the late Permian have been utilized to suggest the presence of a euxinic ocean which may have helped trigger a mass extinction event.  Samples from three marine sections spanning the Permian-Triassic boundary were analyzed: Meishan and Shangsi (Southern China) and Demirtas (Turkey) for CAS isotopic composition.  Rapid variations in the \u0192\u00d434SCAS with extremely 34S depleted values in the Permian were found at all three sections.  A decrease in \u0192\u00b413C (\u0192\u00d413Ccarb-\u0192\u00d413Corg) was also measured at Meishan and Shangsi, but not Demirtas coincident with the largest pulse of extinction.  The patterns of isotopic shift indicate a shallow unstable chemocline overlying euxinic deep water which periodically upwelled into the photic zone.  This release of sulfide may have stimulated a bloom of phototrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria.  These bacteria would have produced elemental sulfur globules depleted in 34S, which were deposited in the sediment and later oxidized and incorporated as CAS. The variations in \u0192\u00d434SCAS between the three marine sections suggest intermittent euxinic conditions in the surface waters which varied by location helping to trigger the largest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic.\nThese rapid variations in the isotopic composition of CAS during the latest Permian associated with the Permian-Triassic boundary mass extinction event have raised concern over the susceptibility of the CAS isotopic proxy to diagenetic alteration.  Chemical and spectroscopic analyses were performed on both modern and ancient samples to determine the resistance of CAS to alteration.  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of powdered carbonate suggests CAS is present within the calcite mineral lattice.  Examinations of CAS isotopic values in a modern euxinic environment were performed at meromictic Fayetteville Green Lake (near Syracuse, NY).  Lake water and sediment samples were analyzed for sulfate and sulfide concentration and isotopic composition.  The isotopic values for CAS remained the same as those found in the overlying lake water for both the oxic and euxinic sediments suggesting CAS is a reliable proxy for overlying water sulfate isotopic composition under varying burial conditions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [235], "author_name_tesi": "Riccardi, Anthony ", "last_name_ssi": "Riccardi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anthony", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lee Kump", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Katherine Haines Freeman", "Carlo G Pantano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lee Kump, Committee Chair", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Chair", "Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Member", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sulfur Isotopes", "Mass Extinction", "Geochemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Seasonal and Synoptic Patterns of CO2 Distribution in the North American Continental Boundary Layer\n", "id": "12347", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4106", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The increasly dense global CO2 measurement network is expanding, enabling us to capture local fluctuations of CO2 across North America.  For this study, continuous CO2 mixing ratio data are gathered across the North American continent in the United States and Southern Canada at 36 land-based measurement sites in 2008.  These towers are further divided into two categories in order to distinguish those with a possible urban influence from their environment.  Flask measurements obtained along 30\u00b0N latitude in the Pacific Ocean and between 3 and 8 km above ground level (agl) at 15 North American aircraft sites are used to estimate boundary layer conditions in the marine boundary layer (MBL) and free troposphere (FT), respectively.  MBL and FT CO2 mixing ratios, as well as reliable daytime observations from the highest land-based measurement levels, have been averaged for each day of the year and clearly reveal five distinct seasonal patterns.  The sites are separated into regions according to similarities in phasing, amplitude, and seasonal patterns of CO2 mixing ratios: East, Southeast, Mid-Continent, Northwest, and West.  An estimate of the CO2 mixing ratio per day for each region is computed by taking the mean of the daily average of all sites in the region for each day of the year. When the results are compared across regions, low regional variability is found during the periods of January to April and October to December. The Mid-Continental Region is characterized by a large decrease in CO2 during the summer months while the Southeast and West are characterized by low yearly variability. A decrease in CO2 is observed during the same time period in the East and Northwest, but the drawdown in the Eastern Region is slightly larger and more significant than that in the Northwest.  An analysis of synoptic weather events and regional variance reveals an association between CO2 mixing ratios and frontal systems.  Regional variance tends to be larger in the presence of fronts than in the absence of fronts and CO2 mixing ratios are more apt to be higher ahead of frontal systems than behind them.  Seasonal patterns of CO2 mixing ratios and their relationship to synoptic weather systems provide insight into the location and mechanisms of sources and sinks in the temperate biosphere of the north latitude ecosystems.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4084], "author_name_tesi": "Ricciardi, Michelle Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Ricciardi", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ken Davis", "Kenneth James Davis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ken Davis, Thesis Advisor", "Kenneth James Davis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Regional CO2 Distribution; North America CO2; Boun"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Diagnosing uncertainty and improving predictions of terrestrial CO2 fluxes at multiple scales through data assimilation\n", "id": "7159", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1503", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We use data assimilation techniques to assimilate carbon cycle data over a range of spatial and temporal scales in three models.  First, global CO2 concentration data and ocean flux observations are used to calibrate a simple carbon cycle model, to estimate uncertainty in key carbon cycle parameters, and to predict the behavior of both the terrestrial and ocean carbon sinks. Given equal observation errors, historical temperature forcing, and our assumed model structure, hypothetical annual observations of global terrestrial CO2 fluxes reduce predictive uncertainties about CO2 sinks more than twice as much as annual observations of global ocean CO2 fluxes. The main reason for this effect lies in the interannual variability of the terrestrial carbon cycle that is resolved by our model and that constrains model parameters. This conclusion hinges on the model structure that assumes much smaller interannual variability of the oceanic carbon cycle.\n\nDirect observations of terrestrial CO2 fluxes do not exist at a global scale, and data assimilation experiments using direct terrestrial flux observations must focus on smaller scales until appropriate upscaling techniques are discovered.  Eddy covariance towers measure continuous fluxes of CO2 with a spatial footprint on the order of 1 km2.  At the WLEF eddy covariance tower in a northern Wisconsin mixed forest, interannual variations in observed sums of CO2 flux are found to be statistically significant with respect to random error.  These flux data were assimilated into a simple climate-driven model.  Considerable differences in respiration parameter probability density functions (PDFs) occurred depending on whether daytime, nighttime, or all flux data were used in the assimilation.  This simple model was moderately successful in producing statistically significant correlations with interannual variations in annual and growing season NEE sums, but was generally unsuccessful in spring and autumn.  In all cases, the model underestimated the range of variability in NEE sums.\n\nUpscaling eddy covariance tower fluxes from the scale of an eddy covariance footprint to a regional or global scale is a nontrivial task.  Assimilating eddy covariance data into a process-based terrestrial carbon cycle model is one way to attempt this type of upscaling.  We use the Top-down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics (TRIFFID) to assimilate eddy covariance data from five sites in eastern North America.  Because of the complexity of the model, only a subset of model parameters could be optimized; 22 parameters assumed to contribute the most to observed flux variance are selected.  The system is nonconvex, displaying multiple maxima in the likelihood function.  We use a genetic algorithm to find the global optimum set of parameters for each site individually, and jointly among all five sites.  Variability from diurnal to seasonal timescales is simulated with high accuracy by the optimized models, a large improvement over the results obtained when using published parameters.  There was little skill in reproducing interannual variability using either the published or the optimized parameters, indicating that key processes governing variability at this timescale are, as of yet, missing in TRIFFID.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1488], "author_name_tesi": "Ricciuto, Daniel Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Ricciuto", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis", "Klaus Keller", "John Corry Wyngaard", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis, Committee Chair", "Klaus Keller, Committee Member", "John Corry Wyngaard, Committee Member", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["land-atmosphere trace gas exchange", "ecosystem modeling", "data assimilation", "carbon cycle"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "UNCOVERING THE CAUSAL PATHWAYS OF\nHEALTH AND EDUCATION CHOICES", "id": "10997", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "30", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation concerns the relationship between education and health.  While this is not a new topic, the focus of this research is to explicitly model the education and health decision process and estimate such a model. Compared to current literature which focuses on statistical modeling as opposed to economic modeling of the decision, this project allows for deeper intuitive and policy analysis.\n\nChapter one reviews the Economics literature on the relationship between health and education.  It then discusses the current issues in the literature and proposes a solution to some of those problems.  This chapter also provides a simple economic model of health and education choice from which a more complicated dynamic model is derived in chapter two.\n\nChapter two proposes a dynamic model of health and education choice allowing for unobserved heterogeneity. This model is then estimated using data from the Health and Retirement Study.  Results from the estimation suggest that an exogenous increase in education only increases expectation of life by approximately one third of the amount typically reported in the current literature.\n\nChapter three performs various robustness checks on the structural estimation described in chapter one.  One test is to simulate data from the estimated model and perform statistical analysis analogous to what the current literature would perform on real data.  This analysis shows that while the model predicts a far less mortality decline from a year of school, simulated data still generates the same results as real data when put to the standard analysis.  The other major test performed in this chapter is to vary the amount of unobserved heterogeneity allowed in the model to see how sensitive it is to this number.\n\nChapter four performs various policy experiments using the model estimated in chapter one.  It examines the cost and benefits of compulsory education policy, college cost policy, and smoking policies.  While all of these policies have various effects, this chapter only looks at the health benefits of these levers and compares the various cost benefit ratios.  Ultimately the conclusion is that even with the reduced benefit of education compared to the current literature, education investment as a health policy is most likely effective.

For this reason, scholars studying issue attention have emphasized the importance of focusing on cross-institutional shifts in attention. Yet despite this emphasis on including multiple institutions in such analyses, only rarely have the courts been included, and in those few instances research has been limited to a subset of Supreme Court activity. With the courts omitted, two separate perspectives have emerged on issue attention dynamics both within the judicial hierarchy and between the courts and other institutions. In the first view, the courts are portrayed as passive implementers of policy, with attention in the courts following attention in other institutions. Contrary to this perspective, an emerging literature suggests the courts can be used by litigants and interest groups to proactively shift issue attention across institutions. \n\nWhether the courts are an agenda setter or simply reactive is a question unresolved by scholars, and one with important implications for policymakers. Can interest groups encourage attention through the judiciary, as some scholars urge them to do?  Can citizens directly impact the attention of government through their involvement in the courts? Do judges encourage attention for unresolved issues in the law?  In sum, what part do the federal courts play in the policy process? To answer these questions, I integrate the judiciary into our understanding of the policy process. In particular, I examine changes in the issue attention of the litigants, judges and interest groups within the federal courts and document the relationships in issue attention among these actors. In order to study these patterns in issue attention for actors within the judiciary, I utilize a variety of natural language processing and machine learning methods for information extraction and topic modelling tasks.  Then, I move beyond the context of the courts and also test competing theories of how the policy attention and activity of these actors within the courts impacts or is impacted by attention to policy in Congress and the executive branch. \n\nIn so doing, this study provides the broadest examination to date of the influence of courts in the formation of public policy as well as the broad dynamics of issue attention in American government. I have collected information on the issues addressed in over 10 million cases at all levels of the federal court system in the United States. Such comprehensive information on the issues which the federal courts are addressing permits previously impossible analyses of how changes in government policies percolate throughout the different institutions of the federal government. In these analyses, I uncover evidence supporting both proactive and passive courts perspectives, with the dynamics of issue attention contingent on the actors and issue areas under consideration. Within the judicial hierarchy, the research provides evidence suggesting the Supreme Court settles areas of increasing litigation, while also signalling interest groups and judges about areas the Court considers a priority. Across institutions, the evidence indicates issue attention relationships vary considerably across issue areas and actors, with the courts actually leading other institutions in attention to particular issue areas in the time period under study. In all, the research suggests federal courts systematically matter for the issue attention of institutions of American government.

This study focuses on the recently hypothesized and not well understood Stage-III corrosion. Stage-III corrosion, the unexpected resumption of high-rate glass dissolution, has been observed to occur for some glass waste forms and not for others. The onset is unpredictable, but is likely related to the composition of the waste glass and the state of the contacting solution or environment. \nThe two reference waste glasses studied are comprised of 26 oxides with 20 common components between them. The first glass is a French waste form, referred to as SON68. The other is a waste glass developed by the United States Department of Energy for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, and is referred to as AFCI. The glass SON68 has been shown to release markedly larger quantities of glass species into the contacting solution, but in the long term, is consistently the more durable of the two glasses, while AFCI is more susceptible to this Stage-III transition. For this reason, these two reference (simulated) waste glasses were studied to determine how the differences and similarities in composition may affect the transition to Stage-III corrosion. Ideally, this might provide clues to the critical species or concentrations triggering the transition.\nTo do this, combinations of the two glasses were melted together in ratios by weight of 75% SON68 to 25% AFCI, 50% SON68 to 50% AFCI, and 25% SON68 to 75% AFCI. These blends, along with pure SON68 and pure AFCI, were reacted according to standard glass durability test methods. Crushed glass powder from each composition was reacted in separate vessels of ASTM Type 1 water at 90\u00b0C. Along with powder, bulk glass monoliths were added to some containers as reference samples for characterization. \nAlthough only one of the blends transitioned into Stage-III corrosion, pertinent information could be drawn based on composition and precipitated mineral formations for this glass. For all the glass compositions, the likelihood of a Stage-III transition could be rationalized based on a strong base/weak acid model using solution analysis data. Irrespective of a Stage-III transition, clear trends through the range of glass compositions were also identified for the formation of a phyllosilicate mineral, and as a result, its impact on the glass durability was hypothesized.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13526], "author_name_tesi": "Rice, Jarrett Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Rice", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "Jarrett", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carlo G Pantano", "Seong Han Kim", "William B.

Quality post-secondary education becomes more and more critical to both national competitiveness and the development of a robust agricultural economy. There is a continual need for productive research on effective teaching. To ensure undergraduate students are receiving the quality of education needed to be competitive in our global society, colleges of agricultural sciences must constantly advance their education and scholarship. The purpose of the research study was to investigate links between post-secondary agricultural sciences faculty espoused teaching theories and their teaching practice. The research study allowed for researchers to better understand how university academics learn to teach to improve post-secondary agriculture education. The research study compared two leading agricultural science post-secondary institutions on the approaches to teaching of identified excellent teachers. The study employed a multiple case\u2013study approach utilizing a basic qualitative design to frame their one-on-one structured interview research methods. The results were discovered through in-depth analysis for rich description expressing the faculty member\u2019s beliefs they hold about their teaching. Findings revealed lecture as the dominant teaching method currently in use by faculty at one university, and lecture with integrated active learning techniques was the dominant teaching method at the other university. Data revealed current teaching strategies were influenced by prior educational experiences; however, there was very little exposure to instruction in teaching methods.  Although faculty at both institutions had received very little training in teaching, all felt confident in their ability to teach.  Findings revealed the teaching beliefs and philosophies of interviewed faculty were well established; however, faculty at one university were aware the practices used in the classroom did not necessarily align. The teaching practices of the other faculty aligned with their teaching beliefs and stated philosophies. Faculty interviewed agreed class size, time, and budgetary constraints affect the teaching method employed as different constraints that limit employing some of their philosophical beliefs in the classroom. More empirical studies are needed for researchers to build better understanding about which belief affects which action, and subsequently how to address or change teachers\u2019 beliefs.

This issue is compounded by lack of food safety training, cultural differences, and language barriers.

The training program was designed to increase retention of food safety knowledge, improve attitude, alter behavior, and increase skills. Initially, needs assessments of employees were conducted by concealed-direct observations, a demographic survey, and a manager preference survey.  Needs assessment data were used to develop a customized \u201ccounter-top\u201d food safety training program that included images and oral supplementation in Spanish and addressed common food safety issues occurring in the carnicer\u00edas. Due to the low literacy level of participants, training was conducted on site via face-to-face (FTF) and in Spanish. The inclusion criteria for the carnicer\u00edas required that they have a meat display case, a meat slicer, employees >18 years, and employees who spoke Spanish as their first language. Twenty carnicer\u00edas were assigned randomly to two treatments groups: control-no training or FTF-training. The food safety \u201ccounter-top\u201d training program included four different assessments: knowledge, attitude, behavior, and performance of a skill (hand washing). The assessments were given pre-training (2 weeks prior), post-training (2 weeks after) and delayed- post training (3 weeks after the post-test).  Analysis using ANCOVA for knowledge and skill results demonstrated a significant difference in post-test and delayed post-test scores when controlling for the pre-test scores of the FTF-trained group, as compared to the control group. The findings of this current study demonstrated that food safety attitude and behavior changes were not significant, although numerical improvements were observed.

Research has also addressed the benefits of cooperative education experiences.  Yet, in this era of high stakes testing and program accountability, the amount of time that career and technical students are permitted to participate in these experiences has diminished.  Unfortunately, there is little empirical evidence to suggest that there is a relationship between capstone cooperative education experiences and performance on end of program assessments. The purpose of this baseline study was to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean summative test scores of secondary career and technical education students who participated in capstone cooperative education experiences and those students who did not participate, as measured by NOCTI scores.  The population studied was secondary career and technical school seniors during the 2009/2010 academic year in seventeen schools throughout Pennsylvania.  Additionally, this study sought to determine if student grade point average (GPA), Individualized Education Plan (IEP) status, length of time on coop or quality of student training plan could significantly account for any established mean differences.  It was determined that students who participate in cooperative education experiences score significantly higher on both the written and practical portions of their summative NOCTI exams than those students who do not participate in cooperative education.  While student GPA and IEP status appear to be the best predictors of both written and practical NOCTI scores, collectively the four moderating variables could only predict about 22% of the variance in test scores between students who participate in cooperative education and those who do not, which is not a particularly significant amount.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1725], "author_name_tesi": "Richard, Elizabeth Doane", "last_name_ssi": "Richard", "middle_name_ssi": "Doane", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Allen Walter", "Richard Allen Walter", "Robert W Clark", "Cynthia Pellock", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Allen Walter, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Allen Walter, Committee Chair", "Robert W Clark, Committee Member", "Cynthia Pellock, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["summative assessment scores", "vocational education", "cooperative education", "NOCTI scores", "co-op", "experiential learning", "contextual learning", "career and technical education"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Anomalously Low \u03b418O Values of High-Latitude Permo-Triassic Paleosol Siderite: Implications for the Hydrologic Cycle during Warm Climate Intervals", "id": "14176zxr5027", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14176", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Pedogenic carbonates are valuable tools used to reconstruct atmospheric hydrology in Earth\u2019s past. Isotopic measurements of siderite occurring in paleosols during intervals of extreme global warming suggests severe high-latitude depletions in \u03b418O of precipitation, often attributed to an amplified hydrologic cycle or intensified atmospheric circulation. Here, Late Permian and Early Triassic paleosol siderite from Alaska, Antarctica, eastern Australia, Siberia, South Africa, and southern China indicate similar or greater meridional gradients in siderite \u03b418O compared to other past warm intervals. High-latitude siderite samples feature variable (>10\u2030) \u03b418O values, indicating that the ancient wetlands may have been recharged seasonally or from different sources; for example, from mean annual precipitation, from depleted, high-altitude rainfall, or from snowmelt.  \nAn isotope-tracer-enabled version of the Global Environmental and Ecological Simulation of Interactive Systems (GENESIS) general circulation model (GCM) with specified paleoatmospheric CO2 concentrations of 12.7X preindustrial atmospheric level (PAL), which when used to calculate siderite \u03b418O, matches relatively less depleted high-latitude siderites (-9 to -10\u2030). However, when the siderite \u03b418O data is supplemented with literature-reported contemporaneous calcite and kaolinite \u03b418O, converted to precipitation \u03b418O using GENESIS temperature estimates, these \u03b418O-values agree best with the most \u03b418O-depleted high-latitude siderites, suggesting that the data-derived meridional precipitation \u03b418O gradient is significantly steeper than what GENESIS predicts. This mineral proxy data-derived Permo-Triassic precipitation \u03b418O gradient is similar to those calculated from siderite and estimated temperatures from other hothouse intervals, perhaps suggesting a similar paleoatmospheric phenomenon. This result supports the conclusions from previous paleosol siderite studies and leads to the question whether GCMs like GENESIS are able to properly simulate global-scale hydrology during times of elevated atmospheric pCO2. Other possible explanations for highly depleted high-latitude siderite include summer-formed siderite from snowmelt-derived recharge, or high altitude drainage from nearby mountains. Model intercomparison, the utilization of small-scale basin drainage models with \u03b418O-tracing capability, and the development of a sample-based modern soil siderite \u03b418O meridional gradient will be required to further explain highly depleted highlatitude paleosol siderite from hothouse intervals, and to suggest possible atmospheric mechanisms that may drive significant high-latitude \u03b418O depletions.

The discrepancies in views can be hard to detect using standardized tests and formal assessment practices.  An accumulation of research shows that students in introductory college physics courses find the topic of electromagnetic induction (EMI) the most difficult to undersand (Allen, 2001; Maloney, O'Kuma, Hieggelke, & Heuvelen, 2001; Guisasola, Almud\u00ed, & Zubimendi, 2004; Thong & Gunstone, 2008; Pollock, 2009).  Physics teachers also list EMI as one of the most arduous topics for students to comprehend (Albe, Venturini, and Lascours, 2001).   In order to improve students\u2019 functional understanding of EMI, dynamic computer simulations have been developed to provide concrete representations of changing magnetic fields and moving charges.  \nThe process of integrating simulations into physics curricula requires an evaluation of their effectiveness.  Neglecting this research may result in missing the desired effects of the simulations on students\u2019 understanding of the animations (Zacharia & Anderson, 2003). But how can one assess a students\u2019 understanding of an animation? \nThe principal investigator of this study selected a set of animations, interactive simulations, and videos from the internet to explore how students view and interact with virtual models of EMI.  Through the use of a think-out-loud protocol, eleven male physics students from a technical college in north-central Pennsylvania were interviewed while viewing the animations.  The information garnered from the transcribed interviews, along with pre/post surveys and quizzes, was used to get an empirical look into this particular class\u2019s conceptions of EMI. The students\u2019 viewpoints were studied to see if the class was able to identify the critical attributes, as well as the interactions, that occur in the animations. \nThe outcome of this experimental study afforded the principal investigator insight into where some of the students\u2019 misconceptions may have originated. Student conceptions varied, but the visualizations brought out several limitations in their thinking, including their difficulty in distinguishing critical attributes and correlating causal relationships between the components. In addition, students had trouble relating the simulations and animations to a real video demonstration of EMI.   \n The think-out-loud interviews proved to be an effective way to assess students\u2019 thinking about the five animations used in this study.  Students\u2019 intuitive notions of EMI were exposed as they viewed the animations without any prompts.  When reflection prompts were added, students seemed to focus on specific features within the animations and were able to identify some of the critical attributes in the EMI animations. However, the prompts did not provide convincing evidence that they are effective at facilitating students\u2019 metacognition. \nThis study adds to the growing body of research in instructional design, instructional technology, and physics education research, providing insights into students\u2019 conceptions that may be useful for designing more effective teaching practices.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1555], "author_name_tesi": "Richards, David Stuart", "last_name_ssi": "Richards", "middle_name_ssi": "Stuart", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Mary Land", "Susan M Land", "Kyle Leonard Peck", "Scott P Mcdonald", "Priya Sharma"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Mary Land, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan M Land, Committee Chair", "Kyle Leonard Peck, Committee Member", "Scott P Mcdonald, Committee Member", "Priya Sharma, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Case study", "electromagnetic induction", "animations", "simulations", "video"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Chemical communication and genomics of swarming behavior in honey bees (apis mellifera L.)", "id": "16241", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8230", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are an outstanding model system in which to examine the communication systems underlying complex social behavior. Swarming behavior is a fascinating example of this communication on a grand scale: when honey bee colonies swarm, a large group of workers will depart from their hive with the old queen, leaving behind the rest of the workers and a number of developing queens. The chemical communication systems regulating swarming behavior, and the neurophysiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the responses to these chemical signals and/or cues, have not been characterized. In Chapter 2, we used solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy to examine the volatile chemical compounds produced by the queen during different phases of the swarming process (in-hive, pre-bivouac, and liftoff). We demonstrated that queens release a significantly more complex blend at swarm liftoff than during the previous phases of the process, and that volatiles produced by swarming queens during liftoff are significantly more attractive to workers than volatiles produced by non-swarming queens. We identified five compounds from this blend, one of which is (E/Z)-beta-ocimene, a compound found in mated queens. There was considerable variation among the queens. This suggests that blends of chemicals, rather than a specific chemical, are associated with the swarming process. In Chapter 3, we examined the physiological and brain gene expression differences between workers that remain in the hive versus those that depart with the swarm. Microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that these two groups of bees have distinct gene expression patterns, including significantly higher levels of the egg-yolk and storage protein vitellogenin, which is a marker of the nursing behavioral-physiological state. We also identified 142 transcripts that were consistently, significantly, differentially expressed in the brains of swarming versus non-swarming workers from two different colonies. This gene list overlapped significantly with a list of differentially expressed genes in nurses versus foragers. Subsequent analysis of directional overlap demonstrated that swarming workers had similar gene expression patterns as younger, nurse bees. However, the reproductive potential of swarming workers (as measured by the number of ovarioles) did not differ significantly from that of non-swarming workers. This suggests that individual fitness benefits do not factor into the likelihood to join the swarm. Our results demonstrate that queens could play a role in triggering the initial swarming event through the release of novel pheromones, and swarming and non-swarming workers represent distinct physiological and behavioral states that likely are differentially responsive to these pheromones.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8157], "author_name_tesi": "Richards, Jessica Yung", "last_name_ssi": "Richards", "middle_name_ssi": "Yung", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christina M Grozinger", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "Edwin George Rajotte", "Anita Collins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christina M Grozinger, Thesis Advisor", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Edwin George Rajotte, Thesis Advisor", "Anita Collins, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["honey bee", "Apis mellifera", "swarming", "chemical communication", "genomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2000, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF AN INSTRUCTIONAL\nUNIT IN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT:\nEVALUATION OF STUDENT KNOWLEDGE AND\nATTITUDES AS A RESULT OF INSTRUCTION\n\n", "id": "5819", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3508", "defended_at_dtsi": "1999-12-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate an IPM instructional unit for secondary science and agricultural science classes.

Data on some 700 state prisons from 1974 to 1995 is employed to answer the two central research questions:  1) how have the social structure, institutional characteristics, and the political context of prisons, as well as interpersonal and collective unrest inside these institutions changed over the past several decades and 2) how do social structure, institutional characteristics, and political context affect prison interpersonal and collective unrest.  The theoretical strategy employed involves synthesizing dominant theoretical approaches in criminology literatures with approaches in sociology literatures in order to develop explanations of two dimensions of prison social unrest, interpersonal conflict between individual inmates and prison staff and collective action by groups of inmates.  To explain prison interpersonal conflict, I draw upon the importation, deprivation and social disorganization theories.  I integrate inmate-balance, administrative-control, breakdown and state-centered theories to explain collective unrest.  As a consequence, I identify the social structure of a prison population and the institutional characteristics of a prison as predictors of interpersonal conflict.  For collective conflict, social structure, institutional characteristics and political context were identified as predictors.  I utilized both descriptive analyses and multilevel growth curve models to account for interpersonal and collective unrest in prisons.  I conclude that interpersonal conflict worsened for inmates as individual prisons have become increasingly unable to protect those being confined in these institutions from being sexually and physically assaulted or even murdered.  According to the longitudinal data, individual prisons have changed significantly in their mean rates of disturbances and fires but not in their probabilities of a riot.  Despite record numbers of inmates being housed in state prisons and expanding costs, a number of inmate programs continue to operate in these institutions.  Inconsistent trends exist in both the median earning of guards relative to the median income of families in a state and the stability of the executive leadership of state prison systems.  In describing the political context within which prisons are nested, I found that the mean number of groups in a state that are organized around issues relating to prisons has remained relatively stable from 1984 to 1995, despite the substantial increase in both the number of inmates and prisons.  Also, as may be expected state total expenditures for prisons have increased steadily.  When accounting for prison violence, the findings indicate that models that include both predictors of social structure of the prison population and characteristics of institutions best explains interpersonal conflict between inmate and staff and among inmates.  Similarly, composite models that include predictors of social structure, institutional characteristics and the political context within which prisons are nested are identified as the most salient explanation of collective conflict within prisons.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4606], "author_name_tesi": "Richards, Nicole ", "last_name_ssi": "Richards", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John David Mccarthy", "Lee Ann Banaszak", "Roger Kent Finke", "D Wayne Osgood"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John David Mccarthy, Committee Chair", "Lee Ann Banaszak, Committee Member", "Roger Kent Finke, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["disturbances", "prisons", "interpersonal violence", "assaults", "collective unrest", "riots"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Intersubjectively Relevant Information: An Account of Citizen-centered Information and Communication in Democratic Deliberation about Ballot Initiatives", "id": "28858", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12478", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In deliberative-democratic theory, some authors have referred to a type of information\u2014which is especially relevant to the interests, values, and personal characteristics of citizens\u2014that when introduced into citizens\u2019 policy discussions can foster democratic deliberation and beneficial outcomes of such deliberation.

The dissertation concludes by summarizing results of the empirical studies, detailing a revised empirical model of the role of IRI in citizen deliberation, discussing avenues for further research on the role of information in democratic deliberation, and proposing reforms to ballot-initiative election procedures suggested by the results of the research.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11822], "author_name_tesi": "Richards, Robert Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Richards", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John W Gastil", "John W Gastil", "James Dillard", "James Hogan", "Christopher Jon Zorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John W Gastil, Dissertation Advisor", "John W Gastil, Committee Chair", "James Dillard, Committee Member", "James Hogan, Committee Member", "Christopher Jon Zorn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["democratic deliberation", "political communication", "legal communication", "political cognition", "sense-making"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Technoeconomic Analysis of Pumped Hydroelectric Storage as a Means to Mitigate the Variability of Renewable Generation", "id": "14464", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7064", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Because its \u201cfuel\u201d is free, it makes economic sense to utilize renewable energy whenever it is available.  But due to its inherent variability, efficiently integrating large amounts of renewable generation will require a flexible generation fleet.  One way of increasing a generation fleet\u2019s flexibility is through the adoption of pumped hydroelectric storage (PHS).  Like traditional hydropower generation, PHS is capable of quickly varying its power output but it is also capable of operating in reverse to store excess energy for later use.  This paper addresses many of the financial and operational aspects of complementing variable wind and solar power generation with PHS, which is typically used to store excess energy from traditional generators.  \n\nThe benefits that a PHS facility can offer to renewable power generators are many, but the biggest drawback to doing so is the high capital cost of PHS.  In order to study the revenue streams and operational requirements of PHS facilities and the revenue streams of renewable power generators in the PJM interconnection, a computer model with one-minute resolution was programmed in Mathcad 14.  Hourly electricity demand, power prices, and wind power production were obtained from PJM\u2019s website for the year 2010.  The NREL program PVWatts v.1 was used to generate the simulated hourly solar power production which was combined with the PJM data and used as input to the model.  \n\nFor this thesis, the model scaled the wind and solar power production inputs to match the proposed 38,131 MW wind and 3,721 MW solar power penetrations in PJM as of October 6, 2011.  It then analyzed the variability of the wind and solar power production and the ability of a 1000 MW, fixed speed, pump-turbine PHS facility to mitigate the previously mentioned variability.  The model also calculated the hourly profits and penalties that resulted from the variable renewable generation being sold in PJM\u2019s day-ahead market and compared them to selling the electricity in PJM\u2019s real-time market.  In addition, the model was used to quantify the effects that changes in pumping efficiency, generating efficiency, power capacity, and energy storage capacity have on the annual energy arbitrage profit of a PHS facility in PJM.  \n\nThe output of the model demonstrates that the annual penalties that result from the variability of renewable power production can be significant.  It also suggests that large amounts of renewable power production have the potential to suppress high electricity prices that occur during periods of peak electricity demand.  In terms of PHS parameters, the model shows that a 14% decrease in round trip efficiency would reduce annual energy arbitrage profits by more than 33%.  The analysis presented in Chapter 8 illustrates the need for PHS facilities with increased flexibility and Chapter 9 details a variety of abstract concepts that are not addressed in the previous chapters but are pertinent to this thesis.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7057], "author_name_tesi": "Richards, Scott Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Richards", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Horacio Perez Blanco"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Horacio Perez Blanco, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["pumped hydroelectric storage", "pumped storage hydro", "renewable energy", "wind power", "solar power", "PJM", "variable generation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Winning and Losing: A Philosophical Analysis", "id": "15484", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7614", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The concept of winning and losing is deeply ingrained in the Western approach to competition.  Much of this emphasis on the winning vs. losing dichotomy comes from exponential growth in professional sports and business-oriented intercollegiate athletics.  Sports are big business.  Now parents of young children are often pushing the win vs. lose concept beginning with teams for very young children through high school sports.  \nThis dissertation has three hypotheses:  While dichotomous characterizations of sporting achievement enjoy degrees of validity, they are insufficient; these insufficiencies can be shown metaphysically and normatively, and; traditions and practices of Zen Buddhism can be used effectively as a source for rival conceptions of sporting achievement.\nThis study examines winning and losing from a Western perspective by examining dualisms and dichotomies, complementary pairs, and Darwinian roots of dichotomies.  Then it examines the nature of sporting tests, test variations and related meanings, test contingencies and related meanings, the complexity and nature of sporting contests, test-contest relationships, and seven types of winning ~ losing.\nA brief history of Buddhism is presented, followed by a discussion on the four principles of Zen: meditation, mindfulness, moral action, and moral thought.  Then Zen principles and practices are translated into sport and movement.\nThe final chapter applies Zen philosophy to coaching youth baseball.  Practice and participation guidelines for youth baseball coaches discuss:  Zen mysticism, Zen as a high-demand practice, pragmatics, diversity, and self-transformation.  It concludes with a case study using a Zen-inspired coaching method on how to field grounders.  \nIf coaches stop placing an over-emphasis on winning vs. losing and encourage youth players to experience the game from a holistic, peaceful, and calm Zen approach, the children will begin to also have harmony and oneness with equipment, with their physical ~ mental approach to playing, and experience a self-transformation of seeing baseball without the mental clutter of anxiety or worry about winning vs. losing.  By using Zen coaching techniques, children and teens can learn to play the sport for the sake of the experience the game offers, the enjoyment of playing, and for the growth and development Zen and baseball offers in the sport and in life.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7549], "author_name_tesi": "Richardson, Brian Kayle", "last_name_ssi": "Richardson", "middle_name_ssi": "Kayle", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Linda L Caldwell", "Douglas Ray Hochstetler", "Mark Dyreson", "Karl Maxim Newell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Scott Kretchmar, Committee Chair", "Linda L Caldwell, Committee Member", "Douglas Ray Hochstetler, Committee Member", "Mark Dyreson, Committee Member", "Karl Maxim Newell, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Zen", "Buddhism", "Baseball", "Winning", "Losing", "Competition", "Philosophy", "Dichotomy", "Test", "Contest"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Oil, Power, and Universities: Political Struggle and Academic Advancement at the University of Texas and Texas A&M, 1876-1965\n", "id": "6565", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5770", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study traced the development of the University of Texas (UT) and Texas A&M (A&M) from their establishment in the 1870s and 1880s to the gradual collapse of desegregation and oppressive governmental control in the early 1960s.  UT and A&M did not begin to become competitive with public universities nationally until after the elimination of segregation and excessive government control in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  Throughout the period under study, UT and Texas A&M were hampered by low state appropriations, hostility towards higher education within the state government, battles to gain control over the Permanent University Fund (PUF), segregation, and paranoia rooted in racism and anticommunism. These conditions inhibited research activity and the improvement of academic standards, limited access to higher education for Texans, and compromised academic freedom.  In addition, debates at A&M regarding the legitimacy and practicality of an all-male student body (until 1963) and compulsory military training (abolished for the final time in 1965) overshadowed the institution's academic and research aspirations.  The thesis analyzed the impact of state government on higher education in Texas.

Chronic psychosocial stress has the capacity to cause physiological dysregulation by marking immune cells with proinflammatory phenotypes, increasing circulating C-reactive protein concentrations within the body (T. V. Johnson et al. 2013; Segerstrom and Miller 2004). As an indicator of chronic low-grade inflammation, C-reactive protein is associated with premature chronic disease onset and mortality (Danesh et al. 2004; Kaptoge et al. 2010; Ridker et al. 2000). This dissertation expands on prior work by examining chronic inflammation at the intersection of race and ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status to understand which individuals in society are most vulnerable to the cumulative effects of social disadvantage. Further, I explore body composition, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption as proximate risk factors potentially mediating the effect of social disadvantage on C-reactive protein. \n\tUsing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2010, findings reveal that all race and ethnicity by socioeconomic status demographic subgroups experience higher inflammation concentrations compared to non-poor white males and females, with the exception of non-poor Hispanic women who exhibit C-reactive protein levels on par with that of non-poor white women. Disparities in inflammation on account of social disadvantage are most evident among those aged 45-64 years and diminish for those 65 and older in both men and women. \nAmong women, proximate risk factors account for variation in inflammation levels among poor white women, poor black women, and non-poor black women. Poor Hispanic women\u2019s elevated inflammation levels persist after adjustment for proximate risk factors individually and as composite lifestyles. Similarly, among all male demographic subgroups, proximate risk factors, whether analyzed individually or as composite lifestyles, attenuate the strength of the focal association, but inflammation disparities persist. Thus, proximate risk factors explain higher C-reactive protein concentrations among most socially disadvantaged women, but only partially account for elevated inflammation levels among socially disadvantaged men. This study emphasizes that mechanisms explaining chronic low-grade inflammation vary across gender, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age group and interventions aimed to reduce health disparities in inflammation should reflect these heterogeneous pathways.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9950], "author_name_tesi": "Richman, Aliza Dresner", "last_name_ssi": "Richman", "middle_name_ssi": "Dresner", "first_name_ssi": "Aliza", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Matthews", "Melissa Hardy", "Jason Ramone Thomas", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Matthews, Dissertation Advisor", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Member", "Jason Ramone Thomas, Committee Member", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Social Disadvantage", "Chronic Inflammation", "C-reactive protein", "Health"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Plant-derived bioactives and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids as nutritional interventions for cardiovascular disease risk factors", "id": "29558", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12677", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nutritional interventions can be used to modify multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This dissertation research investigated the effects of plant-derived bioactives and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids on CVD risk factors. The first study evaluated whether incorporating 40 g of freeze dried strawberry powder into a high-fat meal altered postprandial vascular function or attenuated triglyceride, glucose, and insulin responses. Overweight but otherwise healthy adults (n = 30) consumed a control and strawberry meal in a randomized crossover design. Both meals significant decreased the augmentation index (p < 0.002) and significant increased serum triglycerides, insulin, and glucose compared to baseline (p < 0.001), but with no significant differences between meals. Longer-term strawberry supplementation may be needed to improve CVD risk factors. The second study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, crossover trial (8 wk treatment, 8 wk washout) investigating the effects of a pharmaceutical dose (3.4 g/d) of EPA+DHA on inflammatory responses to low-dose endotoxemia (intravenous 0.6 ng/kg purified lipopolysaccharide) in 20 healthy young men. Endotoxin administration produced a robust inflammatory response with consistent elevations in C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1; however, there was no difference in the peak concentration of any inflammatory markers following EPA+DHA supplementation compared to the olive oil control (p > 0.05). Omega-3 fatty acids may exert beneficial effects on inflammation via mechanisms other than cytokine production. The third study analyzed the effect of EPA+DHA supplementation on urinary isoprostane production following low-dose endotoxemia in two study populations: 1) described above and 2) healthy young adults (n = 17 [10M]) supplemented with 0, 300, 600, 900, or 1800 mg/d EPA+DHA for 5 months. In both studies, EPA+DHA increased F3-isoprostanes. In the study of healthy adults, EPA+DHA supplementation (600-1800 mg/d) attenuated total urinary isoprostane production in a model that also included body mass index. More research is needed to clarify whether omega-3s can attenuate acute oxidative stress. Although neither the strawberry nor the omega-3 intervention demonstrated a significant effect on the specified CVD risk factors, these null findings improve our understanding of these interventions and will aid in the development of future clinical studies of dietary bioactives.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11919], "author_name_tesi": "Richter, Chesney Kirstin", "last_name_ssi": "Richter", "middle_name_ssi": "Kirstin", "first_name_ssi": "Chesney", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Gordon Lee Jensen", "Sheila Grace West", "Eric Loken"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Dissertation Advisor", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Chair", "Gordon Lee Jensen, Committee Member", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member", "Eric Loken, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["inflammation", "fish oil", "endotoxemia", "strawberries", "oxidative stress", "arterial stiffness", "postprandial dysmetabolism"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "MECHANICAL INDUCTION OF LATERAL ROOT INITIATION\n\n", "id": "9432", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2066", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Unlike mammals whose development is limited to a short temporal window, plants produce organs de novo throughout their lifetime in order to adapt their architecture to the prevailing environmental conditions. Development of the root system represents a morphogenetic program where the positioning of new lateral organs occurs through the periodic recruitment of pericycle cells to become founder cells of a new lateral root (LR) primordium. While the hormone auxin appears intimately involved in specifying LR formation, it remains unclear why some pericycle cells are specified to initiate a LR while others are not. In the following thesis, I show that mechanical forces can act as one of the triggers for founder cell formation and so entrain the pattern of LR production to the environment. I observed that transient physical bending of the root was capable of eliciting LR formation to the convex side of the curve. Such mechanical stimulation triggered a Ca2+ transient within the pericycle, which was associated with the recruitment of ordinary pericycle cells to a LR founder cell fate. The initial establishment of the mechanically induced LR primordium was independent of an auxin supply from the shoot and was not disrupted by mutants in a suite of auxin transporters and receptor/response elements. \n\nMechanical forces have long been proposed to act as plant morphogenetic factors, however the cellular elements that translate mechanical force to a developmental signaling cascade have remained obscure. My observations indicate that in the case of mechanical induction of LR formation, the program of organogenesis may be triggered by mechanically elicited Ca2+ changes that can even suppress the requirement for many auxin-related elements normally involved in founder cell recruitment. Thus, the mechano-sensitive Ca2+ signaling system responsible for eliciting LR founder cell fate provides a potentially widespread mechanism whereby external and endogenous mechanical forces could be translated into morphogenetic programs during plant growth and development.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2048], "author_name_tesi": "Richter, Gregory Lorin", "last_name_ssi": "Richter", "middle_name_ssi": "Lorin", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Cyr", "Richard Cyr", "Simon Gilroy", "David Braun", "Randen Patterson", "Timothy W Mcnellis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Cyr, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Cyr, Committee Chair", "Simon Gilroy, Committee Member", "David Braun, Committee Member", "Randen Patterson, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ORGANOGENESIS", "ARABIDOPSIS", "ROOT ARCHITECTURE", "CALCIUM", "MECHANOSIGNAL TRANSDUCTION", "AUXIN", "INTRACELLULAR SIGNALLING"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "DNA preservation under extreme conditions", "id": "21122", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9698", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past thirty years the field of ancient DNA (aDNA) has expanded from looking at short DNA sequences from historic animals in museums to reconstructing entire genomes of extinct organisms.

Glycerin (42.5% food grade glycerol) was fed at 4% of ration DM replacing equivalent amounts of pure corn starch or sugar (sugar cane molasses) in the diet. The trial had 3 experimental periods 14 d each and d 1 through 9 were used for adaptation to the diets. Dry matter intake and milk yield were measured daily from d 10 to 14 and milk samples were taken on d 13 of each period. Blood samples were drawn from the jugular vein post-feeding for 4h on the last day of each period. Samples were taken every 10 min for the first hour and every 20 min thereafter. Dry matter intake did not differ among treatments and averaged 28.52\u00a1\u00d3 0.76 kg/d. Milk yield for cows provided the glycerin was lower than for cows fed sugar (39.2 vs. 42.12 \u00a1\u00d3 3.78). Milk yield for cows provided starch in the diet (41.06 kg/d \u00a1\u00d3 3.43 kg/d) tended (P = 0.08) to be higher than for those fed glycerin. Milk protein percentage was lower for cows fed glycerin (P < 0.01) compared to those fed diets containing sugar or starch and averaged 2.95, 3.03, 3.02%, respectively. Other milk components were not different among treatments. Blood concentrations of glucose and \u0192\u00d2-hydroxybutyrate were not affected by treatment and averaged 69 \u00a1\u00d3 2.5 mg/dL and 747 \u00a1\u00d3 36.8 \u00a3gmol/L, respectively. Blood concentration of insulin was greater (P < 0.05) for cows fed glycerin than those cows fed sugar (0.72 vs. 0.4 \u00a1\u00d3 0.17 ng/ml), however this did not differ from cows fed starch. At the level of inclusion used in this experiment, the liquid glycerin product used, negatively impacted milk yield and milk protein content. From these data, use of glycerin is not advised since it may result in economical losses.\n\nIn experiment I, glycerin was used as a feed ingredient replacing starch or sugar in the diet in a single effluent continuous culture system to asses the effects on ruminal fermentation and N metabolism. A 3 x 3 Latin square design was used to compare glycerin,  corn starch, and sugar molasses such that glycerin (42.5% food grade glycerol) was fed at 4% of ration DM replacing equivalent amounts of pure corn starch or sugar (sugar cane molasses) in the diet. The trial had 3 experimental periods of 9 d each, using the first 6 d for adaptation and the last 3 d for sampling. Fermenter effluent was collected daily and subsampled for analysis of volatile fatty acids (VFA), ammonia and DM content. Fermenters (1015 to 1040 ml in volume) were incubated with ruminal fluid (1 L) and ruminal digesta (25 g) from a cow receiving a diet with a 55:45 forage to concentrate ratio. Fermenters were fed 25 g DM of the experimental diets three times per day and the solids retention time was set at 24 h.  Replacing starch or molasses with glycerin, did not affect total VFA concentration (90.8 mmol/L) however, there was a numerical trend (P = 0.07) for higher acetate to propionate ratio when fermenters were provided glycerin vs. sugar (2.8 vs. 2.5). Butyrate molar proportion was lower (P < 0.01) for glycerin compared to starch or sugar (13, 16, and 18% of total VFA, respectively). Ammonia was highest (P < 0.01) for glycerin compared to sugar or starch and concentrations were 24.9, 8.8 and 11.8 mg/L, respectively. Dry matter digestibility tended to be higher (P < 0.07) for glycerin than for starch and sugar (61, 58, 57%, respectively). These results suggest that diet digestibility is increased by replacing some of the dietary starch with glycerin under the present experimental conditions. In addition, higher ammonia concentrations and lower butyrate in fermenters fed glycerin perhaps reflect changes in bacterial populations and inefficient use of nitrogen as ammonia compared to sources of starch or sugar; however, this requires further verification.\n\nIn experiment II, increasing levels of glycerin were evaluated for effects on ruminal fermentation during continuous culture. A 4 x 4 Latin square design was used to study four levels (0, 3, 5, and 8% of ration DM) of dry glycerin (min. 65% food grade glycerol) in the diet when replacing corn starch. The trial had 4 experimental periods of 9 d each, the first 6 d for adaptation and the last 3 d for sampling of effluent for DM content. Samples for VFA and ammonia were taken hourly for 5 h after feeding on day 9. Fermenters (1015 to 1040 ml in volume) were incubated with ruminal fluid (1 L) and ruminal digesta (25 g) from a cow receiving a diet with 16% CP, 32% NDF, and 25% starch. Fermenters were fed 25 g DM of the experimental diets three times per day and the solids retention time was set at 24 h. During the first 5 h after feeding, production of total VFA increased linearly (P <0.05) (76, 81, 86 and 87 mmol/L) while ratio of acetate to propionate decreased linearly (P < 0.01) (2.7, 2.3, 1.8 and 1.5) by increasing level of glycerin in the diet. Daily ammonia concentrations (9.49, 9.39, 8.07 and \t11.48 mg/dl) decreased quadratically (P < 0.05) with increasing glycerol in the diet suggesting a positive effect of glycerol on ammonia capture. Dry matter digestibility increased linearly (P < 0.01) with glycerin level and was 53.42, 52.38, 57.23 and 56.25% for the 0, 3, 5, 8% glycerin treatments, respectively. Ammonia concentrations decreased quadratically (P = 0.02) indicating a positive effect or dry glycerin on ammonia capture by bacteria. Under the present experimental conditions, replacement of starch with glycerin seemed to have positive effects, as shown by increased total VFA production, decreased acetate to propionate ratio, and higher DM digestibility.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1373], "author_name_tesi": "Rico Navarrete, Daniel Enrique", "last_name_ssi": "Rico Navarrete", "middle_name_ssi": "Enrique", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gabriella Anne Varga", "Gabriella Anne Varga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gabriella Anne Varga, Thesis Advisor", "Gabriella Anne Varga, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["glycerin", "milk production", "blood metabolites", "continuous culture", "ruminal fermentation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Recovery of normal ruminal biohydrogenation and de novo fatty acid synthesis following induction of milk fat depression in dairy cows", "id": "17581", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8530", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The opportunity exists to improve production efficiency on dairy farms by implementation of strategies conducive to maximal milk fat yield.

This condition is the result of altered ruminal fermentation that leads to the formation of specific intermediates of biohydrogenation (BH) of unsaturated fatty acids that reduce mammary lipid synthesis. The observation of time course of recovery of milk fat synthesis and the timing of associated changes following an episode of MFD provides insight into the mechanism.  Furthermore this knowledge is of great importance to management of the condition, as field nutritionists would benefit from understanding the time required to observe recovery after a dietary correction. The set of studies in the present dissertation characterized the time course of induction and recovery from MFD to be between 7 to 13 days and between 11 to 15 days, respectively. In addition, we identified the reduction in dietary concentration of polyunsaturated FA as the most important factor to correct in order promote restoration of normal BH and recover milk fat synthesis. Ruminal adaptation was corroborated as the rate-limiting step in the rate of recovery from MFD and the potential for dietary probiotics use to accelerate recovery of milk de novo fatty synthesis was demonstrated.

As our population continues to age these numbers are likely to grow significantly.  Estimates of the economic burden of treating this disease in 2005 are on the order of $17 billion and are expected to increase by as much as 50% by 2025.  As a result, the development of new therapeutic techniques designed to enhance bone formation and strength is a necessity.  One way to achieve such goals is to harness the proliferation and differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from skeletal tissue.  MSCs provide a source of new bone-forming osteoblasts important for skeletal homeostasis, but the factors that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of MSCs are not completely understood.  \n\tMechanical signals are widely accepted regulators of skeletal homeostasis, such that the addition of exogenous mechanical load enhances osteoblastic bone formation while inhibiting osteoclastic bone resoption.  Current hypotheses suggest that the deformation of bone in response to an applied load generate substrate strains that drive the movement of interstitial fluid and bone cells sense this fluid movement in the form of chemotransport or a shear stress across cell bodies and processes.  Indeed, numerous in vitro studies suggest that both osteoblastic and osteocytic cells respond to the predicted physiologic levels of fluid shear stress by releasing paracrine factors necessary for the anabolic response of bone to mechanical loads.  It is likely that fluid flow also regulates the behavior of MSCs, but there is little experimental evidence for this and the signaling cascades activated in MSCs in response to fluid flow have not been examined.  Thus the goals of this thesis are three-fold: 1) to examine the effect of oscillatory fluid flow on human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) proliferation and to identify candidate signaling cascades involved in this response; 2) to identify the factor that initiates the activation of these signaling cascades; and, 3) to identify the biophysical signal that hMSCs perceive.\n\tOne hour of fluid flow exposure induced a significant increase in cellular proliferation over static controls, indicating that like osteoblasts and osteocytes, hMSCs are responsive to fluid flow.  Since intracellular calcium is a vital mediator of the processes by which extracellular signals are conveyed to the cell\u2019s interior, we next examined whether calcium signaling pathways contribute to the effect of fluid flow on hMSC proliferation.  Fluid flow exposure triggered a robust, but transient increase in intracellular calcium concentration that was partially mediated by the activation of phospholipase C.  Increased intracellular calcium concentration stimulated the activation of the protein phosphatase calcineurin and the nuclear translocation of its target transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT).  Fluid flow also stimulated the activating, phosphorylation of the MAP kinases, ERK-1 and -2.  Pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin activation or ERK1/2 phosphorylation blocked the effect of fluid flow on hMSC proliferation.\n\tHaving determined that fluid flow stimulates hMSC proliferation, we attempted to identify the factor responsible for this response.  As previous studies from our laboratory and others suggested a role for extracellular ATP in osteoblastic and osteocytic mechanotransduction, we hypothesized that the release of ATP may also account for the mechanosensitivity of hMSCs.  hMSCs actively release ATP in response to fluid flow stimulation and express a number of purinergic receptors necessary to respond to extracellular nucleotides.  Treating hMSCs with ATP, but not other nucleotides, induced cellular proliferation at a level similar to fluid flow.  Further, enzymatically degrading extracellular nucleotides with apyrase abolished the effect of fluid flow on hMSC proliferation.  Degrading extracellular nucleotides also abrogated the effect of fluid flow on intracellular calcium signaling, the activation of calcineurin, and the nuclear translocation of NFAT.  These data strongly suggest that ATP is the factor that mediates the induction of hMSC proliferation in response to fluid flow.  \n\tFinally, we examined the contribution of chemotransport and fluid shear stress, two biophysical signals induced by interstitial fluid flow, to the effect of fluid flow on hMSC proliferation.  Alterations in chemotransport, but not fluid shear stress, altered the sensitivity of hMSCs to fluid flow.  We found that decreasing chemotransport inhibited hMSC proliferation as well as intracellular calcium signaling and ATP release in response to fluid flow.  Incrementally increasing fluid shear stress did not alter any of these parameters.  These data suggest the clearance of cellular metabolites and replacement of nutrient levels are a prerequisite for hMSC mechanotransduction.  \n\tIn summary, these studies provide new evidence that mechanical signals regulate the behavior of mesenchymal stem cells and outline for the first time the molecular mechanisms by which fluid flow affects these cells.  The similarities between the signaling cascades activated by fluid flow in more mature osteoblastic cells and in hMSCs imply that a common pathway exists by which mechanical signals are translated to cellular responses.  These data could be used in the development of new therapeutic techniques designed to enhance the recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells and promote there proliferation and subsequent differentiation into bone-forming osteoblasts.  Such techniques would be beneficial in the treatment of diseases in which decreased bone formation compromises the integrity of skeletal tissue.  Additionally, given the interest in hMSCs in tissue engineering protocols, these data could be applied in such a way as to control the phenotype of stem cells in vitro and drive their proliferation and differentiation towards specific lineages.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5108], "author_name_tesi": "Riddle, Ryan Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Riddle", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Donahue", "Sarah Bronson", "Douglas Cavener", "Christopher J Lynch", "Timothy Ritty"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Donahue, Committee Chair", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Christopher J Lynch, Committee Member", "Timothy Ritty, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Osteoporosis", "Mesenchymal stem cell", "Orthopaedics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Translating Overseas Student Teaching to First Year Teaching: An Exploration\n", "id": "12633", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3988", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\nThis dissertation examines the experiences of five first year teachers who completed their student teaching practicum in Trondheim, Norway.

This dissertation consists of 3 cross-sectional studies designed to better understand age- and sex-associated differences in this balance.  The first two studies characterize age and sex differences in maximal leg vascular conductance responses to local ischemia (study 1) and maximal isolated quadriceps exercise (study 2), as well as the maximal cardiac output response to whole body exercise (study 2).  The third study examined age differences in systemic and leg exercise hemodynamics and cardiac function in response to acute plasma volume (PV) expansion.  \nIn study 1, peak calf vasodilator capacity evoked by 10 min of arterial occlusion was examined as a function of age (20 to 79 yrs) in healthy women (197).  These women exhibited a 5-7% per decade decline in peak calf blood flow and vascular conductance with increasing age, nearly twice the rate of decline observed in a similarly aged male cohort tested in an identical manner (182).  This study suggested that maximal vasodilator capacity in the legs is better preserved with age in men than women.  This sex difference was not explained by differences in aerobic fitness (peak cycle oxygen uptake), which declined similarly in men and women (i.e., 7-8% per decade).  Matching of a subgroup of young and older subjects for fitness abolished the decline in vasodilator capacity in men but not in women, suggesting a sex-specific and fitness-independent effect of aging on the leg vasculature of women.  Study 2 examined maximal cardiac output (graded treadmill exercise to maximal exertion) and peak contraction-induced leg blood flow (single knee extensor exercise to maximal exertion) in younger (20-30 yrs) and older (60-75 yrs) men and women.  These findings indicated that systemic oxygen delivery capacity (maximal cardiac output and VO2peak) was positively correlated with active muscle vasodilator capacity, as measured by peak blood flow and conducting capacity of the contracting knee extensor muscles, in men but not women . This relationship was most pronounced in older men, regardless of how peripheral vasodilatory capacity was expressed or normalized. The disparate balance between maximal cardiac output and peripheral vascular reserve suggest different cardiovascular limitations to aerobic capacity in men and women particularly with aging.  \nStudy 3 attempted to further assess age and sex differences in the balance between central and peripheral blood flow during exercise.  Phase 1 experiments showed that PV expansion via 5% albumin acutely raised cardiac stroke volume and output at rest and during exercise in young women and men.  The effects of PV expansion on leg exercise hemodynamics were difficult to detect in older subjects and could not be dissociated from concurrent effects of hemodilution.  Phase 2 (follow-up) studies incorporated high resolution echocardiographic methods to assess the effects of PV expansion and posture during resting conditions on cardiac filling parameters, indexes of filling pressure, and cardiac stroke volume and output.  Additionally, these same echocardiographic metrics, along with C2H2 measurement of cardiac output, were acquired during upright cycling exercise up to near maximal exertion (80% of VO2peak).   At rest, in both the supine and seated postures young and older women had approximately the same ventricular filling pressure (indexed as the ratio of early filling velocity to mitral annular velocity, E/E\u2019).  At this consistent filling pressure the young women were able to augment early filling and increase end-diastolic volume (and therefore stroke volume) to a greater extent than older in both the supine and seated postures. Cardiac output was more labile in the young women, rising significantly in the supine compared to seated posture during normovolemia, a response only seen during hypervolemia in older women, when filling pressure was the highest.  Additionally, mitral valve deceleration slope was steeper and mitral annular velocity higher in the young women during both normovolemia and hypervolemia.  These results collectively suggest a more compliant ventricle in young women and a lack of sufficient reserve capacity in the older heart to normalize filling parameters or diastolic function to values observed in the young at rest.  Throughout exercise in the plasma volume expanded state the young had a more significant absolute increase in cardiac output than the older, mediated by a greater increase in stroke volume.  This did not translate into an increase in whole body oxygen consumption and therefore appears only to have corrected the hemodilution attendant to the PV expansion in both groups.  \nCollectively these studies demonstrate an aging female cardiovascular system that has both peripheral structural limits to vasodilation and a reduced ability to augment cardiac output via the Frank-Starling mechanism which could limit older women\u2019s ability to support the blood flow demands of working muscles compared with young women.  Further, the balance between peripheral dilatory capacity and cardiac function is sex-specific in aged humans.  Collectively these results suggest different mechanisms for optimizing the perfusion of active muscle in older men and women and that further investigations into the function of the aging cardiovascular system should analyze each sex individually as both peripheral arterial function, cardiac function and the interplay between these two demonstrates sex-specificity. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5621], "author_name_tesi": "Ridout, Samuel James", "last_name_ssi": "Ridout", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Samuel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor", "David Nathan Proctor", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Mosuk Chow", "Urs Andreas Leuenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor, Dissertation Advisor", "David Nathan Proctor, Committee Chair", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Member", "Mosuk Chow, Committee Member", "Urs Andreas Leuenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cardiac output", "aging", "women", "plasma volume expansion", "exercise"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "An Examination of Long-Lived Asset Impairments", "id": "6013", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1926", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Prior research reveals that write-offs of long-lived assets are both large in magnitude and frequent in occurrence.

The model was compared to an image theory and a stochastic ray tracing model\nto validate its overall accuracy. This validation showed good agreement.  The model was then used to simulate environments that were measured during the 2009 Sonic Booms On Big Structures (SonicBOBS) NASA experiment on Edwards AirForce Base. These environments were used for further validation to determine the accuracy when applied to a realistic sonic boom event. The Environmental Management (EM) building, a single building with surface irregularities,\nwas examined. Facade features, di\u000bffusion and surface absorption were varied to determine their impact. The EM building showed good comparison to the measured data. The model was then used to simulate an environment with multiple buildings. This did not show good agreement between the simulated and measured data even for microphones that were not affected by the presence of additional buildings. The reason for this is the location of the multiple building environment on\nthe edge of the boom carpet. It is concluded that the ray tracing/radiosity method is not valid for locations near the edge of the carpet. With these limitations in mind this model can successfully used to propagate sonic booms around buildings.\nThe impact of absorption was shown to be minimal for a single building. The loss of energy to diffuse reflections reduced the amount of specularly reflected energy \fsignificantly. The complexity of the facade features did not improve the accuracy of the results enough to warrant the additional computation time and memory required.\nThe method was then applied to an urban canyon environment. The perceived loudness (PLdB) on the sidewalk, the shape of the signal, and the pressure loading on the building wall were all examined. It was found that the PLdB increases as\nmuch as 7 dB from an environment with no buildings. While this increases the impact on people it does not drastically increase the impact over a single building environment. The PLdB can also be zero if it falls in a shadow zone. There was no observable trend between the parameters varied, building height, canyon width,\ninitial boom elevation angle and azimuthal angle and the sound level. Varying diffusion did have a significant\f effect on both the signal shape and the PLdB on the sidewalk. Diffusion could significantly reduce the impact on people at the\nground level.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3313], "author_name_tesi": "Riegel, Kimberly A", "last_name_ssi": "Riegel", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor Ward Sparrow", "Ute Poerschke", "David Carl Swanson", "Anthony A Atchley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor Ward Sparrow, Dissertation Advisor", "Ute Poerschke, Committee Member", "David Carl Swanson, Committee Member", "Anthony A Atchley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sonic Boom", "Ray Tracing", "Radiosity", "Acoustics", "Urban Environment"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "AN ANALYSIS OF THE MIRAI BOTNET AND ITS IMPACT ON THE FUTURE OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS", "id": "14014mqr5228", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14014", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Though botnets have been a security problem for a long time, they have recently begun taking advantage of the security vulnerabilities present in connected devices often referred to as the Internet of Things.

In late 2016, the source code for Mirai was released on a hacker forum. The goal of this thesis is to investigate Mirai, which is responsible for the largest botnets ever seen. We discuss its full functionality, focusing on how it spreads by taking advantage of weak authentication on devices. We take a look at the malware\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and how it may be - and probably currently is being - modified and improved. We collected real Mirai tra c in the wild and investigated how exactly it behaves so that we may distinguish between benign and malicious tra c. We find that Mirai tra c may be fingerprinted using deep-packet inspection and that it has evolved to attack more devices in the past several months. We then use these results to construct a picture of what the Mirai landscape currently looks like and where it is headed.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15003], "author_name_tesi": "Riegel, Meghan Carole", "last_name_ssi": "Riegel", "middle_name_ssi": "Carole", "first_name_ssi": "Meghan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick McDaniel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick McDaniel, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["mirai", "botnet", "internet of things", "malware", "iot"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EVALUATION OF CONCRETE SLABS USING AUTOMATED AIR-COUPLED IMPACT-ECHO METHOD\n", "id": "12581", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "701", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work examines the use of a prototype air-coupled impact-echo system for the locating of flaws in concrete slabs through nondestructive evaluation.  A brief background of the some of the theory behind the research is given.  Development and components of the prototype is covered.  Laboratory testing with slabs of known construction was carried out with both the prototype and a commercially available impact-echo testing system and results from those experiments are compared.  In situ and ex situ field testing of concrete slabs of unknown composition was carried out with the developed prototype.  Finally, a selected group of the slabs with unknown composition were forensically analyzed by destructive means and those results were compared to results gathered by the prototype during field testing.\nThe prototype impact-echo system is comprised of an automated impactor unit and control box that utilizes compressed air to pneumatically fire a ball bearing impactor, air-coupled piezoelectric microphones mounted within sound proofed enclosures, a dynamic signal analyzer to perform the analog to digital conversion of the signal, and a laptop computer.  The laptop computer accomplishes the tasks of controlling inputs to the impactor unit and the recording of signal generated from the impact, as well as other environmental and system data, through the use of a customized program based in National Instrument\u2019s LabVIEW program.\nResults from the laboratory testing carried out over the course of this work indicate that the air-coupled impact-echo system prototype developed produces results comparable to those produced by a commercially available testing system on slabs ranging in thickness from 5\u201d to 10\u201d and defects ranging in size from 4\u201d to 12\u201d in lateral extent.  The laboratory testing also demonstrated that the impactor unit and its impactors produced analogous results under varying system air pressures and between ball bearing and spring ball impactors.\nFindings from field testing and the forensic analysis of slabs of unknown composition suggest that the developed prototype can be a viable tool for detection of flaws under a set of given conditions.  Further additional adjustments to the prototype could be explored in order to further refine the system and develop a more robust system capable of ameliorating the limitations of the current prototype.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [695], "author_name_tesi": "Riewestahl, Brian ", "last_name_ssi": "Riewestahl", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Boothby", "Thomas E Boothby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Boothby, Thesis Advisor", "Thomas E Boothby, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nondestructive testing", "air-coupled", "impact-echo", "automated impactor"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Dynamic Pricing in an Urban Freight Environment\n", "id": "8385", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3986", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis proposes a dynamic, game-theoretic model of dynamic pricing in an urban freight environment with three distinct agent types: sellers, transporters and receivers.

The sellers compete to capture receiver demands, while the transporters compete to capture the transportation demand generated by the seller-receiver transactions. Each competing agent\u2019s best response problem is formulated as an optimal control problem and the set of these coupled optimal control problems is transformed into a differential variational inequality representing the general Nash equilibrium problem. A time discretization approximation is utilized to recast the game as a finite dimensional nonlinear complementarity problem.

For the differential variational inequality formulation, this dissertation presents and establishes convergence of an algorithm that solves day-to-day subproblems using a time-stepping approach and within-day subproblems using a continuous time fixed point scheme.
