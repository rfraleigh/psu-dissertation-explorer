This interest was particularly invigorated after results of microorganism dispersion from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) obtained the same results as the physical phenomena are. The growing interest in dispersion of airborne microorganisms revealed a need to disinfect indoor environment of buildings. This disinfection process of building indoor environments increases the occupants\u2019 health and decreases the overexposure risk of occupants to contaminants. A practical way to disinfect rooms with known presence of microorganisms, such as patient rooms or microbiology laboratories, uses upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UR-UVGI) lamps. However, performance of UR-UVGI lamps in the patient rooms depends on a transport phenomenon that is not completely understood. For instance, it is important to notice that the wavelength of UV-C emitted from the UR-UVGI lamps can be useful to inactivate DNA of microorganisms, but the same wavelength can be harmful to occupants\u2019 health.\nThe intention of the present master thesis is namely to study the UR-UVGI effectiveness in patient rooms by using CFD. To assess a realistic performance of UR-UVGI lamps in patient rooms, this thesis performed a sensitivity analysis on global results, such as the fraction of remaining microorganisms, by applying various simplifications on the boundary conditions. Then, this research study used two well-known particle dispersion and spatial distribution of microorganism concentration methods: (1) The Eulerian method, and (2) The Lagrangian method. This research study used two commercial CFD software, including the PHOENICS and the Fluent, to implement the Eulerian and the Lagrangian method. To expedite simulation computational time, the present research study utilized High Performance Computers (HP) at Pennsylvania State University. This research study assessed the quality of simulations with these two methods by comparing the results with the existing experimental studies in the literature. This validation provided confidence in the simulated results as well as an insight into efficient simulations for future research studies. \nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no single study that used various kinds of simplifications on the boundary conditions and used two microorganisms modeling approaches together. Additional research studies are needed to further validation of local microorganism concentration and improvement of simplifications. Finally, the CFD modeling methods and simplification applied in UR-UVGI CFD studies should be developed to improve accuracy of simulated results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4384], "author_name_tesi": "Heidarinejad, Mohammad ", "last_name_ssi": "Heidarinejad", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mohammad", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric", "Jelena Srebric"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric, Thesis Advisor", "Jelena Srebric, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["UR-UVGI lamp", "Patient room", "CFD"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Relative Significance of Heat Transfer Processes to Quantify Tradeoffs Between Complexity and Accuracy of Energy Simulations With a Building Energy Use Patterns Classification", "id": "21156", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9638", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation develops rapid and accurate building energy simulations based on a building classification that identifies and focuses modeling efforts on most significant heat transfer processes. The building classification identifies energy use patterns and their contributing parameters for a portfolio of buildings. The dissertation hypothesis is \u201cBuilding classification can provide minimal required inputs for rapid and accurate energy simulations for a large number of buildings\u201d. The critical literature review indicated there is lack of studies to (1) Consider synoptic point of view rather than the case study approach, (2) Analyze influence of different granularities of energy use, (3) Identify key variables based on the heat transfer processes, and (4) Automate the procedure to quantify model complexity with accuracy. Therefore, three dissertation objectives are designed to test out the dissertation hypothesis: (1) Develop different classes of buildings based on their energy use patterns, (2) Develop different building energy simulation approaches for the identified classes of buildings to quantify tradeoffs between model accuracy and complexity, (3) Demonstrate building simulation approaches for case studies.\nPenn State\u2019s and Harvard\u2019s campus buildings as well as high performance LEED NC office buildings are test beds for this study to develop different classes of buildings. The campus buildings include detailed chilled water, electricity, and steam data, enabling to classify buildings into externally-load, internally-load, or mixed-load dominated. The energy use of the internally-load buildings is primarily a function of the internal loads and their schedules. Externally-load dominated buildings tend to have an energy use pattern that is a function of building construction materials and outdoor weather conditions. However, most of the commercial medium-sized office buildings have a mixed-load pattern, meaning the HVAC system and operation schedule dictate the indoor condition regardless of the contribution of internal and external loads. To deploy the methodology to another portfolio of buildings, simulated LEED NC office buildings are selected. The advantage of this approach is to isolate energy performance due to inherent building characteristics and location, rather than operational and maintenance factors that can contribute to significant variation in building energy use. A framework for detailed building energy databases with annual energy end-uses is developed to select variables and omit outliers. The results show that the high performance office buildings are internally-load dominated with existence of three different clusters of low-intensity, medium-intensity, and high-intensity energy use pattern for the reviewed office buildings. Low-intensity cluster buildings benefit from small building area, while the medium- and high-intensity clusters have a similar range of floor areas and different energy use intensities. Half of the energy use in the low-intensity buildings is associated with the internal loads, such as lighting and plug loads, indicating that there are opportunities to save energy by using lighting or plug load management systems. A comparison between the frameworks developed for the campus buildings and LEED NC office buildings indicates these two frameworks are complementary to each other. Availability of the information has yielded to two different procedures, suggesting future studies for a portfolio of buildings such as city benchmarking and disclosure ordinance should collect and disclose minimal required inputs suggested by this study with the minimum level of monthly energy consumption granularity.\nThis dissertation developed automated methods using the OpenStudio API (Application Programing Interface) to create energy models based on the building class. ASHRAE Guideline 14 defines well-accepted criteria to measure accuracy of energy simulations; however, there is no well-accepted methodology to quantify the model complexity without the influence of the energy modeler judgment about the model complexity. This study developed a novel method using two weighting factors, including weighting factors based on (1) computational time and (2) easiness of on-site data collection, to measure complexity of the energy models. Therefore, this dissertation enables measurement of both model complexity and accuracy as well as assessment of the inherent tradeoffs between energy simulation model complexity and accuracy. The results of this methodology suggest for most of the internal load contributors such as operation schedules the on-site data collection adds more complexity to the model compared to the computational time. \nThe third objective deployed the developed building classification and energy simulation approaches to two well-instrumented case studies. In the first case study, without the use of on-site data except the building energy consumption, the developed methods successfully predict the natural gas consumption, while the electricity consumption requires additional inputs beyond the building energy consumption. The second case study exhibited an opposite pattern of outcomes, meaning the developed methods successfully predict the electricity consumption, while the natural gas consumption requires additional inputs. For the first case study with additional site visit data, and for the second case study with using monthly building indoor temperature readings, the developed methods provide accurate predictions for both natural gas and electricity consumptions that have met the ASHRAE Guideline 14 requirements, to have CV below 15%. It is important to note this guideline provides accuracy measurement criteria for a well-calibrated model for which an energy modeler typically performs multiple site visits and reviews detailed building documentation to obtain inputs for the building model. In addition, with the exclusion of three outlier months from the analyses, the results without any additional inputs have met the accuracy requirement. The conducted energy simulations for the two case studies revealed that there are key variables such as outdoor air fraction, infiltration rate, and monthly HVAC setpoints especially for the shoulder months (April-May and October-November) that are not included in the building energy database due to the difficulty of on-site measurements. Use of these variables in the building classification and modeling can increase the accuracy of energy simulation to the required level of acceptance. \nOverall, this study provided specific data on tradeoffs between accuracy and model complexity that points to critical inputs for different building classes, rather than an increase in the volume and detail of model inputs as the current research and consulting practice indicates.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9399], "author_name_tesi": "Heidarinejad, Mohammad ", "last_name_ssi": "Heidarinejad", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mohammad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric", "Dr Jelena Srebric", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni", "Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Seth Adam Blumsack"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Jelena Srebric, Committee Chair", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni, Committee Member", "Hosam Kadry Fathy, Committee Member", "Seth Adam Blumsack, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Building energy simulation", "building energy use patterns classification", "campus buildings", "LEED certified buildings", "OpenStudio"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "HIGH-PERFORMANCE POLYMER/LAYERED SILICATE NANOCOMPOSITES\n", "id": "7843", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4169", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High-performance layered-silicate nanocomposites of Polycarbonate (PC), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and their blends were produced via conventional melt-blending techniques. The focus of this thesis was on the fundamentals of dispersion, control of thermal stability, maintenance of melt-blending processing conditions, and on optimization of the composites\u2019 mechanical properties via the design of controlled and thermodynamically favorable nano-filler dispersions within the polymer matrices.\nPET and PC require high temperatures for melt-processing, rendering impractical the use of conventional/commercial organically-modified layered-silicates, since the thermal degradation temperatures of their ammonium surfactants lies below the typical processing temperatures. Thus, different surfactant chemistries must be employed in order to develop melt-processable nanocomposites, also accounting for polymer matrix degradation due to water (PET) or amine compounds (PC). Novel high thermal-stability surfactants were developed and employed in montmorillonite nanocomposites of PET, PC, and PC/PET blends, and were compared to the respective nanocomposites based on conventional quaternary-ammonium modified montmorillonites. Favorable dispersion was achieved in all cases, however, the overall material behavior \u2013i.e., the combination of crystallization, mechanical properties, and thermal degradation\u2013 was better for the nanocomposites based on the thermally-stable surfactant fillers.\nStudies were also done to trace, and ultimately limit, the matrix degradation of Polycarbonate/montmorillonite nanocomposites, through varying the montmorillonite surfactant chemistry, processing conditions, and processing additives. Molecular weight degradation was, maybe surprisingly, better controlled in the conventional quaternary ammonium based nanocomposites \u2013even though the thermal stability of the organically modified montmorillonites was in most cases the lowest. Dependence of the resultant nanocomposites\u2019 mechanical properties on the preferential alignment of the montmorillonite nano-platelet was also evaluated. Highly aligned filler platelets did not result in an additional enhancement in mechanical properties.\n\tPC/PET blends and their respective PC/PET/montmorillonite nanocomposites were synthesized and compared. The dispersion of the organically modified nano-fillers in the PC/PET blends was controlled via thermodynamic considerations, realized through proper surfactant choice: Nanocomposites in which the layered silicate was preferentially sequestered in the PET phase were designed and synthesized. This preferential dispersion of the nano-filler in the PET phase of the PC/PET blend was insensitive to processing conditions, including approaches employing a master-batch (filler concentrate); regardless of the master-batch matrix, both PC and PET were employed, thermodynamics drove the layered silicate to preferentially migrate to the PET phase of the PC/PET blend. \n\tIn a second approach, the development of a nanocomposite with controlled PC/PET compatibilization near the montmorillonite platelets, in absence of appreciable transesterification reactions, led to the formation of very high performance nanocomposites. These latter systems, point to an exciting new avenue of future considerations for nanocomposite blends with selective nano-filler dispersions, where performance can be tailored via the controlled preferential dispersion of nano-fillers in one phase, or by filler-induced polymer compatibilization.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4144], "author_name_tesi": "Heidecker, Matthew J", "last_name_ssi": "Heidecker", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Evangelos Manias", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare", "Charles E Bakis", "Ronald Hedden", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Evangelos Manias, Committee Chair", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Committee Member", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member", "Ronald Hedden, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["exfoliated", "intercalated", "composite", "modulated DSC", "crystallization", "ductility", "mechanical properties", "PC", "PET", "non-compatibilized", "compatibilized", "high-peformance nanocomposites", "polymer nanocomposites", "polymer physics", "high temperature surfactants", "imidazolium", "quaternary ammonium surfactants", "melt-blending", "injection molding"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Citation-Based Assessment Of The Performance Of U.S. Boiling Water Reactors Following Extended Power Up-Rates ", "id": "15228", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7742", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nuclear power plants produce 20 percent of the electricity generated in the U.S. Nuclear generated electricity is increasingly valuable to a utility because it can be produced at a low marginal cost and it does not release any carbon dioxide.  It can also be a hedge against uncertain fossil fuel prices.  The construction of new nuclear power plants in the U.S. is cautiously moving forward, restrained by high capital costs.  Since 1998, nuclear utilities have been increasing the power output of their reactors by implementing extended power up-rates.  Power increases of up to 20 percent are allowed under this process.  The equivalent of nine large power plants has been added via extended power up-rates.  These up-rates require the replacement of large capital equipment and are often performed in concert with other plant life extension activities such as license renewals.\nThis dissertation examines the effect of these extended power up-rates on the safety performance of U.S. boiling water reactors.  Licensing event reports are submitted by the utilities to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal nuclear regulator, for a wide range of abnormal events.  Two methods are used to examine the effect of extended power up-rates on the frequency of abnormal events at the reactors.  The Crow/AMSAA model, a univariate technique is used to determine if the implementation of an extended power up-rate affects the rate of abnormal events.  The method has a long history in the aerospace industry and in the military. At a 95-percent confidence level, the rate of events requiring the submission of a licensing event report decreases following the implementation of an extended power up-rate.  It is hypothesized that the improvement in performance is tied to the equipment replacement and refurbishment that is performed as part of the up-rate process.\nThe reactor performance is also analyzed using the proportional hazards model.  This technique allows for the estimation of the effects of multiple independent variables on the event rate.  Both the Cox and Weibull formulations were tested.  The Cox formulation is more commonly used in survival analysis because of its flexibility.  The best Cox model included fixed effects at the multi-reactor site level.  The Weibull parametric formulation has the same base hazard rate as the Crow/AMSAA model.  This theoretical connection was confirmed through a series of tests that demonstrated both models predicted the same base hazard rates.  The Weibull formulation produced a model with most of the same statistically significant variables as the Cox model.  The beneficial effect of extended power up-rates was predicted in the proportional hazards models as well as the Crow/AMSAA model.  The Weibull model also indicated an effect that can be traced back to a plant\u2019s construction.  Performance was also found to improve in plants that had been divested from their original owners.  \nThis research developed a consistent evaluation toolkit for nuclear power plant performance using either a univariate method that allows for simple graphical evaluation at its heart or a more complex multivariate method that includes the effects of several independent variables with data that are available from public sources.  Utilities or regulators with access to proprietary data may be able to expand upon this research with additional data that is not readily available to an academic researcher.  Even without access to special data, the methods developed are valuable tools in evaluating and predicting nuclear power plant reliability performance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7675], "author_name_tesi": "Heidrich, Brenden ", "last_name_ssi": "Heidrich", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Brenden", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Samuel Oyewole", "Samuel Oyewole", "Jamal Rostami", "R Larry Grayson", "Andris Freivalds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Samuel Oyewole, Dissertation Advisor", "Samuel Oyewole, Committee Chair", "Jamal Rostami, Committee Member", "R Larry Grayson, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nuclear Power", "Nuclear Safety", "Reliability", "Failure Analysis", "Energy Economics", "regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Thermo-mechanical Model Development and Experimental Validation for Directed Energy Deposition Additive Manufacturing Processes", "id": "25008", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11058", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Additive manufacturing (AM) enables parts to be built through the layer-by-layer addition of molten metal. In directed energy deposition (DED) AM, metal powder or wire is added into a melt pool that follows a pattern to fill in the cross section of the part. When compared to traditional manufacturing processes, AM has many\nadvantages such as the ability to make internal features and to repair high-value parts. However, the large thermal gradients generated by AM result in plastic deformation. Thermo-mechanical models must be developed to predict the temperature and distortion produced by this process.\n\nThermo-mechanical models have been developed for AM by several investigators. These models are often validated by measuring the temperatures during the deposition of a small part and the final distortion of the part. Unfortunately this is not a sufficient\nvalidation method for the non-linear thermo-mechanical model. Although good agreement between the thermal model and the temperatures measured during a small depositions can be achieved, it does not necessarily mean that the model will be accurate for an industrially relevant part that requires 10^2 - 10^4 tracks and hours of processing time. The relatively small deviations between the model and the validation will propagate when modeling large depositions and could produce inaccurate results. The errors in a large part will be increased further if the assumptions made of the\nthermal boundary conditions are not appropriate for the system.\n\nThe objective of this work is to develop and experimentally validate thermo-mechanical models for DED. Experiments are performed to characterize the distortion induced by laser cladding. The depositions require many tracks and nearly an hour of processing time, during which the temperature and the deflection are measured in situ so that the response of the plate to each deposition track is understood. Measurements are then made of the convection caused by two different laser deposition heads. Thermo-mechanical models are developed by implementing the measured rate of convective heat transfer and the temperature dependent material properties. The models are validated using in situ measurements of the temperature\nand the deflection generated during the process, as well as post-process measurements of the residual stress and the distorted\nshape.

Many factors influence RNA folding, including proteins, small molecules, salt, temperature, and pH.   Human protein kinase PKR is a component of the innate immune response, and is activated by long stretches of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), but is inhibited by highly structured or short dsRNAs.  Activation of PKR often results in inhibition of protein synthesis.  The types of RNAs encountered by PKR in the cell are diverse in structure and function, including mRNA, miRNA, tRNA, rRNA and viral RNAs. While PKR regulation by human cellular RNAs has not been extensively studied, it is known that PKR is activated by viral dsRNA genomes and long dsRNA replicative intermediates.  The work presented in this thesis focused primarily on trapping and characterizing a unique RNA fold and then examining PKR regulation by that RNA.   \n    Experiments were performed using a diverse collection of viral and cellular RNAs, as well as model RNAs.  Viral RNAs, including a small hairpin (TAR) from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-I) and various length sequences from hepatitis delta virus (HDV), are single-stranded, but form complex secondary and/or tertiary structures.  Both TAR RNA and the ribozyme portion of HDV are reported herein to form dimers and/or aggregates, which are found to be PKR activating species.  Longer HDV sequences, which are rod-shaped and do not include continuous double-stranded RNA sequence greater than 20-bp, are still found to be potent PKR activators.    \n    Cellular RNAs have not been extensively examined as PKR regulators.  It was our hyphothesis that most cellular RNAs have evolved defects to avoid activating or inhibiting PKR.  We examined one cellular RNA, precursor miRNA 374a, which is reported herein to be an inhibitor of PKR. Precursor miRNAs are ~70-nt and are very structured with multiple bulges and mismatches.  Removing defects and replacing them with Watson-Crick GC base pairs improves the ability of partially truncated pre-miRNAs to inhibit PKR.  Another finding is that PKR activation at low pH is RNA-independent and represents a novel PKR response.  Surprisingly, partially truncated pre-miRNA sequences were very potent inhibitors of RNA-independent activation of PKR at low pH, while only a weak inhibitors at high pH.  \n    Lastly, three separate studies were performed using model RNAs in an effort to understand the effects of RNA helical defects and dimerization on PKR activation, as well as to attempt to crystallize a minimal RNA binding register with p20 (dsRNA binding domain of PKR).  The first study examined the effects of RNA helical defect position, size, and geometry on PKR activation.  Positioning a bulge in the center of a helix, increasing bulge size, and orienting RNAs in cis or trans geometry decreased PKR activation relative to perfect double-stranded RNA.  These results may be useful for predicting PKR activators.  The second study investigated PKR activation by ternary complexes comprised of TAR dimers linked by base pairing to a bridging DNA oligo.  Although all attempts to design a PKR activating complex were unsuccessful, rationale for designing complexes and native gel analyses are provided.  Lastly, a third study involved preparing a ternary complex comprised of p20/stem-loop RNAs/U1A for crystallography.  Preliminary gel-shift data and purification protocols are provided.  Overall, the work in this thesis provides guidelines for predicting the ability of an RNA to activate or inhibit PKR.  \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3682], "author_name_tesi": "Heinicke, Laurie Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Heinicke", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Laurie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

Unlike most frogs, they lay eggs on land which hatch into froglets rather than tadpoles (direct development). In order to better understand the evolutionary pattern of this group, I have gathered DNA sequence data for over 300 terraranan species. Several main results have emerged. First, most terraranan species fall into four main groups (genera), each predominating in a different geographic region (Central America, the West Indies, northern and western South America, and southeast Brazil). Molecular clock analyses show that these genera are relatively young (between 20 and 50 million years old). Because land connections among Central America, the West Indies, and South America were broken by the beginning of the Cenozoic, these times of divergence suggest parallel origins by overwater dispersal for the West Indian and Central American clades. By using broad taxonomic sampling, and performing analyses with multiple nuclear and mitochondrial genes, a well-supported phylogeny was produced which is the basis of a new classification of terraranan frogs. An enigmatic undescribed frog was placed in a 17-gene molecular phylogeny. This phylogeny demonstrated that it represents the most basal species in Terrarana.

One of the cheapest, most effective ways of controlling malaria is by targeting the anopheline mosquitoes which transmit it. This is primarily accomplished via the use of chemical insecticides, which may be integrated into bed nets or applied as spray treatments to indoor walls. However, wild mosquitoes are rapidly evolving resistance to all four classes of chemicals currently approved for indoor use, spurring research to identify new control technologies.\nFungal entomopathogens are one such tool. Fungal spores act as contact pesticides and may be deployed in a manner similar to chemicals. While chemicals are selected to kill or knock down mosquitoes within hours of exposure, fungal entomopathogens may require a week or more to kill exposed mosquitoes. However, the parasite which causes malaria also requires at least nine days to mature within the vector before it can be transmitted to a new host, and both this extrinsic incubation period and mosquito survival time following fungal exposure are strongly dependent on environmental temperature. Because little was known about the relationship between temperature and fungal virulence (defined here as rate of kill), we evaluated virulence of the candidate fungal biopesticide Beauveria bassiana  in anopheline mosquitoes across the range of temperatures relevant for malaria transmission. We found that the fungus consistently killed the vast majority of mosquitoes before they would have been expected to begin transmitting malaria (i.e. in a shorter period of time than the malarial extrinsic incubation period). This result was robust across different diets (mosquitoes fed exclusively on sugar vs. blood fed), species (Anopheles stephensi and Anopheles gambiae) and levels of diurnal temperature variation (\u00b10\u00b0C, \u00b16\u00b0C). We also evaluated the fungus in mosquitoes infected with malaria but found no evidence of an effect of fungal co- or superinfection on malaria infection parameters or on mosquito mortality rate. Theoretical modeling predicted that realistic levels of fungal coverage could deliver significant reductions in infectious adult mosquito population density. When combined with mean temperature data from across Africa, our results suggested that, if fungus was deployed at sufficiently high coverage levels, temperature would have a limited impact on the ability of this biopesticide to suppress malaria-infectious mosquito populations. \nWe parameterized our model based on data collected at constant temperatures. However, temperatures in the field tend to vary even over the course of a single day. Because mosquitoes are small-bodied ectotherms, their body temperature and the temperature of the pathogens they carry will vary along with the temperature in their environment. Because organismal performance tends to be nonlinearly related to temperature, it has long been recognized that performance rates under constant temperatures may not be equivalent to those under fluctuating conditions, a phenomenon known as the Kaufmann effect. While this is often accounted for by summing incremental rates over the range of temperatures experienced, there are indications that this rate summation technique does not always accurately predict the impacts of realistic levels of diurnal temperature variation. We tested the accuracy of rate summation by measuring in vitro radial growth rate of B. bassiana at constant temperatures to create a thermal performance norm curve. We then used rate summation to predict the impacts of diurnal temperature variation and tested these predictions empirically. We found that the accuracy of rate summation depended both on mean temperature and on the patterns of diurnal temperature variation. At moderate levels of variation, rate summation was accurate, but at high levels, rate summation overestimated performance at the warm end of the curve. We also found that initial growth conditions significantly affected estimates of the critical thermal maximum, or the temperature above which no growth should occur. Acute exposure to temperatures above the critical thermal maximum paused growth in a time- and temperature-dependent manner, but once growth resumed, growth rate was not significantly different from controls in the majority of treatments.\nBased on these results, we concluded that fungal biopesticides have the potential to significantly reduce infectious mosquito density and that, based on the results of our rate summation experiment, our modeling predictions regarding malaria mosquito control likely underestimate fungal impact under more realistic fluctuating temperature conditions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10358], "author_name_tesi": "Heinig, Rebecca Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Heinig", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Brian Thomas", "Andrew Fraser Read", "Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Jason Laurence Rasgon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Brian Thomas, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Fraser Read, Committee Member", "Tracy Lee Langkilde, Committee Member", "Jason Laurence Rasgon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["malaria", "Anopheles mosquito", "vector control", "fungal biopesticide", "rate summation", "diurnal temperature variation"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "STUDY OF THE IRON SULFUR CLUSTER AND POLYPEPTIDE COMPOSITION OF THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC REACTION CENTER FROM HELIOBACTERIUM MODESTICALDUM  ", "id": "7567", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4238", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-01-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The photosynthetic reaction center from Heliobacterium modesticaldum (HbRC) was studied using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques. The purpose of the work was to obtain a better understanding of the electron transfer cofactors and polypeptides that comprise the HbRC. The major findings include: (1) the HbRC loosely binds a ferredoxin-like protein that harbors two iron-sulfur clusters. This protein, which dissociates from the HbRC when it is passed over an anion exchange resin, was named PshB. HbRC complexes purified in this manner are henceforth referred to as HbRC cores. PshB can also be removed from HbRC complexes at high ionic strength and purified by passage over an ultrafiltration membrane. PshB was shown to restore the light-induced EPR signal of [FA/FB]- (visible at low temperatures), and the characteristic flash-induced kinetic decay of P798+ when recombined with HbRC cores. (2) HbRC cores bind an interpolypeptide iron sulfur cluster termed FX. When HbRC cores are incubated with sodium dithionite in the presence of light, FX undergoes a one-electron reduction. Mossbauer and EPR data indicate the reduced cluster has a ground spin state of S=3/2. (3) Analysis of the non-heme iron content shows that HbRC cores bind 21.1 \u00b1 1.1 Bchl g/P798.  (4) The PshB protein was cloned from H. modesticaldum using knowledge of the N-terminal sequence of Fd2, a ferredoxin that had been isolated previously from Heliobacillis mobilis. When Fd2 is overexpressed in Escherichia coli with a His affinity tag and reconstituted with iron and sulfide, the holoprotein was found to co-purify with HbRC cores when subject to G-75 gel filtration chromatography and Ni-affinity chromatography. Similar to PshB from H. modesticaldum, the overexpressed Fd2 holoprotein restores the light-induced EPR signal of [FA/FB]- and the characteristic flash-induced kinetic decay of P798+ when recombined with HbRC cores. This work indicates the function of Fd2 is now properly assigned: instead of representing a soluble ferredoxin, Fd2 is PshB and is normally bound to the HbRC complex.

A selective emitter increases efficiency by heavily doping the region directly below the front-side metal contacts, providing a potential energy barrier for the minority charge carriers and thus lowering recombination at the metal-semiconductor interface. Laser doping provides a very attractive method to create the selective emitters due to its ability to locally heat and dope the surface of the cell without additional patterning steps. \nThis work investigates the influence of laser processing parameters and dopant concentration in the creation of selective emitters. Q-switched lasers of 1064, 532, and 355 nm wavelengths are used at a range of pulse energies on p-type FZ silicon with a pre-deposited thin n+ dopant film with varying thickness. In addition to the pulsed lasers, a 1070 nm continuous wave laser is used with varying power and pulse duration.

Approximately 0.5% of acute infections terminate in fatal, fulminant hepatitis.  The WHO currently estimates that 350-400 million people are chronically infected with HBV.  In the United States of America, approximately 12 million people have been infected, more than 1.25 million chronically infected, with 5,000 deaths per year caused by HBV and its complications (Hepatitis B Foundation).\n     The primary treatment for chronic HBV is lamivudine.  The major clinical limitation of lamivudine is the emergence of drug-resistant mutants.  The most common mutations occur in the highly conserved tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif in the catalytic domain of the HBV polymerase gene, resulting in substitutions of methionine to either valine or isoleucine at amino acid 204.  Another common mutation arising during chronic HBV infection develops in the precore/core region of the HBV genome.  Precore-negative chronic hepatitis B is the most prevalent form of chronic HBV in many parts of the world.   Understanding the consequences of mutation in the hepatitis B virus genome on HBV replication is critical for treating chronic HBV infection.\n     Initial studies of this Dissertation focus on the replication of the precore (PC) and lamivudine-resistant rtM204I mutant of HBV.  Previously, others have performed in vitro studies on the PC mutant, reporting conflicting results with some suggesting that the PC mutant has an inherent replication advantage compared to wild-type (WT) HBV.  The pattern and magnitude of HBV replication when initiated by a PC HBV recombinant baculovirus were similar to what was observed for WT HBV throughout the time course examined.  Therefore, more extensive studies with the PC mutant were not carried out.  During the first five days post-transduction, the rtM204I mutant replicates to levels comparable to WT HBV, in contrast to previous reports suggesting that the rtM204I mutant has a severe defect in replication compared to WT HBV.  However, by day 10 post-transduction, rtM204I levels of intra- and extracellular HBV DNA were markedly reduced compared to WT HBV.  Although the rtM204I mutation reduced production of HBV replicative intermediates, no effect on the levels of covalently closed circular DNA or HBV transcripts was observed at late time points.  Cotransduction studies with different ratios of WT and rtM204I baculovirus show that rtM204I does not produce a product that inhibited HBV replication.  However, the combination of WT and rtM204I yielded HBV DNA levels at late time points greater than WT alone, suggesting that WT polymerase may function in trans to boost rtM204I replication.  Collectively, the data demonstrate that the rtM204I mutation generates a polymerase that is not only resistant to lamivudine but also replicates nucleic acids to lower levels in vitro at late time points in the recombinant baculovirus system when replication is driven primarily from CCC DNA.\n     Recombinant baculoviruses expressing the WT hepatitis B virus polymerase were utilized to determine if the WT polymerase could correct the defect in reverse transcription at late time points post-transduction of rtM204I.  Expression of a functional WT polymerase was confirmed through the restoration of replication of a polymerase-minus HBV mutant.  WT polymerase can indeed restore rtM204I replicative intermediates and extracellular DNA levels without affecting the level of covalently closed circular DNA.  Analysis of the genetically marked viral genomes verified that this restoration resulted from trans-complementation, rather than recombination.  Furthermore, WT polymerase can function in trans to complement viral replication regardless of whether the RNA packaging signal, epsilon, which is required to activate the polymerase, was provided in cis.  In contrast, the enhanced levels of total HBV RI observed when HepG2 cells were cotransduced with baculoviruses expressing the WT and rtM204I genomes was not due to trans-complementation of rtM204I by the WT polymerase.  The data indicate that HBV polymerase can function in trans, without the requirement of the epsilon RNA in cis, in either RNA packaging or DNA synthesis in vivo.  WT polymerase also has the capacity to trans-complement the replication defect of the polymerase mutant rtM204I; however, trans-complementation may require polymerase over-expression from a packaging-defective RNA.  In contrast, when expressed from an authentic pregenomic RNA, as in a mixed infection, polymerase may not trans-complement efficiently.\n     To continue the extensive analysis to identify where the block in replication of rtM204I occurs, the next step tested was RNA encapsidation.  However, encapsidation has not been characterized in the HBV recombinant baculovirus system.  Detectable levels of encapsidation by Southern blot first becomes visible approximately 10h post-transduction, with HBV SS DNA arising by 14h, RC/DS DNA by 24h, and EC DNA by 48h.  Once encapsidation was characterized, WT and rtM204I levels of RNA encapsidation were measured.  It is clear that the block in rtM204I replication does not occur at the level of RNA encapsidation, suggesting that the defect is either at the step of reverse transcription or DNA-to-DNA synthesis.  Additionally, partial restoration of rtM204I replication by the WT polymerase construct, PCFE, does not cause an increase in RNA encapsidation compared to rtM204I alone, suggesting that more than one polymerase molecule may be packaged within a nucleocapsid, at least when excess WT polymerase is over-expressed from a packaging-defective RNA during trans-complementation of a drug-resistant mutant.\n     To begin to directly compare the function of the WT and rtM204I polymerases, the endogenous polymerase reaction was used.  The rtM204I polymerase does not show increased activity when dNTP concentrations exceed 20&#956;M, in contrast to a previous report.  The rtM204I polymerase appears to be functionally hindered and unaffected by dNTP concentrations, although the effect of increasing dNTP concentrations in vivo still needs to be tested.\n     Collectively, the research described within this Dissertation narrows down the step where the defect in rtM204I replication occurs.  That is, at the level of reverse transcription or DNA-to-DNA synthesis.  Results generated from trans-complementation of rtM204I by a WT polymerase demonstrate that replication of rtM204I can be partially restored.  In addition, results suggest that more than one polymerase molecule may be packaged within a nucleocapsid under certain conditions.  Finally, the rtM204I polymerase appears to also be defective in the in vitro endogenous polymerase reaction.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5071], "author_name_tesi": "Heipertz Jr, Richard Arthur", "last_name_ssi": "Heipertz Jr", "middle_name_ssi": "Arthur", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet C Isom", "Harriet C Isom", "Richard James Courtney", "David Joseph Spector", "Jianming Hu", "Kristin Ann Eckert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harriet C Isom, Dissertation Advisor", "Harriet C Isom, Committee Chair", "Richard James Courtney, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["in vitro replication", "HBV", "rtM204I mutant", "lamivudine-resistant"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Transcriptional interference drives the evolution of mammalian nested genes", "id": "8g84mm241", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12812", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nested genes are common in the genomes of higher eukaryotes.

Subsequent analysis of same-strand nested genes reveals an overrepresentation of intronless internal nested genes, and uncovers a positive nonlinear correlation between the number of splice sites in internal nested genes and the distance between external and internal nested gene splice sites, suggesting that mammalian nested gene evolution is also driven by transcriptional interference during RNA splicing.

An NCT reconstruction is comprised of individual volume elements, or voxels.  The gray level value of a voxel represents the total macroscopic cross section,  , of the material present at the voxel\u2019s spatial location.  For voxels along interfaces, the gray level represents a combination of  s for the various materials present.  The fractional amount of water, known as a partial volume, represented by such a voxel must be quantified for an accurate result.  This calculation requires removing the influence of other materials on the voxel\u2019s gray level.  This is accomplished by background normalizing the raw projection data.  The resulting reconstruction contains voxels that represent only water.  Normalizing to the gray level value of a voxel of known water mass produces a voxel matrix with gray levels representing fractional water amounts.  These fractional amounts are tallied and multiplied by the known water mass of the normalizing voxel to determine the total. \n\nThe NCT water quantification technique was tested using MCNP simulations of samples containing liquid phase water and ice phase water.  Quantification of the MCNP simulations yielded results within 0.2% of the theoretical.  For liquid phase and ice phase water samples at ~30mm from the detector, results were within 2% of the theoretical.  The ability to quantify an ice water mixture to within 2% of the theoretical was also demonstrated.  For liquid phase water samples at 140mm from the detector, significant error in the quantified water mass, as large as 47%, was observed and determined to be the result of geometric un-sharpness effects and cupping artifacts.  \n\nDeconvolution of the imaging system\u2019s blurring function was performed to correct for geometric un-sharpness.  Results showed a reduction in geometric un-sharpness by ~14.4% yielding a 6.7% average increase in quantified water mass.  The effects of magnification and cupping artifacts on the final quantification results were also investigated.  Magnification was determined to have no effect while cupping artifacts accounted for 1.4% of the error.  Geometric un-sharpness accounted for 45% of the error, making it the dominant error source. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [498], "author_name_tesi": "Heller, Arthur Kevin", "last_name_ssi": "Heller", "middle_name_ssi": "Kevin", "first_name_ssi": "Arthur", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Kenan Unlu", "Matthew M Mench", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jack Brenizer Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Chair", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Member", "Matthew M Mench, Committee Member", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Neutron Imaging", "Neutron Computed Tomography", "Neutron Radiography", "Water Quantification", "Partial Volumes", "Partial Volume Voxels", "un-sharpness correction", "deconvolution", "NCT"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Biomechanical Changes in Gait and Posture as a Result of In-Shoe Orthoses and External Load", "id": "6872", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4119", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Stress fractures in the lower limbs affect 5% to 20% of military recruits, which contributes to decreased military readiness and increased medical costs.

Results from recent studies using rice (Oryza sativa) have suggested that the phytohormone ethylene plays a role in resistance to the rice blast pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. The rate-limiting step of the ethylene biosynthetic pathway is the conversion of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), catalyzed by ACC synthase (ACS). Of the six ACS genes in rice, OsACS1 and OsACS2 are induced within 24 hours of inoculation by M. oryzae. This induction occurs simultaneous with an increase in ethylene production that is noticeable 12 hours post inoculation. In this study, we have used a transgenic approach to further determine the role of ethylene biosynthesis and signaling in resistance to M. oryzae. In the first study, we used the RNA interference (RNAi) method, to generate transgenic rice lines with suppressed expression of the single M. oryzae inducible-OsACS2 gene. The OsACS2-RI lines exhibited reduced basal levels of ethylene, and reduced expression of ethylene signaling genes. A series of elicitation and inoculation studies were performed with the use of these ethylene-deficient OsACS2-RI lines, in conjunction with previously developed ethylene signaling mutants OsEIN2a+b-RI and OsEIL1-RI lines. We found that both ethylene-deficient and ethylene-insensitive lines showed an attenuation of mechanisms involved in basal resistance, including decreased expression of a chitin-binding receptor, lower and/or delayed expression of genes involved in basal resistance and phytoalexin biosynthesis, a reduction in early HR-like cell death, reduced callose deposition, and increased susceptibility to multiple isolates of M. oryzae. These results suggest that both ethylene production and signaling are involved in basal resistance. A second study involved generation of transgenic lines with inducible overexpression of OsACS2 (OsACS2-OX). In contrast to the ethylene-deficient and insensitive lines, the OsACS2-OX lines showed increased resistance to both a moderately and a\niv\nhighly virulent isolate of M. oryzae, as well as R. solani. These results suggest that increasing endogenous levels of ethylene may enhance host resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens and pathogen races. A third study performed using a negative regulator of ethylene production, OsEOL1 (Ethylene-overproducer like 1) revealed more information about regulation in ethylene production involved in ethylene-mediated resistance. OsEOL1 is a BTB (broad-spectrum/tamtrac/bric a brac) domain-containing protein, and a putative E3 ligase component. Expression of OsEOL1 increased at 48 hours post-inoculation, occurring simultaneously to a decrease in ethylene production in rice. Transgenic rice lines with stress-inducible overexpression of OsEOL1 showed increased resistance to spray-inoculated, but not punch-inoculated isolates of M. oryzae. This suggests that OsEOL1 is a positive regulator of resistance to M. oryzae, depending on the time of induction. The results of these experiments suggest that ethylene production and signaling are necessary components of basal resistance, however, ethylene-mediated resistance is dependent on the timing, and dose of ethylene production.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8341], "author_name_tesi": "Helliwell, Emily Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Helliwell", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yinong Yang", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "Dawn S Luthe", "Timothy W Mcnellis", "Seogchan Kang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yinong Yang, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member", "Seogchan Kang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Oryza sativa", "rice", "ethylene", "rice blast", "ethylene biosynthesis", "ethylene signaling"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Investigation of the Impacts of Cognitive Style and Teamwork on Ideation Effectiveness", "id": "13990kch5174", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13990", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the interplay of ideation, teamwork, and cognitive style in the engineering design process is important to making engineering students and practitioners more flexible designers.  This master\u2019s thesis investigates concept generation in engineering design with regard to teamwork and cognitive style.  After reviewing previous research in teamwork and cognitive style, a study was conducted.  In this work, 175 undergraduate engineering students were studied with regard to their performance and perceptions during concept generation with and without teamwork.  Of those 175 participants, 95 participants were further studied with regard to their cognitive style.  Of those 95 participants, 52 participants were studied with regard to cognitive gaps with their partners.  During concept generation, participants completed two 20-minute sessions of brainstorming.  The first session was completed individually, and the second session was completed in teams of two or three individuals.  By comparing participants\u2019 performance and perceptions, several observations were made with regard to how teamwork and cognitive style influence concept generation.  Results gathered from perceptions indicate that individuals perceive teamwork to positively impact the creativity and diversity of their ideas and the easiness of brainstorming, whereas results gathered from evaluations of design ideas indicate that individuals in teams are more likely produce fewer ideas and produce ideas with lower quality.  Considering these findings together, individuals appear to have a positive outlook on teamwork in brainstorming that is not fully justified by measurements of performance.  Results also suggest that individuals with different cognitive style have similar perceptions and performance with regard to teamwork; however, teams with larger cognitive gaps are more likely to disagree on perceptions of brainstorming.  To facilitate better teamwork for teams with differences in cognitive style, a tool for concept generation was developed and tested.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15254], "author_name_tesi": "Helm, Kevin C", "last_name_ssi": "Helm", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Kathryn Jablokow", "Dr. Matthew Parkinson", "Dr. Karen Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Kathryn Jablokow, Thesis Advisor", "Dr. Matthew Parkinson, Committee Member", "Dr. Karen Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Engineering Design", "Ideation", "Cognitive Style", "Brainstorming", "Teamwork", "Concept Generation", "Creativity", "Idea Assessment"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Eavesdropping plants: Plants perceive and respond to insect odors by priming their anti-herbivore defenses", "id": "26321", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11511", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Insect feeding damage is known to induce plant defenses. More recent discoveries have found that plants can also perceive environmental cues associated with the presence of insect herbivores, allowing them to prepare their defenses for future attack. For example, plants can detect insect footsteps or oviposition, and some even use olfactory cues to sense the presence of nearby herbivores. Several studies have found that undamaged plants eavesdrop on volatiles emitted by their insect-damaged neighbors and respond by enhancing their own anti-herbivore defenses. In my dissertation research, I demonstrate for the first time that plants can also perceive and respond to olfactory cues emitted directly by insect herbivores. My findings indicate that tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima) plants exhibit enhanced defense responses following exposure to the putative sex attractant of a specialist herbivore, the goldenrod gall fly (Eurosta solidaginis).  \nIn field and laboratory experiments, goldenrod plants previously exposed to the male fly emission suffered significantly less herbivore damage than unexposed controls. Moreover, goldenrod plants exposed to the fly odor induced higher amounts of the key defense signaling hormone jasmonic acid and emitted greater quantities of defense-related volatile compounds following herbivore damage. I also found that exposure to the E. solidaginis emission does not directly deter subsequent insect feeding as exposing other plant species to the emission did not reduce herbivore feeding damage.\nBecause little is known about how plants perceive olfactory cues and the specificity of plant olfaction, I also investigated S. altissima responses to the individual chemical constituents of the E. solidaginis emission blend. I found that goldenrod plants exposed to the most abundant compound in the blend, (7S,5S)-7-methyl-1,6-dioxaspiro[4.5]decane, received less herbivore damage and induced higher quantities of jasmonic acid than control plants, a similar result to plants exposed to the complete blend.\nMale E. solidaginis flies emit very large quantities of the putative sex attractant (~70 \u00b1 20 \u03bcg over 24 h), despite providing a cue for eavesdropping S. altissima plants. To determine whether female E. solidaginis may select for this trait and whether emission production is correlated with E. solidaginis male quality, I quantified the amount of emission produced as well as other physical characteristics of individual male flies, such as mass, gall-size, and life span. I found that emission production is not correlated with gall size, male mass, or life span. However, I did observe that the ratio of compounds in the male emission changes with fly age.\nTogether, these results suggest that S. altissima plants eavesdrop on the olfactory signals of their insect antagonist and exploit these signals as indicators of impending herbivory. These findings document a new class of olfactory-mediated interactions with broad significance for the evolutionary ecology of plant-insect interactions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11022], "author_name_tesi": "Helms, Anjel M", "last_name_ssi": "Helms", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Anjel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Frazier Tooker", "Mark C Mescher", "David Eissenstat", "Consuelo M De Moraes", "Debashis Gosh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Frazier Tooker, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark C Mescher, Dissertation Advisor", "David Eissenstat, Committee Member", "Consuelo M De Moraes, Committee Member", "Debashis Gosh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Priming", "Plant defense", "Chemical ecology", "gall insect"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "INGOs, the global ideology of childhood and educational policy in Nepal", "id": "21507", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10004", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Over the last century, cultural ideas reflecting an ideal, normative childhood have become a major driving force shaping global policy related to children, particularly within the realm of education for development.  A global consensus around these cultural ideas, referred to in this study as the global ideology of childhood, underscores the shared belief that all children are entitled to similar rights, protections, and childhood experiences.  As societies around the world strive towards the realization of this ideal, a fundamental question remains: how is the global ideology of childhood reproduced in national contexts as transnational actors, and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) in particular, develop and implement education practices and policies?\n     Within the context of a global movement that emphasizes the needs and rights of individual children through the provision of quality education for all, this study utilizes a qualitative case study of Nepal\u2019s National Framework of Child-friendly Schools for Quality Education to illustrate how INGOs and other policy actors reproduce and interpret global norms concerning children and childhood.  The ultimate goal is to provide a richly descriptive account of how global culture is appropriated in one national context.  Accordingly, three research questions ask: 1) how is the global ideology of childhood reflected in the policy?; 2) how do international, national, and local actors understand their roles in the development and implementation of the policy?; and 3) How do these actors envision the sustainability of the child-friendly school model in Nepal, and how might these global ideas be linked to broader social and cultural change? \n     Drawing on interviews with multilevel actors, policy documents, and school observations, the findings provide evidence of the convergence between global and national conceptions of childhood; demonstrate that models of cultural reproduction must allow for the possibility of multi-directional patterns; and reveal the complexity of sustaining global ideas in local contexts while pointing to the rise in importance of the child in modern society.  Ultimately, the research highlights how the child-friendly schools policy has created a space for education reform\u2014and the realization of the rights of Nepali children\u2014using language legitimated by a global consensus on childhood.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9715], "author_name_tesi": "Henck, Adrienne Blaine", "last_name_ssi": "Henck", "middle_name_ssi": "Blaine", "first_name_ssi": "Adrienne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David P Baker", "David P Baker", "Maryellen Schaub", "Katerina Bodovski", "Leif Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David P Baker, Dissertation Advisor", "David P Baker, Committee Chair", "Maryellen Schaub, Committee Member", "Katerina Bodovski, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["childhood", "child-friendly schools", "INGOs", "education policy", "quality education", "and Nepal"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Loop Quantum Cosmology: A Window Into the Path Integral Representation of Quantum Gravity\n", "id": "12472", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "69", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation we present sum of histories formulations of loop quantum cosmology.\nThese are considered for exactly soluble LQC expressed in a Schrodinger\nform with time provided by a scalar field where we are interested in transition\namplitudes and as a constrained system where we are interested in the physical\ninner product defined by group averaging.

The third theme investigates the ionic/electronic conductivity of layered perovskites. The results of the experiments as well as their possible applications are described in detail within each chapter.\n\nChapter two describes research performed on the exfoliation and reassembly of layered perovskites. The reassembly (with in-plane registry) of exfoliated sheets was of particular interest. Multiple layered perovskites were synthesized and ion exchanged. While most of these materials did not exfoliate to a significant degree, it was observed that there are specific criteria required for sheets exfoliate and even more stringent requirements for reassembly. It was also observed that even with materials that exfoliate and restack completely, a mixture of sheets from two distinct compounds do not reassemble together. An interesting trend was observed in which the degree to which a material exfoliates is correlated to the acidity of the interlayer protons.\n\nChapter three describes a study of anion-exchanging clay/polymer composites designed as materials for the sequestration of environmentally hazardous anions such as perchlorate and pertechnetate. Exfoliated synthetic fluoromica was reassembled with cationic polymers to produce composites, which selectively bind perchlorate in solutions that contain both perchlorate and chloride. The focus of this chapter is the binding isotherms observed for numerous composite systems. Most of the composites exhibited cooperative binding, while one conformed to a Langmuirian isotherm. Experiments detailing the use of these composites as hosts for catalytic particles are also discussed in this chapter.\n\nChapter four focuses on the exfoliation of layered materials with uncharged sheets, such as tungsten disulfide and hexagonal boron nitride. Combining the methods in recent reports of the intercalation of phosphoric acid into hexagonal boron nitride with reports of solution based exfoliation of layered materials, an increase in the yield of exfoliated flakes was observed. There is a significant increase in the number of thin flakes obtained using acid-assisted exfoliation as compared to experiments without the acid.

Many of these processes have focused on the synthesis, modification, and conversion of nanoparticles and deposited thin-films, which can overcome energetic barriers, such as the rate-limiting solid-solid diffusion step, associated with traditional metallurgical and ceramic techniques.  Through a loss of dimensionality or drastically reduced diffusion distances these approaches can access a wide range of materials at much lower temperatures than typically employed.  Additionally, low-temperature methods potentially provide for the discovery of nonequilibrium or kinetically stable phases.  This dissertation details our work towards the development of alternative, non-traditional synthetic methods for accessing both intermetallic and oxide compounds at low-temperatures and ambient pressures.\n\tWe have used molten dispersions of low-melting metals as reactive precursors in the synthesis of various bimetallic materials, specifically M-Sn, M-Ga, M-Bi, and M-In phases (M = late transition or post-transition metal).  These compounds possess a range of different chemical and physical properties, such as superconductivity, and can be rapidly obtained in solution at temperatures below 300 \u00b0C.  Additionally, we find that the choice of solvent is somewhat flexible, as several of these bimetallic phases were obtainable under similar conditions in renewable plant and seed oils, such as safflower and canola oil.  This provides further support for our hypothesis that the solvent acts primarily as medium for dispersion and heat-transfer and that intermetallic formation occurs through a diffusion-based approach in solution.\n\tWith regards to oxide compounds, we have accessed layered perovskite-type Eu2Ti2O7, which is typically obtained through high-pressure techniques, at moderate temperatures and ambient pressure through mild oxidation of EuTiO3.  This approach suppresses formation of the more thermodynamically stable pyrochlore structure and allows partial retention of the perovskite motif up to 900 \u00b0C.  Our synthetic method is amenable to bulk-scaling and yields samples that possess an increased response toward second harmonic generation relative to previous reports.  Finally, we have synthesized Ca-substituted EuTiO3 phases through a modified sol-gel approach.  By varying the level of Ca content, we can systematically alter the length of the unit cell edge and suppress the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, presumably through dilution of magnetic spins.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4644], "author_name_tesi": "Henderson, Nathaniel Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Henderson", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Nathaniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Christine Dolan Keating", "James Hansell Adair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["intermetallics", "perovskites", "second harmonic generation", "europium titanate", "low-temperature", "solid state", "solution synthesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "The Development of an Iron Responsive Element (IRE)-Driven Fluorescent Reporter Construct", "id": "6415", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5195", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-09-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A wide variety of debilitating illnesses have been directly connected with an imbalance of iron regulation within the body or indirectly through the occurrence of oxidative stress, a common symptom of iron imbalance.  Iron regulation within each cell is closely controlled by iron responsive elements (IREs) within the mRNA of iron handling proteins.  Examples of iron handling proteins are ferritin, the intracellular iron storage protein, and transferrin receptor, which works to uptake iron bound to the iron circulating protein transferrin.  Iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) tightly regulate the production of these iron handling proteins by blocking or enhancing ribosomal translation of these mRNA into protein.  What is unclear is how this strictly controlled mechanism can become disrupted in cases of iron imbalance such as hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and even cancer.  In order to more closely examine how iron regulatory machinery reacts to environmental stressors, an IRE driven cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) reporter construct was created to examine changes in cellular iron regulatory machinery in environments that mimic different disease states.  This construct was patterned after ferritin so that it would imitate an iron responsive endogenous protein in such a way that it could be used to reflect the activity of a cell\u2019s iron regulatory machinery.  This produced a system where CFP made by the construct would increase when intracellular iron levels increased, and where CFP amounts would decrease when intracellular iron levels decreased.  The construct was designed with flexibility in mind so that it could be analyzed either non-invasively by fluorescence microscopy or by the more traditional method of immunoblot analysis.  Ultimately, this construct was designed to be a method by which to evaluate various therapies aimed at targeting cellular iron imbalance.  Using this construct, the proof of concept was established in HEK-293 cells using lipid-mediated delivery systems.  Through gel shift assay, fluorescence pixel density analysis, and western blotting it was demonstrated that the construct could bind native iron responsive proteins (IRPs) within cell lysates, that it was responsive to changes in iron status after the addition of excess iron or an iron chelator, and that the vector without the IRE insertion did not elicit similar responses.  Once this proof of concept was achieved, this construct was then utilized in a model of hereditary hemochromatosis (chronic iron loading) using primary mouse hepatocytes and a baculovirus delivery system.  This system allowed for the examination of iron driven protein production in non-dividing cells capable of being chronically loaded with supra-physiological amounts of a lipophilic form of iron.  In this model, the construct proved its similarity to ferritin by closely paralleling the increases seen in ferritin throughout the course of the experiments.  This system was also used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the iron chelator desferoxamine at blocking any increases in CFP fluorescence that occurred in the presence of chronic iron loading alone.  To expand the usefulness of the IRE-driven construct, an IRE-red fluorescent protein (RFP) was created and used in subsequent applications.  This IRE-RFP vector was utilized in SH-SY5Y cells to evaluate their response to iron, beta-amyloid, a radiomimetic antibiotic bleomycin, and an iron chelator clioquinol.  The construct was then used to investigate the proposed hypothesis that hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) patients are at a heightened risk for developing AD as they age.  The construct created a unique opportunity to study whether or not the mutated Hfe genes that cause HH protect cells from or render cells more susceptible to environmental conditions known to affect the iron regulatory machinery of the cell.  Therefore, SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing forms of the Hfe gene were used to test the response of the IRE-RFP construct in cases of excess iron or iron plus beta-amyloid.  The findings of this thesis are of twofold.  First, it was determined that IRE-driven reporter constructs can be applied to a variety of cell types (both cell lines and primary cells) using a number of different delivery methods and can reliably report changes in iron driven protein production in situations of iron overload, iron chelation, and applications of toxic agents such as bleomycin and beta-amyloid.  Secondly, these constructs demonstrated significant improvements over the technology that is currently available in that they are a flexible, reproducible method to repeatedly monitor the iron regulatory machinery of a population of living cells in a way that uses the uniquely iron specific endogenous iron regulatory machinery of the cell.  With these traits, the construct made it possible for the development and initial assessment of an in vitro model of hereditary hemochromatosis, the evaluation of iron chelation therapies, the impact of radiomedic antibiotics, and neurotoxic fragments on the iron balance within SH-SY5Y cells.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5170], "author_name_tesi": "Henderson, Rebecca Jane", "last_name_ssi": "Henderson", "middle_name_ssi": "Jane", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Dr J Kyle Krady", "Jong Kak Yun", "Dr Charles Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Committee Chair", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Chair", "Dr J Kyle Krady, Committee Member", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member", "Dr Charles Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["iron", "ferritin", "hereditary hemochromatosis", "beta-amyloid", "iron regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Inconsistent input and amount of exposure: child language acquisition of Fering, a dialect of North Frisian", "id": "23599", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10612", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation presents six comprehension and production experiments designed to test how the amount and type of language input influence child language acquisition in a naturalistic minority language. This project focuses on the acquisition of Fering, a dialect of North Frisian spoken on the island of F\u00f6hr in northern Germany. Acquisition of a consistently produced feature, plural marking, and an inconsistently produced feature, grammatical gender, was compared in groups of bilinguals with different amounts of language input. Elementary school students (ages 6-10), high school students (ages 16-19) and adults on F\u00f6hr completed a series of production and comprehension tasks examining their acquisition of Fering morphology. The results indicate that both the amount of language input and the type of input (consistent vs. inconsistent) influence the acquisition of morphology. Specifically, when children are exposed to inconsistent input, their production patterns depend on how much linguistic input they have access to. Children with high levels of input were able to faithfully acquire adult-like patterns of inconsistency, while children with roughly equal exposure to each language at home tended to regularize inconsistent input. Those who had a minimal amount of Frisian input tended to produce grammatical gender randomly. For consistently produced plural markings, elementary school students with larger quantities of input were more accurate in producing and comprehending plural markings. The results of this dissertation suggest that both the amount and type of language input strongly influence how children acquire their languages.

Because no ground reaction data was available, kinetic calculations were performed in a head to toe direction.  \n\tAnalysis of the segmental reactions to the postural perturbation revealed that: (1) All segments and joints studied were utilized in a wave like motion and the reaction was not limited to a hip or an ankle strategy.  (2) The horizontal components of the ankle joint reaction force and knee joint reaction force were of approximately the same magnitude and approximately twice the magnitude of the hip joint reaction force.  The vertical component of the ankle joint reaction force was larger than the knee joint reaction force, which was greater than the hip joint reaction force.  The ankle joint produced the largest moment in response to the platform perturbation while the knee moment was larger then the hip moment.  (3) With some reservations the larger the magnitude of the sudden angular ground perturbation distance the greater was the joint angular displacement at all joints.  (4) The faster the angular velocity of the rotational perturbation the larger the joint angular displacement and peak force.  Even though the peak knee torque did not increase in reaction to faster angular velocities of perturbation, the peak torque of the ankle and hip did.

As the design space is narrowed, more accurate and time-intensive tools are brought to bear. These tools are used to determine the effect of a design decision on the performance, handling, stability and efficiency of the aircraft. One notable parameter left out of this process is acoustics. This is due in part to the difficulty in making useful acoustics calculations that reveal the differences between various design configurations. This thesis presents a new approach designed to bridge the gap in prediction capability between fast but low-fidelity Lagrangian particle methods, and slow but high-fidelity Eulerian computational fluid dynamics simulations. A multi-pronged approach is presented. First, a simple flow solver using well-understood and tested flow solution methodologies is developed specifically to handle bodies in arbitrary motion. To this basic flow solver two new technologies are added. The first is an Immersed Boundary technique designed to be tolerant of geometric degeneracies and low-resolution grids. This new technique allows easy inclusion of complex fuselage geometries at minimal computational cost, improving the ability of a solver to capture the complex interactional aerodynamic effects expected in modern rotorcraft design. The second new technique is an extension of a concept from flow visualization where the motion of tip vortices are tracked through the solution using massless particles convecting with the local flow. In this extension of that concept, the particles maintain knowledge of the expected and actual vortex strength. As a post-processing step, when the acoustic calculations are made, these particles are used to augment the loading noise calculation and reproduce the highly-impulsive character of blade-vortex interaction noise. In combination these new techniques yield a significant improvement to the state of the art in rotorcraft blade-vortex interaction noise prediction.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9099], "author_name_tesi": "Hennes, Christopher Conrad", "last_name_ssi": "Hennes", "middle_name_ssi": "Conrad", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Sven Schmitz", "Philip John Morris", "Anthony A Atchley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Steven Brentner, Dissertation Advisor", "Sven Schmitz, Committee Member", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Anthony A Atchley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Acoustics", "Rotorcraft", "Computational Fluid Dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Reporting of Contingent Legal Liabilities: Employment Discrimination Lawsuits", "id": "8504", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3511", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The reporting of contingent legal liabilities is an area where financial reporting standards conflict with legal strategy and policy.

Although the majority of women in the United States intend to breastfeed, only 13% meet the global public health recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding for at least six months. A major barrier to meeting this goal is lactation insufficiency (i.e. altered milk composition or failure/reduced ability to lactate). Therefore, identifying mechanisms that contribute to lactation insufficiency will aid in developing strategies to improve breastfeeding rates and infant-mother health. \n     Post-lactation or upon weaning, the mammary gland undergoes massive programmed cell death and regresses or \u201cinvolutes\u201d back to the pre-pregnant state. Within a matter of days, ~80% of the milk-secreting mammary epithelial cells undergo tightly regulated programmed cell death pathways. Programmed cell death is thought to occur through an initial phase of lysosomal-mediated cell death (< 24 h post weaning) followed by mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis (> 48 h post weaning). Despite being the most dramatic example of physiological programmed cell death, surprisingly little is known about how mammary gland involution occurs.\n     The biologically essential micronutrient, zinc (Zn), regulates both pathways of cell death in other cell types. For example, Zn accumulation in prostate cells and neurons induces mitochondrial apoptosis while Zn accumulation in lysosomes causes lysosomal-membrane permeabilization (LMP) and induces neuronal cell death in astrocytes. Moreover, the Zn transporter ZnT2 imports Zn into vesicles and mitochondria and ZnT2-overexpression activates cell death in mammary epithelial cells. This suggests that Zn accumulation in mitochondria and lysosomes may be a key factor in programmed cell death during mammary gland involution. It also suggests that mammary gland Zn pools must be redistributed from the secretory compartment during lactation to mitochondria and lysosomes during involution. Here, we used model organisms to study the biological process of mammary gland involution, with the overarching goal of understanding the role of ZnT2-mediated Zn transport in mammary gland involution. Our working hypothesis was that factors released at weaning redistribute ZnT2 to accumulate Zn in lysosomes and mitochondria to activate programmed cell death of the mammary cells and mammary gland involution. We further hypothesized that alterations in this process would result in lactation insufficiency due to premature involution or inadequate involution and breast disease.\n     In study 1, we show that ZnT2 imports Zn into lysosomes and mitochondria to activate lysosomal-mediated cell death and apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells in vitro and mammary gland involution in vivo. We also demonstrate that TNF\u03b1 redistributes ZnT2 to accumulate Zn in lysosomes and activate lysosomal-mediated cell death in vitro and mammary gland involution in vivo. This indicates that ZnT2 plays a key role in modulating Zn pools, which contributes to mammary gland involution and importantly, that TNF\u03b1, as an initial involution signal, redistributes ZnT2 to lysosomes to activate lysosomal-mediated cell death and the initiation of involution.\nIn study 2, we sought to determine how TNF\u03b1 redistributes ZnT2 to lysosomes. We found that a highly conserved dileucine motif in ZnT2\u2019s C-terminus (L294L) targets ZnT2 from late endosomes to lysosomes by binding adaptor protein complex-3 (AP-3). Moreover, we show that ZnT2 is dephosphorylated at S296 in response to TNF\u03b1, allowing for lysosomal targeting of ZnT2. Collectively, this suggests that factors that augment the targeting of ZnT2 to lysosomes, such as TNF\u03b1, may lead to premature involution and lactation failure. \n     In study 3, we aimed to determine whether aberrant inflammation during lactation activates lactation failure through ZnT2-mediated Zn retention in lysosomes. We found that obese lactating mice have increased inflammatory mediators, including TNF\u03b1, in the mammary gland microenvironment, which was associated with increased lysosomal Zn and ZnT2, increased lysosomal activity and autophagy, and subclinical involution and lactation failure. Collectively, this suggests that inflammation may compromise lactation by mediating Zn retention in lysosomes, activating cell death and promoting premature involution and may provide a biological explanation for why overweight and obese mothers fail to initiate and maintain lactation. \n     Collectively, my dissertation focuses on the role of ZnT2 in the post-lactational regression of the mammary gland. I found that the redistribution of ZnT2 to lysosomes is a critical event for mammary gland involution to occur normally and that TNF\u03b1 is an upstream regulator of this process. I also found that a dileucine motif in ZnT2\u2019s C-terminus traffics ZnT2 to lysosomes, which I propose is due to TNF\u03b1-dependent phospho-signaling. A recently completed study in our laboratory found that ~30% of breastfeeding women (n=54) have genetic variation in ZnT2. Functional characterization of these variants showed that they were mis-localized with altered cellular Zn management and had a loss or gain in function. Importantly, ~50% of the variation was found in ZnT2\u2019s C-terminus and in close proximity to my proposed dileucine motif and phosphorylation sites, suggesting that these women may be at risk for insufficient involution due to the inability to traffic ZnT2 to lysosomes. Furthermore, I found that obese mice have aberrant TNF\u03b1 in the mammary gland during lactation, which leads to premature involution and lactation failure. This demonstrates that factors that affect ZnT2 trafficking lead to lactation insufficiency and suggests that obese mothers may benefit from nutritional interventions to decrease inflammation prior to pregnancy. Ultimately, my dissertation work may lead to novel interventions to improve infant-mother health by increasing breastfeeding rates and preventing lactation insufficiency and/or breast disease due to inadequate involution.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10157], "author_name_tesi": "Hennigar, Stephen Russel", "last_name_ssi": "Hennigar", "middle_name_ssi": "Russel", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shannon Leanne Kelleher", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Troy Ott", "Connie Jo Rogers", "David I Soybel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Dissertation Advisor", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "Troy Ott, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member", "David I Soybel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mammary gland", "involution", "cell death", "zinc transporter", "zinc", "lysosome", "cytokines", "inflammation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Antibiotics on Bacterial Cellulose In Vivo", "id": "cf95jb44s", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13021", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bacterial cellulose is being considered as a key feedstock for biofuel production and for the creation of sustainable nanomaterials.

G. hansenii was exposed to 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin throughout a seven-day growth period, and cellulose structure was analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).  Biomass weight and cellulose weight at Days 1, 3, 5, and 7 were also assessed as well as non-cellulosic exopolysacchride (EPS) yield and cell morphology upon antibiotic exposure.\n\nWe discovered that ampicillin and chloramphenicol significantly affected surface topography, cellulose bundling, allomorph content, biomass growth, cellulose yield, exopolysaccharide production, and cell morphology without altering cellulose crystallinity.  By observation, ampicillin treatment led to an underdeveloped top pellicle layer with a second layer that had wider bundles than pellicles from other treatment groups; EPS deposits were also visible on both layers.  In addition to causing cellulose macrostructural changes, ampicillin treatment also yielded the lowest amount of cellulose per gram of biomass (p < 0.01) and caused a significant cell division defect in which cells propagated in long filaments.  Chloramphenicol inhibited cell growth most significantly (p < 0.01), increased the I-alpha allomorph content        (p < 0.01), and also caused cells to divide in filaments.  Antibiotic stress on protein production and cell division caused additional exopolysaccharides to be produced, and these non-cellulosic exopolysaccharides enhanced glucan chain aggregation into higher-order structures such as bundles and pellicle layers.\n\nThe findings of this study have significant implications for downstream applications such as genetically engineering G. hansenii to produce bacterial cellulose with modified mechanical properties.

Using daily flow and return data, I find that flows to leveraged ETFs predict subsequent benchmark index returns. These results remain significant to a lesser extent at the weekly level, but disappear for monthly returns. Separating ETFs into commodity, debt, domestic equity, foreign equity, and real estate sectors, I find that out-of-sample predictability is limited to foreign equity and junk bonds. A self-funding strategy based on out-of-sample predictability earns over 5\\% per year, but the majority of this is negated by transaction costs. This suggests that although flows do not predict most market sectors, flows can anticipate movements in markets where there are higher transaction costs or less liquidity. \nIn the second study, I investigate the dynamics of equity and commodity market correlation. Unlike previous economic downturns where equity returns dropped but commodity futures returns largely stayed positive, following the financial crisis equity and commodity futures returns showed much higher than normal levels of co-movement. Using mean-variance spanning tests, I find that though diversification from a portfolio of solely equities into a portfolio of equities and commodities generally improves an investor's efficient frontier, it did not yield any significant improvement from 2008 to 2010 and little to no improvement in 2007 and 2011. Frontiers post crisis starting in 2012 are again benefited from diversification into commodities. Using quality of predictive power for several factors, I find that the levels of global supply and demand, and to a lesser extent commodity relevant hedge fund assets under management (AUM), and index investment aid in predicting future commodity-equity correlation leading into the financial crisis as well as during the subsequent recovery. \nFinally, in the third study I examine the associations of various types of director expertise on a distressed firm\u2019s ability to avoid bankruptcy. Since the advent of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 there have been significant increases in the percentage of board members with accounting, investment banking and legal expertise. In a study of US firms during the period between 1996 and 2011, I find that the percentages of bankers and lawyers on boards are associated with significant changes in the likelihood that a firm will enter bankruptcy in the future. No similar effect is observed for board member accounting expertise. These results support the idea that bankers may aid distressed firms in renegotiating their debt, enabling them to avoid bankruptcy. Conversely, a board with more legal expertise may be instrumental in steering a firm through bankruptcy.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14324], "author_name_tesi": "Henrichsen, Aaron Peter", "last_name_ssi": "Henrichsen", "middle_name_ssi": "Peter", "first_name_ssi": "Aaron", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jingzhi Huang", "Jingzhi Huang", "Tim Simin", "David Haushalter", "John Liechty"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jingzhi Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jingzhi Huang, Committee Chair", "Tim Simin, Committee Member", "David Haushalter, Committee Member", "John Liechty, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Exchange Traded Funds", "Market Prediction", "Commodities", "Diversification", "Governance"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Root traits for sustainable low-input agro-ecosystems", "id": "8646", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "502", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soil stress is a key constraint to global food production, and selection for root traits is a \npromising strategy for improving sustainability of low input agro-ecosystems.

This is particularly difficult given that L2 learners have limited knowledge of these cues and have limited resources to process them. As a result, L2 learners employ a variety of strategies to help them make sense of complicated input. These strategies include attending to simpler or more salient cues in the input, such as lexical items, semantic cues (e.g., animacy, plausibility), or word order (VanPatten, 2004a). Consequently, other cues, such as morphosyntax (e.g., tense or case information) are not processed readily, and learners have difficulty acquiring these forms. Thus the presence of more salient forms that encode the same semantic information, may present a significant barrier to acquisition. On the other hand, there may be situations where certain cues support each other and promote acquisition. For example, current research (e.g., Gr\u00fcnloh, Lieven, & Tomasello, 2011) suggests that prosody (e.g., stress, pitch) may support the processing of morphosyntactic forms.\n\tThe goal of this dissertation is to explore the psychological principles that underlie learners\u2019 interactions with lexical-semantic, morphosyntactic, and prosodic cues in an input stream and to investigate how these processes impact the acquisition of morphosyntactic forms. Furthermore, this dissertation seeks to examine whether instructional interventions such as Processing Instruction can take advantage of these psychological principles in order to change processing behaviors and promote the acquisition of morphosyntactic cues. In order to address these issues, the present research tests the offline and online (i.e., real-time) effects of Processing Instruction on the acquisition and subsequent processing of German accusative case markers, which signal subject-first and object-first word orders as in (1):\n\n(1a) Der Kellner k\u00fcsst die Frau im kleinen Restaurant. (Subject-First) \nTheNOM waiter kisses theACC woman in.the small restaurant. \t\n\"The waiter kisses the woman in the small restaurant.\" \n\n(1b) Den Kellner k\u00fcsst die Frau im kleinen Restaurant. (Object-First) \nTheACC waiter kisses theNOM woman in.the small restaurant. \n\"The woman kisses the waiter in the small restaurant.\"\t\n\n\tIn Experiment 1, two groups of third semester learners of German received two types of training: Processing Instruction (PI), in which lexical-semantic and reliable word order cues were explicitly removed from the input; and Traditional Instruction (TI), in which cues were not manipulated. Offline effects of the treatments were measured by sentence interpretation and picture description tasks following a traditional pre-test/post-test design. Changes in real-time processing strategies were assessed via a self-paced reading (SPR) task using sentences like those in (1). During this task, reading times for individual phrases were measured, and it was expected that learners would read object-first sentences slower if they processed the accusative case-markings. The results indicated that the PI group outperformed the TI group on the posttest offline comprehension task and equaled their gains on the offline production task. However, results from the SPR task provided no evidence that either group was slower to read object-first sentences.\n\tThe goal of Experiment 2 was to improve the methodology of Experiment 1 and investigate whether the inclusion of prosodic cues in the training could facilitate acquisition and processing of the target form. Thus, three training groups were under investigation: TI, standard PI, and PI that includes prosodic cues (PI+P). The effects of instruction were again measured using the online and offline tasks used in Experiment 1. The results indicated that the PI and PI+P groups outperformed the TI group on the posttest offline comprehension measures and that all three groups improved equally on the production measures. Results from the SPR task indicated that none of the groups processed the experimental sentences in a native-like way and that participants had difficulty comprehending sentences in this task. However, there is evidence to suggest that the PI and PI+P groups directed more attentional resources towards case markers after training. Furthermore, evidence from the SPR task suggests that the PI+P group did process object-first sentences with more effort after reading the entire sentence.\n\tTaken together, the pattern of results for these experiments suggest that Processing Instruction did have a significant impact on the acquisition of the target form. Furthermore, it appears that Processing Instruction does influence processing strategies, but that its effects are mediated by other factors (e.g., working memory, or the speed of lexical access) that prevent rapid and efficient integration of morphosyntactic information. These data suggest that lexical-semantic cues hinder the acquisition of morphosyntactic cues, but that prosodic cues can play a facilitative role in the acquisition and processing of these forms. These findings are discussed within the context of the Input Processing model (VanPatten, 2004a) and the Competition Model (Bates & MacWhinney, 1987), and pedagogical implications are discussed within the context of research on Processing Instruction (VanPatten & Cadierno, 1993). \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10569], "author_name_tesi": "Henry, Nicholas Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Henry", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carrie Neal Jackson", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Michael Travis Putnam", "Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Bill Van Patten"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carrie Neal Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member", "Michael Travis Putnam, Committee Member", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Committee Chair", "Bill Van Patten, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["second language acquisition", "sentence processing", "German", "applied linguistics", "Processing Instruction", "Input Processing"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Cue-elicited neural activity and functional connectivity among smokers associated with the decision to smoke", "id": "23647", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10771", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cue-reactivity, or the responses of drug users to drug cues, has been shown to be related to smoking behavior including relapse in smokers, but the mechanisms linking drug use to drug cues remain unclear.

A composite driveshaft can be optimized to transmit power in a misaligned condition without the use of flexible couplers that add weight and complexity.  Using a flexible matrix composite (FMC) for this application seems to be an attractive approach in comparison to a conventional rigid matrix composite (RMC) because of the potentially low energy dissipation and high cyclic strain capacity of elastomeric matrix materials. However, a lack of accurate models for critical strength and elastic properties of FMCs makes it necessary to experimentally characterize these parameters.  Characterization of fiber dominated properties is further complicated by the presence of fiber undulations which are manufactured into the part during filament winding.\n\nThe objective of this research is to develop material characterization tools that provide the necessary inputs for the mechanical design of misaligned laminated composite driveshafts.  A [\u00b1\u03b8/89/\u00b1\u03b8] laminate was devised for the express purpose of evaluating the compressive strength and elastic modulus of the unidirectional composite in the fiber direction\u2014properties which are believed to be strongly affected by fiber undulations.  The fiber direction modulus back-calculated using this specimen design applied well to a range of laminates and winding patterns, although the fiber direction strength was found to be highly dependent on winding pattern. An empirical model relating the Young\u2019s modulus of the matrix material to the various quasi-static elastic and strength parameters of interest in shaft design was developed. This model is potentially useful for the rapid screening of candidate matrix materials. \n\nMaster curves representing the transverse and shear dynamic storage moduli and loss factors versus loading frequency and temperature were created for multiple candidate composites with different matrix stiffnesses.  These curves, in conjunction with other properties measured in this investigation, were used as inputs for a previously developed analytical tool for predicting the steady-state surface temperature of a spinning misaligned laminated composite shaft. Predictions from the model were compared to spin test data for several materials and laminates. Good agreement between the predicted and measured temperature increases was obtained for flexural strains up to approximately 2000 \u00b5\u03b5, which encompasses the range of cyclic strains expected in rotorcraft driveshaft applications.

The single-piece shaft concept is enabled by the relatively high fatigue strain capacity of fiber reinforced polymer composites over metals.  Challenges for single-piece driveshaft design lie in addressing the self-heating behavior of the composite due to the material damping, as well as, whirling stability, torsional buckling stability, and composite strength.  Increased composite temperature due to self-heating reduces the composite strength and is accounted for in this research.  The laminate longitudinal stiffness (Ex) and strength (Fx) are known to be heavily degraded by fiber undulation, however, both are not well understood in compression.  The whirling stability (a function of longitudinal stiffness) and the composite strength are strongly influential in driveshaft optimization, and thus are investigated further through the testing of flat and filament wound composite specimens.\nThe design of single-piece composite driveshafts, however, needs to consider many failure criteria, including hysteresis-induced overheating, whirl stability, torsional buckling stability, and material failure by overstress.  The present investigation uses multi-objective optimization to investigate the design space which visually highlights design trades.  Design variables included stacking sequence, number of laminas, and number of hanger bearings.  The design goals were to minimize weight and maximize the lowest factor of safety by adaptively generating solutions to the multi-objective problem.  Several design spaces were investigated by examining the effect of misalignment, ambient temperature, and constant power transmission on the optimized solution.  Several materials of interest were modeled using experimentally determined elastic properties and novel temperature-dependent composite strength.  Compared to the baseline multi-segmented metallic driveline, weight reductions of 43% and 48% were obtained for single-piece flexible and rigid matrix composite shafts.  The rigid matrix weight reduction was slightly lower than that seen in the literature due to consideration of shaft misalignment.\nIn filament wound composites, the existence of fiber undulation introduces unique challenges in the prediction of compressive modulus and strength using traditional laminated composite theories.  In the current investigation, novel full field strain measurements of compressively loaded specimens were used to evaluate local strain distributions in the region of a 0-deg. undulated lamina in a [0n/90n]s laminate (n=2,4,6) and a 30-deg. undulated lamina in a [30n/-60n]s laminate (n=2,4).  Unique to this research, specimens were fabricated with carbon fibers, various amplitudes of undulation, and matrix materials with three different moduli of elasticity.  Full-field strains were measured on the free edge and across the width of the compressively loaded specimens using two-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC).  The observed strains were highly influenced by the undulation geometry.  The longitudinal modulus of a [0n/90n]s laminate was more sensitive to reinforcement undulation when the matrix was flexible rather than rigid.  An undulation with an amplitude/length ratio of 0.1 (low for a filament wound cylinder) reduces the average longitudinal modulus of elasticity in the undulation region by approximately 43% and 3% in laminates with flexible and rigid matrices, respectively, relative to a similar material without undulation.  Observations of strain on the free edge revealed that fiber undulation caused elevated out-of-plane shear (\u03b5xz) and through-thickness normal (\u03b5zz) strains in regions eventually involved in the fiber microbuckling failure process.  \nA new three dimensional method was derived for the homogenization of a heterogeneous composite laminate consisting of individual anisotropic lamina for which structural coupling (Bij) may occur due to in- and out-of-plane (undulation) fiber reinforcement orientation.  Three-dimensional elastic constants were calculated by considering a representative volume element taken from the heterogeneous laminate.  Three-dimensional elastic constant predictions were validated through comparison with established methods, both two- and three- dimensional.  When the new derived three dimensional theory was applied to experimental results, the modulus and strength predictions compared favorably.\nA series of [\u00b1\u0398/89/\u00b1\u0398] cylinders with multiple helical fiber angles, winding patterns, and matrix materials were fabricated and tested in compression.  Digital image correlation was used for the first time to measure outside surface displacements and strains.  Longitudinal and hoop direction strain fluctuations between the undulated and non-undulated regions were found to be of the order of 20-30% of the mean values throughout the cylinders.  Qualitatively, these fluctuations can be related to non-classical elastic couplings (Bij) in the anti-symmetric regions of the filament winding pattern.  Failure of the cylinder occurred by fiber microbuckling, which initiated near the crossing of circumferential and helical cross-over bands.  Based on a statistical analysis of surface strains in the local fiber coordinate system, it was determined that longitudinal compressive and in-plane longitudinal shear strains at incipient microbuckling were two to four times greater than their respective global counterparts.  These results indicate the magnitude of strain concentration existing in the cylinders immediately before final failure (possibly during local failure) and highlight the importance of longitudinal compressive (\u03b511) and in-plane longitudinal shear strains (\u03b512) in the failure process.\nA novel local-global approach was used in predicting the longitudinal modulus and strength of filament wound cylinders.  Several representative volume elements were chosen to represent the filament winding rhombus, and were used as a basis for homogenization.  Strength predictions were augmented with empirical critical distance factors.  The average Ex and nuxy prediction error for Conathane DPRN 30917 was 6.8 % and 21 % and the average error for EPON 862 was 9.7 % and 14 % respectively.  The strength prediction error was approximately 7.7 % and 24 % for 30917 and EPON 862 with failure location typically at the circumferential undulation by mode sig6 (tau12).  The failure mode prediction was consistent with experimental observations from filament wound cylinders and flat-undulated specimens of similar lamination arrangement.

From this perspective, the Flemish and Walloon Movements are the \"awakenings\" of these primordial groups.  I argue instead that regionalism is a form of discourse, a \"political idiom\" which historical actors develop and use in the course of political debates on a wide array of issues which are portrayed as connected to regional identities.  In particular, I examine the Walloon Movement in the three decades before World War I.  I propose that this movement was the domain of ambitious but frustrated men in the literary and political fields who felt symbolically \"dominated\" by a clerical, \"Flemish\" government.  The development of Walloon regional identity was inextricable from anti-clerical and broadly \"leftist\" political viewpoints, which conflated \"Wallonia\" with the values of liberty and progressivism, thereby excluding Catholic Walloons as well as progressive Flemings from its rhetoric.  The Walloon Movement's rhetoric emphasized three overlapping forms of identity as sources of pride and prestige: Walloon, French, and Belgian.  I study the way in which Walloon Movement used each of these three forms of identity in elaborating a politicized regional discourse.  Finally, I argue that as a discursive formation, we cannot see Walloon regionalism as the inexorable outcome of historical forces, but rather a contingent phenomenon, constructed in a particular set of political and social circumstances.  A teleological narrative focusing on the \"inevitable break-up of Belgium\" is grossly inaccurate and denies the role of contingency in history.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1411], "author_name_tesi": "Hensley, David J.", "last_name_ssi": "Hensley", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sophie C De Schaepdrijver"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sophie C De Schaepdrijver, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["intellectuals", "pride", "nationalism", "regionalism", "Wallonia", "Belgium", "identity formation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Defending French in Flanders, 1880-1975", "id": "22748", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10456", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the ultimately unsuccessful efforts of French-speaking populations in Flanders \u2013 who had long constituted an elite group within Flemish society \u2013 to maintain a place for French in the Flemish public realm, namely administration, the judiciary, and education. It spans the period from the late nineteenth century and the first concerted legislative efforts to (re)introduce Dutch into the overwhelmingly Francophone administrative and educational institutions of Flanders, to the 1970s, when a combination of legislative measures and socioeconomic pressures erased the last vestiges of French in Flemish public life. By examining the periodical press, debates in scholarly publications, political pamphlets and posters, parliamentary speeches, and private correspondence produced by these Francophones, I question how and why their arguments in favor of a legal presence for French in Flanders changed over time. At first, many Francophones appealed to the universality and utility of French language and culture, and argued that individuals should enjoy \u201cfree choice of language\u201d in the public realm. Such arguments reflected the dominant status of French in the Western world as well as the prevailing anti-statist sentiments among the Francophone elite of Flanders.  During the period between the world wars, and again during the 1960s, however, some Francophones who wanted French-language rights in public services constructed an identity as a minority and made claims in terms of minority rights. This rhetorical shift came about for several reasons. The growth of a mass-based Flemish Movement made elitist and classically liberal appeals to the \u201cfree choice of language\u201d politically untenable. During the interwar period, \u201cminority rhetoric\u201d had become common across Europe among previously-elite groups like the German-speakers of Poland and Czechoslovakia; it is likely that the Francophones hoped that their use of such would make their claims more legitimate in the eyes of both the Belgian state and the international community. Finally, the decline of French as an international language, especially after World War II, made the Francophones less likely to appeal to its \u201cuniversality\u201d when arguing in favor of a place for the French language in Flemish public life.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10110], "author_name_tesi": "Hensley, David J.", "last_name_ssi": "Hensley", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sophie C De Schaepdrijver", "Jennifer Boittin", "John Philip Jenkins", "Willa Zahava Silverman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sophie C De Schaepdrijver, Dissertation Advisor", "Jennifer Boittin, Committee Member", "John Philip Jenkins, Committee Member", "Willa Zahava Silverman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Flanders", "Belgium", "Language policy", "Minorities", "French language"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Phase-field modeling of microstructure evolution in elastically inhomogeneous polycrystalline materials", "id": "13166", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7099", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "  This study focuses on modeling microstructure evolution in elastically inhomogeneous polycrystalline materials using the phase-field approach. Phase-field models for the diffusional processes and the structural transformations are successfully integrated with the inhomogeneous elasticity model of polycrystalline materials. By employing the Voigt notation scheme of the mechanical equilibrium equation, the computational efficiency for obtaining elastic solutions in polycrystalline materials is improved. The developed phase-field models are then applied to investigate the kinetic processes taking place in polycrystals.\n  To describe the diffusional processes in an elastically anisotropic polycrystalline binary solid solution, the chemical free energy model of the solid solution is integrated with the elastic strain energy model. The elastic interactions due to coherency elastic strain are incorporated by solving the mechanical equilibrium equation using an iterative-perturbation scheme taking into account elastic modulus inhomogeneity stemming from the grain orientation. The elastic strain energy of the solid solution itself of an elastically anisotropic polycrystal is also formulated based on Khachaturyan\u2019s theory, and discussed from the theoretical point of view. By applying the model, the precipitate-precipitate interaction across a grain boundary and the grain boundary segregation-precipitate interaction are microscopically investigated.\n  We then study strain-induced solute segregation at a grain boundary and solute drag effect on boundary migration using a phase-field model integrating grain boundary segregation and grain structure evolution. Strain-induced grain boundary segregation at a static planar boundary is studied numerically and the equilibrium segregation composition profiles are validated using analytical solutions. In addition, we systematically study the effect of misfit strain on grain boundary migration with solute drag. The drag force is theoretically analyzed based on Cahn\u2019s analytic theory. The simulation results are discussed based on our theoretical analysis in terms of elastic and chemical drag forces. The optimum condition for solute diffusivity to maximize the drag force under a given driving force is identified.\n  The developed phase-field model for structural change in polycrystals is modified and applied to the deformation twinning process in fcc materials. A phase-field model for modeling the microstructure evolution during deformation twinning in fcc crystals is firstly proposed. The order parameters are proportional to the shear strains defined in terms of twin plane orientations and twinning directions. The deformation energy as a function of shear strain is obtained using the first-principle calculations. The gradient energy coefficients are fitted to the twin boundary energies along the twinning planes and to the dislocation core energies along the directions that are perpendicular to the twinning planes. The elastic strain energy of a twinned structure is included using the Khachaturyan\u2019s elastic theory. The model is then extended to modeling the deformation twinning processes in polycrystals. We simulate the twinning processes and microstructures evolution under a number of fixed deformations and predicted the twinning plane orientations and microstructures in single- or polycrystals. Moreover, the hierarchical twinning process in a fcc crystal (Cu) is simulated by applying the phase-field model for twinning processes in polycrystals. The possibility of secondary and tertiary twinning processes under the proper deformation condition is identified from the simulations.\n  The developed models for both diffusional processes and structural transformations are also applied to modeling phase transformations in one of realistic materials systems, Ti alloys in which the phase transformation takes place through solute diffusion processes as well as bcc to hcp structural changes. First of all, the possible kinetic pathways during the phase transformation from the high temperature beta phase to the low temperature (alpha+beta) two-phase Ti alloys are investigated based on the thermodynamic stability analyses using a Ti-V binary alloy system. We demonstrate and discuss the proposed phase transformation sequences employing phase-field simulations. We then study the morphological evolution during the phase transformations in polycrystalline Ti alloy by applying the phase-field model for polycrystals to the system. The mechanisms of the alpha phase formation as well as the variant selection at or near a grain boundaries are investigated using the phase-field simulations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7090], "author_name_tesi": "Heo, Tae Wook ", "last_name_ssi": "Heo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tae Wook", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen", "Zi Kui Liu", "David John Green", "Qiang Du"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Member", "David John Green, Committee Member", "Qiang Du, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Phase-field model", "Microstructure evolution", "Polycrystalline materials", "Diffusional processes", "Structural transformations", "Inhomogeneous elasticity"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A High-efficiency Switched-capacitance Htfet Charge Pump For Low-input-voltage Applications", "id": "25058", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11269", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High-efficiency power delivery, as well as low-power circuit design continues to be an important concern in energy harvesting circuits and application that are limited by the battery capacity.

It provides for higher efficiency than the conventional CMOS solution. The proposed circuit doubles the ratio of input voltage to output voltage, which is strongly related to its high efficiency.

Optical flow diagnostic tools, such as laser Doppler velocimetry, were applied to investigate near valve fluid structures suspected of causing blood damage. Modifications were made to the valve housing to enable visual access to previously inaccessible regions of flow. Specifically, the near-valve flow fields generated by the Bjork-Shiley Monostrut, St. Jude Medical, and On-X mechanical heart valves were studied. The three-dimensional flow patterns presented here reveal regions of turbulence, flow stagnation, vorticity, and flow separation near the leaflet tip. These flow conditions, in combination with cavitation, are the primary factors contributing to blood trauma induced during valve closure. \nMechanisms for blood damage were further investigated by analyzing high frequency pressure fluctuations, which represent cavitation intensity. Mitral valve closing sounds contain characteristics that, when appropriately isolated, can help to diagnose cavitation, asynchronous leaflet closure, and valve impact forces. The effect of ventricular pressure, valve size, valve composition, leaflet geometry, and fluid properties on cavitation were evaluated through this work. The risk of blood damage in patients with mechanical heart valves was minimized when valve impact and rebound were dampened.

The fluviokarst conduit system acts as a mixing chamber where sediments from multiple sources are sorted and rearranged.  The storm recharge in the basin largely controls the sediment transport through the drainage to the spring.  Continuous and event-based monitoring at five karst springs in Pennsylvania over the past four years offered insight into the basic functioning of storms and sediment transport in fluviokarst aquifers.\n\nThe episodic nature of storm flows can make prediction of sediment transport and flow quite difficult.  To this end, researchers have employed conceptual models based on both surface water and groundwater flow to describe flow response in karst.  Frequently, karst is envisioned as a mid-point between surface water and groundwater resources or some mix of the two types.  Analysis of the flow at multiple springs points to complications with employing this approach.  Different karst springs fall at multiple locations on the surface to groundwater continuum, and the relationship between location on the continuum and specific physical properties is difficult to deduce.  Understanding the functioning of storm flow in karst systems has direct impact on comprehending sediment transport.\n\nThe composition of the fine-grained portion transported through the aquifer even during minor storms is dependent on source area, mixing within the aquifer, and transport mechanisms.  Composition can vary substantially in composition from spring to spring.  This portion can also reveal aspects of the flow behind the spring mouth that aren\u2019t apparent from detailed chemistry and flow monitoring.  Nolte Spring in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, discharged a variety of calcite sediments in spite of being undersaturated with respect to calcite.  This unique sediment discharge enabled deduction of processes not visible in the karst system, and pointed to the idea that sediment discharge at the spring mouth can reveal a complex signal of washed through, conduit-sourced, and stored sediment at any particular time.\n\nAdditional observations at Arch Spring in Blair County, Pennsylvania confirmed this complex signal in sediment transport.  Exceptional runoff events can lead to sediment transport where concentrations increase an order of magnitude, and thresholds required to mobilize stored sediment in the conduits are exceeded.  Though such thresholds in flow and transport have been discussed in the literature for decades, very few have been captured through direct monitoring and no similar sediment transport event has been captured.  This monitoring during large storm events also quantified a threshold in the flow system where any excess water beyond a certain level flows on the surface rather than through the conduit system.\n\nThough much additional work remains in the field of karst sediment transport, long-term continuous and event-based monitoring revealed these complicated aspects of the five karst aquifers. The nature of these behaviors would not have been uncovered through periodic site visits, and results presented here reinforce the necessity of long-term monitoring protocols in karst.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1780], "author_name_tesi": "Herman, Ellen K", "last_name_ssi": "Herman", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Ellen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rudy L Slingerland", "William Blaine White", "Derek Elsworth", "Kamini Singha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rudy L Slingerland, Committee Chair", "William Blaine White, Committee Chair", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Kamini Singha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sediment", "springs", "karst", "time series"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Time-varying sensitivity analysis reveals impacts of watershed model choice on the inference of dominant processes", "id": "13742", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7203", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lumped rainfall-runoff models are widely used for flow prediction, but a long-recognized need exists for diagnostic tools to identify appropriate model structures for a given application based on the dominant processes they are meant to represent.

Since then, New Zealand GNS Science has recorded over 10,000 aftershocks, including three destructive ~MW6.0 earthquakes near Christchurch. Because there were no active tectonic structures visible at the surface or recorded earthquakes larger than ~MW4.5 prior to September 2010, we treated the Canterbury earthquake sequence as an intraplate earthquake sequence, and compared its kinematics to the Andersonian model for fault slip in a uniform stress field.\n\nWe determined moment magnitudes and double couple solutions for 144 earthquakes larger than MW3.7 in the Canterbury sequence through the use of an inversion technique relying on waveforms observed at stations on South Island, New Zealand. The majority (120) of these double couple solutions had strike slip focal mechanisms, with right lateral slip on ENE fault planes or left lateral slip on SSE fault planes. The remaining focal mechanisms were reverse, except for two normal faulting events. Both the right lateral and left lateral strike slip segments of the Canterbury earthquake sequence had near-optimal orientations for slip in a stress field with a horizontal \u03c31 oriented ~N115oE, and horizontal \u03c33. The preference for right lateral strike slip earthquakes suggested these structures were inherited from previous stages of deformation, leading to slip on these existing planes of weakness rather than forming new faults. Although reverse deformation was incompatible with such a stress field, it likely was more favorable for reverse slip to occur on previously existing structures rather than generate new, optimally oriented strike slip structures. The segments of reverse faulting bounded the Canterbury earthquake sequence, suggesting that they may have controlled the propagation of strike slip ruptures and aftershocks during the Canterbury earthquake sequence.\n\nAdditionally, the double couple solutions yielded P- and T- axes, which were inferred to represent the orientations of the stress field driving the events. Despite the variations in slip direction and faulting style, most of the aftershocks had nearly the same P-axis orientation, consistent with the regional \u03c31. There was no clear evidence for any changes in these stress orientations throughout the Canterbury earthquake sequence, even near the main shock fault segment with ~5 meters of slip.

Both seismic and geodetic observations of earthquakes and their foreshock/aftershock sequences are used to determine event locations and source parameters.

Case studies include the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku, Japan, the 2013 Mw 8.0 Santa Cruz Islands, the 2014 Mw 6.3 Mae Lao, Thailand, the 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique, Chile, the 2015 Mw 8.3 Illapel, Chile, and the 2016 Mw 5.7 Christchurch, New Zealand earthquakes. Geophysical observations of these events are applied in conjunction with a variety of numerical modeling approaches to develop improved earthquake cycle deformation frameworks. Models of fault slip in an elastic half-space are applied during the co-seismic stage to compute surface displacements and stress changes. These stress changes are interpreted to trigger subsequent seismicity in nearby regions and induce other types of postseismic deformation. Some of the observations are not compatible with these elastic half-space models, so finite element modeling approaches are used to further explore the deformation in more rheologically realistic systems. These models include simulations of inter-seismic deformation around a heterogeneous frictional plate boundary interface, accumulation and release of strain throughout each stage of the earthquakes cycle, and the spatial patterns of loading in a rheologically layered upper plate. By integrating observations and models, these studies highlight the importance of rheological heterogeneity, strain rate, and deformation history in earthquake cycle processes.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15266], "author_name_tesi": "Herman, Matthew William", "last_name_ssi": "Herman", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin Patrick Furlong", "Kevin Patrick Furlong", "Charles James Ammon", "Donald Myron Fisher", "Karl Martin Reichard", "Christelle Wauthier", "Rob Govers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin Patrick Furlong, Dissertation Advisor", "Kevin Patrick Furlong, Committee Chair", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Donald Myron Fisher, Committee Member", "Karl Martin Reichard, Outside Member", "Christelle Wauthier, Committee Member", "Rob Govers, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Geodynamics", "Geophysics", "Earthquakes", "Finite Element Modeling", "Subduction Zones", "Rheology"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SPECIAL EDUCATION SUPERVISION: \nPERCEPTIONS OF ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN PENNSYLVANIA CHARTER SCHOOLS\n\n\n", "id": "12489", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1469", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this study of Pennsylvania charter schools; the focus was on the qualifications, duties, and role perceptions of the special education supervisors.

Exercise is commonly advocated as a preventative strategy against the development of osteoporosis and as a treatment for individuals already affected.  However, considerable variance in the utility of exercise or physical activity as an intervention has been observed, suggesting an intrinsic component. Defining interactions between environmental loading and genes will facilitate design of new interventions for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of exercise on skeletal strength and architecture in female C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) inbred mouse strains. \n   Each strain was divided into the following exercise treatment groups: treadmill running, tower climbing, and non-exercised control. The treadmill regimen was performed 5 consecutive days per week for a total of 5 weeks with a gradual increase to a 25 degree incline at 15 m/min for 30 minutes/day. The tower climbing mice were continually housed in a cage equipped with a cylindrical tower 17 cm in diameter and 100 cm tall for a total of 5 weeks. For the first week, water bottles were adjusted from 20 to 100 cm from the bottom of the cage to train the animal to climb the tower. Upon completion of the five week exercise intervention, the tibiae were extracted and then analyzed using a Scanco Medical micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT-40) instrument to obtain quantitative data of cortical and trabecular bone architecture. Following scanning, the tibial midshafts were tested to failure in three-point bending using a semi-hydraulic Materials Testing System (MTS) 858 MiniBionix apparatus. The proximal end was embedded and sectioned to qualitatively assess bone apposition using dynamic histomorphometry based upon fluorescent dyes that were administered during the 5 week exercise regimen. The distal segment of the tibia was dried and ashed to determine bone composition. \n   Genetic strain and the type of exercise intervention significantly affected the outcome. Significant exercise treatment effects were identified for several measures including cortical thickness, trabecular bone volume fraction as well as trabecular number and thickness in B6 mice with the magnitude of effect dependent upon the intervention type, whereas no exercise treatment effect was observed in the D2 animals. \nTaken as a whole, these results demonstrate the impact of different types of exercise on skeletal architecture, strength, and composition as a function of genetic predisposition.

Mutations in p53 are mostly found in the DNA-binding domain and they prevent p53 to exert its normal tumor suppressive functions. Furthermore, p53 mutations can result in gain-of-function activity, acquiring oncogenic characteristics. Therefore, altering the stability of mutant p53 protein is an attractive therapeutic strategy in cancer cells. The current project aims to identify compounds that restore the p53 pathway and modulate mutant p53 protein. Accordingly, we used a luciferase based p53 reporter to screen for small molecules that restore the p53 pathway in mutant p53-bearing cancer cells. We identified a small molecule, CB002, as a candidate for restoration of the p53 pathway in mutant p53-harboring cancer cells. \n\n\tColorectal cancer cell lines SW480 and DLD-1 were treated with different concentrations of CB002 at various time points. Cell lines exposed to CB002 showed an increase in p53 target gene expression (i.e. NOXA/DR5/P21) and apoptotic cell death markers (i.e. cleaved caspases and PARP), as early as 16 hrs. Moreover, we showed that CB002 selectively results in apoptotic cell death in cancer cells and not in WI38 normal human lung fibroblast cells as indicated by the Sub-G1 content. To explore the importance of the p53 target genes in apoptotic cell death, we knocked-down DR5 and NOXA proteins. Stable knockdown of NOXA abolished apoptotic cell death whereas DR5 did not, indicating that NOXA is required for CB002-mediated cell death. Following CB002 treatment, we observed an increase in the formation of vacuoles within treated cells. Thus, NOXA induction together with the formation of vacuoles prompted us to investigate if autophagy was playing a role in degradation of mutant p53. Autophagy induction was confirmed by LC3B conversion in cell lysates. CB002 decreased the stability of mutant p53 R175H in HCT116 and RXF393 cells. Although blocking autophagy did not rescue mutant p53 protein expression, induction of autophagy was required for cell death. We further investigated if CB002 was mediating mutant R175H p53 protein degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. R175H p53 mutant protein expression was largely rescued by the co-treatment of CB002 with MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor, implicating a role for the ubiquitin proteasome system. Altogether, our data suggests that CB002 stimulates apoptosis through the induction of NOXA and degrades mutant p53 R175H through the ubiquitin proteasome system. In addition,  induction of autophagy by CB002 appears to be required for cell death. Hence, our results provide insight into effective p53 pathway activation through the use of small molecules.

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the integration of various alternative tactics that can control several key pests in cucurbits in a more durable and ecologically sound way. A two year (2006-2007) split-plot field experiment was conducted to evaluate the integration of resistance inducers such as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR, BioYield\u2122), calcium silicate and phosphonate, as well as row covers and systemic insecticides to manage multiple important pests that occur naturally in cucumber and squash. Fabric row covers were used during the second experimental year (2007) on cucumber. Various diseases such as bacterial wilt, powdery mildew, downy mildew and mosaic virus, as well as striped cucumber beetles and other Diabrotica spp. were assessed on a weekly basis during the growing season in both years. Additionally, cucumber and squash fruits were harvested during the growing season to measure crop productivity and yield. Distinct and significant results were observed during both years in both cucumber and squash. Results indicated that row cover proved to be a better strategy for suppressing beetle populations and bacterial wilt as well as increasing plant productivity compared to the recommended systemic insecticide in cucumber.

Three rowcover treatments (removal at anthesis, removal 10 days after anthesis and no rowcover), three nutrient treatments (applied using 10 or 30% mineralization rates, and organic bagged fertilizer) and two PGPR treatments (with or without seed treatment) were assigned to plots in a split plot factorial design. An extra rowcover treatment (removal at harvest with bumblebee hives placed under the rowcovers) was used in squash. Data were collected for ambient air and soil temperatures, striped cucumber beetle densities, bacterial wilt severity, squash bug density, soil properties, leaf tissue nutrient concentrations, open flower counts, bee visitation, seed counts, fruit quality, earliness and yield. Rowcovers modified the crop microclimate by increasing air and soil temperatures. In muskmelon, removing rowcovers 10 days after anthesis significantly reduced cucumber beetle density and bacterial wilt disease severity, enhanced earliness and increased yield. In 2009, the use of rowcovers increased plant nutrient concentrations. In squash removing rowcovers at anthesis prevented squash bugs from laying their eggs on plants and significantly increased yield.  Soil proprieties were variable between years for different nutrient treatments in muskmelon and squash. However, applying compost using a 30% mineralization rate (low amount) was the best nutrient treatment for reducing bacterial wilt and squash bug egg masses and increasing soil fertility and organic matter without impacting yield compared to the organic bagged fertilizer for muskmelon and squash. Interaction terms were found between PGPR and nutrient treatments on the severity of bacterial wilt during the three years of the study in muskmelon but no significant effect was found on squash.

High surface area, strain relaxation, quantum confinement, and orthogonal light absorption and charge separation are examples. In this work, conducting polymer nanowires were synthesized by template-assisted electrodepositon.  The dimensions of the nanowires could be easily controlled, and arrays or individual nanowires could be obtained.     The conducting polymers synthesized were polypyrrole and poly(3,4-ethylendioxythiophene), as well as palladium-polymer and platinum-polymer composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) / energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were employed for structural characterization.  Integration of the nanowires onto test structures was carried through electrofluidic assembly. Once assembled, the electrical properties of individual nanowires were investigated and studied for sensing of various gases. \n\nTemplate-assisted electrodeposition was also employed to synthesize cadmium selenide (CdSe) and copper indium diselenide (CuInSe2) nanowires. The crystal structure and crystallite domain size of the CdSe nanowires was controlled by either direct electrodeposition from an electrolyte that contained both elements or by topochemical cation exchange starting from crystalline t-Se nanowires. This was confirmed by TEM, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and electron diffraction. CdSe nanowire photoanodes were used to study the effects of crystallite domain size on the photoelectrochemical properties.  CuInSe2 nanowires were characterized by SEM, TEM/EDS, XRD, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, Mott-Schottky analysis, and single wire electrical measurements. It was demonstrated that single phase p- and n-type CuInSe2 nanowires could be fabricated by this method.     \n \nSince micro and nanowire arrays coupled to inexpensive catalysts are promising materials for unassisted-overall water splitting, the viability of membrane-based electrolytic cells was investigated. The challenge is to find conditions under which the cell can operate at solar flux (25 mA/cm2) and near neutral pH without significant series resistance.   Potential losses   were analyzed with anion exchanger membranes and different buffers.  It was discovered that monoprotic buffers gave minimal transmembrane pH gradients because of fast permeation of the membrane by the neutral acid.

As one example, manganese (Mn) is enriched in surface soils at the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO), a small watershed in Huntingdon County, PA.  Soils at the SSHCZO record the legacy of industrial Mn inputs from the numerous iron furnances operating in Huntingdon County during the mid-19th century and the widespread industrialization of PA into the 20th century.  Atmospheric inputs of manganese to soils from disperse industrial sources have led to widespread but patchy contamination of soils with Mn in previously or currently industrialized regions throughout Pennsylvania and the United States.  The enrichment of Mn in a soil profile relative to the parent lithology can be quantified to derive estimates of past atmospheric inputs.  We establish that although atmospheric deposition rates of Mn have fallen with the decline of the iron and steel industries, soils, vegetation, and water systems in Pennsylvania exhibit high concentrations of Mn, and impacted ecosystems slowly release accumulated Mn from soils and vegetation into rivers.  \n\nThe rate of transfer of Mn contamination from soils into rivers is strongly impacted by vegetation in SSHCZO.  Specifically, trees take up dissolved Mn from the soil and store it in biomass for years to decades.  Additionally, the soluble Mn that is stored in biomass is oxidized and immobilized as Mn-oxides in the soil during biomass decomposition.  The continuing process of uptake, storage, and oxidation of Mn in vegetation leads to long-term retention of Mn within impacted ecosystems, and Mn is only slowly leaked from soils and vegetation into rivers.  Conversely, high concentrations of soil organic matter in parts of the catchment lead to high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon that facilitate Mn mobilization from soils. Thus, the Shale Hills catchment is characterized by spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the rates that Mn is leached from soils into pore fluids and streams.  Specifically, Mn is input to the SSHCZO stream dominantly from organic-rich swales during periods of low stream discharge, and Mn concentrations in the stream are diluted by inputs from organic-poor hillslopes during periods of high stream discharge.  Overall, biological cycling increases Mn retention in ecosystems impacted by industrial inputs and concentrates the Mn into soils with high soil organic matter before the Mn is lost from the catchment.  Vegetation therefore acts as a capacitor that concentrates Mn inputs in this temperate catchment.\t\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7965], "author_name_tesi": "Herndon, Elizabeth Maureen", "last_name_ssi": "Herndon", "middle_name_ssi": "Maureen", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley", "David Eissenstat", "Jennifer Macalady", "Peter J Heaney", "Carmen Martinez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley, Dissertation Advisor", "David Eissenstat, Committee Member", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member", "Peter J Heaney, Committee Member", "Carmen Martinez, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Biogeochemistry", "Shale Hills", "Critical Zone", "manganese"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF GENERAL ANESTHESIA ON URINARY BIOMARKERS OF KIDNEY INJURY: HEPATITIS A VIRUS CELLULAR RECEPTOR-1 (HAVCR1) AND   LIPOCALIN-2 (LCN2)", "id": "rb68xb84x", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12553", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The continued development and ongoing use of urinary biomarkers for sensitive prediction of kidney injury in both preclinical and clinical studies is an active area of research.  As new markers are identified and validated, it is important to utilize them in an effort to reevaluate the safety of medications delivered to animals during research.  Given the frequent use of anesthesia in various animal models of disease, including in the evaluation of kidney injury, information regarding the effects of anesthesia alone is important in both guiding the appropriate selection of anesthetic agents, as well as in the interpretation of data.  For this purpose, a prospective study utilizing male C57BL/6J (n=45) mice exposed to a single anesthetic episode of one of several commonly used anesthetics was developed.  Three injectable agents (ketamine/xylazine, tiletamine-zolazepam, and pentobarbital) and two inhalational agents (isoflurane and sevoflurane) were evaluated, and urine was collected at various time points (0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hr) following anesthesia.  Expression of hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (HAVCR1, AKA KIM-1) and lipocalin 2 (LCN2, AKA NGAL) were measured in the collected urine samples by ELISA.  HAVCR1 levels were significantly elevated over baseline in the ketamine/xylazine group at 6 hr following recovery from anesthesia.  The remaining groups did not increase over baseline during the first 24 hr following anesthesia.  Conversely, LCN2 levels were significantly decreased from baseline at 6 hr following ketamine/xylazine anesthesia.  Surprisingly, LCN2 levels steadily increased over the first 24 hrs following both isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia, with significant elevations present at 24 hr after sevoflurane.  These results suggest an immediate effect of injectable anesthesia on HAVCR1 and LCN2, while the inhalational effect on these biomarkers increases with time.

My analysis incorporates both forms while still keeping important criticisms of both in mind. Both forms of evidence, archaeological and historical, have biases, and it is important to consider their nuances and limitations as well as the information they offer. In the first chapter, I describe the most important previous approaches to the person of Herod and evaluate both the theoretical paradigms as well as the methodologies which governed them. I show how the evidence from Herod\u2018s baths has seldom been meaningfully utilized to evaluate the king. In the second chapter, I provide a synthesis of the archaeological evidence for Herod\u2018s bathing installations and show that his predilection for imported Roman luxuries was balanced against his devotion to Jewish strictures of ritual purity. In the third chapter, I examine the evidence which Flavius Josephus preserves for the life of Herod and show that, though our best historical source, the writer was unfamiliar with Herod\u2018s personal bathing habits. In the fourth and final chapter, I locate the discussion of Herod\u2018s bathing practices within the larger debate over Romanization in the Empire, showing that Herod\u2018s adoption of Roman baths fits within this model as an expression of both local and empire-wide power dynamics and a display of conspicuous consumption.

After a series of devastating earthquakes shook the country in January 2010, Haiti was launched into the American media once again. The earthquakes and the aftershocks that followed were the worst to impact the nation in nearly 200 years, causing the United States to send millions of dollars in aid, search and rescue personnel, and military officials to organize the relief effort. Twenty-four hour cable news networks were among many other news providers to monitor nearly all aspects of the disaster. \n\nPrior studies have explored how the American media cover disasters. However, few have sought to understand how 24-hour American cable news providers handle disaster coverage, and even fewer have investigated how American media depict Haiti and Haitians. Therefore, the purpose of this study was two-fold. First, to investigate how American 24-hour cable news networks, specifically Cable News Network (CNN), Microsoft and National Broadcasting Company (MSNBC), and Fox News Channel (FNC) discursively portrayed Haiti and its people in the aftermath of this overwhelming disaster. Secondly, to gain an understanding of what aspects of this disaster these cable news providers considered most newsworthy. \n\nDiscourse is a powerful rhetorical tool that is often used to perpetuate existing ideologies, both implicitly and explicitly. In this case, it is imperative to consider how discourse perpetuates and justifies power and dominance. Therefore, it is important to understand the role of American 24-hour cable news networks in framing both Haiti and Haitians discursively during a vulnerable time.

Van Dijk\u2019s Critical Discourse Analysis approach to analyze a total of 224 news transcripts from the three most viewed cable news networks: CNN (n=184), MSNBC, (n=13) and FNC (n=17) from January 12, 2010 to December 31, 2010. Five main themes emerged from the disaster coverage: problematic pre-conditions, incompetence of the Haitian government, U.S. involvement in the relief efforts, victim experience and recovery. \n\nIn their uneven coverage, the three networks \u201crecontextualized\u201d the disaster for American viewers by using semantic strategies that Teun A. Van Dijk (1991) would describe as: \u201cpresupposition,\u201d \u201chyperbole,\u201d \u201cvagueness,\u201d \u201cover-completeness,\u201d \u201cblaming the victim,\u201d \u201ccomparison\u201d and \u201cadmission.\u201d Overall, the coverage portrayed Haiti as a charity case in need of not only funding, but of order and proper governance \u2013 which could be accomplished by U.S. intervention. Additionally, the coverage offered by these networks perpetuated some long-standing notions of Haiti and its people and focused on poverty, political instability, and weak infrastructure. Limitations were also identified.\n\nHopefully, this study\u2019s findings contribute to literature on American media portrayals of Haiti and its people, while offering insight to how discourse on 24-hour cable news networks can potentially impact the way in which viewers perceive Haiti and countries like it. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [946], "author_name_tesi": "Herring, Courtney Celiese", "last_name_ssi": "Herring", "middle_name_ssi": "Celiese", "first_name_ssi": "Courtney", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Media Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Olorunnisola", "Anthony Olorunnisola"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Olorunnisola, Thesis Advisor", "Anthony Olorunnisola, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Earthquakes", "News ethics", "Disaster communication", "Semantic strategies", "Critical Discourse Analysis", "Natural disasters", "Haiti", "Poverty", "Hegemony"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Late Ordovician ocean-climate system and paleobiogeography", "id": "6274", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "67", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Ordovician was a time of extensive diversification and radiation of marine life. The end of the Ordovician is marked by a major mass extinction that is generally attributed to environmental perturbations associated with an extensive yet short-lived glaciation. The understanding of the climate dynamics during this crucial time period for the evolution of life is still fragmental.\nI used an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) and an ocean general circulation model (OGCM) to study the climate system in the Caradoc (~454 Ma) and the Ashgill (~545 Ma). Specifically, I investigated the response to changes in paleogeography, atmospheric pCO2, solar insolation cycles (obliquity), poleward ocean heat transport, and sea level. I also used a 3-dimensional ice sheet model to explore the necessary boundary conditions for ice sheet formation.\nThe AGCM results indicate that, assuming that pCO2 did not fall below 8x PAL (a minimum value for this time period), a drop in pCO2 and the paleogeographic evolution can only be regarded as preconditioning factors in the glaciation. In order for ice sheets to form, other factors must have changed such as a drop in sea level from its generally high Late Ordovician levels and/or a reduction in poleward ocean heat transport.\nIn all OGCM simulations, a drop in sea level led to a reduction in poleward ocean heat transport.  This indicates a possible positive feedback that could have led to enhanced global cooling in response to pre-glaciation sea level drop. Continental drift could explain the observed global cooling trend in the Late Ordovician through a combined reduction in poleward ocean heat transport and increased ice-albedo effect. The ocean-climate system was also dominated by strong latitudinal temperature gradients and vigorous horizontal and vertical ocean circulation.\nFinally, I compared the paleobiogeography of different taxonomic groups to the results of the climate models. The spatial distribution of Caradocian marine organisms is consistent with climatic and oceanographic gradients inferred from coupled ocean-climate models. The paleobiogeographic data thus provide an important evaluation of the global ocean-climate models and lead to a more robust inference of the early Late Ordovician global ecosystem.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [68], "author_name_tesi": "Herrmann, Achim Dirk", "last_name_ssi": "Herrmann", "middle_name_ssi": "Dirk", "first_name_ssi": "Achim", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark E Patzkowsky", "Rudy L Slingerland", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr.", "David Pollard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark E Patzkowsky, Committee Chair", "Rudy L Slingerland, Committee Member", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Committee Member", "David Pollard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ordovician", "ocean model", "climate model", "mass extinction", "paleobiogeography"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Probing Galactic Disks with Planetary Nebulae\n", "id": "9224", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3322", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution is severely limited by poorly known galaxy mass profiles.  Flat rotation curves indicate the presence of dark matter in the outer regions of spirals and determine total galactic mass, but rotation curves alone cannot decouple the mass contribution of the dark halo from that of the disk.  Thus astronomers typically assume a constant disk mass-to-light ratio (<i>M/L</i>) in models.  While studies indicate that <i>M/L</i> is constant in the inner regions of spirals, nothing is known about the <i>M/L</i> of outer disks.  To determine this quantity, one must measure the surface mass of a disk directly from the <i>z</i>-motions of its old disk stars.  Planetary nebulae (PNe) are ideal test particles because they are: bright and abundant to > 5 scale lengths (<i>h<sub>R</sub></i>), representative of the old disk, relatively easy to distinguish from H II regions, and their velocities are measurable to ~2 km s<sup>-1</sup> with fiber-fed spectrographs.\n\nThe first step, then, is to use narrow-band imaging to identify large (~100) samples of PNe in face-on spirals.  The magnitudes of the PN samples also provide reliable distances to the galaxies themselves via the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF).  I discovered 165, 153, 241, 150, 19, and 71 PNe in IC 342, M74 (NGC 628), M83 (NGC 5236), M94 (NGC 4736), NGC 5068, and NGC 6946, respectively, and determined distances of 3.5 \u00b1 0.3 Mpc, 8.6 \u00b1 0.3 Mpc, 4.8 \u00b1 0.1 Mpc, 4.4 <sup>+0.1</sup> <sub>-0.2</sub> Mpc, 5.4 <sup>+0.2</sup> <sub>-0.4</sub> Mpc and 6.1 \u00b1 0.6 Mpc, which agree well with values in the literature.  I also explored minor fluctuations in the PNLFs as a function of position in the galaxies.\n\nThe next step is to perform follow-up spectroscopy to measure as many velocities as possible and yet also obtain a high precision.  I used the Hydra multi-fiber spectrographs on the WIYN 3.5-m and CTIO Blanco 4-m telescopes, as well as the Hobby-Eberly Telescope's Medium Resolution Spectrograph, to measure velocities of 99, 102, 162, 127, and 48 PNe in IC 342, M74, M83, M94, and M101, respectively, to better than 15 km s<sup>-1</sup> precision.  I performed rigorous tests to determine my velocity uncertainties and I examined the line ratios of the spectra as well.\n\nUsing these data, I have determined disk mass surface density directly by analyzing the vertical velocity dispersion (&#963;<sub><i>z</i></sub>) of 550 planetaries in the previously mentioned five nearby low inclination spirals.  I removed galactic rotation using H I rotation curves and isolated &#963;<sub><i>z</i></sub> from the velocity ellipsoid by using the epicyclic approximation, a maximum likelihood analysis, and stability arguments.  Results from edge-on spirals helped me to estimate the vertical scale height, <i>h<sub>z</sub></i>, initially assumed to be constant with radius.\n\nMy results are interesting.  In most cases, within ~3 <i>h<sub>R</sub></i>, the exponential decrease of &#963;<sub><i>z</i></sub> generally follows that of the light, indicating that <i>M/L</i> is indeed constant in the inner regions of my galaxies.  These results agree with absorption line studies out to 1.5 <i>h<sub>R</sub></i>.  However, in the two galaxies with significant data beyond 4 <i>h<sub>R</sub></i>, &#963;<sub><i>z</i></sub> stops declining and drastically flattens out.  Possible physical explanations for my results include (1) variations in the light profile (i.e., a broken exponential) and flaring, possibly indicative of a transition between the thin and thick disks and (2) heating of the disk by halo substructure.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3308], "author_name_tesi": "Herrmann, Kimberly A.", "last_name_ssi": "Herrmann", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robin Bruce Ciardullo", "Jane Camilla Charlton", "Steinn Sigurdsson", "Richard Alan Wade", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robin Bruce Ciardullo, Committee Chair", "Jane Camilla Charlton, Committee Member", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Wade, Committee Member", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["extragalactic planetary nebulae", "galactic dynamics", "disk mass"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DIAGNOSTIC MODELING OF OCEANIC BIOGEOCHEMICAL FLUXES USING A GENERAL OCEAN TURBULENCE MODEL (GOTM) AND TIME-SERIES TRACER MEASUREMENTS \n", "id": "11361", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4489", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work addressed the ocean biogeochemical context of two climate-relevant gases: carbon dioxide (CO2) and dimethylsulfide (DMS).

The study looked specifically at the process of acquiring a professional identity for associate degree nursing graduates. The theoretical frameworks of structural functionalism and reference group theory provided the lens which guided the study. Structural functionalism is a sociological perspective describing how groups reproduce themselves by creating members whose behaviors and values correspond to the established group norms. A reference group is the social group which an individual uses to define attitudes, beliefs, and values which the individual wishes to emulate and join. Semi-structured interviews were used to learn the essence of being socialized into the profession of nursing and taking on a professional nursing identity for the participants. \nThe major finding which was revealed from this study was that taking on of a professional identity for the associate degree graduates occurred through an intermeshing of four processes.  The processes include: bringing of one\u2019s self; including past experiences and personality traits, to the educational programs; learning to become a nursing student; socializing into the professional nurse role; and internalizing the professional identity. This finding led to the creation of the Professional Nursing Identity Model.  Additional findings include: family members within healthcare professions are instrumental in guiding individuals into the profession of nursing; nursing students assess the attitudes, skills, and behaviors of the professional nurses with whom they interact; personal development is a byproduct of professional development; and learning to balance school work and home life while a student is valuable practice for balancing similar expectations of the professional nurse.  Based on these findings, implications for nursing and adult education are discussed.  Included are suggestions for future research surrounding professional identity development.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2779], "author_name_tesi": "Hershey, Jean L.", "last_name_ssi": "Hershey", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Jean", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniele D Flannery", "Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Samuel William Monismith", "Dennis Ray Lott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniele D Flannery, Committee Chair", "Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Member", "Samuel William Monismith, Committee Member", "Dennis Ray Lott, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Associate Degree Graduates", "Socialization", "Professional Identity; Nursing Students", "Phenomenology"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Numerical Analysis of 3d Flow in a Transonic Turbine Cascade Facility for Aerodynamic Loss Minimization", "id": "19109", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9037", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ability to test engineering ideas and designs at a computational level \u2013 before conducting physical tests and even far before real world operation \u2013 is a vital and necessary step in the development of that idea and design.

Designs were focused in two regions of the facility; the initial diffuser out of the second elbow and the stagnation chamber prior to the intended test-section region.  Within this diffuser a splitter plate was installed as a preventative separation device for the flow entering the stagnation chamber.  However, the splitter plate proved to choke and diminish the energy of the flow and was thus not further analyzed with the addition of the linear cascade system.

There are several methods, such as the T-burner, Rotating Valve Burner, and Impedance Tube that measure the acoustic admittance of the burning surface of solid propellant; however, each has its drawbacks.  This study sought to improve techniques for measuring acoustic admittance using a magnetic flowmeter in a system that created a strong, uniform magnetic field, increased the number of velocity measurements taken in a single burn, and increased the amplitude of the forced pressure oscillation.\nSamples of a composite solid rocket propellant were burned inside a stainless steel combustion chamber.  Acoustic oscillations were forced inside the chamber using two methods in an effort to impose an oscillating pressure on the burning propellant surface.  The first method used a rotating toothed gear that passed over the exit area of a sonic nozzle.  The second method took advantage of the deformation of a piezoelectric stack actuator to vibrate a titanium shim over the exit area.  In both methods, the mean and oscillatory pressures were measured.  Additionally, a permanent magnet and a flowmeter were utilized to measure the velocity of the combustion gases as they flowed from the burning surface.  These measurements were then used to calculate the acoustic admittance of the burning propellant surface.\nA 0.5 0.06 Tesla magnetic field was successfully created inside the stainless steel combustion chamber by using eight N42-grade nickel-coated neodymium rare earth magnets.  The magnetic field helped to increase the signal to noise ratio of the velocity measurement.  A combustion chamber that allowed for eight velocity measurements was also successfully created.  The use of eight velocity measurements in a single burn improved the statistical accuracy of each test.

This dissertation also includes some more fundamental exploratory syntheses to probe the limits of phosphazene chemistry and discover structure-property relationships that may be useful in designing compounds to fulfill important technical requirements.  Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to polymers and polyphosphazenes as well as ion-conducting materials and the contribution of polyphosphazene chemistry to that field.  Chapter 1 also provides a brief introduction to some of the analytical techniques employed in this dissertation.\n\tChapter 2 begins with the use of organophosphates as stand-alone non-volatile and fire-retardant liquid electrolyte media for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as well as their use as plasticizer in polymer gel electrolytes intended for application in lithium batteries. These organophosphates are the smallest phosphorus containing model molecules investigated in this dissertation.  A homologous series of oligoalkyleneoxy substituted phosphates was synthesized and the effect of the substituent chain length on viscosity and conductivity was investigated.  Small, test-scale DSSCs were constructed and showed promising results with overall cell efficiencies of up to 3.6% under un-optimized conditions.  Conductivity measurements were performed on polymer gel-electrolytes based on poly[bis(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)phosphazene] (MEEP) plasticized with the phosphate with the best combination of properties, using a system loaded with lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate as the charge carrier.  These measurements yielded promising results with conductivities (at 30 \u00b0C) as high as 3.0x10-3 S\u00b7cm-1 at the highest plasticizer loading.\n\tIn chapter 3 the effect of the cation of the charge carrier species on the anionic conductivity of DSSC type electrolytes is evaluated using hexakis(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)cyclotriphosphazene (MEE-trimer) as a small molecule model for MEEP.  The iodides of lithium, sodium, and ammonium as well as the ionic liquid, 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) were tested in various electrolyte concentrations.  After identifying PMII as the most efficient salt additive for promoting anion conduction in the MEE-trimer systems, it was tested in MEEP-based DSSC polymer-gel electrolytes plasticized with propylene carbonate (PC).  The MEEP/PMII type electrolytes were compared against and outperformed similar formulations based on poly(ethylene oxide).  An overall cell efficiency of 1.88% was obtained.\n\tChapter 4 extends the concept of poly[(oligoethyleneoxy)phosphazene] electrolytes by the synthesis of MEEP-analogues with various ammonium ions covalently bound to the polymer side chains in order to create a single-ion conducting polyelectrolyte.  The motivation for this approach is that  in this system the polymer serves as the conductive medium and provides the charge carriers.  In this case iodide is the only ion that is free to move and carry charge since the cation is bound to the polymer.  Two candidates from the series of polyelectrolytes were selected for extensive study, one in which the ammonium ion has a hexyl group, and another in which the ammonium ion has an MEE-group.  The polymers were characterized by dielectric spectroscopy, X-ray scattering, and density functional theory calculations.\n\tIn chapter 5 the concept of polyphosphazene based polyelectrolytes is extended further by quaternization of nitrogen atoms that are a part of the polymer backbone rather than a pendent group.  The feasibility of the concept is first explored using cyclic-trimeric phosphazenes as small molecule models and is then extended to high polymeric systems.  It was found that it is indeed possible to produce stable backbone-quaternized polyphosphazene electrolytes using strong methylation reagents such as methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate or  trimethyloxonium fluoroborate.  Unfortunately for their potential use in DSSCs, ion-exchange of the anions from the methylation reagents for iodide ion results in dealkylation or decomposition of the polyelectrolyte due to the high nucleophilicity of iodide.  However, the conductivities of the unplasticized polyelectrolytes containing mobile trifluoromethanesulfonate ion are among the highest observed for unplasticized solid-state polymer electrolytes or polyelectrolytes.\n\tChapter 6 begins a new section of exploratory synthesis meant to probe the limits of phosphazene chemistry and discover useful structure-property relationships as well as to improve on the synthetic procedures of the past.  Thus, in chapter 6 a series of cyclotriphosphazenes is synthesized for evaluation as compounds with the ability to complex to metal surfaces or to form ceramic materials after pyrolysis.  Several known compounds are resynthesized, many with improvements over previously published procedures either in yield or simplicity of reaction conditions.  Also, two new cyclotriphosphazenes were synthesized in an attempt to produce a catechol-like side group that could mimic the metal complexation and adhesive abilities of mussel adhesive proteins which take advantage of similar catecholic moieties.\n\tChapter 7 presents the synthesis of fluorine-bearing aryloxy phosphazenes in an attempt to overcome the deficiencies of some of the classical fluorinated organic polymers.  Classical organic fluorinated polymers designed to be flexible often contain aliphatic C-H bonds which limits their thermal, chemical, and radiation stability.  Poly(fluoroaryloxy)phosphazenes can offer many of the same advantages without the deficiencies of some of the more classical materials.  The materials synthesized are excellent candidates for dielectric film materials in capacitors.\n\tIn chapter 8 new ground is broken in phosphazene chemistry, wherein cycloalkanoxy groups, a type of side-group for phosphazenes that has been neglected in the past, are attached to the phosphazene skeleton.  First, a single previous report of the synthesis of hexakis(cyclohexanoxy)cyclotriphosphazene was reproduced as a model system.  Then a series of single substituent polyphosphazenes was synthesized in order to determine how large a saturated cyclic ring can be attached to the polymer backbone while still completing the replacement of the chlorine atoms attached to the backbone.  Subsequently, a series of mixed substituent polymers containing both cycloalkanoxy groups (from cyclopentoxy to cyclooctanoxy) and the well-studied trifluoroethoxy group was synthesized and characterized in order to study larger saturated cyclic rings as polyphosphazene side-groups.  These polymers are interesting not only from a fundamental scientific point of view, but may have applications in the field of membrane separations and are promising candidates for mechanical damping applications.\n\tChapter 9 contains the author\u2019s recommendations for the continuation of the research presented in this dissertation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10501], "author_name_tesi": "Hess, Andrew R", "last_name_ssi": "Hess", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock", "John V Badding", "John B Asbury", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock, Dissertation Advisor", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phosphazene", "polyphosphazene", "polymer electrolytes", "DSSC", "dye sensitized solar cell", "lithium battery", "lithium-ion battery"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Hadrianic Tondi on the Arch of Constantine: New Perspectives on the Eastern Paradigms\n", "id": "12120", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2018", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is a study of the impact of eastern traditions, culture, and individuals on the Hadrianic tondi. The tondi were originally commissioned by the emperor Hadrian in the second century for an unknown monument and then later reused by Constantine for his fourth century arch in Rome. Many scholars have investigated the tondi, which among the eight roundels depict scenes of hunting and sacrifice. However, previous Hadrianic scholarship has been limited to addressing the tondi in a general way without fully considering their patron\u2019s personal history and deep seated motivations for wanting a monument with form and content akin to the prerogatives of eastern rulers and oriental princes.\n\tIn this dissertation, I have studied Hadrian as an individual imbued with wisdom about the cultural and ruling traditions of both Rome and the many nations that made up the vast Roman realm of the second century. I have determined that the tondi reflect this knowledge in that for the first time in an imperial public state relief they commemorated the virtues of the emperor in a language derived from Hadrian\u2019s personal experiences and beliefs. \n\tThe tondi include the Bithynian youth Antinous. It is with Hadrian\u2019s fellowship with this Greek youth that a more nuanced understanding of the tondi resides. The tondi were a means to communicate Hadrian\u2019s and Antinous\u2019 heroic exploits in the hunt\u2014\u2014a theme that was utterly new in Roman imperial artistic context yet very much part of the personae of monarchs from eastern Royal Societies. The layers of meaning in the tondi even extended to the educational. They were not only public instruction about a strong, virtuous ruler; they were a manifestation of paideia, Greek education for the cultured elite. Part of this cultural education was to develop one\u2019s own worth, but it was also to introduce and involve youth in all the noble pursuits that made a man. The hunt gave public face to Antinous while at the same time commemorated Hadrian\u2019s intellectual, moral, and physical authority to rule. \n\t In my study, I also provide numerous examples of Hadrian\u2019s beneficence to the provinces. His legendary tireless journeys to the farthest reaches of the empire often saw him in some of the provinces on more than one occasion, especially his most beloved Greece\u2014\u2014Hadrian\u2019s devotion to Greek culture was equally renowned. By establishing a record of Hadrian\u2019s patronage in the most favored provinces this study legitimizes Hadrian\u2019s willingness to take the unprecedented leap in giving visual expression to ideas rooted in foreign philosophies. The round form of the tondi is also of great significance. I have offered the possibility that clipei virtuti, coins and medallions, and Roman marble oscilla served as prototypes for the tondi. Not only did they serve as sources for the tondi\u2019s round format, but they also had inherent meanings and traditions, which Hadrian appropriated and applied to the tondi. \n\tThe Hadrianic tondi were not the result of any one conception. They were the product of the most educated Roman emperor\u2019s life course. This dissertation is a study of the tondi and their patron, and how they reflected him in an entirely new way. They were at once and the same time, historical reliefs, imperial currency, religious proclamations, and personal testaments.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2000], "author_name_tesi": "Hess, Gerald A", "last_name_ssi": "Hess", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Gerald", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Walters", "Donald B Redford", "Craig Robert Zabel", "Brian A Curran", "Elizabeth Walters"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Walters, Dissertation Advisor", "Donald B Redford, Committee Member", "Craig Robert Zabel, Committee Member", "Brian A Curran, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Walters, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Antinous", "Hadrian", "Arch of Constantine", "Roman Art"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "LIVING BETWEEN THE EXTREMES:  A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY OF HOW MID-LIFE WOMEN RECREATE THEIR IDENTITY AFTER A WORK TRANSITION", "id": "10394", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6266", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\tThis qualitative research study examined the \"lived experiences\" of learning identity during work transitions among three women (ages 35 to 55) who were not previously married.  The research question was how do particular mid-life women who engage in a work transition re-construct the meaning of (or make sense of) their identity?  Primary research questions included the following:  \n*  What effect does the work transition experience have on one\u2019s identity?  \n*  What kind of feedback was received concerning the work transition?  \n*  How does one\u2019s identity affect what the new work role means to the participant?  \n*  How are various aspects of identity re-negotiated over time in the new career in order to reconcile a more whole or complete sense of self within the new work environment?    *  What aspects of identity (formation, or re-creation) remain difficult, and are these struggles dependent on length of time spent in the previous career?   \n*  Does one need to define oneself differently in order to accomplish the tasks required by the new work role?  \n \tResearch questions asked how co-researchers described their work transition, as well as inquiring about the feedback participants received during and after the transition process.  The study found that within the transition experiences the following themes emerged:  finding one\u2019s purpose in life; sensing unease during transitions; learning how to be in control through various means such as maturity, time, education, support/belonging, spirituality, hope and humor; passiveness with money, decision-making, and peer support; learning stereotypes versus learning one\u2019s purpose; learning marriage and singleness messages; conflict in the family of origin; and progressive mothers versus being \u2018just\u2019 a housewife.  \n \tQualitative research guidelines developed by Moustakas (1990, 1994), van Manen (1997, 2003), and the Duquesne Studies (1979, 1985) were used extensively.

This dissertation investigates several interactions between the host and the classical bordetellae, which must not only sense their environment, but evade host immunity to persist in the host. Little is known concerning what environmental cues the classical bordetellae sense within the host. Here, we investigated their response to growth in 5% CO2 conditions and identified increased transcription of several known virulence factor genes. Additionally, transcription of two genes, cyaA and fhaB, was found to be increased in 5% CO2 conditions in the absence of a functional BvgS\u2014the master virulence factor gene regulator. These data indicate that there are additional virulence factor gene regulatory mechanisms that respond to growth in 5% CO2 conditions. On the other hand to evade host innate immune response, Bordetella species secrete a molecule(s) that inhibits LPS-induced IL-1 secretion in murine macrophages. B. bronchiseptica and B. pertussis have additional mechanisms to induce secretion of IL-1, but B. parapertussis does not. This inhibitory molecule did not affect transcription or downstream inflammasome products, such as caspase-1, suggesting that it blocks release of IL-1 from macrophages. Furthermore, additional host immune factors are important for the control of Bordetella species colonization in the respiratory tract, such as complement. B. parapertussisov strains, isolated only from sheep, are rapidly cleared from the lower respiratory tract of mice, unlike the other classical bordetellae. B. parapertussisov strains did not produce an O-antigen, were susceptible to murine complement deposition and killing, and colonized complement deficient mice more efficiently. Unlike mouse serum, sheep serum did not efficiently kill B. parapertussisov strains, indicating a role for complement in host adaptation of this species. Evasion of cross-protective immune responses through antigenic variation is one strategy employed by pathogens to evade recognition by the immune response. The Bordetella species produce antigenically distinct O-antigens that appear, based on SNP density and phylogenetic analysis, to have been horizontally transferred, specifically the genes thought to be responsible for serotype differences. Additionally, poorly immunogenic O-antigens do not appear to generate cross-protective immune responses, suggesting that O-antigen variation allows for evasion of protective immune responses. Combined, the data herein suggest CO2 sensing by the classical bordetellae, the subversion of IL-1 secretion, a role for complement in host adaptation of a Bordetella species, and horizontal transfer of O-antigen serotype-specific genes to evade protective immunity.

First, memories expressed by the U.S. participants highlighted experiences of class, tokenism, family culture, value of education, and socio-culture/ethnicity, while memory for participants in Puerto Rico dealt with silence, invisibility, and normative social pressures. Second, turning points for participants in the U.S. meant realizing they could become professors, whereas for participants in Puerto Rico, turning points were related to visibility. Third, common themes between cultures were being allies and using emotional intelligence to negotiate space as faculty members. Fourth, exemplary institutional citizenship distinguished LGBQ\u2013Latina, Chicana faculty members from non-LGBQ faculty members.

The Pennsylvania State University has applied secondary treated wastewater effluent to forests and agricultural cropland from 1963 \u2013 1976, and continuously since 1983 at the Living Filter (LF) site.  The objective of this study was to characterize soil phosphorus (P) accumulation for contiguous wastewater-irrigated forested and grassed areas of the LF. An adjacent unirrigated area served as control.  Soil cores were collected from the Hagerstown soil, and divided into five layers by depth (0 \u2013 15, 15 \u2013 30, 30 \u2013 45, 45 \u2013 60, and 60 \u2013 75 cm).  The samples were analyzed for Mehlich-3 extractable P, aluminum (M3Al), iron (M3Fe), copper, calcium, as well as pH, total P (TP), and percent organic matter content.\nA TP mass balance was performed for the crop field and forest soils for the top 75 cm of soil.  Effluent applied P was estimated using historical data and average annual TP loading rates.  Biomass removal was subtracted from applied P to determine the net P applied with wastewater irrigation.  Control site soil data were used as a baseline to establish the amount of applied TP retained in the top 75 cm of soil since irrigation commenced.  The mass balance indicates that 63 and 70% of wastewater-applied TP cannot be accounted for in the top 75 cm of soil in the field and forest, respectively.  Because extensive records have been kept of effluent application rates and P concentrations, as well as harvested forage yields and nutrient contents, it is unlikely that imprecision in the values used in the mass balance can explain the magnitude of the unaccounted for effluent-applied P.\nBecause the samples in the cropped field were taken at summit landscape positions, it is likely that surface runoff and subsurface lateral flow of effluent P, documented by other researchers, is partially responsible for the deficit of P in the 0-75 cm soil layer. Moreover, changes in the P-retention ability of the soil and the high hydraulic loading rate (irrigation plus natural precipitation of ~300 cm water per year) has probably caused leaching of P below the 75 cm depth.\nThe capacity of the soil to assimilate and renovate effluent-applied P has been reduced as a result of irrigation with wastewater.  M3Al and M3Fe results suggest podsolization may have occurred in both the field and the forest soil profiles, which could explain the lower P-retention properties of the surface soil layers.  Since the soils are no longer acidic, the mobilization of Al and Fe is likely less significant than early in the system operation.  Copper, which forms strong complexes with soil organic matter, also appears to have leached to a greater extent from the surfaces layers in the wastewater-irrigated forest.  \nIf leaching below 75 cm has occurred, the deep soils (> 200 cm) and distance (> 30 m below surface) to the permanent groundwater table suggest that the penetration of P into the subsoil of the forested area has had little impact thus far on groundwater water quality.  Additional research is warranted to understand the long-term impacts of P application on the sustainability of land treatment as a viable means of recycling municipal wastewater effluent.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6310], "author_name_tesi": "Heyler, Timothy W", "last_name_ssi": "Heyler", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Pollution Control", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott", "Herschel Adams Elliott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott, Thesis Advisor", "Herschel Adams Elliott, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["forest", "wastewater irrigation", "soil phosphorus"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Contributions of the Capsid N-terminal Domain to the Regulation of Assembly and Maturation in Rous Sarcoma Virus ", "id": "22812", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10146", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Retroviruses are pathogens with the unique ability to integrate directly into the genome of their host cells, creating permanent infections that are propagated with every subsequent cell division. The lasting nature of integrated proviruses makes retroviral infections such as HIV difficult to eradicate despite the availability of effective drug combinations that suppress viral replication. Thus, continued exploration of the retroviral life cycle remains essential to the identification of targets for future drug design. One attractive prospect for pharmacological intervention is the assembly and maturation of new viral particles. Since proper assembly and maturation are prerequisites for infectivity, agents that interfere at these stages could potentially prevent viral transmission. \n\nImmature retrovirus assembly is a complicated, multifactorial process that centers on the formation of an spheroidal Gag shell around two copies of the RNA genome. While Gag-Gag interactions in the shell occur between all the components of the polyprotein, the CA (capsid) protein mediates major contacts that determine proper spacing and successful assembly of a new virus. After immature particle release and protease activation, retroviruses undergo a maturation step that results in a complete reorganization of the viral interior, culminating in the assembly of newly liberated CA into a polyhedral capsid around the nucleocapsid (NC)-coated genome and reverse transcriptase (RT). CA sequence manipulation can interfere with both initial viral particle release and formation of the mature capsid. Therefore, careful characterization of the CA interactions that build immature and mature virions and identification of the regions of CA that regulate maturation is vital to our understanding of how to build an infection-competent virus. \n\nThe flexible loop (FL) region of the CA protein poses one potential control point for the ordered assembly of infectious particles. Located on the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the two-domain CA protein, the FL is a structurally heterogeneous, sequentially divergent, and relatively dynamic stretch of residues. Mutations in the FL sequence alternately disrupts budding or maturation, and a number of host restriction factors bind the FL, suggesting a possible role for the region in particle assembly, the maturation transition, and even establishment of a new infection. The structural significance of the FL is further underscored by a recent study showing that the region participates directly in an interface connecting adjacent monomers of CA within an immature Gag lattice. \n\nIn order to determine how the FL could participate in the assembly of an infection-competent virus, we undertook targeted mutagenesis to identify essential residues for viral infectivity. The strongest effects were seen at three charged residues, which were further characterized to differentiate whether mutations affected immature assembly, the maturation transition, or a combination of both steps. We found that charges at these positions strongly affected the regularity of initial particle formation, but their absence did not preclude in vitro formation of mature CA-CA contacts. Modeling of the residues into the immature Gag lattice structure suggested that these residues participated in the FL-FL interface, which is unique to the Gag lattice. A gain of function suppressor mutant that compensated for an infectivity defect at one of these positions mapped in the model to an extended form of the same interface, reinforcing the possibility that these charged residues primarily serve as control points in the formation of the immature Gag lattice. \n\nBased on these findings, we extended the current model of the immature Gag lattice to include the FL region, which was partially omitted in the published structures.  Molecular dynamics modeling performed by collaborators at UIUC identified novel contacts in the FL-FL interface that we tested in the viral context. This work identified at least one completely new interaction that we assessed with dual cysteine mutations in an attempt to link monomers across the interface. Infectivity and particle release data with the double mutant showed aberrant Gag release and processing, providing some of the first viral support for the immature lattice model that appear to demonstrate interactions across the newly described FL-FL interface. \nSince published structures of the mature capsid do not suggest a direct structural role for the FL in any interfaces in the lattice, we also examined how FL residues may work cooperatively with distant regions of the CA protein. Using a triple mutant suppressor virus that required an FL and CTD mutation to compensate for an infectivity defect from a founder lesion in the N-terminus of CA, we characterized how these residues worked cooperatively to promote the assembly of a maturation-competent, infectious virus. Altogether, these data support a strong regulatory role for the FL in the assembly of a nascent viral particle, and suggest that proper control of Gag lattice formation facilitates subsequent reorganization into a mature capsid. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9837], "author_name_tesi": "Heyrana, Katrina Joy", "last_name_ssi": "Heyrana", "middle_name_ssi": "Joy", "first_name_ssi": "Katrina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rebecca C Craven", "Rebecca C Craven", "Jianming Hu", "Faoud T Ishmael", "Clare E Sample", "John Warren Wills"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rebecca C Craven, Dissertation Advisor", "Rebecca C Craven, Committee Chair", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member", "Faoud T Ishmael, Committee Member", "Clare E Sample, Committee Member", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["retroviruses", "capsid assembly", "Gag assembly", "virus maturation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Adaptive Password Meters with Unreliable Storage", "id": "19011", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9148", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "User-chosen passwords continue to be a primary means of authorization on computerized systems.

Due to this variability, password meters that base score on the existing set of passwords may perform better. For such an adaptive password meter to function, it must have access to some information about the passwords other than their hashed values. This means that the system must store this additional information.

The first uses a multilevel logistic regression approach to examine patterns of between-child variation in cognitive and socioemotional school readiness. The second analytic chapter examines children\u2019s reading and mathematics ability growth from kindergarten through eighth grade using a three-level mixed-effects modeling framework. The final component of the present study examines variation in adolescents\u2019 reading and mathematics self-concept prior to high school entry using a two-level random-effects modeling approach. Results suggest that immigrant generational status is an important moderator of racial/ethnic variation along several measures of academic success. Among non-Asian minority children, those with foreign-born mothers tend to demonstrate lower levels of school readiness and flatter ability growth trajectories than third-plus generation children. Among Asian children, however, children of foreign-born mothers experience advantages relative to their first and second generation counterparts. After adjusting for an array of family background characteristics, children from racial/ethnic minority and immigrant families demonstrate comparable ability growth trajectories to non-Hispanic white children of native-born mothers, with the exception of non-Hispanic black and first/second generation Mexican children, who fall increasingly behind over the elementary and middle school years. Children of immigrant mothers generally demonstrate higher levels of academic self-concept than children of native-born mothers, and most minority adolescents have comparable levels of academic self-concept to non-Hispanic white adolescents after adjusting for family background characteristics. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2960], "author_name_tesi": "Hibel, Jacob Rosson", "last_name_ssi": "Hibel", "middle_name_ssi": "Rosson", "first_name_ssi": "Jacob", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle Lynn Frisco", "Michelle Lynn Frisco", "George Farkas", "Alan Booth", "Emily Kate Greenman", "Paul Morgan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle Lynn Frisco, Dissertation Advisor", "Michelle Lynn Frisco, Committee Chair", "George Farkas, Committee Chair", "Alan Booth, Committee Member", "Emily Kate Greenman, Committee Member", "Paul Morgan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["immigration", "self-concept", "academic achievement", "school readiness", "generational status"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INTER-PARENTAL CONFLICT AND EARLY CHILDHOOD ADRENOCORTICAL ACTIVITY: A BIOSOCIAL FAMILY SYSTEMS APPROACH\n\n", "id": "9918", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3731", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It is universally accepted that family conflict exposure is a significant stressor in the lives of children and a driving force in the development of maladjustment. Unfortunately, little progress has been made in determining the mechanisms by which this occurs. Theoretical models of risky families highlight the potential for exposure to conflict and violence to dysregulate stress physiology, thus precipitating the development of mental and physical health problems. While past studies have found variations in intensity, and frequency of conflict, to be implicated in the development of pathology, recent mechanistic studies of stress physiology have failed to incorporate this level of detail in their examination of conflicted families. Furthermore, maternal behaviors have been shown to be critical in both facilitating the development of stress responsive physiological systems and mitigating the repercussions of conflict and violence exposure.  The analyses presented in the following chapters will attempted to integrate a family systems approach along with a biosocial model of atypical development. Study 1 will examine the unique contributions of verbal and physical aggression on infant adrenocortical levels, reactivity, and recovery. Study 2 will examine the implications of chronic exposure to violence across the first two years of life on toddler adrenocortical levels, reactivity, and recovery. Data come from the Family Life Project, a multi-site study of child development in the context of non-urban poverty. At enrollment the sample (n = 1,292 mother-infant dyads; 49.4 % male) was racially diverse (41% African American) and from predominantly low-income (78% of the families were more than 200% below the poverty line), rural communities. During a home visit, the child\u2019s saliva was sampled before, 20-minutes, and 40-minutes after standardized tasks designed to elicit the child\u2019s emotional arousal and later assayed for cortisol. Mothers completed self-report measures of her and her partner\u2019s verbal and physical aggression. Parenting behaviors were assessed via structured interview and mother-child interactions. Study 1 focused on the later infancy assessment when the child was 15 months old and Study 2 focused on data up to and including the toddler assessment when the child was 24 months old. Results from Study 1 found the confluence of inter-parental verbal aggression and maternal insensitivity to be related to heightened cortisol levels. Similarly, the combination of physical violence and low levels of maternal negative-intrusion was related to higher overall cortisol levels. Analyses for Study 2 revealed chronic exposure to inter-parental violence to be related to heightened cortisol reactivity. However, early maternal sensitivity was found to completely buffer children from heightened cortisol reactivity. In other words, children exposed to maternal sensitivity during early infancy (at approximately 7-months) did not exhibit high cortisol reactivity even when exposed to chronic inter-parental violence. Findings are discussed within the framework of current biopsychosocial and risky family theories.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3712], "author_name_tesi": "Hibel, Leah  Corinne", "last_name_ssi": "Hibel", "middle_name_ssi": "Corinne", "first_name_ssi": "Leah ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Douglas Granger", "Douglas A Granger", "Elizabeth Susman", "Laura Klein", "Alan Booth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Douglas Granger, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas A Granger, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Susman, Committee Member", "Laura Klein, Committee Member", "Alan Booth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["inter-parental conflict", "cortisol", "mother", "child"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Role of Atmospheric Parameters and Turbulence on Meteor Trail Evolution: Analysis and Simulations", "id": "11185", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1723", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this thesis is to present analyses on two different meteor trail echo types: non-specular and underdense specular echoes.

For Catholic colleges and universities, these issues are evidenced by the difficulty some institutions have with being readily able to recognize their distinctive Catholic character, identity, and mission (Gallin, 2000; Garrett; 2006; Hellwig, 2005). Among Catholic scholars, the perception and significance of these identity questions and concerns are varied. Some Catholic scholars regard the situation as catastrophic, warning that Catholic higher education is experiencing an identity crisis (Dosen, 2009; Morey & Piderit, 2006).  Other Catholic higher education authorities take a less ominous approach, referring to the question of Catholic identity as a problem (Gleason, 1995) or challenge, as a former president of the University of Notre Dame described it  (Hesburgh, 1994).     \n\tSeveral specific circumstances have been attributed to the identity concerns in Catholic higher education. These factors are: an increasing reliance on the laity; declining membership within sponsoring congregations; changing organizational and stakeholder characteristics; finances; and the recent pedophilia and sex-abuse scandals that have rocked the Roman Catholic Church. These identity concerns, combined with the social, political and cultural changes in American society and the Roman Catholic Church over the last 50 years, have left the Catholic higher education community to wonder \u201cwhat is a Catholic university?\u201d (O\u2019Brien, 1997, p. 38).\nThe purpose of this qualitative study is to understand how senior executives; specifically presidents, provosts, chief student affairs officers, and senior executives for development, understand and promote organizational identity and culture at three northeastern Catholic colleges and universities.  Furthermore, this study compares the experiences of these senior executives based on the executive\u2019s position as a religious or lay leader at the institution.  The results of the study indicate three major themes that explain how senior executives currently define, manage, and preserve Catholic identity and culture on campus. The three themes are: defining who we are; managing identities; and promoting and preserving Catholic culture and identity. These themes have assisted senior executives in distinguishing their institutions from other Catholic and secular postsecondary institutions. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7113], "author_name_tesi": "Hickey, Suzanne M", "last_name_ssi": "Hickey", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Suzanne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Beverly Lindsay", "Beverly Lindsay", "Edgar I Farmer Sr.", "Kimberly Griffin", "Timothy Grant Pollock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Beverly Lindsay, Dissertation Advisor", "Beverly Lindsay, Committee Chair", "Edgar I Farmer Sr., Committee Member", "Kimberly Griffin, Committee Member", "Timothy Grant Pollock, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Catholic", "Identity", "Culture", "Women Presidents", "Leadership", "Higher Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "The Identification of Effective Recruitment Strategies from Non-Traditional Engineers: A Recruitees' Perspective\n", "id": "7216", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1958", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nHistorically, there has been a myth in Corporate America which says there is a labor shortage of qualified talent, particularly among women and minorities in the high tech industry.

Thus, this research will identify the perceived effective recruitment strategies and techniques by senior-level non-traditional (i.e., first-generation African-American and Spanish-speaking; male and female) engineers.
