However, such understandings are often prevented by the complexities in the process coupling and challenges in modeling such couplings at watershed scale. \nThis dissertation presents an integrated approach to study this system. A fully coupled finite volume hydrological, land surface and reactive transport model: RT-Flux-PIHM has been developed. Based on Flux-PIHM, which simulates the terrestrial water cycle and the surface energy balance, the additional RT module explicitly models mass transfer and geochemical reactions, including mineral dissolution, precipitation, and ion exchange. As such, RT-Flux-PIHM is the first numerical model that provides the integration of land surface, hydrological, mass transfer and biogeochemical reaction at large scale.\nThe model was verified and then applied at the Susquehanna Shale Hills watershed (0.08 km2), a National Science Foundation (NSF) Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO). Based on existing conceptual framework on major hydrogeochemical processes and extensive measurements at the site (Herndon et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2011a), RT-Flux-PIHM reproduces the spatiotemporal evolution of solute concentrations which matched field observations. \nThe chloride concentration is controlled by inputs from rain and the hydrological connectivity of watershed. The watershed is well connected in the wet seasons, which allows fast flushing of chloride. In contrast, the less connected watershed in the summer sees \u201ctrapping\u201d of chloride in less connected area. Large rainfall events connect the whole watershed and wash out these \u201cold water\u201d pockets of high Cl concentrations \u2013 however, by the time the water emits at the stream mouth it is diluted significantly. This seasonal change in hydrological connectivity at the watershed scale essentially regulates the chloride concentration. \nExisting studies show the slope of the log-log concentration discharge (CQ) plot of chloride is ranging from 0 to -0.25 however it is unclear what controls the variations. Numerical experiments are conducted to elucidate the hydrological controls on the Cl CQ relationship. The chemostasis of chloride is dependent on the capability of the watershed to effectively mitigate the concentration variations induced by transition between source waters, e.g., from valley floor and swale subsurface flow to upslope subsurface flow, or from subsurface flow to deeper groundwater flow. Larger water storage leads to more chemostatic behavior while larger precipitation level and coarser soil both lead to stronger dilution behavior. However, transport parameters such as macro pore conductivity changed the Cl CQ slope only marginally.\nMg concentrations, however, are regulated by the interplay between clay dissolution and groundwater influx as sources and discharge as sink while ion exchange acts as the storage buffer. Faster clay dissolution in the wet season with more abundant water is accompanied by more diluted groundwater influxes to the stream at the mouth by more discharge. In the dry summer, the slower clay dissolution is accompanied by less diluted groundwater influxes at the stream mouth and lower discharge. Cation exchange buffers the Mg concentration by storing tens of times higher Mg on exchange sites than in pore water. Large rainfall events flush out significant amount of stored Mg on the exchange sites while also diluting the waters, leading to similar Mg concentrations in the stream waters in large and small rainfall events. In general, the multiple processes work together to generate the relatively consistent concentrations for both solutes. \nIn sum, the development of RT-Flux-PIHM enables studies on the hydrogeochemical dynamics at large scale, offering process-based modeling that integrates different processes while at the same time can separate and interrogate the importance of each mechanism.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11643], "author_name_tesi": "Bao, Chen ", "last_name_ssi": "Bao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Li Li", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Li Li", "Turgay Ertekin", "Christopher J Duffy", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Li Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Louise Brantley, Dissertation Advisor", "Li Li, Committee Chair", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydrologic modeling", "reactive transport", "watershed geochemistry", "concentration discharge relationship"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Meprin Metalloproteases Modulate Epithelial Barrier Integrity and Monocyte Migration", "id": "12670", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3049", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Meprin metalloproteases have been implicated in a number of normal developmental and pathological processes. However, it has been difficult to establish the cellular and molecular basis for the biological role of meprin metalloproteases in health and disease, possibly because of the large number of metalloproteases, many having overlapping substrate specificities. A number of important biological molecules have been demonstrated to be meprin substrates in vitro, such as extracellular matrix and cytokines. With the development of congenic mice lacking meprin activity, it has been possible to relate in vitro results with in vivo data to examine cellular and molecular processes. \n  The hypothesis of the thesis work is that meprins relax epithelial barriers by cleaving tight junction proteins, and facilitate monocyte migration. The study demonstrated that homomeric meprin A and meprin B cleaved the tight junction protein occludin, but not claudin-4, in membrane fractions from MDCK cells. Meprin A, but not meprin B, added exogenously to MDCK monolayers cleaved occludin. Meprin A, but not meprin B, cleaved recombinant occludin extracellular loops, and the cleavage site was determined in the first extracellular loop of occludin. Different cleavage site preferences at extracellular regions explain the different results between meprin A and meprin B to cleave occludin in intact cells and cell extacts. \n  The biological relevance of the in vitro experiments was demonstrated by studies in cell culture, in vivo and ex vivo. Meprin A disrupted the immunostaining of tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1 on MDCK monolayers. In addition, meprin A impaired the barrier function of MDCK monolayers, as shown by increased small molecule flux and decreased transepithelial electrical resistance. To elucidate the role of meprin A in acute urinary tract infections, meprin A was infused into the mouse bladder and the effects on bladder epithelium wall was investigated. The results showed that active meprin A increased the permeability of the epithelium as demonstrated by the influx of a fluorescene dye. The hypothesis that meprin A disrupts epithelial barriers and facilitates monocyte migration was further investigated by co-culturing monocytes with MDCK monolayers and measuring monocyte migration. Monocytes from mice lacking meprin A (meprin \uf061KO) were less able to migrate through MDCK monolayers than monocytes from wild-type mice. \n  It is concluded that the capability of meprin A to disrupt epithelial barriers is one important factor by which meprin A modulates inflammation.           \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3039], "author_name_tesi": "Bao, Jialing ", "last_name_ssi": "Bao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jialing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith S Bond", "Gail Lynn Matters", "Sergei A Grigoryev", "W.

Previously, the majority of the work reported was restricted to temperatures below 70oC due to apparatus constraints, whereas the current operation temperature for proton exchange membrane fuel cells is around 100oC and is envisioned to operate at even higher temperatures.  In this work, a special apparatus for controlled hydrodynamic study was constructed, which can keep the system in a single aqueous phase at elevated temperatures.  \nThe growth kinetics and mechanism of the anodic oxide film on platinum are studied under potential sweep conditions.  By fitting the current equation derived based on the framework of the point defect model (PDM) on the linear polarization curves, the kinetic parameters for film growth and dissolution are extracted, which agree well with other findings.  \nThe kinetics and mechanism of the HER are investigated both at ambient temperature with a rotating ring disk electrode and at elevated temperatures with a platinized nickel electrode.  Ambient results by micropolarization analysis agree well with findings in literature, and yield an exchange current density on the order of mA/cm2.  An activation energy of 17.3kJ/mol is determined.  This is comparable with that of a bulk platinum electrode, and is lower than sputtered platinum and single crystal platinum electrodes in alkaline solutions.  Surprisingly, the apparent Tafel slope of the hydrogen evolution reaction is almost temperature independent.  The most probable reason is that two parallel reactions with different activation energy and transfer coefficients are occurring at the interface.  \nThe OER on platinum is also studied by potential sweep method and potentiostatic polarization method.  The sluggish nature of this reaction is postulated to be due to the existence of a thin oxide layer on the electrode surface so that the electrons resides in the metal have to quantum mechanically tunnel (QMT) through this layer in order to reach the oxygen species in the solution or adsorbed on the surface.\nThe exponential decay of the current with potential (the inverse Tafel\u00a1\u00afs law) upon the formation of an oxide film can be accounted for by combining QMT theory for charge transfer across an interface and the PDM for film growth and dissolution.  A new method for extremely thin oxide film thickness measurement is also developed by combining these two theories.  This method employs the tunneling current of the hydrogen oxidation reaction as a probe and is demonstrated to be a very sensitive and convenient in situ technique.  However, currently the thickness range that can be measured is limited to 1-2nm, since the passive current of platinum imposing a lower limit of the tunneling current that can be measured.\nThe tunneling constant, which defines the blocking character of the film, is measured to be (0.57 \u00a1\u00c0 0.035) x 108cm-1, and is temperature independent.  A barrier height of 0.31eV at the film/solution interface is then yielded.  Theoretical interpretation is implemented by developing a model for the electronic structure of the metal/barrier layer/solution interphase utilizing the Boltzmann\u00a1\u00afs distribution law for the distribution of the energy states of the redox species in the solution phase and by noting that the barrier layer is a highly doped (and probably degenerate) defect (oxygen vacancy) semiconductor, having a Debye length that is the same order as the thickness of the film.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3038], "author_name_tesi": "Bao, Jianer ", "last_name_ssi": "Bao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jianer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Long Qing Chen", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tunneling current", "electrocatalysis", "platinum", "platinum oxide film", "Fuel cells", "quantum electrochemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Design and Characterization of Microporous Zeolitic Hydroceramic Waste Forms for the Solidification and Stabilization of Sodium Bearing Wastes\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "6223", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6818", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     During the production of nuclear weapon by the DOE, large amounts of liquid waste were generated and stored in millions of gallons of tanks at Savannah River, Hanford and INEEL sites.  Typically, the waste contains large amounts of soluble NaOH, NaNO2 and NaNO3 and small amounts of soluble fission products, cladding materials and cleaning solution.  Due to its high sodium content it has been called sodium bearing waste (SBW). We have formulated, tested and evaluated a new type of hydroceramic waste form specifically designed to solidify SBW.  \n\t     Hydroceramics can be made from an alumosilicate source such as metakaolin and NaOH solutions or the SBW itself.  Under mild hydrothermal conditions, the mixture is transformed into a solid consisting of zeolites.  This process leads to the incorporation of radionuclides into lattice sites and the cage structures of the zeolites. Hydroceramics have high strength and inherent stability in realistic geologic settings.  \n     The process of making hydroceramics from a series of SBWs was optimized. The results are reported in this thesis.  Some SBWs containing relatively small amounts of NaNO3 and NaNO2 (NOx/Na<25 mol%) can be directly solidified with metakaolin.  The remaining SBW having high concentrations of nitrate and nitrite (NOx/Na>25 mol%) require pretreatment since a zeolitic matrix such as cancrinite is unable to host more than 25 mol% nitrate/nitrite. Two procedures to denitrate/denitrite followed by solidification were developed.  One is based on calcination in which a reducing agent such as sucrose and metakaolin have been chosen as a way of reducing nitrate and nitrite to an acceptable level. The resulting calcine can be solidified using additional metakaolin and NaOH to form a hydroceramic. As an alternate, a chemical denitration/denitrition process using Si and Al powders as the reducing agents, followed by adding metakaolin to the solution prepare a hydroceramic was also investigated. Si and Al not only are the reducing agents, but they also provide Si and Al species to make zeolites during the reducing process. \n     Performance of the hydroceramics was documented using SEM microstructure and X-ray diffraction phase analysis, mechanical property and leaching tests (Product Consistency Test and ANSI/ANS-16.1 leaching test).  \n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6815], "author_name_tesi": "Bao, Yun ", "last_name_ssi": "Bao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michachel W Grutzeck", "Berry E Scheetz", "Paul Wencil Brown", "Alan James Benesi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michachel W Grutzeck, Committee Chair", "Berry E Scheetz, Committee Member", "Paul Wencil Brown, Committee Member", "Alan James Benesi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Zeolitic waste form", "Zeolites", "hdroceramics", "Nuclear waste form", "Radioactive waste form"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ANISOTROPIC HEAT CONDUCTION EFFECTS IN PROTON EXCHANGE\nMEMBRANE FUEL CELLS\n", "id": "8950", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "998", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two-dimensional single-phase and two-phase models were used to investigate the behavior of a PEM fuel cell under different steady-state conditions.

At a given fixed voltage and high humidity inlet conditions, the fuel cell generates maximum current density for bipolar plates with narrow ribs and for GDLs with low\nthrough-plane and high in-plane thermal conductivities. It is also predicted that for low\nhumidity operating conditions, the fuel cell generates maximum current density if the GDL is tailored to have high through-plane thermal conductivity and wider ribs near the inlet and progressively decreasing through-plane thermal conductivity and narrower ribs at distances away from the inlet. Additionally, analysis of the effects of anisotropic electrical resistivity shows that, in case of GDLs with high anisotropic thermal conductivity, the maximum and minimum temperatures in a cathode catalyst layer correlate with the average current density and not the local current density.\nA three-dimensional model was also developed to analyze external heating techniques used for PEMFC startup.

Numerous cellular proteins are involved in the maintenance of this balance.  Cellular division requires complete synthesis of the genome, and mutagenesis is an active process during replication that is countered by proofreading and mismatch repair.  Mutations can range from large chromosomal rearrangements to point mutations, including base substitutions and small insertions or deletions, also called frameshifts.  In this thesis, I explore the mechanisms of frameshift mutagenesis and develop an assay to examine the role of mismatch repair in limiting these mutations.  I examine common, abundant repetitive DNA sequences as targets of mutagenesis and repair.  The mutation frequency of repetitive sequences is only increased relative to non-repetitive sequences after a threshold length of the repeat is achieved.  Beyond the threshold length, these short repetitive sequences are known as microsatellites, and the propensity of these repeats to mutate by insertion or deletion of one or more bases makes them important in the cellular balance of mutation and stability.  Mechanisms for frameshift mutagenesis within repetitive sequences include strand-slippage mediated, dNTP-stabilized, and misincorporation/misalignment, also called dislocation.  The human genome encodes 15 known DNA polymerases, with distinct mutation frequencies, which are dependent on the DNA template. DNA polymerase kappa (pol \u03ba) is a member of the Y-family of polymerases, best known for its role in translesion synthesis (TLS).  \t\n\tIn chapter 2, I examine the in vitro error profile for pol \u03ba when replicating di- and tetranucleotide microsatellites.  I observe that pol \u03ba displays relatively accurate synthesis for unit-based indels, for di- and tetranucleotides at lengths that are above the threshold for increased mutagenesis, five units and four units, respectively. When the total microsatellite length exceeds 28 nucleotides, an abrupt increase in unit-based indels is observed, suggesting that pol \u03ba makes extended DNA-protein interactions that increase accuracy in replication.  Single-base errors were identified in both the coding and microsatellite regions at similar frequency.  These single-base errors represent the mutational signature of pol \u03ba, and are consistent with a mechanism of mutagenesis distinct from homology-stabilized slippage.  \n\tIn chapter 3, I further explore mechanisms of frameshift mutagenesis using mononucleotide alleles.  All deletions and insertions of the motif base would be classified as unit-based indels by the definition used in chapter 2, although they may not all occur by the same mechanism.  To examine these mechanisms, I compare the ratio of expansions to deletions to deduce the most likely mechanism of mononucleotide microsatellite mutagenesis.  I find that both the frequency and mechanism of mutagenesis are highly dependent on the sequence identity of the microsatellite motif.  The relative mutability of the repeat motifs by pol \u03ba is: [C]10 >> [T]8 > [A]8 = [G]9.  Expansion to deletion ratios also vary, with [C] and [G] templates almost exclusively deletions, while [A] and [T] template mutants are a mixture of expansions and deletions.  I test the influence of dNTP abundance on mutability and mechanism in order to determine the role of the other substrate in the polymerase reaction.  The effect of altering the balance of different dNTPs also depended on motif identity, demonstrating that pol \u03ba both substrates affect pol \u03ba fidelity and mutational specificity. In addition, I altered reaction temperatures to determine the role of DNA duplex stability in mechanism of mutagenesis. Increasing (C template) or decreasing (T template) the reaction temperature resulted in lower mutation frequencies, but no change in specificity, suggesting that thermodynamic stability of the microsatellite duplex does not considerably affect the mechanism of frameshift errors.  Based on these studies, I conclude that pol \u03ba makes frameshift errors when replicating G and C mononucleotide templates by a dNTP-mediated mechanism, when copying A and T templates, pol \u03ba is more prone to strand-slippage misalignment errors.  \n\tFinally, in chapter 4, I examine the role of mismatch repair in microsatellite mutability, using an SV-40 ori-based transient mutagenesis assay I developed for use in epithelial cell lines.  Specifically, mismatch repair deficient lines were utilized for replication of long microsatellite dinucleotide alleles.  I compared results from two different mismatch repair deficient cell lines with results previously obtained for the same alleles in different mismatch deficient and proficient cell lines as well as results from in vitro reactions.  Unlike in in vitro reactions and in cells that are completely mismatch repair deficient, plasmids replicated in mismatch repair proficient cells show a distinct expansion bias in mutants, suggesting that mismatch repair is more efficient in repairing premutational deletions than expansions.  \n\tThe data presented in this thesis add to the knowledge of the DNA replication field by interrogation of mechanisms of frameshift mutation through analysis of mutational spectra of different microsatellites as well as mechanisms of mutational outcomes due to correction by cellular mismatch repair complexes.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8599], "author_name_tesi": "Baptiste, Beverly Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Baptiste", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Beverly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kristin Ann Eckert", "Keith C Cheng", "Neil David Christensen", "Laura Carrel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kristin Ann Eckert, Dissertation Advisor", "Keith C Cheng, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Laura Carrel, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["DNA polymerase kappa", "replication", "mismatch repair", "mutagenesis", "microsatellite"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Length Limitations of Prestressed Concrete Girder Integral Abutment Bridges\n", "id": "10216", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3565", "abstract_tesi": "The construction of integral or jointless bridges in North America has become increasingly popular because of the many advantages over conventional, jointed bridges. However, conservative limits have been set on the maximum length of integral abutment bridges (IABs) because no analysis or design guidelines for IABs exist. Additionally, the behavior and potential problems associated with IABs at increased lengths are largely unknown. This study developed 3D numerical models in ANSYS that simulate IAB behavior to study the critical bridge response, establish a practical IAB maximum length, and identify potential distress in IABs at extreme lengths. \n\tKey components to IAB behavior included in the numerical models are soil-pile interaction, abutment-pile interaction and construction joint detail. The loads on the numerical models were ambient temperature, AASHTO temperature gradient, time-dependant loads, and backfill pressure. A parametric study was performed with an initial bridge length of 1000\u0081\u0152 (305 m) considering the effects of: (1) abutment height; (2) soil stiffness; (3) construction joint flexibility; and (4) pile orientation on IAB response. \n \tResults of the parametric study showed weak axis oriented piles developed higher pile stress than strong axis oriented piles and abutment height had the greatest effect on IAB critical response. Taller abutments, moderate construction joint stiffness, low soil stiffness and strong axis pile orientation are best suited for IABs at extreme lengths because these conditions yield comparatively lower pile stress, moment and concrete stress at the abutment-pile connection. Based on analysis results, IABs at extreme lengths develop high stress in the piles, deck, the abutment at the construction joint and the backwall-girder connection, limiting the length of IABs. A practical maximum length of 1500\u0081\u0152 (457 m) was established based on IAB limiting factors. For IAB lengths beyond 1500\u0081\u0152 (457 m), cracking will most likely develop at the backwall-deck connection, the abutment at the construction joint and at the abutment-pile connection. High stress, approaching yield, is also likely to develop in steel H-piles in IABs at extreme lengths.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3545], "author_name_tesi": "Baptiste, Keisha  Terry", "last_name_ssi": "Baptiste", "middle_name_ssi": "Terry", "first_name_ssi": "Keisha ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey A Laman", "Jeffrey A Laman", "Andrew Scanlon", "Angelica Palomino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey A Laman, Thesis Advisor", "Jeffrey A Laman, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Scanlon, Thesis Advisor", "Angelica Palomino, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["bridges", "prestressed concrete", "integral abutment", "length limits"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Computational Study of Robustness in Level Set Surface Reconstruction", "id": "13717", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7023", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis examines the performance of the local level set method on the surface reconstruction problem for unorganized point clouds in three dimensions.  Many laser-ranging, stereo, and structured light devices produce three dimensional information in the form of unorganized point clouds.  The point clouds are sampled from surfaces embedded in three-space from the viewpoint of a camera focal plane or laser receiver.  The reconstruction of these objects in the form of a triangulated geometric surface is an important step in computer vision and image processing.  The local level set method uses a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation to describe the motion of an implicit surface in three dimensions.  An initial surface which encloses the data is allowed to move until it becomes a smooth fit of the unorganized data.  A 3D point cloud test suite was assembled from publicly available laser-scanned databases.  The test suite exhibits nonuniform sampling rates and various noise characteristics to challenge the surface reconstruction algorithm.

In this thesis, maize mutants with defects in inflorescence development are characterized to gain insight into the pathways regulating the initiation of the axillary meristems controlling inflorescence development.\n\tPrevious work revealed that the plant hormone auxin plays a central role in the initiation of lateral organs and meristems.  Mutants with defects in polar auxin transport, such as pinformed1 (pin1) and pinoid (pid) of Arabidopsis, fail to initiate axillary meristems during inflorescence development and as a consequence produce sterile, pin-like inflorescences.  Similarly, in maize, mutants in barren inflorescence2, the co-ortholog of PID, are also defective in axillary meristem initiation, resulting in a barren inflorescence with reduced branches, spikelets and florets.   \n\tIn Chapter 2, we describe the classical maize mutant Barren inflorescence1 (Bif1).  Similar to bif2, Bif1 mutants produced fewer branches, spikelets, florets and floral organs than normal, the result of a failure in axillary meristem initiation.  Double mutants between Bif1 and bif2 displayed a synergistic phenotype, indicating that Bif1 overlaps in function with bif2, possibly encoding a regulator of auxin transport in maize.   Positional cloning of Bif1 is presented in the Appendix.\n\tIn Chapters 3 and 4, the characterization of a novel maize mutant, sparse inflorescence1 (spi1) is described.  spi1 mutants have defects in the initiation of axillary meristems and lateral organs during vegetative and inflorescence development.  spi1 has been found to encode a flavin mono-oxygenase similar to the YUCCA (YUC) enzymes of Arabidopsis, which function in local auxin biosynthesis.  Analysis of the interaction between spi1 and genes regulating auxin transport indicates auxin biosynthesis and auxin transport function synergistically to regulate axillary meristem initiation.

Though viewed as an acute medical and social problem, entomologists, pest management professionals and others are largely unprepared to manage them. As a result, there is much to be investigated about the development and survival, and control of bed bugs. This dissertation evaluates bed bug survival and development using a life table approach, elucidates the efficacy of entomopathogenic fungi as a novel control for bed bug populations, and as an indicator of the general public\u2019s ability to play a role in bed bug management, describes the current state of bed bug related knowledge and attitudes among Penn State resident assistants as well as there ability to be educated on the topic. Bed bug survival and development was studied by comparing the laboratory reared Harlan strain and the ECL-05 field strain of bed bugs and the hybrid crosses of those strains. Developmental differences were found between strains based on instar, and were found between the parental and F1 generations. While survival of Harlan and ECL-05 strain parental generation bed bugs was not significantly different (~207 and ~208 days respectively), there were significant differences in the mean survival of the F1 generation. Harlan F1 survived ~226 days, ECL-05 F1 survived ~236, Harlan females x ECL-05 males F1 survived ~243 days, and ECL-05 females x Harlan males F1 survived ~213 days. Subsequent experiments evaluated the survival of bed bugs reared on two different feeding regimens. Results indicate that human blood reared HS developed in 34.90 \u00b1 5.428 days, which was significantly faster than rabbit blood fed HS (49.10 \u00b1 16.884 days). There were no significant differences in human blood or rabbit blood reared ECL-05 developmental time (32.10 \u00b1 3.638 days and 35.88 \u00b19.460 days respectively). Additionally, ECL-05 bed bugs reared on rabbit blood survived ~174 days, which was significantly longer than the ~153 days of the HS bed bugs. Next, we investigated the potential of Beauveria bassiana as a biopesticide against bed bugs. Results indicate that B. bassiana is effective regardless of bed bug sex, feeding status, and strain. However, bed bugs were more susceptible when placed on jersey cotton material compared to paper. Similarly, while all instars tested were susceptible to the fungus, first instars and adults died significantly faster than fifth instar bed bugs. Successful integrated pest management programming requires that all stakeholders understand pest problems and management options. Information derived from laboratory analyses was implemented into a bed bug education intervention to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of Penn State resident assistants. Data indicate that bed bug knowledge and attitudes of resident assistants can be positively affected by education interventions. These results add valued insight into the biology of the common bed bug, how biological control methods can be used for its control, and how research based education interventions can change human knowledge and behavior.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7482], "author_name_tesi": "Barbarin, Alexis Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Barbarin", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Alexis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edwin George Rajotte", "Thomas Charles Baker", "Kelli Hoover", "Nicole Sheree Webster", "Steven Bradley Jacobs", "Dt Stephen Kells"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edwin George Rajotte, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Charles Baker, Committee Member", "Kelli Hoover, Committee Member", "Nicole Sheree Webster, Committee Member", "Steven Bradley Jacobs, Special Member", "Dt Stephen Kells, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cimex lectularius", "life table", "survival", "fecundity", "entomopathogen", "public education"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EXAMINING ELECTRON TRANSFER AND CHARGE TRANSPORT IN ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAIC MATERIALS\n\n\n", "id": "8580", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3881", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tEnergy consumption is extremely high and costly in the world today.  The use of fossil fuels is climbing at a rapid rate; and with the demand so high, costs could skyrocket.  Also, the use of more fossil fuels is leading to worldwide issues such as global warming.  A change to more renewable energy resources is needed to eliminate emissions and potentially lower the cost of energy.  Several options are available for substituting or even replacing fossil fuels.  The most promising renewable resource is solar energy.  Solar radiation hits the Earth around the clock and will not become depleted in the seeable future.\n\tCurrent inorganic solar technology has been used for decades, but the cost of production is too high to replace current energy sources.  A new and cheaper technology is emerging that has the potential to become cheaper than fossil fuels in terms of the amount of energy produced.  This technology is known as organic photovoltaics (OPVs).  These materials use electron donating polymers in conjunction with electron accepting materials (such as fullerenes).  Current efficiencies of OPVs are drastically low in order to become implemented into energy collection methods.  Improvement on solar energy harnessing and conversion to electrical energy is currently being examined to make these materials efficient enough to succeed in making solar energy a feasible substitute for an energy source.\n\tCurrent issues of OPVs include charge carrier separation, degradation, charge carrier mobility and extraction.  This study will focus on examining charge separation and mobility in OPV materials.  Studies utilizing two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy were used to examine the local structure of PCBM molecules within the OPV bulk heterojunction (BHJ).  In conjunction with SEM and FTIR studies, it was found that the fullerene molecules tend to cluster together into roughly spherical domains surrounded by a layer of polymer.  The addition of the polymer perturbs the fullerene molecules which allows for the measure of electron transfer from the polymer to the PCBM domains using Vis-IR spectroscopy.  Vis-IR studies give a measure of the charge transfer process and allow for a kinetic study of charge transfer from optically mobile charge carriers.  In conjunction with these kinetic studies, CELIV experiments began to measure electrically mobile charge carriers.  All together, these experiments allow for the understanding of rates of the charge transfer process as a function of morphology of the OPV samples.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3855], "author_name_tesi": "Barbour, Larry W", "last_name_ssi": "Barbour", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Larry", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John B Asbury"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John B Asbury, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["OPV", "PCBM", "PPV", "Charge Transfer Dynamics", "Charge Seperation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Modelling of synthetic molecular motors and self-assembled monolayers\n", "id": "9004", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1063", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The main goals of this dissertation work are the modelling of the static\nand dynamic properties and mechanisms of energy dissipation of synthetic\nmolecular motors, as well as modelling of the kinetics of exchange reaction\nprocesses in self-assembled monolayers.\n \nChapter 1 presents a brief overview of the field of synthetic molecular motors and\nsome of the theoretical methods used to evaluate their static and dynamic properties:\ndensity functional theory and universal force field classical potential. \nArtificial molecular motors have been created by scientists in order to develop\nbetter understanding of the biological ones, to mimic and to augment their functions.\nWe discuss several different types of motors, classified according to the sources \nof fuel used as input energy, the environment in which they operate, and\nthe type of mechanical-like motion they produce. \n\nIn chapter 2, we study the static and dynamic properties of a synthetic \ncaltrop-based rotary molecular motor chemically attached to a surface and driven\n by external rotational electric fields.

The bacterial cell envelope lies at the interface between a bacterial cell and its environment. To relay information about changes sensed at this interface to the transcriptional machinery and elicit a response, bacteria have developed systems such as extracytoplasmic function sigma factors that allow the cell to rapidly redirect transcription to a particular subset of genes in order to appropriately respond to the stress condition.\n  I have identified an important extracytoplasmic function sigma factor, SigE, in Bordetella bronchiseptica, a respiratory pathogen that causes disease ranging from asymptomatic infection to fatal pneumonia in most mammals. SigE is a member of the RpoE-like group of sigma factors, which includes \u03c3E from Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, as well AlgU from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia pseudomallei. In this dissertation, I demonstrate that B. bronchiseptica sigE encodes an RpoE-like sigma factor, and that the downstream genes rseA and rseB encode negative regulators of its activity. SigE is required for response to heat shock, ethanol stress, and specific cell envelope stress, and both no sigE and high SigE activity are detrimental to virulence. Cells with high SigE activity, in particular, are defective in early colonization of the lower respiratory tract of mice, and cause less disease in immunocompromised mice. By using multiple methods, I have identified members of the SigE regulon, including some candidate SigE-regulated small regulatory RNAs, and show that the SigE system plays a role in regulation of cell envelope components, consistent with its role in responding to cell envelope stress. Through this work, I have demonstrated a role for SigE in regulation of both cell envelope stress response and virulence, independently of the well-characterized BvgAS two component system in the bordetellae. B. bronchiseptica is closely related to both B. pertussis and B. parapertussis, the etiological agents of whooping cough in humans, and the sigE locus is nearly 100% conserved in all three species, suggesting an important and conserved role for this system in Bordetella species.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5551], "author_name_tesi": "Barchinger, Sarah ", "last_name_ssi": "Barchinger", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Ellen Ades", "Eric Thomas Harvill", "Paul Lee Babitzke", "B Tracy Nixon", "Edward G Dudley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Ellen Ades, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Member", "Paul Lee Babitzke, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["extracytoplasmic function sigma factor", "Bordetella bronchiseptica", "stress response", "cell envelope", "respiratory pathogen", "anti-sigma factor"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATING RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY AMONG REHABILITATION DOCTORAL STUDENTS", "id": "5859", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "949", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-03-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rehabilitation educators have expressed concern regarding low levels of research interest and productivity among graduate students in scientist-practitioner training programs.

In the first chapter, I utilized multi-species occupancy models to determine if I could identify local scale forest features associated with increased occupancy of groups of co-occurring species of forest birds.  Over the 2015 and 2016 breeding seasons, I conducted 310 avian point counts within 77 sites across forested regions within the Allegheny Plateau and Ridge and Valley ecoregions in Pennsylvania.  I returned to each of these point count locations to collect vegetation data after the breeding season in 2015 and 2016.   For my analysis, I first used a general model that tested the same set of six covariates across six groups of co-occurring species: species associated with the canopy, midstory, understory and ground strata as well as conifers and dead wood.  This model included the abundance of canopy, midstory, understory, and ground cover, as well as proportion of conifers in the canopy and abundance of snags.  I then created group specific models for each of the six groups.  For the canopy group, I created a model that included three covariates: canopy cover, the abundance of large trees, and abundance of understory cover.  For the midstory group, I created a model that included three covariates: the abundance of midstory cover, abundance of small trees, and standard deviation of DBH.  For the understory group, I created a model that included two covariates: the abundance of tall ericaceous shrubs and the abundance of ground cover.  For the ground group, I created a model that included three covariates: the abundance of ground cover, abundance of hayscented fern, and litter depth.  For the conifer group, I created a model that included two covariates: the proportion of hemlock and proportion of other conifers in the canopy.  Finally, for the dead wood group, I created a model that included two covariates: the abundance of snags and abundance of woody debris.\nI found that different local scale forest features were associated with the increased or decreased occupancy of each group.  From the results of each occupancy model, I was able to determine a posterior mean effect of each covariate.  A positive posterior mean effect demonstrates an increase in predicted occupancy given a certain covariate while a negative posterior mean effect demonstrates a decrease in predicted occupancy.  Each posterior mean effect size included 95% credible intervals, which can be used to evaluate strength of association.  Intervals that do not overlap 0 or slightly overlap 0 indicate more significant results than credible intervals that largely overlap 0.  \nOn average, the predicted occupancy of understory associates was 0.29.  Of the covariates I measured, the abundance of tall ericaceous shrubs had the strongest correlation with the predicted occupancy of understory associates and had a positive mean posterior effect, or \u03b2, of 0.59 with the 95% credible interval slightly overlapping 0 (95% CrI=-0.04 to 1.2).  The predicted occupancy of five out of six understory associates, Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), Hooded Warbler (Setophaga citrina), Chestnut-sided Warbler (Vireolanius melitophrys), Black-throated Blue Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens), Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), and Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), increased with increasing abundance of tall ericaceous shrubs. However, the predicted occupancy of Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) decreased (\u03b2=-0.67, 95% CrI=-1.37 to 0.00).  Overall, the posterior mean effect of tall ericaceous shrubs was more positive than the posterior mean effect of the other covariate included in the understory associate model, abundance of ground cover (\u03b2=0.24, 95% CrI=-0.08 to 0.57). \nOur results indicate that understory associates utilize areas with increased abundance of tall ericaceous shrubs, such as mountain laurel.  These shrubs occur on acidic soils that are considered poor quality and can suppress tree regeneration.  Therefore, these shrubs are often considered detrimental to forest quality.  However tall ericaceous are currently a dominant understory feature within Pennsylvania.  The positive relationship we identified with this study indicate that despite management concerns, tall ericaceous shrubs may provide habitat for certain bird species.  Therefore, the shrubs may provide an important structural feature for understory associates even in areas with poor quality soils.\nThe predicted occupancy of midstory associates was 0.20 on average, slightly lower than that of understory associates.  Of the covariates I measured, the standard deviation of DBH had the strongest correlation with the predicted occupancy of midstory associates and had a positive mean posterior effect, or \u03b2, of 0.16 with the 95% credible interval slightly overlapping 0 (95% CrI = -0.09 to 0.43).  The posterior mean effect was positive for all five species included in this group and was highest for Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) (\u03b2=0.23, 95% CrI=-0.07 to 0.54).  The posterior mean effects for the other covariates included in the midstory associate model, midstory cover and small tree abundance, were both negative and had credible intervals that overlapped 0 (\u03b2=-0.15, 95% CrI =-0.46 to 0.14; \u03b2=-0.15, 95% CrI =-0.50 to 0.23).\nConsequently, our results demonstrate a positive correlation between the standard deviation of DBH and the predicted occupancy of midstory associates.  Management techniques such as uneven-aged management may prove useful in creating important structural features, such as a variety of tree sizes. Monitoring features like standard deviation of DBH following management may allow managers to determine how successful certain prescriptions are for creating quality habitat.  Additionally, identifying areas with high variation of tree sizes may allow managers to identify areas that have higher quality habitat for midstory associates.  \nCanopy associates were the most abundant group of species with a predicted occupancy of 0.42.  Of the covariates I measured, the abundance of understory cover had the strongest correlation with the predicted occupancy of canopy associates and had a negative mean posterior effect, or \u03b2, of -0.24 (95% CrI=-0.49 to -0.01).  The posterior mean effect of understory cover was negative for all six species included in this group and was most negative for Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludovicianus) (\u03b2=-0.33, 95% CrI =-0.67 to -0.02).  While the abundance of understory itself likely does not have a direct negative impact on canopy associates, more abundant of understory cover likely indicates larger canopy openings and reduced availability of canopy habitat.  The posterior mean effects of the other covariates included in the canopy associate model, canopy cover and abundance of large trees, were considered negligible because they did not demonstrate as strong of a negative effect as understory cover and had credible intervals that largely overlapped 0 (\u03b2=-0.01, 95% CrI =-0.31 to 0.31; \u03b2=-0.08, 95% CrI =-0.38 to 0.23).  \nGround associates were the second-most abundant group with a predicted occupancy of ground associates was 0.35.  However, the local scale forest features I included in my ground associate model had minimal effect on birds within this group.  The posterior mean effects of the covariates included in the ground associate model, abundance of ground vegetation cover (\u03b2=-0.08, 95% CrI =-0.54 to 0.36), litter depth (\u03b2=-0.05, 95% CrI =-0.30 to 0.20), and the abundance of hayscented fern (\u03b2=0.00, 95% CrI =-0.25 to 0.25), were all considered negligible with small effect sizes and credible intervals that largely overlapped 0.  Therefore, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the direct impact of local forest features on the occupancy of ground associates.\nConifer associates were our rarest group with a predicted occupancy of conifer associates was 0.16.  Of the covariates I measured, the proportion of hemlock in the canopy had the strongest correlation with the predicted occupancy of conifer associates and had a positive mean posterior effect, or \u03b2, of 0.34 (95% CrI=0.09 to 0.59).  The posterior mean effect of hemlock was positive for 10 out of the 11 species we included in this model and was highest for Blue-headed Vireo (Vireo solitaries) (\u03b2=0.62, 95% CrI =0.29 to 0.97).  The posterior mean effect of hemlock was slightly negative for Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga coronata), but considered negligible as the effect size was small and the credible intervals largely overlapped 0 (\u03b2=-0.02, 95% CrI =-0.66 to 0.54).   The other covariate included in the conifer associate model, proportion of other conifers in the canopy, had a positive posterior mean effect (\u03b2=0.13, 95% CrI =-0.10 to 0.36), however the credible intervals overlapped 0 and this posterior mean effect was not as strong as the effect of hemlock in the canopy.  The posterior mean effect of other conifers in the canopy was highest for Blue-headed Vireo (\u03b2=0.42, 95% CrI =0.10 to 0.77).\nThe positive correlation between the abundance of hemlock in the canopy and the predicted occupancy of conifer associates indicates another forest feature that managers should monitor.  The abundance of hemlock in the canopy may decrease as pests like hemlock woolly adelgid damage hemlock stands, while the abundance of woody debris may increase with hemlock die-off.  My results indicating a positive effect of hemlock on conifer associates provide further evidence that hemlock woolly adelgid will likely negatively affect conifer associates as forest composition changes.  In addition to protecting extant stand of hemlock, managers should examine other forest features that may provide similar habitat for conifer associates.  While the positive correlation we identified between the predicted occupancy of conifer associates and other conifers was not as strong as the relationship with hemlock, these findings indicate that certain species within this group may be able to utilize other coniferous species as hemlocks decline.  Hemlock is considered valuable to wildlife because it retains its lower branches, creating complex vertical structures from close to the base of each tree to the crown.  Therefore, it may also be worthwhile for future research to explore how conifer associates utilize other structural features within the forest that could be managed as hemlock continues to decline.\nOn average, the predicted occupancy of dead wood associates was 0.17.  Of the covariates I measured, the abundance of woody debris had the strongest correlation with the predicted occupancy of dead wood associates and had a positive mean posterior effect size, or \u03b2, of 0.18, although credible intervals slightly overlapped 0 (95% CrI=-0.02 to 0.39).  The mean posterior effect of woody debris was highest for Black-and-white Warbler (\u03b2=0.13, 95% CrI =0.02 to 0.54).  The mean posterior effect of the other covariate included in the dead wood associate model, the abundance of snags, was slightly positive (\u03b2=0.09, 95% CrI =-0.18 to 0.38), but had credible intervals that overlapped 0 and was not as high as the mean posterior effect of woody debris.\nThe abundance of woody debris was a stronger predictor of increased occupancy of dead wood associates than snags.  Our results suggest that the abundance of woody debris is a better indicator of the availability of dead wood features than the abundance of snags.  Within the forest there are many trees that are dying from disease, yet are not considered snags.  These trees may create the same nesting and foraging materials as snags.  Collectively, woody debris may be the best indicator of habitat features used by dead wood associates given these condition.  Dead wood associates may also benefit in the short term as dying hemlock creates more dead wood material.    However, these species may decline in the long term as diseased trees are replaced and no longer contributes to the amount of coarse woody debris within a forest.  Tracking these local scale features may allow managers to determine the current suitability of forest habit for forest bird communities and make more effective management decisions to conserve quality habitat as these processes continue to shape forested habitat.  \nThese results indicate that local scale forest features may be useful in predicting increased occupancy of groups of co-occurring species.  Of the covariates we included in our models, the abundance of tall ericaceous shrubs, hemlock in the canopy, and woody debris, as well as the standard deviation of DBH appeared to positively correlate with the predicted occupancy of understory, conifer, dead wood, and midstory associates respectively.  The increased abundance of these forest features may therefore be indicators of higher quality habitat for these groups of habitat associates.  These features may be monitored to determine the current quality of forested habitat for certain groups of interest, as well as the efficacy of management prescription.   Each of these features are already monitored through surveys such as the Continuous Forest Inventory.  Additionally, managers may benefit from utilizing forest bird monitoring programs and point count data to identify areas where these features may already be present by examining which forested areas are occupied by the groups of co-occuring species. \nMoving beyond a focus on different groups within the forest bird community, in the second chapter I used multi-species occupancy models to examine how local forest complexity affects overall species richness of forest specialists.  I used the same avian point count and vegetation data from the first chapter to examine if forest bird species richness increased as local compositional and structural complexity increase.  I created a model that included two measures of structural complexity as well as four measures of compositional complexity: the standard deviation of DBH, the volume of vegetation below the canopy, tree species richness, shrub species richness, the number of ground cover types, and the number of forest cover types within 500 m.  I also examined the nestedness of our points to examine whether species depauperate (i.e., not species rich) sites were subsets of species rich sites.  \nOur results indicate that structural complexity had a positive effect on overall species richness.  The standard deviation of DBH had the strongest positive correlation with bird species richness compared to other measurements of structural complexity and across 47 species had an average mean posterior effect size of 0.09 (95% CrI=0 to 0.18).  The standard deviation of DBH had a positive correlation with the occupancy of 44 of the species we examined.  The standard deviation of DBH had the strongest positive correlation with the occupancy of the midstory (\u03b2=0.16, 95% CrI = -0.10, 0.41), conifer (\u03b2=0.18, 95% CrI = -0.01, 0.38), and dead wood (\u03b2=0.15, 95% CrI = -0.07, 0.36) associated groups, although credible intervals overlapped 0. \nThese results indicate that uneven-aged management or other management strategies that can create more variation of tree DBH may be a useful tool for maintaining forest bird species diversity.  Managers monitoring the success of management prescriptions may also benefit from tracking the standard deviation of DBH as a metric.  Prescriptions that results in a higher standard deviation of DBH will likely be more effective for creating stands that support higher bird species richness.   \nWhile the volume of vegetation below the canopy did not have as strong of a positive relationship with bird species richness as standard deviation of DBH, this features also hada positive correlation with bird species richness and had an average mean posterior effect of 0.06, although credible intervals overlapped 0 (95% CrI= -0.06 to 0.19). This feature had a positive correlation with the occupancy of about half of the species we examined (n=23) and had the strongest positive correlation with the occupancy of understory associates (\u03b2=0.35, 95% CrI = 0.00, 0.65).  Certain measures of compositional complexity also had a positive correlation with bird species richness.\nThe number of cover types within a 500 m buffer around each point had the strongest positive effect on species richness compared to other measurement of compositional complexity.  The number of cover types within a 500 m buffer had an average mean posterior effect size of 0.10, although credible intervals slightly overlapped 0 (95% CrI=-0.01 to 0.21).  The number of cover types had the strongest positive correlation with the occupancy of the understory (\u03b2= 0.14, 95% CrI = -0.11), ground (\u03b2=0.16, 95% CrI = -0.19, 0.49), and conifer (\u03b2=0.20, 95% CrI = -0.05, 0.45) groups and had a positive correlation with the occupancy of 45 species.  This positive correlation between the number of forest cover types within a 500 m buffer and bird species richness indicates that spatial heterogeneity is also important for maintaining species diversity.  The results of our other measurements of compositional complexity provide more evidence supporting the importance of spatial heterogeneity as well.  \nMeasurements of local compositional complexity, including tree species and shrub species richness and number of ground cover types did not appear to have a strong positive effect on species richness.  Across 47 bird species, tree species richness had an average mean posterior effect of 0.04 with credible intervals largely overlapping 0 (95% CrI=-0.11 to 0.20), and shrub species richness had an average mean posterior effect of -0.04 with credible intervals also overlapping 0 (95% CrI=-0.19 to 0.10).   Tree species richness had the strongest positive correlation with the occupancy of midstory-associated species (\u03b2=0.39, 95% CrI = -0.13, 0.94) and the strongest negative correlation with the occupancy ground-associated species (\u03b2=-0.12, 95% CrI = -0.43, 0.17), although credible intervals overlap 0.  Shrub species richness had the strongest positive correlation with the occupancy of the midstory and understory groups (\u03b2=0.16, 95% CrI = -0.13, 0.46; \u03b2=0.23, 95% CrI = -0.06, 0.50) and the strongest negative correlation with the occupancy of the canopy, conifer, and dead wood groups (\u03b2=-0.26, 95% CrI = -0.67, 0.21; \u03b2=-0.18, 95% CrI = -0.46, 0.11; \u03b2=-0.17, 95% CrI = -0.55, 0.19), although credible intervals overlap 0. The number of ground cover types had an average mean posterior effect of -0.05 with credible intervals slightly overlapping 0 (95% CrI=-0.15 to 0.05), however this covariate appeared to have a negligible effect on the occupancy of all groups of co-occurring species.  For each of these compositional covariates, the credible intervals largely overlapped 0 and did not appear to affect overall species richness positively or negatively.  \nThese results indicate that changes in compositional complexity may lead to changes in forest bird community composition, but not overall richness.  The varying effect of measures of compositional complexity on the predicted occupancy of the six groups of interest, as well as our results from the first chapter linking species groups to local forest features, indicate that microhabitats within the forest are important to specific groups of co-occuring species.  Therefore, spatial heterogeneity would increase the availability of a variety of these microhabitat features across a landscape and allow managers to maintain biodiversity across forests.\nOur nestedness results also indicate that managing certain for features that increase species richness, such as the standard deviation of DBH and spatial heterogeneity, stands to benefit the forest bird community as a whole.  Of the points we surveyed, species rich and species depauperate points were nested based on the expected nesting from a random distribution (p<0.001). 48.23% of our points demonstrated an overlap pattern consistent with nestedness, whereas 25.08% of cells in a random matrix demonstrated overlap consistent with a nested pattern. Therefore, the overlap of species within our points deviated from what would be expected in a random, non-nested matrix (p<0.001).  These results indicate that managing for species richness of forest specialists meets the goal of keeping common species common, while also creating habitat for rare species of interest.  This demonstrates that managing for forest bird species richness may be a useful strategy for managing habitat for the forest bird community as a whole.  Therefore, using management tools that create higher variability of tree sizes and also encourage spatial heterogeneity across a forested landscape would be useful for balancing the needs of both rare and common forest bird species on interest.\nThe results of this project indicate that a number of forest features may be useful for monitoring the current quality of forested habitat, determining the efficacy of management techniques, and creating areas of higher diversity.  Each of the forest features that demonstrated a positive correlation with the predicted occupancy of groups of co-occurring species are already monitored through surveys such as the Continuous Forest Inventory and are highly accessible to forest managers.  The results of Chapter 1 demonstrating that measures of ericaceous shrubs, hemlock abundance, standard deviation of DBH, and woody debris abundance predict increased occupancy for understory, conifer, midstory, and dead wood associates respectively indicate the importance of microhabitat features for certain groups of co-occurring species. Chapter 2 demonstrated that the standard deviation of DBH and the number of cover types within 500 m positively correlated with predicted bird species richness.  This demonstrates that local structural complexity as well as spatial heterogeneity may be useful to indicate area of forest that can support higher biodiversity.  Across a forested landscape, managers may be able to maintain robust and diverse forest bird communities by maintaining a variety of microhabitats and forest cover types across a landscape as well as managing for higher variation of tree sizes within forest stands. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13760], "author_name_tesi": "Barenblitt, Abigail Cohen", "last_name_ssi": "Barenblitt", "middle_name_ssi": "Cohen", "first_name_ssi": "Abigail", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham-Brant", "David Andrew Miller", "Matthew Marshall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham-Brant, Thesis Advisor", "David Andrew Miller, Committee Member", "Matthew Marshall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Forest bird communities", "Forest bird species richness", "Occupancy Models", "Local Forest Features", "Forest Complexity"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Maternal Borderline Personality Characteristics and Family Functioning", "id": "5962", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4711", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-08-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThis study was designed to assess the relations among maternal borderline personality traits, perceived parenting self-efficacy, parenting quality, and the development of 2- and 3-year-old children. 75 mother and child dyads were observed in the laboratory and provided assessments of maternal personality traits, parenting self-efficacy, and child behavior problems.

Pastures grazed in the studies were based on smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.).\n\tIn the first study, twenty multiparous Holstein cows (4 ruminally cannulated) in five 4 x 4 Latin squares with 21-d periods were used to study the effect of concentrate supplementation when grazed at two pasture allowances. The four dietary treatments resulted from the combination of two pasture allowance targets (low, 25 vs. high, 40 kg DM/cow per d) and two concentrate supplementation levels (zero vs. 1 kg concentrate/4 kg milk). Concentrate supplementation decreased pasture dry matter intake 2.0 kg/d at the low pasture allowance (17.5 vs. 15.5 kg/d) and 4.4 kg/d at the high pasture allowance (20.5 vs. 16.1 kg/d). Substitution rate was lower at the low pasture allowance (0.26 kg pasture/kg concentrate) than at the high pasture allowance (0.55 kg pasture/kg concentrate). Total DMI of both supplemented treatments averaged 24.4 kg/d. Milk production of both supplemented treatments averaged 29.8 kg/d, but was increased with higher pasture allowance in the unsupplemented treatments (19.1 vs. 22.2 kg/d). Milk response to concentrate supplementation was 1.36 and 0.96 kg milk/kg concentrate for the low and high pasture allowance, respectively. Concentrate supplementation reduced milk fat percentage but increased milk protein percentage. Rumen pH and NH3-N concentration were decreased by concentrate supplementation. Substitution rate was likely related to both negative associative effects in the rumen (reductions in rumen pH, rate of pasture digestion and NDF digestibility) and reductions in grazing time. This latter was quantitatively more important, explaining between 80 to 100% of the reduction in pasture DMI observed.\n\tIn the second study, the effect of pasture allowance on the grazing behavior of unsupplemented or supplemented high producing Holstein cows was studied in two single reversal experiments. Ten multiparous cows (2 ruminally cannulated) were unsupplemented, and six multiparous cows (2 ruminally cannulated) were supplemented with a corn-based concentrate. Within each supplementation group cows grazed a bromegrass/orchardgrass-based pasture offered at two pasture allowances: 1) 25 kg DM/cow/d, and 2) 40 kg DM/cow/d. Recorders were used to measure grazing time and bites per d. Bite mass was calculated dividing the pasture DMI, measured by chromic oxide, by the total number of bites per d. With unsupplemented cows, pasture DMI (18.8 vs. 15.6 kg/d) and milk production (17.6 vs. 15.2 kg/d) were higher at high pasture allowance. The higher pasture DMI was a result of a longer grazing time and a greater number of bites after the p.m. milking. Rumen pH was lower (6.33 vs. 6.60) and total VFA concentration was higher (134.5 vs. 119.5 mmol/L) at high pasture allowance. With supplemented cows, pasture and total DMI (14.7 and 22.8 kg/d) and milk production (27.8 kg/d) were not affected by pasture allowance. Grazing behavior of supplemented cows was not affected by pasture allowance. Neither rumen pH (6.05) nor total VFA concentration (148.4 mmol/L) differed between low and high pasture allowance. Pasture allowance had important effects on grazing behavior, pasture DMI and milk production of unsupplemented cows, however neither grazing behavior nor performance of supplemented cows were affected by pasture allowance.\n\tIn the third study, forty-five Holsteins cows (15 primiparous, 30 multiparous) were used to compare three feeding systems combining pasture and total mixed ration (TMR) on animal performance in a 21-wk repeated measures experiment. The three treatments were: 1) pasture plus concentrate (PC), 2) pasture plus partial TMR (pTMR), and 3) TMR (non pasture). Total dry matter intake (DMI), using chromic oxide as a marker, was 21.6, 25.3, and 26.8 kg/d for PC, pTMR, and TMR, respectively. Milk production was highest for TMR (38.1 kg/d), lowest for PC (28.5 kg/d), and intermediate for pTMR (32.0 kg/d). All three treatments received ten bST injections, PC responded to six, pTMR to four, and TMR to nine administration of bST during the 21 wk trial; milk response averaged 13.8, 15.6, and 11.8% for PC, pTMR, and TMR, respectively. Cows fed pTMR and TMR had higher milk fat (3.33 vs. 3.13%) and true protein (2.97 vs. 2.82%) percentage than cows fed PC. Cows on PC gained less body weight and lost more body condition compared to cows on pTMR and TMR. Initial concentrations of plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) were higher in PC (302 meq/L) than in pTMR (130 meq/L) and TMR (225 meq/L). Plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) was lower in both pTMR and TMR treatments (13.8 mg/dl) than in PC treatment (17.2 mg/dl). Performance was improved combining pasture and TMR compared to pasture plus concentrate, resulting in higher milk production, milk production persistency, milk fat and protein percentage, and no loss in body condition score.\n\tIn the fourth study, six multiparous Holstein cows fitted with rumen cannulas were used to study the effect of these three feeding systems combining pasture and total mixed ration (TMR) on ruminal digestion in a 21-wk repeated measures experiment. Rumen ammonia nitrogen concentration was lower in both the pTMR and TMR treatments (10.2 mg/dl) than in the PC treatment (19.9 mg/dl). Rumen pH was not affected by treatments and averaged 5.87. Neither total volatile fatty acids concentration (137.5 mmol/L) nor main individual volatile fatty acids proportions (64.4, 20.6, and 12.0 mol/100 mol for acetate, propionate, and butyrate, respectively) differed among treatments. The combination of pasture with TMR reduced the total potentially degradable fraction of DM (85.5 vs. 82.3%) of pasture, and increased the lag time (5.4 vs. 6.5 h) and reduced the potentially digestible fraction (82.1 vs. 74.9%) of pasture NDF. Ruminal losses of ammonia nitrogen were reduced combining pasture and TMR, however no positive effects on rumen pH were observed. The combination of pasture and TMR also decreased the rumen digestion of pasture, indicating the presence of negative associative rumen effects.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1969], "author_name_tesi": "Bargo, Fernando ", "last_name_ssi": "Bargo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fernando", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marvin H Hall", "Lawrence Dean Muller", "Gabriella Anne Varga", "Peter Tozer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marvin H Hall, Committee Member", "Lawrence Dean Muller, Committee Chair", "Gabriella Anne Varga, Committee Member", "Peter Tozer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["high producing dairy cows", "total mixed rations", "concentrate", "pasture"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Stravinsky's Games of Chance: The Use of Card Games to Navigate Between Two Worlds in \"histoire du soldat,\" \"the Rake's Progress,\" and \"jeu de Cartes\"", "id": "17685", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8663", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\tThis thesis examines how Igor Stravinsky and his collaborators used card games to represent two different and distinct worlds in three of their pieces: Histoire du soldat, The Rake\u2019s Progress, and Jeu de Cartes.

Study 1 used a sample of high school students from the National Study of Adolescent Health (N = 7,786) to identify patterns of positive development and examine the role family capital played in these patterns. A four-profile solution revealed Average, High Self-Esteem, Below Average, and High Achiever Profiles. Multinomial logistic regressions revealed that parent human and economic capital predicted increased odds of being in the High Achiever Profile, and social capital predicted increased odds of being in the High Self-Esteem Profile. Moderator analyses produced evidence of cumulative promotive effects by revealing that family social capital exacerbated the benefits of other types of family capital for positive development. Studies 2 and 3 focused on parental knowledge, which refers to the degree to which parents are informed about their youths\u2019 daily experiences. Study 2 explored how youth gender, age, and family members\u2019 relationship quality predicted five sources of mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 knowledge in a relatively understudied population: two-parent African American families with two youth (N = 187). Multilevel models revealed that older siblings disclosed less to parents than younger siblings. A quadratic youth age pattern indicated that fathers asked youth fewer questions in early adolescence compared to childhood and later adolescence, which coincided with higher levels of relying on spouse and siblings. Warmer parent-child relationships predicted higher levels of relying on multiple sources of knowledge for mothers and fathers, including child disclosure and solicitation. Drawing from family systems perspective, warmer marital relationships predicted relying on spouse, and warmer parent-sibling relationships predicted relying on siblings for information. Study 3 took an in depth look at conceptualization and measurement of parental knowledge. Whereas some researchers have measured parents\u2019 or youths\u2019 perceptions of knowledge, others have examined daily knowledge. We therefore examined multilevel models that included three distinct parental knowledge indicators in a sample of European American families with two adolescent youth (N = 175). Mothers\u2019, fathers\u2019, and youths\u2019 perceived knowledge were each negatively related to youths\u2019 risky behavior, and youth reported fewer depressive symptoms when mothers and fathers were seen by youth as more knowledgeable. Independent of perceived knowledge, however, when fathers\u2019 daily knowledge was higher, youth reported fewer depressive symptoms. Moreover, when youth perceived fathers to be more knowledgeable, fathers\u2019 daily knowledge was not linked to youths\u2019 risky behavior, but when youth saw their fathers as less knowledgeable, fathers\u2019 daily knowledge was related to less engagement in risky behavior.

These two faces are laid out in two opposed readings of Nietzsche carried out by two of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century: Heidegger and Deleuze. For Heidegger, Nietzsche is tied to the Platonic and post-Kantian themes of the opposition between the sensible and the supersensible. The themes of art, knowledge, the body and time all bear the mark of this oppositional duality: the fixed and the fluid, the present and the passage of the present, being and becoming, the self and its overcoming. By solidifying the opposition between the sensible and the supersensible so rigorously, Nietzsche is the culmination of the history of Western metaphysics, the key moments of which culmination are Kant, Schelling, Hegel and Marx. For Deleuze, on the other hand, Nietzsche is a thinker for who overcomes the paradigm of negation and opposition in Western philosophy. On this reading, Nietzsche\u2019s key thought is that of the influence of life upon thought: the sensible is not fundamentally opposed to the supersensible; rather, the supersensible is a way that the sensible differs from itself. Thought is neither opposed to the sensible nor identical with the sensible: it is a way in which the sensible differs from itself. However, human consciousness has a tendency to reproduce the theme of oppositional duality that has dominated Western philosophy; thus, the task of philosophy is to constantly uncover the ways in which this oppositional paradigm always covers up a creative differentiation which is irreducible to a sensible \u2018origin\u2019 and which therefore opens up radically new possibilities for thought and life. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15803], "author_name_tesi": "Barker, Joseph Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Barker", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Lawlor", "Leonard Lawlor", "Robert Bernasconi", "Amy Allen", "Claire Colebrook"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Lawlor, Dissertation Advisor", "Leonard Lawlor, Committee Chair", "Robert Bernasconi, Committee Member", "Amy Allen, Committee Member", "Claire Colebrook, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nietzsche Deleuze Heidegger materiality concepts thought"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "RENEWABLE, ALTERNATIVE BEDDING RESOURCES FOR BROILER PRODUCTION: AN EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE, WELFARE, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS", "id": "14384amm6255", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14384", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Increases in price and variability of the softwood shavings market have prompted exploration of alternative, renewable bedding resources on which to rear broiler-type chickens in the northeastern United States. Although there are many available alternatives used to bed birds across the United States, these are limited by region. An option for sustainable, locally produced bedding comes from the use of biomass grasses. However, processing techniques of the biomass are numerous and have the potential to result in variability of physical properties between processed materials, which may influence their success as bedding.\nIt is paramount that the materials offered as alternatives perform well compared to the current industry standard of kiln-dried softwood shavings. Because the profit margin per bird is small and bedding is an important contributing factor to the environment of a chicken house, there is no room for reduced performance due to the bedding. This bedding environment is defined by moisture index, litter scores, temperature, ambient ammonia, and ammonia flux. Furthermore, the welfare of the birds must be maintained to allow for proper growth. Maintaining welfare standards allows growers to continue to be good stewards to their birds. Footpad and breast cleanliness scores can be reflective of the house environment and can directly impact the welfare of birds reared in said house. Another consideration with bedding material is the litter\u2019s end use. It can be used as either fertilizer or fuel with thorough consideration of the nutrient profile and energy density before application of these materials. \nThe availability and success of an alternative bedding material will only happen in a market willing to accept it. It is therefore pertinent that the current bedding use for broilers in Pennsylvania be evaluated to determine the materials typically used, constraints set in place by integrators and growers, preferred properties, and willingness of the industry to try alternatives. \n\nResearch Objectives\n\n1.)\tEvaluate the current bedding environment in Pennsylvania and see if alternative renewable bedding materials are a valid option for growers.\n2.)\tDetermine if miscanthus grass performs similarly to a softwood shaving/ sawdust bedding mixture in terms of litter parameters and bird performance and welfare.\n3.)\tDefine the role switchgrass particle size plays on litter performance, bird performance, and bird welfare and compare the differences between these materials and a baled softwood shaving.\n4.)\tDetermine what the ideal particle size for switchgrass is in a commercial broiler house by evaluating litter performance, bird performance, and bird welfare using two differing bedding treatments suggested by the results from objective 3.\n5.)\tQuantify the nutrient and energy parameters of alternative bedding materials to approximate their value as a fertilizer or fuel source.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15330], "author_name_tesi": "Barkley, Amy Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Barkley", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul H.

The estimated emission rate associated with the production and transportation of natural gas is uncertain, hindering our understanding of the fuel source\u2019s greenhouse footprint. This study presents a new application of inverse methodology for estimating regional emission rates from natural gas production and gathering facilities in northeastern Pennsylvania. An inventory of methane emissions was compiled for major sources in Pennsylvania. This inventory served as input data to the Weather Research and Forecasting model with chemistry enabled and atmospheric methane mole fraction fields were generated at 3km resolution. Projected atmospheric methane enhancements from WRF-Chem were compared to observations obtained from a three-week flight campaign in May 2015. Model projected enhancements from sources not associated with upstream natural gas processes were removed from the observations, creating a set of observed enhancements from natural gas. Emission rates within the model from unconventional production were then adjusted in the model to minimize errors between aircraft observations and the model-simulated concentrations for each flight, and an optimal emission rate is estimated. As an additional method for calculating emission rates, a simplified aircraft mass balance calculation was performed for four flights. The weighted mean emission rate from natural gas production and gathering facilities in northeastern Pennsylvania using the model optimization approach is found to be 0.36% of total gas production, with a 2\u03c3 confidence interval between 0.27-0.45% of production. Similarly, the mean emission estimates using the aircraft mass balance approach is calculated to be 0.35% of regional natural gas production, with a 2\u03c3 interval between 0.21-0.49% of production.

The experience of the Latina mothers as they assumed a teaching/leadership role in this program was a primary focus of this study; however, the specific purpose of this study was twofold:  to examine the identity development of Latina mothers as they led a parent education program and to examine the intercultural relationships that formed as a result of this parent involvement experience from the perspective of both the teachers and the learners.  The theoretical framework for the study was grounded in sociocultural theory and was supplemented by Latina feminist perspectives as well as critical multicultural education perspectives.  Data collection consisted of pre and post-program interviews with the teachers as well as a focus group interview with the learners at the end of the program.  Weekly reflection forms completed by all participants provided additional written data throughout the program in addition to my observation notes and audio recordings from each session which were transcribed and analyzed.  \nThe findings of the study were grouped into six thematic sections.  The first, fostering meaning-making through sociocultural connections, revealed the importance of eliciting funds of knowledge, fostering contextually-based learning, and the development of empathy which was evoked throughout the language learning experience.  The second, establishing meaningful intercultural relationships, highlighted the mothers\u2019 ability to transcend cultural and linguistic barriers as they participated in the program as well as the program\u2019s impact on the greater school community.  The third finding, embracing the role of teacher/leader, highlighted the teachers\u2019 journey in successfully navigating their teaching role, their meaningful connections with one another, and their insightful reflections on the leadership experience.  A fourth finding of the study was the program\u2019s ability to enhance communication within the school community through both increasing individual communication capacity and fostering an environment through which the mothers used communication as a form of connection with one another.  The fifth section of the findings revealed the mothers\u2019 desire to maintain authentic and practical sessions which addressed the learners\u2019 strengths and needs as well as the mothers\u2019 heightened positivity toward participating in future programs as a result of the program.

This study evaluated the utility of the number of basal root whorls as a\nstrategy for drought tolerance in common bean. Basal root whorls form around the base of the\nhypocotyl in a ring of 4 basal roots. Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) segregating for basal root\nwhorl number (BRWN) with 1, 2 or 3 whorls were used for a terminal drought study in Rock\nSprings, Pennsylvania. By the mid-flower stage the drought treatment had reduced shoot biomass\nby 46%, leaf relative water content by 23%, and increased plant water potential by 225%. Under\nwell watered conditions there was no difference in shoot growth among the three BRWN\nphenotypes, yet under drought RILs with 3 whorls had 67% greater shoot biomass than the RILs\nwith 1 whorl. Root crown phenotyping in the field at the time of shoot harvest confirmed that the\nnumber of basal roots in the field was consistent with the BRWN phenotype, and revealed\nvariation in the number of basal roots with significant secondary growth, or \u2018basal root\ndominance\u2019. The extent of basal root thickening was determined to be part of the biomass\nallocation to roots. Basal root thickening and shoot growth under well watered conditions\nshowed that the number of basal root whorls was not related to plant size.

This compensation with\ngreater secondary growth among RILs with a lower number of basal root whorls is one strategy\nplants use to maintain the same root to shoot ratio. Grown under water stress, plants with few\nbasal roots had less basal root CSA than those with many basal roots, indicating less secondary\ngrowth capability under drought.

The SIRE technique permits the measurement of narrowband radiated sound power and directivity in an environment with unknown field conditions. This type of measurement has previously been limited to environments with exact field conditions, such as the free field. Due to long acoustic wavelengths, underwater anechoic tanks are not cost-effective for low frequency measurements, nor are at-sea measurements time- or cost-effective. Unlike SIRE, techniques like nearfield acoustic holography (NAH) rely on knowledge of exact field conditions, which are usually unknown in a realistic measurement environment.\n\nSIRE is a cost effective, repeatable laboratory technique for narrowband evaluation of complex structural acoustic sources submerged in water. The technique leverages underwater acoustic intensity vector sensors in the near field of a source and allows the outgoing acoustic waves to be separated from unwanted incoming acoustic waves. Supersonic wavenumber filtering rejects the evanescent potions of the acoustic pressure and particle velocity from the separated, outward-propagating sound pressure and particle velocity.\n\nThe SIRE technique was applied to a monopole source, dipole source, and point-driven, thin-walled cylinder with massive end caps. All sources were placed in an underwater reverberant tank and measured using custom underwater vector sensors specifically designed and built to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI). The results are compared with theory, the ANSI S12.51 standard one-third-octave reverberation room method, and free field NAH. SIRE is shown to accurately measure radiated sound power to within the limits of ANSI S12.51. SIRE is also shown to accurately measure the directivity indices of simple sources to within \u00b13 dB. Finally, a coupled finite element/boundary element (FE-BE) model of a point-driven, thin-walled cylinder in a reverberant water tank is developed. The results of the FE-BE model show that the measurement standoff distance for the SIRE technique should be less than the reciprocal of the largest wavenumber in the frequency band of interest.

Other women should also be able to perceive this as increased attractiveness toward the potential mates in question. In the present study, I manipulated women\u2018s voices using the vocal parameters fundamental frequency and formant dispersion to test the effects of vocal femininity on perceived threat potential by same-sex competitors. Specifically, female listeners evaluated attractiveness to heterosexual males and flirtatiousness. I additionally examined the effects of vocal femininity on men\u2018s interest for short- or long-term mating contexts. I found that vocal femininity increased women\u2018s attractiveness to men, and increased the apparent threat potential to other women, both in terms of perceived attractiveness to men and perceived sexual interest (flirtatiousness). Men preferred feminine voices most for a short-term/sexual mating context.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2763], "author_name_tesi": "Barndt, Julia Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Barndt", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Julia", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Andrew Puts", "David Andrew Puts"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Andrew Puts, Thesis Advisor", "David Andrew Puts, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Female vocal attractiveness", "intrasexual competition"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A SOCIOLINGUISTIC STUDY OF SUSTAINED VENETO-SPANISH BILINGUALISM IN CHIPILO, MEXICO", "id": "9921", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2168", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation project examines the language contact situation of Chipilo, a Veneto-Spanish bilingual community of immigrant origin in central Mexico, focusing both on the social motivations for the sustained bilingualism observed and the linguistic outcomes in the Spanish of the community. Chipilo is a unique community in that Veneto, a Northern Italian dialect, has been maintained for over 127 years and is the first language of many, if not all, of the bilinguals in Chipilo. And unlike many other instances of language contact in Mexico, both community languages are ascribed high prestige, therefore slowing the process of language shift from the immigrant language to the national language. \nChipilo was founded in 1882 by a homogenous group of approximately 560 immigrants from Veneto-speaking towns in northern Italy as a result of colonization efforts on the part of the Mexican government. During the initial years the town remained relatively isolated and the linguistic homogeneity of the group allowed for the continued use of Veneto as the preferred language of intra-ethnic communication. Today, changing social conditions brought about by the proximity of Puebla, the fourth largest city in Mexico, and an increase in contact with Spanish and mainstream national Mexican culture may affect the bilingualism observed in Chipilo. Previous research has offered socio-historical and sociolinguistic overviews of the community but none has provided a complete profile of the community investigating both the social and the linguistic aspects of language contact. This dissertation expands on previous work on the community by investigating the social context qualitatively through the use of sociolinguistic interviews and quantitatively with the results of a sociolinguistic questionnaire. The linguistic outcomes of sustained bilingualism in Chipilo are examined through the speech samples provided by the sociolinguistic interviews and also through a quantitative analysis of the expression of null and overt subject pronouns.\nWith respect to the social context of Chipilo, this dissertation explores the differences in language use patterns and language attitudes across different gender, age, and L1 groups. Results reveal significant differences between men and women and across age and L1 groups with respect to language use patterns and attitudes towards both Spanish and Veneto. Women view Veneto as more important both at an individual and societal level and identify more with Veneto than do men. L1 is a strong indicator of language use patterns and attitudes in that L1 Veneto bilinguals use more Veneto and demonstrate more favorable attitudes towards Veneto than L1 Spanish bilinguals. Across age groups, younger generations view Spanish as less important to the community and identify less with Mexican culture than older generations. This is attributed to the positive prestige associated with Veneto and the strong link between Veneto and ethnic identity that persists today in the distinction between chipile\u00f1os and mexicanos.\nThe intense Veneto-Spanish bilingualism observed in the community has linguistic consequences for the contact languages. Sociolinguistic interviews provided speech samples that were transcribed and analyzed for interlingual influence. Instances of language switching, lexical borrowings, and substratum effects, such as double negation, are identified and discussed. Interlingual influence was also examined by reference to the expression of overt subjects. In the case of Chipilo, Veneto and Spanish are both null subject languages, although the languages differ markedly in that Veneto employs obligatory subject clitics that occur in the 2SG, 3SG, and 3PL verb forms, which could be reanalyzed as subject pronouns in bilingual Chipilo Spanish. Statistical analysis revealed no increase in the overall rate of subject pronoun expression in bilingual Chipilo Spanish. Moreover, patterns of subject expression in this contact variety are similar to/identical to the variables implicated in monolingual varieties: the language-internal factors of person (and number), verb form ambiguity, and co-referentiality were all returned as significant in the expression of subject pronouns in bilingual Chipilo Spanish. Furthermore, the language-external factors of age and gender were also returned as significant. Women and older speakers (Group 3, age 51-64) favor overt forms, whereas men and other age groups favor null forms. This is attributed to the fact that women and older speakers may use more Veneto than Spanish and may be more likely to reanalyze Veneto subject clitics as subject pronouns in Spanish. Properties of the grammar commonly found to be subject to contact effects in other bilingual populations (heritage speakers, L2 learners, attrited speakers) were also examined. Variability in production was attested in bilingual Chipilo Spanish with respect to the preterite/imperfect distinction and variability in the use of imperfect subjunctive, variability in the lexical mapping of psychological predicates and use of the indirect object marker a, and variability in the use of clitic-doubling in inalienable possession constructions. \nThis dissertation contributes to a variety of linguistic fields, including social psychology of language, sociolinguistics, language contact, and theoretical linguistics. The language contact situation in Chipilo provides further insight into the processes of language maintenance and shift and the role that factors such as prestige, language attitudes, and identity play in the maintenance of a minority language. Furthermore, research in Chipilo offers a unique perspective to work in language contact and to the linguistic consequences of bilingualism in a situation of sustained contact. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2148], "author_name_tesi": "Barnes, Hilary ", "last_name_ssi": "Barnes", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hilary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Almeida Jacqueline Toribio", "Almeida Jacqueline Toribio", "Barbara Bullock", "John Lipski", "Philip Baldi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Almeida Jacqueline Toribio, Dissertation Advisor", "Almeida Jacqueline Toribio, Committee Chair", "Barbara Bullock, Committee Member", "John Lipski, Committee Member", "Philip Baldi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spanish", "Veneto", "language maintenance", "bilingualism"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Roles and Regulation of Specialized DNA Polymerases in Mitigating Replication Stress and Replicating Common Fragile Sites", "id": "14528rpb180", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14528", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Replicative DNA polymerases serve as the essential enzymes that duplicate our genome with high fidelity and efficiency. This function is compromised however, when repetitive DNA sequences adopt a structure differing from the Watson-Crick B-form or during conditions of replicative stress. However, cells also possess specialized DNA polymerases that can compensate for the replicative polymerases when they are inhibited. The goals of this thesis were to investigate how the specialized DNA polymerases (Pols) eta (\u03b7) and kappa (\u03ba) 1) cooperate with the replicative polymerase delta (\u03b4) in the synthesis of repetitive DNA derived from chromosomal fragile sites, and 2) understand how these enzymes function during cellular replication stress. \n\tCommon fragile sites (CFSs) are genomic loci that display recurrent instability in cells experiencing replication stress. Replication stress, defined as the slowing or stalling of replication forks, occurs when cells are treated with agents that inhibit DNA synthesis or are deficient in DNA repair/replication enzymes. CFSs are sensitive to replication stress, and one rationale for this is their enrichment in repetitive DNA sequences that can adopt a non-B DNA structure. Previous work in the Eckert lab has shown that all three replicative, human DNA polymerases are inhibited by repetitive CFS sequences in vitro whereas polymerases \u03b7 and \u03ba can replicate the same sequences with high efficiency. \n\tIn chapter 3, I test the hypothesis that Pols \u03b7 and \u03ba can cooperate with Pol \u03b4 in CFS sequence replication in vitro. To investigate this, I developed a model of lagging strand synthesis using primed ssDNA templates containing RFC-loaded PCNA, the processivity factor of Pol \u03b4. This system was designed to allow RFC and Pols \u03b4, \u03b7, and \u03ba to function optimally in the same reaction conditions. Using this system, I found that Pols \u03b7 and \u03ba can indeed rescue the Pol \u03b4 holoenzyme (Pol \u03b4/ RFC-loaded PCNA; Pol \u03b4HE) stalled at CFS sequences containing different repetitive DNA motifs. I found this polymerase cooperativity was not mediated by PCNA however, as reactions where RFC was omitted displayed no defect in replication rescue. Moreover, using this system I did not observe any enhancement of cooperativity between Pol \u03b4 and Pols \u03b7 and \u03ba using mono-ubiquitinated PCNA (Ub-PCNA), a post-translational modification thought to regulate polymerase exchange at DNA lesions. Finally, by modeling replication stress in vitro using Aph, a drug that directly inhibits replicative polymerases, I found that Pols \u03b7 and \u03ba become indispensable for repetitive CFS sequence replication. In total, the data in this chapter advances our understanding of human DNA polymerase exchange, and how repetitive DNA replication is accomplished by multiple polymerases.  \n\tWhile the relationship between CFS stability and Pol \u03b7 has been characterized by work in the Eckert lab and others, we did not know how Pol \u03b7 might impact the cell cycle and checkpoint signaling in replication stressed cells. To study this, I employed several models of cellular Pol \u03b7 deficiency and uncovered a role for Pol \u03b7 in G2/M phase progression during replication stress. Pol \u03b7-deficient cells also display increased replication checkpoint signaling during replication stress. Interestingly, this checkpoint signaling can be suppressed in cells expressing a wild-type POLH gene, as well as a POLH gene mutated at the PCNA interaction motif, but not in cells expressing a POLH gene mutated at the ubiquitin binding domain. Moreover, analysis of Pol \u03b7-deficient cells recovering from replication stress revealed a persistence of replication defects and apoptosis up to 24 hours after treatment, concomitant with reduced colony formation. This chapter reveals a global role for Pol \u03b7 in proper cell cycle progression during and following replication stress. \n\tAfter uncovering these cellular phenotypes, I began a study of Y-family polymerase expression during replication stress. In Chapter 5, I present my results showing that POLH transcript and Pol \u03b7 protein levels significantly increase in numerous normal and transformed cell lines using two models of replication stress. Interestingly, this induction of Pol \u03b7 was independent of p53 status, which has been shown to regulate Pol \u03b7 levels. In addition, I also observed stabilization of exogenous Pol \u03b7 protein and increased ubiquitination of Pol \u03b7 during replication stress. Among the related Y family polymerases, Pol \u03b9 displayed no significant induction following replication stress, and while POLK mRNA did not increase, Pol \u03ba protein did increase with Aph treatment. Finally, I discovered that Pol \u03b7 relocalizes to chromatin and forms nuclear foci during replication stress, independent of Rad18, the primary E3 ligase of PCNA.  To understand what protein/pathway may be regulating Pol \u03b7 during replication stress, I focused on the checkpoint kinase ATR. In this chapter I detail my results showing cell-type specific regulation of Pol \u03b7 by ATR during replication stress, at the level of protein expression and ubiquitination. Moreover, I show that ATR protects Pol \u03b7-deficient cells from apoptotic signaling during replication stress, thereby increasing their viability. Consistent with this, Pol \u03b7-deficient cells depleted of ATR had a dramatic reduction in survival in comparison to ATR-proficient cells. In total, the data presented in this chapter greatly advance our understanding of Y-family polymerase regulation outside the context of DNA damage. This data in combination with Chapter 4 demonstrably shows Y-family polymerases are an integral component of the replication stress response. \nIn the Appendix I present my studies on A/T repeat mutagenesis. CFSs are enriched in A/T repeats, and non-B DNA structures formed by these sequences are proposed to induce CFS instability. I developed several new ex vivo reporter assays to examine mutagenesis during replication of A/T repeat rich, CFS derived sequences in human cells. Here I also detail my studies of the most recently identified DNA polymerase/primase, PrimPol. Using the Eckert lab\u2019s established in vitro HSV-tk\u00ac mutagenesis assay, I demonstrated for the first time that PrimPol is a highly error-prone DNA polymerase, and has a unique error signature on random, B-DNA. However, PrimPol\u2019s error signature on the A/T repeats is similar to Pol \u03b7\u2019s, suggesting a conserved mode of repeat replication.\nThe work presented in this thesis advances our understanding of the roles specialized DNA polymerases have in human cells, and how these enzymes are orchestrated in the face of replication stress. Taking these results together, the findings of this thesis are biologically significant because I have elucidated the mechanism underlying the fragile chromosome phenotype of Pol \uf068-deficient cells. By generating the optimal DNA template, Pol \uf068 has an essential role in completing genome duplication at difficult-to-replicate sequences and traversing the mitotic checkpoint, ensuring that cells properly enter the next cell cycle after replication stress release. The human genome is characterized by its DNA sequence complexity and high repetitive DNA content, and the presence of repetitive sequences directly impacts genome stability. I provide here a new conceptual framework, wherein specialized DNA polymerases of varied biochemical properties are essential for complete duplication of highly complex genomes, functioning in each cell division.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15371], "author_name_tesi": "Barnes, Ryan Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Barnes", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kristin Ann Eckert", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "George Lucian Moldovan", "James Riley Broach", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Sergei A Grigoryev"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kristin Ann Eckert, Dissertation Advisor", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Chair", "George Lucian Moldovan, Committee Member", "James Riley Broach, Committee Member", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Outside Member", "Sergei A Grigoryev, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DNA polymerase", "replication stress", "genome stability"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Tissue cutting mechanics of dynamic needle insertion", "id": "28863", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12252", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Needles are commonly used in many medical procedures to sample blood and tissue, inject drugs and anesthetics, and implant radioactive seeds among other uses. The procedures of brachytherapy cancer treatment and tissue biopsy utilize needles to reach precise locations inside the body. However, due to high insertion forces, high accuracy is difficult to achieve. Previous researchers have demonstrated that vibration can reduce these high needle insertion forces. However, little research has currently focused on how the dynamic motions of vibration and velocity effect needle insertion force. This dissertation directly fills this void in knowledge to help reduce needle insertion force, which increases needle position accuracy. This research creates a further understanding of how velocity and vibration affect needle insertion force. This work also presents experimental results and force modeling of dynamic needle insertions. Based on this research, a novel compliant needle is designed and developed that utilizes vibration to reduce insertion forces.\nThree major topics are explored in this research: fracture mechanics model development, analysis of vibrational effect on insertion force, and the development of a novel compliant needle geometry to reduce needle insertion force. Firstly, a fracture mechanics model was developed that allowed for the understanding of how fracture force, tissue spreading force, and friction force impact the overall needle insertion force over a range of velocities (1-80 mm/s). The parameters of tissue toughness and tissue shear modulus were experimentally tested on ex vivo porcine skin. Model results showed the total needle insertion force was comprised of 70% tearing force which was dependent on the fracture toughness, 13% spreading force which was dependent on the shear modulus, and the remaining 17% friction force.\nTo analyze the effect of vibration on insertion force, two needle insertion experiments were performed. First, lancet hypodermic needles were inserted into ex vivo porcine skin with applied vibration. The insertion force was reduced up to 35% with the application of vibration compared to insertion without applied vibration. Next, experiments were performed using five conical tipped needles of varying grind angle sharpness between 15\u00b0 and 75\u00b0. These needles were inserted with applied vibration into ex vivo bovine liver and polyurethane sheets. The experiments into bovine liver showed that any vibratory combination of amplitude and frequency reduced the insertion force of the sharpest needle, grind angle of 15\u00b0, by an average of 55.1% compared to the insertion of the needle without applied vibration. However, the bluntest geometry needle, grind angle of 75\u00b0, had no significant reduction in bovine liver insertion force from applied vibration compared to the insertion without vibration. The experiments into polyurethane reinforced these findings that sharper needles benefit more from vibration in reducing insertion force compared to blunter needles.\nLastly, a novel compliant geometry was developed that transforms applied axial vibration into transverse motion at the needle tip. The needle geometry consisted of four grind planes to create the tip and a single axis flexural hinge created with two slits. Finite element modal analysis was performed on this needle tip geometry to determine the motion upon vibration. Experimentally the motion was measured using a stereomicroscope to be 16.0 \u00b5m in the transverse direction for the compliant geometry. Experiments showed the compliant needle was able to reduce the puncture and friction forces of insertion (18.8% and 71.0% respectively) compared to a standard non-compliant needle without applied vibration. This was due to the crack length in the skin simulant increasing by 190% with the compliant needle over the non-compliant needle, allowing the compliant needle to pass through the crack with less force. This reduced friction force can improve needle placement accuracy, thereby improving the efficacy of needle based procedures such as biopsy and brachytherapy.

The emergent focus in this study is on the role of norms and how they function within the discourse of the doctor-patient relationship.  A discovery of three major types of injunctive norms, explicit, implicit, and understood, was made.  Each major category was defined according to the attributes assigned throughout the analyses:  explicit injunctive norms were found to be those that are stated directly by the physician.  Implicit injunctive norms were defined as norms indirectly, or not overtly, stated by the physician.  Understood norms were those that the patient acknowledged s/he should do, although there is no indication that the patient had indeed adhered to those norms.  That is why they were thus Understood Norms rather than labeled personal norms.\n\tExplicit and implicit norms were broken further down into more specific categories.  Since Understood norms had so few examples, it was not further subdivided.  The implicit norms were subdivided into Implicit Norms as Suggestions, Implicit Norms as Questions, and Descriptive Norms Used as Questions.  It was posited that since Implicit Norms as Questions were the only type of norms that elicited patient accounts, perhaps doctors should ask more questions versus making suggestions or directly stating what the patient needs to do, in order to gain patient compliance.  Since questions are more face-threatening in that they require an answer, they may help function in moving patients from the pre-contemplative stage of behavior change to the contemplative stage, at the very least.   Finally, three models, one for each major type of norm, were derived.  \n\tThe most groundbreaking part of the study involved the investigation of patient accounts in normative behavior. To date, there are no known models of doctor-patient communication which include any type of norms and accounts.  \u201cBad behaviors\u201d stemming from patients ignoring injunctive norms were considered norm violations in this study; therefore, approaching compliance from a norms and account perspective in future studies may increase understanding and awareness of patient behavior and lead to testable models of interaction.  This study produced several models depicting the use of explicit and implicit injunctive norms; the hope of this researcher is that the models can lead to predict what types of injunctive norms are most effective in patient compliance.\n \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3133], "author_name_tesi": "Barnett, Jacqueline M.", "last_name_ssi": "Barnett", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Jacqueline", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael L Hecht", "Michelle E Day", "Ronald L Jackson Ii", "Joe A Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael L Hecht, Committee Chair", "Michelle E Day, Committee Member", "Ronald L Jackson Ii, Committee Member", "Joe A Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["communication", "norms", "doctor-patient communication", "injunctive norms", "accounts", "account-giving"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ADSORPTION ISOTHERM AND AVERAGE ORIENTATION OF ADSORBED \nALCOHOL AND WATER LAYERS ON SiO2 IN AMBIENT CONDITIONS\n\n", "id": "8643", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "209", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As the size of mechanical devices decreases from the macroscale to the micro and nanoscale, innovative lubrication methods are needed to minimize wear.  Recently, vapor-phase lubrication via continuously replenished short chain linear alcohol molecules has been demonstrated to be a durable lubrication technology for MEMS. Short chain alcohols are used as they exhibit high vapor pressures and correspondingly have low inelastic mean free paths providing high collision rates to the surface and thus maintaining a lubricant coating. However, the thickness, packing, and orientation of these short chain alcohols are not well understood. The adsorption isotherm, chain orientation, and packing of short-chain linear alcohols on silicon oxide were studied with attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) as a function of partial pressure. The isotherm thicknesses achieved with these adsorbed alcohols were found to increase from 0.5 nm to 1.5 nm as the partial pressure was increased from 5% to 85%.  It was determined that at partial pressures higher than 10%, the alcohols formed multilayers, ranging from 1-3 monolayers thick.  The orientation and packing of alkyl chains were determined for linear primary alcohols: propanol, pentanol, decanol, and octadecanol.  At room temperature it was determined that the sub-monolayer coverage of the adsorbed alcohol layers were oriented such that the OH was aligned along the surface normal and the alkyl chains were tilted towards the surface.  Above monolayer coverage they assumed a more bulk like structure with no specific orientation.  As water is always present in ambient environments, it was important to understand the adsorption isotherm thickness and orientation of the adsorbed water layers as a function of relative humidity.  At low relative humidities, water was determined to be \u201csolid-like\u201d and the OH transition dipole preferentially oriented ~33\u00b0 from the surface normal.  Near perpendicular orientation of the dipole moments of the adsorbed water layers contradicts the current assumptions that the first bilayer of adsorbed water is randomly oriented on SiO2 surfaces.  At higher relative humidities the water molecules in the adsorbed layers become randomly oriented regardless of whether they were \u201csolid-like\u201d or liquid water at relative humidities above 25%.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [208], "author_name_tesi": "Barnette, Anna Lorraine", "last_name_ssi": "Barnette", "middle_name_ssi": "Lorraine", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong H Kim", "Seong H Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seong H Kim, Thesis Advisor", "Seong H Kim, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["orientation", "adsorption isotherm", "water", "alcohols"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "VAPOR PHASE LUBRICATION OF SiO2 SURFACES VIA ADSORPTION OF SHORT CHAIN LINEAR ALCOHOLS &\nA SUM FREQUENCY GENERATION VIBRATION SPECTROSCOPY STUDY OF CRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE IN BIOMASS\n\n", "id": "11465", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13223", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of silicon oxide with its native oxide layer for the fabrication of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with contacting sliding parts requires the need for innovative lubrication methods to extend device lifetimes.  The most promising method to date involves the equilibrium vapor phase lubrication (VPL) of MEMS using short chain linear alcohols in ambient conditions.  Still, some questions remain regarding the effectiveness of this lubrication method, these include (1) whether or not the adsorbed n-alcohol molecules are the primary lubricant and (2) is this lubrication method effective in humid environments.\nThis study investigates the vapor phase lubrication of SiO2 surfaces using short chain linear alcohols, more specifically n-propanol and n-pentanol.  Macro-scale ball-on-flat tribometer tests are used to evaluate the lubriciousness of n-pentanol vapor under a series of contact loads/ pressures.  Wear reduction of the SiO2 surfaces is achieved when there is complete coverage of the SiO2 surfaces with the adsorbed n-pentanol molecules.  This occurs when the partial pressure relative to the saturation pressure (P/Psat) of n-pentanol was kept above 20% P/Psat which corresponds to approximately monolayer coverage of the SiO2 surface.  In contrast to the lubricious effect of n-pentanol vapor, water vapor proves to enhance wear of the SiO2 surfaces when compared to dry (low moisture) conditions.   This study also demonstrates that the primary lubrication method of the SiO2 surfaces is most likely the adsorbed n-pentanol molecules and not the tribochemical reaction species produced during the sliding contact.  Although this reaction species is always present within the wear tested regions, the production of the tribochemical reaction species is enhanced when more severe wear is observed.  So, the adsorbed n-pentanol molecules are the primary method of lubrication.\nThe effectiveness of the lubrication method in environments containing water vapor is also investigated.  This study is important because in the ambient, water molecules are always present.  In order to fully understand how the n-alcohol molecules interact with the SiO2 surfaces under co-adsorption conditions with water molecules, attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) and sum frequency generation (SFG) vibration spectroscopy are performed to understand the thickness, composition, and structure of the binary adsorbate layer on SiO2 in the absence of sliding.  These studies show that the water and n-alcohol molecules form a bi-layer structure with the water molecules adsorbed to the SiO2 surface and the n-alcohol molecules adsorbed on top of the water molecules.  Once water is adsorbed to the SiO2 surface it is difficult to remove.  So, the effectiveness of adsorbed n-pentanol molecules in humid environment in lubricating a MEMS sidewall friction tribometer is investigated.  This study demonstrates that an environment containing 50% P/Psat n-pentanol can lubricate these MEMS up to a relative humidity of 25% without device failure.  Above this, too much water is adsorbed to the SiO2 surface which inhibits device operation.  Thus, although adsorbed water is considered detrimental to SiO2 surfaces during sliding contact, its effect can be offset using n-pentanol VPL. \n\nCellulose is considered the most abundant naturally occurring polymer on earth. Because of this, many applications in the biofuels and pharmaceutical industries are under evaluation.  Despite studies dating back to the 1940s, the structures of cellulose in its naturally occurring form (I) as well as fabricated polymorphs (II and III) are not completely agreed upon in the literature.  Conventional spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and solid-state 13C Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are widely utilized in pursuit of understanding the structure of cellulose.  Three of these techniques, FTIR, Raman, and NMR, require the separation of cellulose from its surrounding components in biomass.  The chemical processes used for this separation can alter the structure of cellulose.  XRD cannot completely differentiate between the sub-types of cellulose I (&#945; or &#946;).  \nThis study investigates the use of SFG in analyzing crystalline cellulose within biomass samples, which included hemicellulose and lignin, and the different cellulose polymorphs.  This study also demonstrates that SFG is able to selectively detect crystalline cellulose within biomass samples as well as quantify the amount of crystalline cellulose present using proper calibration curves.  Unlike what is observed in FTIR, Raman, and NMR, only crystalline cellulose generates a true SFG spectrum so separation from the other components in biomass is not required.  Also, SFG is able to differentiate between the different polymorphs showing more distinct differences in spectra when compared to FTIR and Raman.

Both have their roots in 1970s development initiatives that ran largely as parallel programs with minor intersections until the late 1990s when some community forest groups began to promote biogas digesters as a tool to further development and forest conversation objectives.  This research analyzes the import and impact of the intersection between community forestry and biogas, with a focus on their impacts across scale from households to global markets.  Two central research questions guide this study, with the results based on qualitative ethnographic fieldwork, over 300 interviews, participant observation, and primary document collection conducted over 17 months during a three year period in Kathmandu, Jhapa and Gorkha districts of Nepal.  \n     The first research question seeks to understand how environmental governmentality and subjectivities can help us to situate individuals\u2019 actions and perceptions regarding the case of community forestry and biogas adoption in Nepal, as well as what this empirical case can contribute to further our understandings of the evolving concept of environmental governmentality.  By applying foundational elements of Michel Foucault\u2019s governmentality to community forestry and biogas technology in Nepal, this study demonstrates how community forestry has become a tool used to modify environment related behaviors.  This research contributes to environmental governmentality literature by arguing that researchers must also consider the complex interplay of multiple subjectivities residing within individuals and how this impacts their changing environmental attitudes and behaviors. \n     The second core question is how are community forestry and biogas technology in Nepal situated in national and international movements for sustainability, development, and carbon markets and how do those connections influence the form and content of these specific programs in Nepal?  This research finds that from their inception, both community forestry and biogas have been connected to global movements and events, but that the discourses surrounding them and the rationale for their continuation has changed.  Knowledge production, discourse, and power are foundational elements of environmental governmentality that contribute to understanding and analyzing this process.  By analyzing how the discourses and rationales surrounding these two initiatives change over time, this research contributes to a better understanding of the complex and varied workings of environmental governmentality. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7641], "author_name_tesi": "Barnhart, Shaunna Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Barnhart", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Shaunna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Mc Carthy", "Lakshman S Yapa", "Brenton Yarnal", "Cynthia Clare Hinrichs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Mc Carthy, Dissertation Advisor", "Lakshman S Yapa, Committee Member", "Brenton Yarnal, Committee Member", "Cynthia Clare Hinrichs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["community forestry", "biogas", "environmental governance", "governmentality", "Nepal", "renewable energy", "carbon credits"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "VOLUMETRIC INTERPRETATION OF PROTEIN ADSORPTION KINETICS\n\n", "id": "9403", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4730", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Protein adsorption is believed to be a very important factor ultimately leading to a predictive basis for biomaterials design and improving biocompatibility. Standard adsorption theories are modified to accommodate experimental observations. Adsorption from single-protein solutions and competitive adsorption from binary solutions are mainly considered. The standard solution-depletion method of measuring protein adsorption is implemented with SDS-gel electrophoresis as a multiplexing, separation-and-quantification tool to measure protein adsorption to hydrophobic octyl sepharose (OS) adsorbent particles. Standard radiometric methods have also been used as a further check on the electrophoresis method mentioned above for purified-protein cases. Experimental results are interpreted in terms of an alternative kinetic model called volumetric interpretation of protein adsorption. A partitioning process between bulk solution and a three-dimensional interphase region that separates bulk solution from the physical adsorbent surface is the concept of the model. Protein molecules rapidly diffuse into an inflating interphase that is spontaneously formed by bringing a protein solution into contact with a physical surface, then follows by rearrangement of proteins within this interphase to achieve the maximum interphase concentration (dictated by energetics of interphase dehydration) within the thinnest (lowest volume) interphase possible. An important role of water in protein adsorption is emphasized and supported by this model. The fundamental aspects including the reversibility/irreversibility of protein adsorption, the multilayer adsorption, the applicability of thermodynamic/computational models, the capacity of protein adsorption, and the mechanism of so called Vroman effect are discussed and compared to the conventional theories.

Interactive applications will demand a minimum amount of bandwidth and the least number of handoffs which introduce unwanted hiccups in live service (e.g. VoIP or live video). Non-interactive applications have no time demands but desire the maximum throughput possible. With cross-layer communication, the application can notify TAR about its bandwidth requirements and whether it wishes to perform handoff reduction or maximum throughput. Furthermore, we propose a distributed fairness mechanism around a weighted max-min scheme to allow interactive users to gain priority during the association cycle, perform a sort of load balancing, and act as a quality-of-service admission control. This can either be done with assistance from the AP or through peer-to-peer coordination with a mobile peer-to-peer database of client-AP associations.

In 2007, the National Research Council published a synthesis report that emphasizes the centrality of constructing, evaluating, and using scientific explanations. Participating in argumentation is seen as fundamental to children\u2019s science learning experiences. These new expectations increase challenges for elementary teachers since their understanding of and experiences with science are overwhelmingly inconsistent with teaching science as argument. These challenges are further amplified when dealing with prospective elementary teachers. \nThe current study was guided by the following research questions: (1) What are the ways in which preservice elementary teachers appropriate components of \u201cteaching science as argument\u201d during their student teaching experience? (2) To what extent do components from prospective elementary teachers\u2019 reflections influence planning for science teaching? (3) What elements from the context influence preservice elementary teachers\u2019 attention to teaching science as argument? This study followed a multi-participant case study approach and analyses were informed by grounded theory. Three participants were selected from a larger cohort of prospective elementary teachers enrolled in an innovative Elementary Professional Development School (PDS) partnership at a large Northeast University. Cross-case analysis allowed for the development of five key assertions: (1) The presence of opportunities for interacting with phenomena and collecting first hand data helped participants increase their emphasis on evidence-based explanations. (2) Participants viewed science talks as an essential mechanism for engaging students in the construction of evidence-based explanations and as being fundamental to meaning-making. (3) Participants demonstrated attention to scientific subject matter during instruction rather than merely focusing on activities and/or inquiry processes. (4) Scaffolded protocols positively influenced participants\u2019 attention to having students construct evidence-based explanations during science planning and teaching. (5) Teachers\u2019 beliefs about children\u2019s science capabilities influence their attention to and adoption of practices associated with teaching science as argument.

If these trends continue, the future efficacy of conservation efforts will be uncertain.  Environmental interpretation is one way to help people develop deeper connections to the natural world.  Through programming, park visitors can develop a powerful sense of stewardship that will serve to protect these important places into the future.  The techniques that interpreters use to present their programs play a critical role in providing these powerful interpretive opportunities.   In an effort to connect more people to natural resources, there is a need to incorporate more creative techniques such as live music into interpretive programming.\nThis study took place at Glacier National Park in northwest Montana and addressed the effectiveness of live music as an interpretive technique.  Utilizing an experimental design, I attempted to understand if there was a difference in interpretive outcomes between the treatment group (participants who experienced a music program) and the control group (participants who experienced a non-music program). The program studied was a 20-minute Ranger talk focusing on the effects of climate change on Glacier National Park resources.  Content-wise, these two programs were identical with the only programmatic difference being that, in the music program, a song was sung and, in the non-music program, a poetic rendition of the lyrics was given.  A post-test survey was administered to visitors after experiencing either the music or non-music program.  To control for variability between the two programs, I was also the National Park Service ranger presenting the programs.  The survey instrument probed for emotional, intellectual, and stewardship response measures, which were adopted from previous interpretive effectiveness studies.  At the conclusion of the data collection process (Summer 2012), 197 surveys were collected (25% response rate) from 28 programs (13 music, 15 non-music).  With this dataset, a number of statistical analyses were undertaken.  Descriptive statistics on the visitor demographic, motivations, and interpretive outcome frequencies were run.  Factor analysis was conducted on the individual interpretive outcome items to create four distinct dependent variable measures.  Then, due to the skewness of the data, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U Tests were utilized to understand if there were statistically significant differences between the two groups. \nResults indicate that there were no significant differences between the two program formats (live-music and non-music) in regards to emotional response, provocation/stewardship response, knowledge gain, and climate change technique effectiveness response.  The initial hypotheses that all four response indicators would be higher amongst the live-music respondents were not supported.  \nExplanations for the lack of difference between the two programs include: the lack of substantial difference between the music and non-music programs, the dramatic location of the study setting (Glacier National Park), a largely homogenous convenience sample, the utilization of an unverified survey instrument, and the exclusively-qualitative methodology.\nEven though the study results do not support the original hypotheses, that live-music based programs result in higher interpretive responses than non-music programs, this project may lay the groundwork for future inquiry into studying the use of music (or other non-traditional approaches) as an effective interpretive technique.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8423], "author_name_tesi": "Barrett, Austin Gordon", "last_name_ssi": "Barrett", "middle_name_ssi": "Gordon", "first_name_ssi": "Austin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Justin Mowen", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "George Richard Vahoviak"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Justin Mowen, Thesis Advisor", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Thesis Advisor", "George Richard Vahoviak, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Environmental Interpretation", "Music", "Climate Change", "Experimental Design"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Diverse Stakeholders' Views and Perceptions of Local Park and Recreation Services", "id": "14330agb149", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14330", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this dissertation was to assess diverse stakeholders\u2019 views, perspectives, and priorities related to local park and recreation services.  As a function of local government, park and recreation services are usually dependent on tax dollar allocations from government general funds.  However, there is great competition among a variety of public services for this finite amount of tax funding.  Existing research indicates that park and recreation services are largely seen as a discretionary public service that are nice to have, if they can be afforded; other services are viewed as more important and worthy of consistent funding.  When local governments face fiscal stress, however, park and recreation services have been shown to be one of the services cut first, and most severely.  To ensure park and recreation services receive an adequate supply of tax support, these services need to be perceived to provide benefits to all members of the community.  Two groups that are particularly important stakeholders, and the focus of this dissertation, are citizens and local government decision-makers.\n\nChapter 1 provides an introduction to the dissertation.  This includes a statement of purpose, the significance of this inquiry to the field, and an overview of related research.  Chapter 5 summarizes the key findings from the three studies (Chapters 2-4), discusses the implications of these findings to practice, and suggests directions for future research.\n\nChapter 2 utilizes a national sample of United States adults to examine differences in local park and recreation use, perceived benefits, and willingness to support these services through local taxes based on a variety of demographic variables.  Differences in these key variables based on whether or not a respondent used local parks and recreation programs was also considered.  Finally, a regression model determined which factors were most strongly related to willingness to support parks and recreation through local taxes.\n\nChapter 3 shifts the focus from citizens to local decision-makers.  Using a sample of local government officials from Pennsylvania, this study provided a descriptive understanding of how officials perceive local park and recreation services within their communities \u2013 including the extent of benefits they believe these services provide, as well as their funding priorities for parks and recreation within their communities.  A series of regression analyses were conducted to test if benefit perceptions related to funding priorities.  These significant relationships could have implications for how park and recreation services select a position upon which to advocate for their services.\n\nChapter 4 utilizes a nation-wide sample of local government officials to explore the perceived importance and quality of park and recreation services compared to other commonly provided public services.  Next, hypothetical allocation scenarios were used to assess the priority officials placed on funding park and recreation services relative to other local government services.  Finally, exploratory regression models were created to identify the factors related to positive allocation decisions in support of funding for parks and recreation.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14982], "author_name_tesi": "Barrett, Austin Gordon", "last_name_ssi": "Barrett", "middle_name_ssi": "Gordon", "first_name_ssi": "Austin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Justin Mowen", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Alan R Graefe", "Brendan Derrick Taff", "William F.

These findings, plus those documenting an attenuation of exercise blood pressure following estrogen replacement, are suggestive of a role for estrogen deficiency in mediating the exaggerated cardiovascular response. However, the mechanisms by which this augmented blood pressure response is achieved and estrogens contribution remains incompletely understood. As such, the objective of this thesis was to determine the effects of acute and chronic estrogen deficiency on the hemodynamic responses to rhythmic exercise with graded reductions in muscle blood flow. Seventeen healthy women participated in this study (7 postmenopausal women, 57-64 yrs; 10 premenopausal women, 20-28 yrs). To discern the effect of acute estrogen fluctuations on the cardiovascular responses to rhythmic exercise with progressive muscle ischemia, premenopausal women were tested at two different time points during their menstrual cycle; when estrogen levels were at their nadir (early follicular phase, days 2-6) and at their peak (late follicular phase). Hemodynamic responses in each subject were assessed (Finometer) at rest and during mild (10% MVC) rhythmic (30 contractions/min) handgrip exercise. Following a 4-minute free flow exercise period, a blood pressure cuff on the subject\u2019s upper arm was progressively inflated at a rate of 20 mmHg/minute. Subjects continued to exercise until volitional fatigue after which contractions ceased but the blood pressure cuff remained inflated (3 minutes) to isolate the contribution of the muscle metaboreflex. As expected, postmenopausal women generated greater systolic blood pressure response at fatigue (\u0394SBP: 24.7\u00b13.9 vs 39.4\u00b13.6 mmHg) (p < 0.05), a response that tended to remain during the period of metaboreflex isolation that followed (\u0394SBP: 17.6\u00b13.1 vs 27.3\u00b14.2 mmHg) (p = 0.07). Importantly, the pressor response generated at fatigue appeared to be mediated almost exclusively by a rise in peripheral resistance in the postmenopausal women (\u0394TPR: 22.7\u00b139.8 vs 218.7\u00b161.1 dyn\u2022s/cm5) (p < 0.05), while changes in cardiac output played a larger role in the premenopausal women (\u0394Q\u0307: 1.8\u00b10.5 vs 0.4\u00b10.7 L/min). The differential nature of the cardiac output response between groups was mediated by differences in stroke volume (\u0394SV: 10.6\u00b14.3 vs -16.4\u00b111.6 mL/beat) (p < 0.05), rather than heart rate. Additionally, at high relative arterial cuff pressures, when the muscle metaboreflex was engaged, the percent reduction in brachial blood flow across increasing cuff pressures was smaller in the postmenopausal than the premenopausal women, indicating that the elevated pressor response in the postmenopausal women appeared to confer a flow advantage. \n\tAcute estrogen deficiency appeared to some extent to mirror the findings noted with chronic estrogen changes. Specifically, although the pressor response to rhythmic exercise and during metaboreflex isolation were not different between the two menstrual phases, elevated estrogen levels appeared to shift the components of the pressor response to an increased reliance on stroke volume changes, both during exercise (\u0394SV: 17.7\u00b15.4 vs 10.6\u00b14.3 mL/beat) (p < 0.05) and during the period of post exercise circulatory arrest that followed (\u0394SV: 17.8\u00b15.8 vs 11.8\u00b14.6 mL/beat) (p < 0.05). Importantly, the divergent nature of the stroke volume response between menstrual phases was not present during the free flow exercise period or at low relative cuff pressures during progressive arterial occlusion suggesting a role for acute estrogen changes on the components of the metaboreflex-induced pressor response. \n\tIn conclusion, the present study provides evidence for estrogenic effects on the hemodynamic responses to rhythmic exercise, particularly when the muscle metaboreflex is engaged. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11752], "author_name_tesi": "Barrett, Megan Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Barrett", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Mary Jane De Souza"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor, Thesis Advisor", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Thesis Advisor", "Mary Jane De Souza, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["estrogen", "metaboreflex", "postmenopausal", "blood pressure"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Observations and Analysis of Repeating Earthquakes beneath the Aceh Basin, Northern Sumatra", "id": "10789", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5467", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Repeating earthquakes are observed across a variety of tectonic settings. In this study we discuss observations of numerous repeating earthquakes that occurred beneath the Aceh Basin following The Great 2004 Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake. The Aceh Basin is the northernmost in a series of forearc basins located along the Sunda Trench (~94\u00b0 E, 5\u00b0 N). The plate boundary beneath the basin was relatively aseismic prior to the 2004 megathrust earthquake. An analysis of the moderate-size earthquakes occurring beneath the Aceh Basin in response to the 2004 megathrust provides interesting and important observations of stick-slip faulting near the deep within the seismogenic zone. We use teleseismic and distant regional observations to identify repeating earthquakes that we infer to be located along the plate boundary 30-50 km beneath the seafloor. Analysis of the short-period coda following teleseismic and regional P and regional S waves is used to estimate the distance between repeating events in the same sequence. The coda analysis indicates that in most instances the same asperity is failing in the sequence of repeating events. Despite incredibly consistent coda coherence, events within each sequence show resolvable amplitude differences, which suggest changes in frictional strength occurring throughout the duration of the repeating earthquake sequence.

Additional studies of large aftershock sequences, such as the 2010 Chile earthquake, may provide more insight into these questions.

The present study focuses on analyzing the impact of oxygenates on the sooting tendency and the soot oxidative reactivity, two important aspects of particulate matter (PM) emissions from biofuel combustion, and their relation to fuel formulation and fuel molecular structure. \n\nSooting tendencies have been measured for 41 oxygenated pure compounds. The test compounds include alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, keto-esters and hydroxy-esters. A new sooting index is proposed and validated for oxygenated and non-oxygenated compounds, which considers the relation between the height of the flame tip and the volumetric stoichiometric air to fuel ratio of the flame. This new index is denoted as the Oxygen Extended Sooting Index (OESI). The results obtained by this new index corroborate that not only the oxygen content but also the molecular structure has an influence on the sooting tendency of fuels. A structural group contribution approach based on group additivity is proposed to interpret experimental observations on the effect of oxygen functional groups on the sooting tendency of fuels using the example of C-5 oxygenated fuels. Among the C-5 mono-oxygenated compounds, the sooting tendency increased in this order: aldehydes < alcohols < ketones < ethers < n-alkanes and for the C-5 di-oxygenated compounds, the sooting tendency order was: acids < esters < di-ethers. \n\nThe new sooting index was applied to commercial biofuel blends of interest such as ethanol-gasoline, butanol-gasoline and biodiesel-diesel blends. Empirical correlations with good correlation coefficients were obtained. Among these fuels ethanol is more efficient than butanol in reducing sooting tendencies of gasoline blends. This can be attributed to the higher oxygen content of ethanol in comparison to butanol. Among the two butanol isomers tested, 1-butanol is slightly more effective on suppressing soot formation than iso-butanol. This can be explained by the alcohol position on the molecular structure since oxygenates located at the periphery of the carbon-chain are more accessible for reaction and produce smaller hydrocarbons that are less effective as soot precursors. \n\nThe PM Index (PMI) developed by Aikawa and collaborators was evaluated and assessed. An improved PM index was proposed, denoted as modified PM index (MPMI), which predicts PM emissions in practical gasoline engines based on fuel physical and chemical properties. This index is based on two main fuel factors that influence PM emissions in gasoline engines. These are the fuel molecular structure effects, which are accounted by the OESI proposed index, and fuel physical properties such as its volatility, which is accounted by the Reid vapor pressure. The new proposed index incorporates all fuel molecular structural effects known to have an impact on soot formation such as branching, condensation, aromaticity and carbon chain length, in contrast to the PMI, which only accounts for degree of saturation. Moreover, the new index accounts for oxygenate functional group effects on the sooting tendency as well. The MPMI correlation should be interpreted as a means to predict how different fuels and additives will affect soot formation in a specific gasoline engine at a specific operating condition. The MPMI values were compared to engine particulate number (PN) emissions. A good agreement between the trends and values was obtained. \n\nA new methodology based on smoke point measurements was proposed and validated for estimating the decrease in diesel engine exhaust opacity when different ethanol- and biodiesel-diesel blends are used instead of conventional diesel fuels. Different binary biodiesel-diesel and ethanol-diesel blends were tested in a smoke point lamp together with ternary ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends. The results of the binary blends were compared to the opacity obtained in a light duty diesel engine operating in a steady state mode confirming that the stoichiometric volumetric air to fuel ratio (A/F) to smoke point ratio accurately reproduces the decreasing trend in opacity, when normalized to a conventional diesel fuel, as a function of the percentage of biofuel in the blend. \n\nFinally, a study and analysis of the relation of ester structures contained in biodiesel to the soot characteristics and soot oxidative reactivity was conducted. In this study, soots generated from the combustion of various methyl esters, alkanes, biodiesel and diesel fuels in laminar co-flow diffusion flames were analyzed via various analytical techniques to determine the impact of fuel-bound oxygen in fatty acid esters on soot oxidation behavior. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the soot samples collected from the diffusion flames showed that ester compounds contained in biodiesel do have an impact on soot oxidative reactivity and soot characteristics in contrast to the claims made in the literature. Soot derived from methyl esters with shorter alkyl chains, such as methyl butyrate and methyl hexanoate, were found to be more reactive than those with larger carbon chain lengths, such as methyl oleate, which are more representative of biodiesel fuels. The impact of fuel-bound oxygen on the reactivity of soot became less significant as the carbon chain length increased. Reactivity of a high cetane, low aromatic diesel fuel derived soot was compared to the derived soot of a conventional diesel fuel. The results obtained suggest that higher aromatic content may increase soot reactivity. Soot reactivity analysis of methyl esters with different type of bonds (single and double) at the same carbon number suggests that not only the degree of saturation but also the type of bond and locations have an effect on the soot reactivity. Furthermore, structural analysis was performed via Raman spectroscopy on methyl esters derived soot samples and compared with n-dodecane derived soot. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9482], "author_name_tesi": "Barrientos, Eduardo Jose", "last_name_ssi": "Barrientos", "middle_name_ssi": "Jose", "first_name_ssi": "Eduardo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Robert John Santoro", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Chair", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Oxygenated Fuels", "Sooting Tendency", "Soot Oxidative Reactivity", "Smoke Point", "Diffusion Flames", "PM emissions"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Emotions in Chronic Illness: The good, the bad and the balanced", "id": "22559", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10182", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous literature has documented the benefits of positive affect and the detriments associated with negative affect but the two literatures have been largely separate from one another. However, to fully understand the affective experience of individuals it is important to consider both positive and negative affect and the connection between the two. Therefore, the three papers of this dissertation sought to examine the affective experience of chronic illness patients and their family members through an investigation of the good (positive affect), the bad (negative affect) and the balanced (relationship between positive and negative affect). \nStudy 1 assessed emotion transmission in 145 individuals with osteoarthritis and their spouses. Emotion transmission is evident when emotions in an individual\u2019s daily experience lead to subsequent and similar emotions in another individual. The current study assessed negative emotion transmission between morning and end of day assessments and positive emotion transmission between morning and afternoon assessments and also between afternoon and end of day assessments. The negative emotion transmission paths (i.e., negative affect predicting negative affect or positive affect) revealed that patient beginning of day affect predicted spouse end of day negative affect but was moderated by both gender and marital satisfaction. Therefore, evidence of transmission is primarily seen in female spouses in marriages with lower satisfaction. Additionally, patient beginning of day negative affect also predicted spouse end of day positive affect but was again moderated by marital satisfaction. In the current investigation, there was no evidence of positive affect transmission. \nStudy 2 assessed the direct relationship between positive and negative affect in a different configuration by calculating affect balance (relative levels of negative affect and positive affect) in 59 prostate cancer patients and their spouses. The current analyses considered balance in the number of items endorsed but also in intensity of affect experienced. The study also sought to understand the association between perceived stress and daily affect balance, which provides an additional dimension to understanding how individuals navigate the chronic illness experience on a daily basis. Findings demonstrate that affect balance in the number of items endorsed and affect balance in the intensity of affect was associated with perceived stress severity for both patients and spouses. However, the change in balance was not only due to a change in negative affect. Patients\u2019 balance was altered both by stress related increases in negative affect and decreases in positive affect. Spouses\u2019 balance was altered only through changes in negative affect. Additionally, perception that the stressor was due to prostate cancer was associated with affect balance count and intensity for patients.\nFinally, Study 3 investigates affect balance in 173 dementia caregivers and assesses changes in affect balance brought on by stressor context and the impact of an intervention that provides respite care. Findings demonstrate that exposure to care related and non-care related stressors predicted affect balance count and stress reactivity to care related and non-care related stressors predicted affect balance intensity. Additionally, affect balance intensity was directly predicted by ADS use above and beyond the impact of stressors. Findings also reveal that there seems to be an accumulation in the benefits of ADS use because negative affect intensity was lowest when both yesterday and today were ADS days.

The goal of this thesis was to develop a method that uses added features such as a wing and an auxiliary propeller (described as added \u2018control degrees of freedom\u2019) on a compound rotorcraft to reduce the noise generated when flight conditions were changed.  Noise radiation is an important factor for both military and civilian helicopters.  There has been limited research on compound rotorcraft acoustics.  Prior research focus has been primarily on tiltrotor configuration and large civil helicopter acoustics.  For this thesis, a notional vehicle with a main rotor, tail rotor, wing, and auxiliary propeller was used.  A flight simulation model and a noise prediction tool were coupled together to produce all of the analytic results.  Predictions indicated that with the additional \u2018control degrees of freedom\u2019, the noise from a compound helicopter can be changed drastically.  \nResearch showed that reducing the rotor advancing tip Mach number resulted in a large noise reduction in high-speed flight; this can be useful when finding an optimal noise flight condition.  Results also showed that changing the thrust produced by an auxiliary propeller located aft of the aircraft does not have a dramatic effect on the overall sound due to the dominance of thickness noise in all areas around the aircraft.  Even though noise does not change drastically with the change of thrust produced, the change is still crucial to the performance of the aircraft.  Studies revealed that combining both advancing-tip Mach number changes along with thrust changes produced the best way to alter the noise produced from the aircraft. The dominant noise source in the cases run were from the auxiliary propeller. Independently changing the auxiliary propeller\u2019s tip Mach number drastically changed the noise produced by the rotorcraft and is the most effective way to reduce overall noise.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8936], "author_name_tesi": "Barron, Heather Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Barron", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Steven Brentner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Steven Brentner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Helicopter", "rotorcraft", "rotor", "craft", "acoustic", "WOPWOP", "PSU-WOPWOP", "aerospace", "compound", "analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRINCIPALS' DISTRIBUTED LEADERSHIP AND TEACHER TURNOVER IN NORTH CAROLINA SCHOOLS", "id": "14400mjb625", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14400", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The three-fold purpose of this quantitative data study was to explore the relationship between teachers' perceptions of distributed leadership and teacher turnover in public schools in North Carolina.

As a result, the system has become increasingly constrained, hindering the ability of the transmission system to facilitate competition among generators. New transmission can fix this problem, but is difficult to construct due to political, environment and financial concerns. Topological reconfigurations of the transmission system could improve the efficiency of power system operations and represents a particularly valuable application of the smart grid. However, in practice the topology reconfiguration problem is difficult to solve.\nReconfiguration of the transmission network can be accomplished through topology optimization. The act of temporarily removing transmission lines from service, known as \u201ctransmission switching\u201d, can relieve transmission congestion and enable the re-dispatch of lower cost generators. Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) co-optimizes the generator dispatch and the network topology and has been shown to minimize costs when applied to test systems. When considering every line in the network as switchable, the problem scales such that 2#-lines distinct network topologies must be considered. Real systems often contain tens of thousands of transmission lines. The size and complexity of OTS has limited optimal solutions to small test systems and linearized DC power flow models.\nA Marginal Analysis of OTS investigates the predictors of the probability with which each transmission line is optimally switched and the contribution of each line to cost savings. The analysis leads to two conclusions. First, the majority of cost savings can be achieved through switching a small subset of lines. And second, the effects of transmission switching are relatively localized. These conclusions lead to the development of two strategies to reduce the computational complexity of the OTS problem. Network partitioning methods are used to\niv\ngenerate sub-networks where the OTS problem can be solved in parallel and then aggregated to form a complete system solution. Additionally, a candidate switchable line screen based on the Line Outage Distribution Factors is presented to identify a superset of switchable lines.\nThus far in the evolution of transmission topology and generation dispatch co-optimization problems, optimal solutions have been obtained using a linearized de-coupled power flow model. While this model is useful for many approximations, it fails to describe reactive power flows and voltage magnitudes; two critical parameters when considering the feasibility of a generation dispatch. However, topology optimization presents an intractable problem when implemented in the nonlinear and non-convex AC power flow model. The discrepancies between the AC and linearized DC power flow models have created speculation that the cost savings generated by optimizing transmission topology in the DC network may not translate into cost savings in the AC network. Using a method developed to achieve feasible OTS solutions in both the AC and linearized DC power flow models, cost savings are achieved and enhanced in the topologically reconfigured AC power flow model.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8216], "author_name_tesi": "Barrows, Clayton Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Barrows", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Clayton", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack", "Reka Z Albert", "Andrew Nathan Kleit", "Luis Ayala", "Paul Hines"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack, Dissertation Advisor", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member", "Andrew Nathan Kleit, Committee Member", "Luis Ayala, Committee Member", "Paul Hines, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Power System Analysis", "Optimization", "Electricity Markets", "Complex Network Science"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of Ultrasonic Cavitation Treatment Effects on the Beneficiation of Bituminous Coal", "id": "22568", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9900", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Laboratory testing was conducted to evaluate the effects of hydroacoustic cavitation\n(HAC) treatment on two bituminous coal slurries and the performance of various subsequent\nseparation processes. Separation process units studied were the hydrocyclone, spiral\nconcentrator, froth flotation, and plate filter press. The pilot-scale HAC circuit consisted of a stainless-steel ultrasonic resonator chamber and in-line flow reduction cavitation orifice.\n\nThe two materials processed were nominal -1-mm and -0.15-mm Illinois Basin bituminous coal slurries. The -1-mm material (Sample A) was the feed stream to a coal preparation plant classifying hydrocyclone while the -0.15-mm  material (Sample B) was the overflow stream from the same hydrocyclone. Laboratory analyses showed that Sample A had an value of 34.44\u00b12.28% and was 4.16% total sulfur while Sample B had an ash value of 53.39\u00b11.16% and was 2.3% total sulfur. Over 70% of the total sulfur was pyritic sulfur for both samples. Heating values were 8,656 Btu/lb and 6,423 Btu/lb for Sample A and Sample B, respectively.\n\nHAC treatment of Sample A demonstrated that 100% power sonication (Son) and 100% power sonication with all slurry flow through the cavitation orifice (SonCav) reduced feed particle size and ash values of coarser size intervals (+150 \u03bcm). After only 5 s of treatment, the 50% cumulative passing size was reduced by about 50 \u03bcm with ash values for certain size fractions decreasing over 5% between untreated and SonCav tests. Extending treatment time led to greater degradation of the +1180-\u03bcm material with increases in the -25-\u03bcm material and reductions in ash values of central size fractions  (-850+150 \u03bcm).\n\nUtilizing the hydrocyclone at an inlet pressure of 20 psi, solids splits to the underflow\nstream of about 90% and 40% were achieved for Sample A and Sample B, respectively. HAC treatment concentrated sulfur in the underflow stream while reducing underflow ash values and\nincreasing heating values as compared to the feed material. From untreated to SonCav treatment, ash was reduced by about 16% for Sample A and 25% for Sample B while heating value increased 7% and 33% for Sample A and B, respectively.\n\nHydrocyclone desliming of Sample A followed by spiral concentration of the underflow stream was effective at reducing ash and total sulfur values of the feed material. SonCav treatment prior to hydrocyclone desliming and spiral concentration produced a yield of nearly 70% with reductions in ash value of almost 60% and total sulfur by 6%. The spiral negated the\neffect of hydrocyclone concentration of sulfur in the product stream.\n\nDesliming Sample B by hydrocyclone followed by froth flotation reduced yields about 33% despite HAC treatment, but reduced ash values by almost 40% in some instances. Decreasing flotation time led to more dramatic reductions in product ash values (>70%) but yields were poor (~10%). The effects of desliming were more prominent than treatment in reducing ash and sulfur values for the froth product.\n\nPressure filtration of Sample B by plate filter press was minimally affected by HAC treatment in terms of cake moisture content as treatment caused high levels of feed stream dispersion and surface fine liberation. Reduction of filter press feed slurry pH to 4 and flocculation by a high molecular weight polymer had more noticeable effects, decreasing final cake moisture.

These perceived\nproblems are the genesis of this study, which develops a metatheoretical framework\nsufficiently plastic to: (1) determine the theoretical lineage of the LO construct; (2)\nanalyze and understand more fully the current state of LO theory and practice; (3) \u201ctest\u201d\nthe veracity of the aforesaid criticisms; and (4) explore the LO\u2019s potential for\nimplementation in organizations.\nIn effect, this dissertation seeks to \u201crelearn\u201d the LO, a response to the proposal by\nmany scholars within the social sciences that \u201ca process of unlearning\u201d the LO take place\ndue to its flawed assumptions about organizations and worklife. Contrary to this\nemerging perspective, this project embraces a different thesis, one that derives from a\nbelief that a given construct is only as robust as the ideas that inform it, and a hunch that\nthe LO paradigm has an evolutionary aspect to it that echoes the sum development of\norganization theory.\nThe starting point for this study is Peter Senge\u2019s conception of the LO, which is\nrecast in this work as an ornate cloth made from manifold threads of theories and\nthoughts about organizations. Then, by reweaving extant strands of knowledge with new\nyarns of insight, a fresh understanding of the LO and the inherent difficulties of\noperationalizing its meaning is made possible.\nThis dissertation is strictly an abstract work. It makes its chief contribution by\npresenting a new way to understand the notion of the LO via its theoretically grounded\nprocesses of concurrent deconstruction and re-invention. This work\u2019s most important\nfinding is that the LO idea is conceptually robust and theoretically powered; the result of\nan impressive scholarly pedigree that reflects the dialectical process of knowledge\ndevelopment within organization theory/organization studies field.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5671], "author_name_tesi": "Bartell, Sherrie Myers", "last_name_ssi": "Bartell", "middle_name_ssi": "Myers", "first_name_ssi": "Sherrie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Frances T.

The conclusions drawn from ion conduction models of the dielectric data are corroborated by additional independent experiments, including x-ray scattering, calorimetry, prism coupling, and DFT calculations.  The broad concern of this dissertation is to understand and clarify a path forward in ion conducting polymer research.  This is achieved by considering low-Tg ionomers and the advantages imparted by siloxane and phosphazene backbones.  The most successful dielectric spectroscopy model for the materials studied is the electrode polarization model (EP), whereas other models, such as the Dyre random barrier model, fail to describe the experimental results.\n  Seven nonionic ether oxygen (EO) containing polymers were studied in order to observe the effect that backbone chemistry has on dipole motion.  Conventional carbon-carbon backbone EO-containing polymers show no distinct advantage over similar EO-pendant polysiloxane or polyphosphazene systems.  The mobility and effective backbone Tg imparted by the inorganic backbones are comparable. A short EO pendant results in a lower static dielectric constant due to restricted motion of dipoles close to the chain.  The flexibility and chemical versatility of inorganic backbone polymers motivates further study of two ionomer systems.\n  A polypohosphazene iodide conducting system was characterized by dielectric spectroscopy and x-ray scattering.  Two end \u201ctail\u201d functionalization of the ammonium ion were used, a tail with two EOs and an alkyl tail of six carbons.  This functional group plays an important role in ion dynamics and can wrap around the ion and self-solvate when EOs are present.  The iodide-ammonium ionomers are observed to have unusually large high-frequency dielectric constants due to atomic polarization of ions.  The strength of the atomic polarization scales with ion content.  The aggregation state of ions is able to be determined from analysis of the static dielectric constant and show excellent agreement with x-ray scattering and DFT calculations, each ionomer strongly favoring the formation of quadrupoles.\n  Finally a polysiloxane ionomer was considered and was mixed with three anion and/or cation solvating additives, tetraglyme, tetraethylene glycol, and branched poly(ethylenimine).  The EP model of the dielectric response gives the conducting ion concentration and the mobility of conducting ions and shows an increase in conducting ion concentration with both anion solvating and cation solvating additives.  The static dielectric constant indicates an increased preference for ion pairs when anion receptors are present.  Most interestingly, the additive that best decreased the glass transition temperature and increased the static dielectric constant did not result in the best dc conductivity.   The best dc conductivity resulted from tetraglyme because it solvated cations without interacting with the polymer.  \n  High ion conductivities have not been observed in polymer systems that decouple charge transport from polymer motion, and therefore low Tg ionomers are the natural path forward for commercially viable ionomers.  Inorganic backbone polymers impart a low Tg without bringing any strong disadvantage to ionomers.  These materials are very important for developing superior ion conductors and should be pursued in future ionomer research.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11356], "author_name_tesi": "Bartels, Joshua Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Bartels", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby", "James Patrick Runt", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Harry R Allcock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby, Dissertation Advisor", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Chair", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Harry R Allcock, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ionomers", "Dielectric Spectroscopy", "Polysiloxane", "Polyphosphazene", "Conducting Polymer"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "SB-BASED MATERIALS FOR BEYOND SI FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR DEVICES", "id": "13195mjb590", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13195", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Antimonide based (Sb) compound semiconductors owing to their superior electron and hole transport properties over Si are an attractive option as a channel replacement material for the future generation of devices. Of the Sb materials p-channel InGaSb and n-channel InAsSb quantum wells (QWs) are particularly interesting due to their enhanced mobilities over silicon and their similar lattice constants. The similar lattice constants allows for a p and n channel all Sb-based alternative to Si CMOS technology to be grown on a common buffer layer. This integration advantages offered by a common buffer layer makes Sb-based devices applicable for use in future low power high-speed digital and millimeter wave applications. Important when evaluating any new technology is understanding its reliability. Radiation effects are important part of device reliability. Complex digital systems can be brought down by a vulnerability in one of its smallest subcomponents. For example an ionizing particle strikes a transistor or memory cell, the particle strike results in the generation of electron and hole pairs which can result the shift of critical transistor performance metrics such as threshold voltage (VT), or the corruption of a stored bit in the memory cell. \n\nThis dissertation addresses the fabrication and integration challenges that were overcome to realize Sb-based QW-MOSFETs.

Both p-channel InGaSb and n-channel InAsSb QW-MOSFETs are assessed for resilience to total ionizing dose (TID) effects and single event effects (SEE).

One important  consideration  when  dealing  with sliding surfaces is the vapor environment in which the two surfaces operate. Molecules from the vapor  phase  will  adsorb  onto  the  material  surface,  and  even  though  these  adsorbate  layers  are often less than one nanometer thick, they can influence friction and wear from the nano-scale to the macro-scale. \nThis study investigates the effect of different adsorbed vapor molecules on the friction and wear during sliding  between different solid surfaces. A macro-scale reciprocating ball-on flat  tribometer  was  used  to  examine  the  effect  of  water  vapor  and  various  organic  vapors  on lubrication and wear primarily between steel or copper surfaces, but also with ceramic, glass, and carbon surfaces. With the exception of engineered materials like diamond-like carbon (DLC), all tested  materials  experience  poor  lubrication  and  surface  wear  when  rubbed  in  a  dry,  inert environment. In the presence of water vapor, a copper surface  rubbed by a stainless steel ball undergoes three distinct lubrication and wear conditions depending on the surrounding relative \nhumidity (RH). Dry conditions and low humidity (<20% RH) produces plastic deformation and mild  abrasive  wear  of  the  copper,  intermediate  humidity  (20-80%  RH)  produces  catastrophic adhesive wear of the copper, and high humidity (>80% RH) produces galvanic corrosion of the stainless steel ball. Other classes of materials generally do not show the same complicated RH dependence  although  RH  does  not  act  as  a  lubricant  for  most  materials.   In  contrast  to  the complicated and deleterious effects of water vapor, organic vapors act as a lubricant across nearly all  solid  surfaces.  Organic  molecules  including  linear  alcohols,  branched  alcohols,  fluorinated alcohols, alkanes, and ketones provided lubrication.  A monolayer of n-pentanol vapor yields a friction coefficient of ~0.15 and minimal wear regardless of the friction or wear that a surface experiences  in  dry  or  humid  conditions.   This  lubrication  occurs  without  any  tribochemical reaction occurring. However, this lubrication is not observed with surfaces covered by residue from evaporated solvents. Low vapor pressure residue from trace contaminants in solvents gives \na low friction coefficient and minimal wear for some surfaces.\nThis study also investigates the effect of molecular structure of the adsorbate on friction and  wear.   Friction  and  wear  decrease  as  hydrocarbon  chain  length  increases  for  linear  chain alcohols and branched alcohols have a higher friction coefficient than linear alcohols for the same number  of  carbons.   Other  molecular  chemistries,  including  alkane,  ketone,  allyl  alcohol,  and fluorinated alcohol, had higher friction coefficients than n-pentanol. Unique to allyl alcohol is the formation  of  a  large  quantity  of  triboproduct  during  sliding.   The  triboproduct  forms  during sliding at all vapor partial pressures tested (15-80% p/p\nsat) and increases in formation for higher applied loads. Infrared spectroscopy of the triboproduct shows that the allyl C-H stretch that is present in the adsorbed vapor spectrum is absent from the triboproduct, indicating the formation of a poly-alcohol. This triboproduct can lubricate the surface in the absence of vapor flow for more than an order of magnitude longer than it took to form.\nThe  effect  of  adsorbed  vapor  on  solid  lubricants  is  also  studied.   Boric  acid  is  a \ncrystalline lamellar solid with a hexagonal structure similar to graphite and can exhibit a friction \ncoefficient as low as 0.05. However, a coating of boric acid is quickly worn away in dry inert \nconditions, exposing the underlying surface. Water vapor and acetone vapor environments yield the expected low friction coefficient, while alcohol vapor yields a friction coefficient   near 0.2. \nFurther  inspection  of  the  coating  during  alcohol  vapor  flow  shows  that  the  boric  acid  coating reacts  to  form  water  and  trialkyl  borate,  which  desorbs  from  the  surface,  thus  giving  only lubrication  by  the  adsorbed  alcohol.   The  mechanism  of  lubrication  for  boric  acid  in  water  or acetone  vapor  appears  to  be  due  to  edge  site  passivation  in  a  similar  fashion  to  graphite lubrication.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11238], "author_name_tesi": "Barthel, Anthony James", "last_name_ssi": "Barthel", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Anthony", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong H Kim", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Kyle Jeffrey Magnuson Bishop", "Albert Eliot Segall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seong H Kim, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member", "Kyle Jeffrey Magnuson Bishop, Committee Member", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tribology", "surface science", "mechanochemistry", "vapor phase lubrication"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Nuclear Proteomics of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Neural Differentiation\n", "id": "8605", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4570", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Goals of Dissertation Research: With the discovery of adult and embryonic stem cells, molecular medicine has expanded prospects for addressing a number of unmet medical needs. We can now imagine mending failing organs at the cellular level or replacing them altogether. However, we still face the issue of efficiently directing the differentiation of these cells. Part of the problem is a lack of knowledge of the signals and developmental timing required to commit to a certain lineage fate. Another issue is that available molecular markers of differentiation are limited. \n\nCellular responses originate in the nucleus where gene expression is initiated. The genetic material and its expression are managed and maintained by the nuclear proteome \u2013 the collection of proteins that operate within the nuclear envelope. We were interested in understanding the fundamental transformations required to direct the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into neuroprogenitors and neurons in vitro. Indeed, neural stem cells, ordinarily isolated from adult brains, can be obtained from hESCs through growth factor-mediated induction and selection. \n\nWe postulated that expression proteomic technologies, applied to nuclear protein extracts, would enrich our understanding of the molecular reprogramming that occurs during in vitro neural differentiation of hESCs (Chapter 1).  Therefore, we focused our efforts on investigating what changes take place in the composition of the nuclear proteome and the relative levels of individual nuclear proteins, using 2-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2-DIGE). The goal of this research encompasses the identification of these changes and the discovery of additional markers and effectors of neural lineage commitment.\n\nSpecific Aims:\nSpecific Aim 1: Develop a methodology for enhancing discovery proteomics for nuclear extracts (Chapter 2). The nucleus is rich in nucleic acids and salts. These species are potent inhibitors of the 2-DIGE process and need to be removed to generate optimal experimental results. Moreover, histones constitute a sizeable proportion of the nuclear proteome and their selective extraction would allow better resolution of less abundant proteins.  \n\nSpecific Aim 2: Characterize Reptin 52 expression during neural differentiation (Chapter 3). A preliminary comparison of hESC and hESC-derived neural stem cells illuminated an increase in Reptin 52 expression during differentiation. In light of a separate study performed between hESCs and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), where the same protein showed a decreased expression in hMSCs, we used orthogonal methods to characterize this protein and its known binding partners.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: Comparison of the nuclear proteomes of hESCs and hESC-derived neurospheres (Chapter 4). An extensive 2-DIGE experiment was conducted with three replicated samples to assess the differential expression of nuclear proteins during in vitro development of neural stem cells.\n\nOriginal Breakthroughs and Findings: We have developed an effective and reproducible technique to deplete nuclear protein extracts of histones and nucleic acids in a single step. This method significantly improves the efficacy and the resolution of    2-DIGE separation, enhancing the quality of image analysis for nuclear protein extracts. We also demonstrated that the expression proteomics approach can illuminate the expression of unsuspected proteins such as Reptin 52 as changed during differentiation. The use of orthogonal analytical tools confirmed this finding and suggests that this protein (and/or its binding partners) are potential regulators of neural differentiation. We have also discovered a network of nuclear proteins that are differentially expressed during in vitro differentiation and could be used as additional markers of differentiation.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4537], "author_name_tesi": "Barth\u00e9l\u00e9ry, Miguel ", "last_name_ssi": "Barth\u00e9l\u00e9ry", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Miguel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kent Eugene Vrana", "David A Antonetti", "Byron C Jones", "Willard M Freeman", "Bruce A Stanley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Chair", "David A Antonetti, Committee Member", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member", "Willard M Freeman, Committee Member", "Bruce A Stanley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Proteomics - Nucleus -  Stem cells - Differentiati"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Effects of Marcellus Shale Development on Songbird Abundance and Habitat Use in Northcentral Pennsylvania Forests ", "id": "22856", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9045", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Due to recent instability in the international petroleum products market, American industries are seeking to develop domestic sources of energy, and foremost among these domestic sources is natural gas. The Marcellus Shale formation in the northeastern portion of the United States contains a vast portion of the natural gas reserve of North America; the northeastern US also contains many large core forest reserves important for breeding songbirds. Within the last decade, development of wells within the Marcellus has rapidly expanded, and the number of wells permitted for drilling has increased steadily. In forested areas, Marcellus development creates large disturbances and causes substantial fragmentation, but the landscape matrix remains dominated by stands of mature forest. I examined the effects of Marcellus Shale gas development on songbird abundance and habitat use surrounding 30 well pads, mean size 2 hectares, placed within an extensive forest landscape in northcentral Pennsylvania. I used fixed-radius point counts to assess songbird abundance relative to well pads at four distances from the pad edge: two points in new edge habitat (0m and 50m) created by pad development and two points in remnant post-development interior habitat (150m and 250m), which served as a reference. I conducted bird and vegetation surveys in both northern hardwood and mixed oak habitat. To determine whether bird abundance and species composition differed between edge and reference points, I analyzed the aggregate avian community at edge and interior points and also built linear mixed models for three guilds of species based upon habitat preference: forest interior, early-successional, and synanthropic species. I also constructed linear mixed models for individual bird species within the guilds observed at \u226550% of field sites. Avian communities differed between forest interior and pad edge, and they also differed by forest habitat type (northern hardwood or oak) overall and at interior reference points. However, communities did not differ by forest habitat type at edge points, indicating biotic homogenization may be occurring near well pads. Forest interior species were significantly less abundant near the pad edge relative to interior reference points. Interior habitat associates such as black-throated green warblers (Setophaga virens), black-throated blue warblers (Setophaga caerulescens), ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla), red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceus), hermit thrushes (Catharus guttatus), and scarlet tanagers (Piranga olivacea) were less abundant at edge points than within the forest interior. In contrast, synanthropic species were more abundant near pad edges than at interior points. American robins (Turdus migratorius) were more abundant within 100m of well pad edges than at reference points within the forest interior surrounding well pads. Distance from edge was not a significant predictor of abundance for the early successional species guild or individual species associated with the guild. Common yellowthroats (Geothlypus trichas) and eastern towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), two species associated with early successional habitat, did not exhibit a detectable response to development. I took nested-plot vegetation samples at points surrounding well sites to assess vegetative changes near well pads as a possible explanation for bird distribution. Average canopy cover, mean litter depth, the number of tree stems >8cm diameter at breast height, and the number of small sapling stems <2.5cm were significantly lower at the immediate pad edge (0m) than at sample points of greater distances, but no other differences were detected. My results suggest development has not largely altered vegetation beyond the immediate edge, but the length of post-disturbance time elapsed may be insufficient for vegetative edge effects to be detectable. Absence of increased sapling density near well pads and lack of a detectable positive response to development by early-successional guild members present evidence Marcellus development is not currently creating early successional habitat. Instead, unconventional gas development appears to be creating a degree of radiative habitat loss beyond what forest is removed for pad construction: forest interior birds are significantly less abundant in forest within 100m of well pad edges. Edge and generalist species, which were previously rare or absent within the forest landscape, are moving into new edge habitat around Marcellus well pads, suggesting an ongoing shift in the bird community near well pad development and possible biotic homogenization as common generalist species replace less common forest specialists.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8878], "author_name_tesi": "Barton, Ethan Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Barton", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Ethan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham Brant", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski", "Duane R Diefenbach", "Michael Gerard Messina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham Brant, Thesis Advisor", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski, Thesis Advisor", "Duane R Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Gerard Messina, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Marcellus", "shale gas", "forest", "songbirds", "biotic homogenization", "habitat fragmentation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Generalized Complex Structures on Courant Algebroids\n", "id": "7912", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2606", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis we study generalized complex structures defined on Lie bialgebroids, and\narbitrary Courant algebroids.

The baseline testing paradigm assumes that healthy athletes will perform better than injured athletes on a battery of neuropsychological tests. However, this assumption has been challenged by recent research showing that abnormally low or discrepant scores on at least some tests in a neuropsychological assessment battery is normal for healthy individuals. To date, such research has focused on older adults and children rather than healthy younger adults such as collegiate athletes. The current study proposed to fill this gap by examining base rates and correlates of abnormally poor neuropsychological test performance on a baseline concussion assessment battery among a large sample of collegiate athletes. Consistent with studies looking at older adults and children, this study found that obtaining some abnormally low or discrepant scores on a multiple test battery is common among healthy collegiate athletes and is dependent upon the stringency of cutoff criteria. Factors correlated with abnormally poor neuropsychological test performance among healthy collegiate athletes at baseline assessment include gender, IQ, and time point in test battery. Information tables are provided, which include base rates for abnormally poor test performance across a multiple test battery among collegiate athletes by gender.

The growing need for industries to survive in a continually evolving market has led to the increasing adoption of Enterprise Architecture practice.\n\nDespite its growing popularity, there have been significant concerns raised about how to measure its business value. The inability of organizations to effectively account for the business impact of EA calls for a comprehensive measurement approach. This research seeks to provide an insight into the EA value measurement process based on experts\u2019 opinion obtained through a survey instrument. In addition, it also reports various challenges of the value measurement process as identified by the survey respondents. One of the main contributions of this research is to extend the ideas laid out in the survey to develop a conceptual metrics-driven model for EA value measurement using business value concepts. This model can be a foundation for the measurement process within a broad range of organizations using EA. \n\nThe second portion of the survey involves documenting the trends in EA frameworks. With the increasing number of frameworks proposed around EA, organizations often find the process of selecting the right framework challenging than ever before. Organizations use enterprise architecture frameworks to create strategic alignment between information technology and business which is crucial for its growth and success. Despite the existence of several research studies that compare EA frameworks, very few studies capture the information or the criteria that organizations need to consider when selecting a particular EA framework from a business perspective. While framework usage continues to become more mature within EA industry, little research has been done to document the trends.

The presence of natural fractures has significant effects on recovery from oil and gas reservoirs. In these reservoirs, fracture networks serve as better flow paths for fluids, while the porous rock provides storage space. The efficiency of hydrocarbon recovery as well as pollution and contaminant removal from soil and groundwater are mainly controlled by our ability to understand and define fluid transport mechanisms in naturally fractured formations. Appropriate representation of transport properties, such as relative permeability and capillary pressure, is essential for the success of any predictive flow process in permeable media. In addition, the presence of heterogeneities such as fractures, faults, and other geological features adds to the difficulty of assigning flow properties that are representative of the system. The present study focuses on the development and implementation of a numerical model of two-phase flow in fractured rocks showing contrasting rock properties in the form of bedding planes. A unique experimental data set of spontaneous imbibition in a fractured sandstone core is used for the development and verification of the model. This data set consists of a series of high-resolution X-ray computed tomography scans of a rock sample showing local rock heterogeneities, fracture orientation, bedding planes, and fluid saturation as a function of time. An automated history matching approach is proposed to determine relative permeability and capillary pressure curves. A commercial reservoir simulator is used in coordination with an optimization protocol in the proposed history matching method. Four different synthetic and a semi-synthetic data sets were used to test the automated history matching approach. Absolute permeability and oil relative permeability curves were predicted in those synthetic cases, using different relative permeability representations. In the semi-synthetic case, known relative permeability for the matrix and capillary pressure for both matrix and the fracture were determined simultaneously using experimental spontaneous imbibition data of a heterogeneous fractured core sample. Results of this study indicate that the automated history matching approach was successful in predicting the absolute permeability, relative permeability and capillary pressure. The effects of transport properties on the imbibition process were also investigated by sensitivity analysis.

Trees were cut longitudinally and the discolored wood was photographed and quantified as a percentage of the total wood area using ImageJ image analysis software.

Iodine starch tests were conducted by cutting unions into longitudinal sections and then staining them with a 5% solution of iodine-potassium iodide.  The iodine starch test was inconclusive, as the amount of tissues that stained varied greatly within each combination.

Intracellular lipid-binding proteins (iLBP\u2019s) are a large family of proteins that share a common ?-barrel structure in spite of very low sequence similarities. One member of this family, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (IFABP) has been shown to fold by a mechanism of specific hydrophobic collapse in a core structural region. These kinetic folding intermediates differ from intermediates observed for the structurally related protein, ileal lipid-binding protein (ILBP). There is some evidence that both proteins initiate folding by the same mechanism, but that stable folding intermediates do not accumulate to the same level for both. The proposed folding mechanism of IFABP is supported by equilibrium unfolding studies by 19F-NMR. Residues in contact with each other in the native protein retain elements of structure at denaturant concentrations much higher than the unfolding midpoint concentrations. This is manifested in the 19F-NMR spectra  in the form of NMR spectral changes that differ in response to denaturant depending on the residue\u2019s role in the folding pathway. Similar analysis of ILBP demonstrates that some residues in this protein also display non-uniform behavior by 19F-NMR with increasing denaturant, although the residues responsible for this behavior were not identified in the initial analysis. By labeling the protein with 19F one residue at a time, assignment of the peak resonances for each 19F-Phe in ILBP have now been made. The results of these 19F-NMR experiments reveal that some of the interactions that occur early in folding may be conserved, but the specific nature of the initiating reactions differs for these two related proteins.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2176], "author_name_tesi": "Basehore, Heather Kenney", "last_name_ssi": "Basehore", "middle_name_ssi": "Kenney", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ira Joseph Ropson", "Dr Michael Pishko", "Cara Lynne Schengrund", "Michael Verderame"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Chair", "Dr Michael Pishko, Committee Member", "Cara Lynne Schengrund, Committee Member", "Michael Verderame, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["b-sheet proteins", "19F-NMR", "protein folding"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "BROADENING SPECTRAL RESPONSE IN SOLID-STATE DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS VIA F\u00d6RSTER RESONANCE ENERGY TRANSFER\n", "id": "12238", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2717", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a promising renewable energy technology.  However, in the 19 years since the dye solar cell was first popularized by O'Regan and Gratzel there has been little improvement in efficiency.  A major hurdle to increasing the efficiency of both solid and liquid dye-sensitized solar cells is the fact that these cells can only convert light in a relatively narrow spectral region.  For example, the most popular dye used in DSSCs, N-719 dye only responds to wavelengths of light between 350-650 nm. Its competitor, crystalline silicon will convert light all the way to 1100 nm.  While DSSCs can have conversion efficiencies near unity for the light which is absorbed, the fact that they are unable to process a large fraction of the solar spectrum creates a fundamental limit on their overall efficiency.\nWithout a broader spectral response, DSSCs cannot achieve efficiencies high enough to displace other more expensive technologies. While many different solar dyes have been synthesized in the past two decades, the most efficient cell realized to date, possessing an 11.5% conversion efficiency, still uses a dye with a structure very similar to that used in the original Gratzel cell published in 1991 and has the same spectral response in the range from 350-650 nm.  Thus far, efforts to increase efficiency by extending the response of dyes have been unsuccessful.  It seems that there is a tradeoff between having a high absorption coefficient and having a broad absorption range.  Many of the strongly absorbing red and NIR dyes have narrow response windows which are insensitive to much of the blue and green light.  The problem becomes more significant when we consider the case of solid state dye sensitized solar cells (SDSCs).  The active layer of an SDSC is required to be very thin due to transport limitations of the low-mobility hole transport materials used.  In order to completely absorb light using such a thin layer, we are restricted to using only the aforementioned high absorbing dyes with narrow spectral response windows.  \nThe question then becomes \u201cwhat can we do given the materials available to us?\u201d  The obvious solution is to employ two or more sensitizers with complementary absorption spectra which can together create a solar cell with a broader spectral response.  Historically, the most successful examples of this concept have been dye cocktails, in which two or more dyes are absorbed onto titania and work in parallel.  To date, however none of these dye cocktails has demonstrated a performance better than if the best constituent dye was used alone.  \nThe focus of this dissertation is a newly developed approach which relies on F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).  In this scheme two dyes work in series instead of in parallel.  A short wavelength absorbing donor material dispersed in the hole transport material is coupled with a long wavelength absorbing acceptor material anchored to the surface of titania.  The donor material absorbs the short wavelength light, becomes excited, and transfers this excitation to the acceptor dye.  In addition to the energy transferred from the donor, the acceptor also absorbs the long wavelength light matching with its own absorption spectra, which would be its only energy source in the absence of the donor material.  Combining the materials in this way overcomes several of the losses inherent in the dye cocktail system, and because the donor and acceptor are not in physical contact they are insensitive to many of each other\u2019s properties.  \n\tFRET has the potential to overcome current efficiency limitations for SDSCs yet, at the inception of this work, FRET had not yet been demonstrated in SDSCs.  The purpose of this dissertation is to develop and demonstrate efficient FRET systems, and indentify appropriate donor and acceptor materials.   Herein, efficient working systems are demonstrated using off-the-shelf laser dyes as donors and commercially available solar cell dyes as acceptors.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2712], "author_name_tesi": "Basham, James Ian", "last_name_ssi": "Basham", "middle_name_ssi": "Ian", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Kenneth Breakall", "Thomas E Mallouk", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Qiming Zhang", "Suman Datta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Kenneth Breakall, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Chair", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member", "Suman Datta, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Forster", "DSSC", "Dye sensitized solar cell", "resonance energy transfer", "FRET"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Characterization of Clathrin-mediated Endocytosis in Plants and Its Influence on Cellulose Biosynthesis", "id": "27306", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11975", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Living cells internalize material from the cell surface using membranous vesicles in a process called endocytosis. The most common mechanism of endocytosis in eukaryotes is clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). In CME, many clathrin proteins, in association with numerous other adaptor and accessory proteins, assemble into a cage-like coat that induces the formation of clathrin-coated pits in the plasma membrane. These clathrin-coated pits develop into clathrin-coated membranous vesicles that are released from the plasma membrane into the interior of the cell. The material internalized by CME includes the lipids that comprise the plasma membrane, plasma membrane resident proteins, and other extracellular cargos such as nutrients and hormones. Therefore, CME is crucial to many cellular processes including the maintenance of membrane composition and integrity, the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, the perception and regulation of cell signaling, and the uptake of nutrients.\nCME is well characterized in some eukaryotes, such as yeast and mammals, in which many components of the CME machinery have been identified and functionally characterized. Comparatively, the study of CME in plants is in its infancy. The research presented in this dissertation has provided insight into the general CME process in plants, which is similar to CME in other eukaryotes in some regards, but also distinct in many ways. For example, like in yeast and mammals, plants possess a heterotetrameric adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex, which acts as a core component of CME by interacting with the plasma membrane and recruiting clathrin and specific cargo proteins to the sites of CME. The research presented in Chapters 2 and 3 aided in the original characterization of the AP2 complex in plants. Recent findings show that plants also possess additional CME components that do not exist in yeast or mammals, which could represent the remnants of evolutionarily ancient trafficking machinery. The research presented in\niii\nChapter 4 explored the function of TWD40-2, a protein that plays a significant role in CME in plants but does not exist in yeast or mammals.\nSince CME is responsible for the internalization of a large variety of cargo proteins and molecules, CME influences many cellular processes, including the synthesis of the plant cell wall. A majority of the cell wall is comprised of polysaccharides in the form of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. Hemicellulose and pectin are synthesized in the intracellular Golgi apparatus and subsequently delivered to the plasma membrane via vesicular trafficking and discharged into the extracellular cell wall through exocytosis. In contrast, cellulose is synthesized and extruded directly into the cell wall by plasma membrane-resident enzyme complexes, the cellulose synthesis complexes (CSCs). The prerequisite that CSCs must be located at the plasma membrane to function emphasizes the importance of CSC delivery to the plasma membrane and CSC endocytosis from the plasma membrane. In Chapters 2 and 3, the cellulose synthase (CESA) proteins of the CSC were identified as cargos of the CME pathway. In Chapter 4, deficiencies in CME were shown to cause deficiency in the cellulose biosynthesis process by influencing the distribution and behavior of the plasma membrane-localized population of CSCs.\nInterestingly, without an analogous structure in yeast and mammals, CSCs represent a novel type of CME cargo. Distinct attributes of CSCs, including the localization of CSCs to distinct particles at the plasma membrane, have enabled CSCs to be used as helpful representative cargos of the plant CME pathway. The research presented in this dissertation could be of interest to a broad scientific audience, with implications in the understanding of general processes of the plant cell, such as CME and cellulose biosynthesis, as well as the dissection of specific questions that reside at the crossroads of these two processes.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11414], "author_name_tesi": "Bashline, Logan Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Bashline", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Logan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ying Gu", "Ying Gu", "Teh Hui Kao", "Lorraine C Santy", "Melissa Rolls", "Gabriele Brigitte Monshausen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ying Gu, Dissertation Advisor", "Ying Gu, Committee Chair", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Lorraine C Santy, Committee Member", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "Gabriele Brigitte Monshausen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["clathrin-mediated endocytosis", "trafficking", "cellulose", "cell wall", "Arabidopsis", "plants"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "CONTINUING TO SEARCH FOR THE MISSING HERITABILITY USING BIOLOGICALLY-INSPIRED AND DATA-DRIVEN APPROACHES", "id": "14970azo121", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14970", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been a commonly utilized technique in complex disease research for the identification of loci associated with common, polygenic traits. These studies have been influential in identifying hundreds of reproducible variants in many traits. However, for most complex traits, GWAS have only explained a portion of the genetic contribution, thus revealing the problem of \"missing heritability\", or unexplained genetic variance. The genetic underpinnings of these traits are likely influenced by multiple components including structural variants, rare sequence variants, epistatic interactions, gene-environment interactions, epigenetics, and even our phenotypic definition. A deeper understanding of the interplay between the genetic and phenotypic complexities of complex traits is needed to fully elucidate their intricate etiologies and ultimately progress toward more precise clinical care. The dissertation herein aims to continue the search for the missing heritability by concentrating on two components that were not addressed in common variant GWAS, and that have been implicated in elucidating additional trait variability and disease risk. The first is examining the role of rare sequence variants. To date, rare susceptibility loci have been inculpated in numerous multifactorial conditions providing compelling evidence that rare variants are involved in the genetic etiology of complex traits. However, due to low allelic frequencies, rare variant analyses are challenging and often suffer from a loss of statistical power. Further, few methods provide a comprehensive platform for robust rare variant analysis. Aims described in this dissertation address this challenge by evaluating select statistical tests appropriate for rare variants and integrating components of the promising tests to create a comprehensive rare variant analysis method for DNA sequence data. The second factor undertaken in this work is accurate phenotype characterization which is often muddled by the presence of phenotype or trait heterogeneity introduced by treating a multifactorial disease as a single phenotype. Heterogeneity can result in substantially decreased ability to detect a true association between a disease and a locus. This confounding factor is confronted with the evaluation and application of unsupervised machine learning approaches to rich phenotypic data extracted from electronic health records (EHRs) for the creation of homogeneous patient subsets with more consistent underlying factors contributing to disease. The methods employed in these aims have the potential to uncover new relationships between rare variants and complex traits, identify phenotypic patterns in clinical EHR-derived data, unveil important biological complexities, and ultimately assess individual disease susceptibility.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16336], "author_name_tesi": "Basile, Anna Okula", "last_name_ssi": "Basile", "middle_name_ssi": "Okula", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie", "Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie", "Santhosh Girirajan", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "George H Perry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie, Dissertation Advisor", "Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie, Committee Chair", "Santhosh Girirajan, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "George H Perry, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["human genetics", "complex disease", "machine learning", "informatics", "pattern recognition", "rare variants", "missing heritability"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Inviscid Wind-Turbine Analysis Using Distributed Vorticity Elements\n\n", "id": "11294", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "684", "abstract_tesi": "With the recent push for green energy technologies by governments around the world, interest in wind energy has skyrocketed.  From 2006 to 2009 worldwide wind power production has doubled.  To continue the pace of wind-turbine innovation, more advanced design and analysis methods are needed.  The primary tool currently used for wind-turbine design is the blade element momentum method, which lacks a detailed wake model and relies on an assumption of non-interacting streamtubes.  These simplifications limit the designer\u2019s ability to tailor the blade shape to minimize the induced power loss of the rotor.  Improved prediction of the induced velocity distribution on the blades can be achieved through the use of potential flow models.  This thesis presents the implementation of one such model featuring the use of distributed vorticity elements.  Distributed vorticity elements are quadrilateral elements with vortex filaments of equal and opposite strength along their leading and trailing edges connected by a sheet of distributed vorticity.  The circulation of the filaments varies quadratically with the local spanwise coordinate, while the strength of the sheet varies linearly.  Both the rotor and its wake are paneled using these elements.  Because the wake has a strong influence on the flow at the rotor, the accurate prediction of its geometry is highly important.  To this end a force-free relaxed wake model is presented, as well as fixed wake and hybrid wake models that are less numerically intensive than the relaxed wake model.  Comparison is made to Goldstein\u2019s theoretical solution for the ideal lightly-loaded rotor, as well as to the blade element momentum method.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [679], "author_name_tesi": "Basom, Blair J.", "last_name_ssi": "Basom", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Blair", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark David Maughmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark David Maughmer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["wind turbine", "horizontal axis", "vortex lattice", "wake modeling", "relaxed wake", "inviscid analysis", "prescribed wake", "Goldstein rotor"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Boarding Schools and Capital Benefits: A Comparative Analysis of Student Experience in North American and South African Schools\n", "id": "7804", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3838", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\tThis dissertation is a comparative study of two boarding schools and the prevalence and impact of Bourdieu\u2019s (1977, 1983, 1986) capital benefits (economic, social, cultural, and educational) at the study schools. In a time when alternative approaches to schooling are so prevalent, this researcher seeks to explore Bourdieu\u2019s capital theories and their impact on student learning in boarding schools. According to this theory, students who are rich in social and cultural capital will perform better, winning them more education capital. Further, wealthier students have a monopoly on the type or quality of social and cultural capital that leads to successful academic performance. They enjoy the separation allowed by differences in social economic status and strive to maintain separation. According to Bourdieu (1983, 1986), those who hold the power in societies design economic and social systems that support their own value systems and attributes. These \u2018designs\u2019 keep people without economic capital out, protecting their position of advantage.  \n\tIn this study, the environment of two boarding schools: Douglas  in the United States, and Bailey  in South Africa will be studied and compared to determine to what extent they increase students\u2019 social, cultural, and education capital (Bourdieu, 1977, 1993, 1996).

Mothers, fathers, and their 6-month old male and female infants (N = 164) took part in the Still Face Paradigm. Parents provided self-report of marital satisfaction, depressive symptoms, and parenting stress. Results suggest that synchrony and flexibility represent related but independent constructs. Flexibility and synchrony were associated with parent and infant affect in the interaction; results differed slightly depending on the interactional context (mother/father, face-to-face/reunion). Mother-infant flexibility in the reunion episode was related to maternal depressive symptoms and report of parenting stress. Maternal positive affect in the reunion interaction was associated with maternal report of marital satisfaction; whereas infant negative affect expressed in father-child reunion interactions was associated with paternal marital satisfaction.

His personalized worldview evolved from endless study of diverse religious and philosophical texts, an endeavor justified only by his insatiable desire for truth in a world where it evaded him. Various components of this synthetic worldview are realized and expressed in Mahler\u2019s prolific symphonic output, the earliest and most spiritually charged of which is the \u201cResurrection\u201d Symphony completed in 1894. Mahler\u2019s eschatological statement of this symphony is profound and revolutionary: life after death without final judgment. This thesis examines the various religious and spiritual influences that contributed to form Mahler\u2019s idiosyncratic vision of the afterlife in his \u201cResurrection\u201d Symphony. \nThe three belief systems assessed by chapter are Reform Judaism, Christianity, and the mystical writings of Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887). Of the first two, Reform Judaism has been nearly neglected in Mahler scholarship while Christianity is often superficially imposed without careful consideration. Chapter 1 aims to investigate this overlooked role of Reform Judaism in both Mahler\u2019s early life and therefore his music, while Chapter 2 seeks to remove dogmatic Christian beliefs that have become tethered to the composer and his Second Symphony. Ultimately, Mahler rejects both of these religions for they failed to ease his persistent metaphysical agony. Chapter 3 explores the ideas of Fechner as one philosophical anecdote to this spiritual void, beliefs which are realized in the climactic statement of the \u201cResurrection\u201d Symphony.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14180], "author_name_tesi": "Bassett, Ryan M", "last_name_ssi": "Bassett", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Musicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Youmans", "Maureen Carr", "Marica Tacconi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Youmans, Thesis Advisor", "Maureen Carr, Committee Member", "Marica Tacconi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gustav Mahler", "Spirituality", "Reform Judaism", "Christianity", "Gustav Theodor Fechner", "The Second Symphony", "The \"Resurrection\" Symphony"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Dielectric and piezoelectric nonlinearities in oriented PYbN-PT thin films\n\n", "id": "6780", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4789", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work provides a comprehensive study of the ac field amplitude dependence of the dielectric constant, quantifying the extrinsic contributions of the domain walls and phase boundaries in two different orientations of PYbN-PT thin films. From the Rayleigh parameters obtained it was determined that {100} films had a higher concentration of mobile interfaces. The Rayleigh parameters decreased logarithmically with frequency. Comparison of the irreversible Rayleigh parameters\u2019 dependence on frequency confirmed a higher concentration of mobile interfaces in {100} oriented PYbN-PT thin films. Frequency dependent Rayleigh parameters were used successfully to predict the dielectric permittivity of the films over a range of three orders of magnitude for frequency and one order of magnitude of field amplitude. Biaxial strain fields were applied and the nonlinear behavior was measured. It was found that for both orientations of the films, 180\u00b0 domain wall motion was the major source of dielectric nonlinearity. The temperature dependence of the nonlinear behavior showed a reduction of both Rayleigh parameters at decreasing temperatures, indicating a reduction of the mobility of the interfaces. As the temperature increased towards the Curie temperature, the Rayleigh parameters showed a net increase in the reversible Rayleigh parameters and a much smaller increase in the irreversible Rayleigh parameter, indicating higher reversible mobility of the interfaces.  The piezoelectric Rayleigh parameters also showed logarithmic dependence on frequency and a higher concentration of mobile interfaces in {100} oriented films.  \nElectric field dependent dielectric and piezoelectric nonlinearities showed comparable amounts of extrinsic contributions to the nonlinear response, under the same applied bias field levels. A normalized frequency dependence of the Rayleigh parameters showed comparable trends for init\u00e5 and initd, and \u00e5\u00e1 and d\u00e1, indicating similar phenomena are responsible for the dielectric and piezoelectric nonlinearities. In the literature, only ferroelastic non-180\u00b0 domain walls are considered to contribute to the piezoelectric effect. However in many ferroelectric films, their mobility is considerably reduced. A dynamic poling model is proposed, allowing a largely reversible 180\u00b0 domain wall motion contribution to the piezoelectric nonlinearity. This model predicts a Rayleigh-like behavior of the piezoelectric coefficient with electric field, accompanied by the creation of a second order harmonic of strain. Experimental measurements of the higher order harmonics of polarization and strain confirmed the model\u2019s predictions.  Measurement of the fe,31 piezoelectric coefficients as a function of increasing ac strain levels didn\u2019t show piezoelectric nonlinearities. Ferroelectric 180\u00b0 domain wall motion, in fact, can\u2019t be activated by application of homogeneous strain fields. The second order harmonic of the piezoelectric response proved to be at least one order of magnitude smaller than the first and third order harmonics. The observation of a Rayleigh behavior in fd,33along with a strong second harmonic in the strain response for electric field drive, coupled with the lack of the amplitude dependence for a strain excitation is consistent with the dynamic poling model. It was therefore demonstrated that piezoelectric nonlinearity can appear in thin films even in cases where only 180\u00b0 domain wall motion is operative. This mechanism will be important in any ferroelectric with large-scale, nearly reversible motion of domain walls (tilted hysteresis loops).", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4766], "author_name_tesi": "Bassiri Gharb, Nazanin ", "last_name_ssi": "Bassiri Gharb", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nazanin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Thomas R Shrout", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Dragan Damjanovic"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Thomas R Shrout, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Dragan Damjanovic, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ferroelectric", "thin film", "nonlinearities", "extrinsic contributions", "domain walls"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Multiple Criteria Decision Engineering to Support Management in Military Healthcare and Logistics Operations", "id": "27547", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11883", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System (MHS) is a unique health system in that it recruits and trains its own medical staff, has a generally physically fit patient population, and is a closed, single-payer system. The unique mission of the MHS comes with its own set of healthcare and logistics challenges above and beyond those of a civilian US-based health system.  At the surface, the MHS is charged with delivering quality healthcare to a diverse population. At the core, however, that charge includes maintaining peacetime healthcare delivery capacity while ensuring the deployment readiness of the active force, and deploying, establishing and running forward deployed healthcare facilities to provide the necessary health services support for combat, stability, peacekeeping, and humanitarian assistance operations. Further complicating the delivery of quality care is the transient nature of healthcare providers either due to deployments or routine personnel moves between hospitals, clinics, and field units.\n\nDue to the complexity of the MHS, effective management of healthcare resources and logistics is paramount. This is also important to senior military leaders since many real-world decision problems in the MHS exhibit the presence of multiple, conflicting objectives for judging alternatives, as well as the need for making compromises or trade-offs regarding the outcomes of alternate courses of action. Further, most of these same resource allocation decision problems are faced under inherent, underlying uncertainties.\n\nAs a result of these challenges, this doctoral dissertation employs methods of multiple criteria decision engineering to assist strategic decision-making and to support the complex planning and management of military healthcare resources, personnel, logistics, and financial incentives. The primary motivation is the requirement to provide data-driven, managerial decision support for decision problems in: 1) resource allocation and performance within the military hospital network, 2) military medical workforce planning and future force structure, 3) supply chain network design for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief aerial delivery operations, and 4) effectiveness of healthcare financial incentives on hospital efficiency. \n\nMulti-criteria and stochastic optimization models that leverage mixed-integer programming, Monte Carlo simulation, discrete event simulation, text mining, clustering analysis, regression modeling and econometrics are developed to provide critical insights for military decision-makers. The multiple criteria decision engineering methods in this dissertation are applied to several real-world decision problems within military healthcare and logistics operations to illustrate the impact and relevance of the results.\n\nFirst, we proffer the Multi-Objective Auto-Optimization Model (MAOM) -- a resource allocation-based optimization model that adjusts resources (system inputs) automatically -- which provides decision-makers with a decision-support tool for re-allocating resources in large health systems that are centrally controlled and funded, such as the MHS. The necessity to efficiently balance and re-allocate system resources among hospitals in a hospital network is paramount, especially as health systems experience increasing demand and costs for health services. In these systems, inputs are fixed at certain levels and may only be adjusted within medical treatment facilities, while outputs must be maintained.\n \nSecond, we proffer the Objective Force Model (OFM), a deterministic, mixed-integer linear weighted goal programming model to optimize workforce planning for the U.S. Army Medical Department (AMEDD) Personnel Proponency Directorate (APPD). We also develop two stochastic variants of the linear OFM, which incorporate probabilistic components associated with uncertain officer continuation rates. We employ a discrete event simulation model to verify and validate the results. These models allow for better transparency of personnel for both the senior AMEDD decision-makers and the health services human resource planners at APPD, while effectively projecting the manpower structure that provides the appropriate skill levels (by grade) to meet the demands of the current workforce structure. \n\nThird, we develop a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework to optimize the military humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR) aerial delivery supply chain network under uncertainty. The model uses stochastic, mixed-integer, weighted goal programming to optimize network design, logistics costs, staging locations, procurement amounts, and inventory levels. The MCDA framework enables decision-makers to explore the trade-offs between military HA/DR aerial delivery supply chain efficiency and responsiveness, while optimizing across a wide range of real-world, probabilistic scenarios to account for the inherent uncertainty in the location of global humanitarian disasters, as well as the amount of demand to be met.\n\nFourth, we propose the Fuzzy Multi-Objective Auto-Optimization Model (FMAOM), an optimization model with fuzzy constraints that can be used for automatic resource re-allocation with respect to different levels of risk preferences. The efficient use of resources in health systems is crucial mostly due to the increasing demand and limited funding. The implications of the proposed fuzzy decision-making model for healthcare decision-makers and its relevance to healthcare policy and management are discussed.\n\nFifth, we measure the effect of a monetary incentive model on hospital efficiency and outcomes. The Army component of the MHS implemented a pay-for-performance financial incentive program in 2007 in an effort to stimulate patient quality, access, and satisfaction improvements. Using a retrospective, quasi-experimental design, the empirical analysis incorporates data envelopment analysis (DEA) with time windows and difference-in-differences estimation. Hospitals are evaluated in the U.S. Army, Air Force, and Navy during the period of 2001--2012. The results indicate a statistically significant reduction in efficiency for the hospitals that received financial incentives. The health policy implications of this study are applicable in light of the national healthcare debate and may assist healthcare policy-makers in determining the efficacy and associated trade-offs of pay-for-performance financing models.\n\nLast, we introduce the Stochastic Multi-Objective Auto-Optimization Model (SMAOM) for resource allocation decision-making under uncertainty in the MHS. The model can automatically identify where to re-allocate system input resources at the hospital level in order to optimize overall system performance, while considering uncertainty in the model parameters. The usefulness of the proposed model is illustrated by a computational experiment in which a traditional DEA model is compared to the proposed SMAOM for 128 hospitals in the three services (Air Force, Navy, Army) in the MHS using hospital-level data from 2009 - 2013. The application of SMAOM to the MHS increases the expected system-wide technical efficiency by 18% over the DEA model while also accounting for uncertainty of health system inputs and outputs. \n\nIn summary, the multiple criteria decision engineering models described in this dissertation focus on supporting the management of scarce military health system resources, military workforce planning and force structure, military humanitarian logistics network design, and military healthcare financial incentives. The challenge, however, remains in careful and continual coordination with senior MHS decision-makers and hospital managers so that models proffered here are used effectively as decision support tools.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11336], "author_name_tesi": "Bastian, Nathaniel Drew", "last_name_ssi": "Bastian", "middle_name_ssi": "Drew", "first_name_ssi": "Nathaniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul M Griffin", "Harriet Black Nembhard", "Paul M Griffin", "Harriet Black Nembhard", "Soundar Kumara", "Terry Paul Harrison", "Lawrence V Fulton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul M Griffin, Dissertation Advisor", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul M Griffin, Committee Chair", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Soundar Kumara, Committee Member", "Terry Paul Harrison, Committee Member", "Lawrence V Fulton, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multi-criteria decision engineering", "resource allocation under uncertainty", "performance measurement", "healthcare", "logistics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Structural and functional characterization of the transcription factor Pdx1 and its interactions with DNA and proteins", "id": "26176", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11530", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Homeobox proteins are vital DNA-binding transcription factors that control the spatial and temporal expression of cells and tissue during early development. These proteins are necessary for other biological processes, including the activation of genes. The DNA-binding homeodomain motif of homeobox proteins bind sequence specifically to double stranded DNA containing the core binding site (5\u00b4-TAAT-3\u00b4), achieving high specificity in vivo. Our current understanding of the mechanism by which these transcription factors recognize their cognate sites is not clear. Moreover, the homeodomain motif is often a small domain within a larger polypeptide chain tethered to intrinsically disordered domains at one or both termini. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play a vital role in maintaining cellular functions. The homeobox transcription factor, Pdx1 is an IDP, important for maintaining proper function of the pancreas and \u03b2-cells by recognizing A-box elements (TA-rich sequences containing a 5\u00b4-TAAT-3\u00b4 core site). The overarching goal of this dissertation was to further the understanding of the mechanism by which homeobox proteins recognize their target sites and bind with high specificity, as well as illuminate the structural and functional role of the disordered C-terminus of Pdx1. \nUsing isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), it was shown that the homeodomain (HD) of Pdx1 exhibited varying binding affinities for promoter-derived (islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) and insulin) and consensus-derived DNA sequences indicating nucleotide sequence discrimination in the flanking regions. The calorimetric data demonstrated that Pdx1 preferentially bound sequence specific insulin elements containing a pentameric DNA sequence (5\u00b4-CTAAT-3\u00b4) rather than IAPP elements encompassing a 5\u00b4-TTAAT-3\u00b4 sequence. Furthermore, binding studies of the HD with a panel of consensus-derived mutants demonstrate a slight preference for an insulin-like 5\u00b4-CTAAT-3\u00b4 sequence over an IAPP-like 5\u00b4-TTAAT-3\u00b4 sequence based on a combination of a tighter binding constant and a more favorable binding enthalpy. Molecular dynamics simulations further showed a strictly conserved arginine has preference for the pentanucleotide sequence 5\u00b4-CTAAT-3\u00b4 rather than 5\u00b4-TTAAT-3\u00b4, due to a more electronegative binding pocket. To determine the residue(s) involved in sequence specificity upstream from the core site and understand the role of residues in the C-terminus in DNA-binding, a slightly longer homeomdomain construct (HDx) was studied using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ITC. The construct was much more stable than the HD construct, which was likely a result of the increased stability of helix 3 as evidenced in the NMR data. Using ITC, the binding affinities of HDx to a panel of DNA were in the low nanomolar range and tighter than the HD affinities to the same panel of sequences. In an attempt to identify the residues responsible for imparting specificity upstream from the core site, a mutational analysis with HDx was carried out. Neither mutations resulted in decreased specificity; however, one mutation contributed slightly to the binding enthalpy.  \nMany folded proteins contain regions that are random coil in structure or form transient secondary structures, which are important for cell signaling, molecular recognition, and transcription. The non-homeodomain regions of Pdx1, which make up a large portion of the protein, are predicted to be disordered based on the amino acid sequence. However, there is no concrete evidence to suggest whether the non-homeodomain regions of Pdx1 are truly unstructured or whether they adopt residual structure. The NMR data of the Pdx1 C-terminus shows that this region adopts random coil structure in solution. Biologically, the plasticity of the intrinsically disordered regions is utilized as a probe to weakly associate with multiple binding partners. One such partner for Pdx1 is SPOP, which is involved in mediating the interaction between an ubiquitin ligase complex and its substrate. Calorimetric data and NMR demonstrated a direct binding interaction and identification of the SPOP binding regions of Pdx1 by NMR.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11038], "author_name_tesi": "Bastidas, Monique ", "last_name_ssi": "Bastidas", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Monique", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott A Showalter", "Philip C.

This thesis examines how small town communities within the Rust Belt can approach revitalization in a manner that values their industrial heritage.  Throughout the years, these towns have experienced both functional and physical erosion as a result of the economic changes consequent to the decline of industrial production.  These manufacturing locations once offered an ideal setting and much-needed resources that set the stage for industrial forces to shape and reshape the urban fabric of the Rust Belt.\n\nIn the Rust Belt, specifically along the Monongahela River Valley, industrialization was once a modern concept that represented technological advances and a means of economic progress.  The manufacturing industries that succeeded did so through strong ties to their respective communities.  This process ultimately created an industrial character that remains steadfast even through altered architectural environments and landscapes.  Unfortunately, the towns that once depended on manufacturing industries for a prosperous livelihood are now struggling in the wake of ongoing industrial decline and ever-increasing departure.  Their remaining industrial heritage is often a dormant concept conceived by once thriving mills and factories, telling a myriad of invaluable stories which can be viewed and judged from multiple perspectives.\n\nUnderstanding the value of industrial heritage provides a new viewpoint from which to evaluate a community\u2019s local characteristics.  From this perspective an Industrial Heritage Mechanism (IHM) was created to evaluate existing local industrial heritage assets of small Mon Valley towns.  The mechanism makes use of a streamlined insight into industrial heritage that was developed in the form of specific categories.  These defined industrial heritage categories break down the resource in terms of geographic advantages, business clusters, institutions, and unique amenities.  The IHM categories define industrial heritage from multiple perspectives allowing a strong basis from which to create town specific assessment profiles.  The assessment of small towns through the IHM enables the identification of important industrial heritage features possessing the ability to play a major role in revitalization efforts.  \n\nThis new approach of considering struggling small towns through the lens of industrial heritage is evident at the chosen Mon Valley case study sites of Braddock, Monessen, and Brownsville.  The Industrial Heritage Mechanism was formulated to gauge the local assets of these locations and link the complex perception of industrial heritage in concert with town assessments.

They are alkaline suspensions containing high fines (particles < 44 \u03bcm) content. Dewatering and consolidation of MFTs are important for both recycle of water to the oil extraction units and reclamation of clay. However, those are difficult to achieve by sedimentation alone due to low hydraulic conductivity of the tailings. In this dissertation, we have looked at how different surface phenomena like colloidal destabilization and electrokinetic transport mechanisms can bring about water separation in MFTs.\nSuppression of charges on a colloidal particle electrostatically to allow aggregation has always been a popular means of dewatering the tailings. In this study, we used several versions of a commercial coagulant with non-ionic and anionic polymeric flocculants to treat three different extraction tailings obtained from the respective resources. The polymers were tested for their ability to flocculate the tailings by zeta potential and floc size measurements.\nDiffusiophoresis is a well-understood flow mechanism that can produce micro-flows even in the inaccessible micro and nano-channels present in a porous medium, for e.g. the concentrated tailings deposits. In our system of MFTs, we observed that flows induced by ionic gradients due to dissolution of inorganic salts like calcium carbonate aid dewatering by a phenomenon called diffusioosmosis. The role of such flows in enhanced dewatering of MFTs is explored in this study in great detail.\nThus, the above methods, though governed by different scientific mechanisms, are primarily dependent on the surface charge of the tailings. Although, the results presented here may not give a direct comparison between the dewatering efficiencies for each of these studied methods, but can definitely help us appreciate the fact that both of them can simultaneously be utilized towards achieving better water separation from the tailings and therefore improved consolidation of clay sediments.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8564], "author_name_tesi": "Basu, Anwesha ", "last_name_ssi": "Basu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anwesha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell Velegol, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["mature fine tailings", "dewatering", "destabilization", "diffusioosmosis", "layering and consolidation."]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "GENETIC, PHYSIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION OF ROOT PLAGIOGRAVITROPISM\n\n", "id": "7045", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5036", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Basal roots together with the primary root forms the scaffolding of the root system architecture of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) which responds to gravity in concert with various environmental cues like phosphorus and hormonal signals such as ethylene and auxin. Basal roots are a type of secondary roots resembling adventitious roots, and they arise from tissue with shoot anatomy. They appear in tetrarch pattern like adventitious and lateral roots. The basal roots emerge from two-three distinct whorls from a one-centimeter region at the root-shoot interface and exhibit plagiogravitropic growth which changes over time. Gravitropic growth of roots determines the three-dimensional root architecture which is essential for efficient acquisition of soil resources. The growth angle of basal roots is a primary determinant of the roots which impacts efficient acquisition of limited and immobile nutrients like phosphorus. Genotypes of common bean vary substantially in the growth angle of basal roots and by altering growth angles the plants are better adapted to low phosphorus availability. Shallow basal roots not only aid in topsoil exploration but also reduce intra and interplant competition for phosphorus. \nSince ethylene has been implicated in both gravitropic and edaphic stress, we studied the role of ethylene and its interaction with phosphorus availability in regulating growth angles of basal roots. We measured endogenous ethylene production from the basal roots and also analyzed the response of basal roots to exogenous application of ethylene in terms of growth angle and root growth. In addition, we developed a new image analysis program \u2018KineRoot\u2019 to study the spatio-temporal patterns of plagiogravitropic growth of basal roots in response to ethylene and phosphorus treatments in a reliable semi-automated way, while minimizing user intervention.  The new software allows us to measure the local patterns of basal root growth and graviresponding zones of basal roots and how these zones are affected by ethylene and phosphorus availability. Moreover, the software enables us to measure the root diameter and root midline which was used in calculating root curvature. Since from the available literature we already know that auxin and ethylene are potential candidates regulating graviresponse of roots, we studied the possible cross-talk between auxin and ethylene in modulating graviresponse of basal roots. To test the hypothesis that ethylene modulates auxin effect on root growth and plagiogravitropic curvature of basal roots, we employed both parental genotypes and recombinant inbred lines of common bean with contrasting basal roots traits for this study. Response of basal root angle and root growth to different doses of auxin was measured. In addition, we examine the effect of application of ethylene action inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene (MCP) and ethylene synthesis inhibitor aminovinylglycine (AVG) on growth angle and root growth in the presence of phosphorus. Free Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content in the basal roots was analyzed and in a separate experiment the basal roots were treated with tritiated IAA to determine the transport of 3H-IAA in the basal roots of different whorls. \nOur work shows that position of origin i.e. whorl has more influence on growth angle of basal roots than previously reported effects of genotype and phosphorus availability. Genotypes of common bean vary in basal root number in each whorl. The diversity in root architecture is generated partly by variation in basal root number as well as variation in growth angles of basal roots. Although endogenous ethylene production from the basal roots did not explain variation in growth angles, tissue sensitivity to exogenous ethylene application appears to be more important in determining the growth angle. Our results show that there is a strong correlation between ethylene sensitivity and growth angle which supports our hypothesis that growth of basal roots may be partially regulated by ethylene and the difference in ethylene sensitivity might explain variation in growth angle with whorl, genotype and phosphorus availability. Basal root growth was also affected by ethylene treatment; however, higher sensitivity for root elongation was not found consistently in all treatments. Our results indicate that ethylene may be a modifier of root responses to nutrient availability and ethylene perception may be a central aspect of root response to low phosphorus availability. \nThe kinematic analysis shows that the basal roots accelerate growth rate of the upper whorls at the cost of lower growth rate in lower whorls in response to low phosphorus. Moreover, study of spatio-temporal patterns of differential growth ratio of the growing root allows identification and measurement of root bending zones and bending amount. We examine the effects of ethylene and MCP on root curvature and observe that both of these treatments do not alter local root curvature, but alters the span and duration of the bending of the root upward or downward and thereby produce shallow and deep roots respectively. \nOur study about the possible interaction of auxin and ethylene supports the hypothesis that the effect of interaction between auxin and ethylene on regulation of growth angles is dependent on phosphorus availability. Free IAA analysis in the basal roots show that lower whorls of basal roots have higher free auxin and are more sensitive to auxin inhibition of basal root growth compared to upper whorls. However, radiolabeled IAA treatment to the root-shoot junction just above the basal rooting zone shows more radiolabeled IAA transported to upper whorls than lower whorls. In addition while application of AVG or MCP together with IAA increases root growth and reduces shallowness in phosphorus sufficient conditions, AVG or MCP do not reverse IAA-inhibition of growth in low phosphorus. These results point to a phosphorus dependent interaction between ethylene and auxin in regulation of root elongation, but a phosphorus-independent interaction for control of growth angle. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5012], "author_name_tesi": "Basu, Paramita ", "last_name_ssi": "Basu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Paramita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paula Mc Steen", "Simon Gilroy", "Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Kathleen Marie Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paula Mc Steen, Committee Member", "Simon Gilroy, Committee Member", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Member", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Growth Angle", "Basal root", "Kinematics", "Root", "Bean", "Auxin", "Phosphorus", "Ethylene", "Hormones"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Essays in Information Economics", "id": "14316pub143", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14316", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of three chapters. The chapters study issues pertaining to  optimal use of information under memory constraints, boundedly rational learning, belief updating after events of surprise (zero-probability) and scenarios of persuasion involving strategic design of information\n\nIn Chapter 1, we study the process of decision-making and inference by a single, boundedly rational, economic agent. The agent chooses either a safe or a risky alternative in each period after receiving a signal about the state of the world in that period. The state of the world is changing according to a Markov process with some degree of persistence across time. The agent's decision rule is expressed as a finite-state automaton with a fixed number of memory states. Updating on the basis of the received signal is, for such an agent, making a transition from one state to another. The finiteness of the number of automaton states automatically suggests that beliefs are classified into categories and a signal causes a (possible) change in the category on the basis of which the next action is taken. The problem is one in partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). We characterise the structure of the optimal decision rule in this setting and show how its properties pin down the categories of beliefs and explain some observed, seemingly irrational behaviour. We then specialise to a fixed state of the world, weaken the optimality requirement to admissibility and derive the staircase structure of the admissible automaton. Finally we examine the question of randomisation in the design of an automaton, propose a measure of the extent of such randomisation and show that there exists a minimal degree of randomisation for the set of automata implementing a given strategy. We show that if the number of signals is large, virtually no randomisation is required. \n\nIn Chapter 2, we study the problem of updating beliefs by interpreting it as a choice problem (selecting a posterior from a set of admissible posteriors) with a reference point (prior). We use AGM belief revision to define the support of admissible posteriors after observing zero probability events and investigate two classes of updating rules for probabilities : 1) \"minimum distance\" updating rules which select the posterior closest to the prior by some metric. 2) \"lexicographic\" updating rules where posteriors are given by a lexicographic probability system. For the former, we show bayesian updating as a special case and for specific AGM belief revisions, provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a minimum distance representation. For the latter, we show that an updating rule is lexicographic if and only if it is bayesian, AGM-consistent and satisfies a weak form of path independence. Lastly, we study a sub-class of lexicographic updating rules, which we call \"support-dependent\" rules. We show that such updating rules have a minimum distance representation. \n\nIn Chapter 3, we study a dynamic Bayesian persuasion framework in a finite horizon setting consisting of a Seller and a Buyer. The Seller wishes to persuade the Buyer to buy a durable good at a given price by providing information about its relevance (match quality). The Buyer has private information about his valuation for a good match and we study optimal dynamic information policies employed by the Seller in equilibrium. For a fixed horizon, we show that the Seller always provides signals which truthfully convey a good match but may garble a bad one. Moreover, if the good is not bought in the first stage, the Seller provides information which improves over time. The agents always interact for a fixed amount of time within which a purchase decision is made. The length of this interaction remains fixed even for long horizons and depends only on the prior on the Buyer's valuation. As the horizon goes to infinity, the bulk of the information about match quality is provided in the first period. This allows the Buyer to extract a large amount of information from the Seller at the beginning of their interaction. Even a slight probability of the Buyer being difficult to convince facilitates close to full disclosure immediately.

Nucleotidyl transferases, including DNA and RNA polymerases (DNAP and RNAP) utilize the two-metal catalysis mechanism. However the temporal order of events in the reaction mechanism is not fully understood. Studies so far are based on predictions from biochemical studies and X-ray structural snapshots obtained with the use of non-reactive substrate analogues. This thesis presents a novel time-resolved X-ray crystallography approach to monitor the enzyme motions through high-resolution crystal structures. A soak-trigger freeze X-ray crystallography technique provides an atomic resolution movie of the active site events during the natural course of nucleotidyl-transfer reaction catalyzed by bacteriophage N4 mini-vRNAP. The structures are the first direct evidence of the temporal order of substrate assembly and metal co-factor binding at the active site of single-unit polymerases. The work reveals that the nucleotide substrates bind the active site along with MeB (nucleotide binding metal) and the catalytic metal (MeA) coordination is only temporary, established just before and dissociated immediately after phosphodiester bond formation. \n\nTo expand the mechanistic studies to cellular multisubunit RNAPs, X-ray crystal structures of transcription initiation complexes from bacteria Thermus thermophilus, have been presented. Bacterial RNAP binds to initiation factor \u03c3, forming the holoenzyme, which is capable of recognizing and binding to promoter DNA, leading to a transcription-ready open complex formation. The holoenzyme initiates RNA synthesis de novo, the only step during transcription where RNAP accepts two nucleotide substrates and performs primer-independent phosphodiester bond formation. The molecular mechanism of preorganization of the RNAP holoenzyme-promoter DNA complex in bacteria has been well studied, but there is no direct evidence for the mechanism of de novo initiation. I solved a structure of a de novo initiation complex that provides the first structural basis for the stable binding of the initiation nucleotide. The structure shows base stacking interactions between the DNA template at -1 position and the incoming nucleotide at +1, which explains the sequence preference of purine-pyrimidine for the -1 and +1 template positions of many RNAP promoters. Further, I solved the structure of a holoenzyme transcription complex containing a 6-mer transcript that was synthesized in crystallo. The structure demonstrates an early step of \u03c3 ejection from the RNAP core enzyme when transitioning to a stable transcription elongation complex. The structure shows that the RNA 5\u2032-triphosphate end reaches the \u03c3 region of 3.2 causing it to be disordered, suggesting that 6-mer RNA transcription is a first step in this transition.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9357], "author_name_tesi": "Basu, Ritwika ", "last_name_ssi": "Basu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ritwika", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katsuhiko Murakami", "Katsuhiko Murakami", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Paul Lee Babitzke", "Andrey S Krasilnikov", "Scott A Showalter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katsuhiko Murakami, Dissertation Advisor", "Katsuhiko Murakami, Committee Chair", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Member", "Paul Lee Babitzke, Committee Member", "Andrey S Krasilnikov, Committee Member", "Scott A Showalter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["soak-trigger freeze X-ray crystallography", "nucleotidyl-transfer reaction", "RNA polymerase", "N4 bacteriophage", "Thermus thermophilus"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Model of Intuitionism based on Turing Degrees", "id": "19078", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8870", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Intuitionism is a constructive approach to mathematics introduced in the early part of the twetieth century by L.

The motivation for studying this model comes from the issuer-pays feature of many certification intermediary markets such as auditors and credit rating agencies. In financial markets, certification intermediaries like auditors and credit rating agencies acquire information about the financial health of a firm.  The information  these  intermediaries  provide  is  used  by  investors  in  order  to  mitigate information risks. This paper investigates whether in a litigation free world reputation concerns can lead to a socially efficient outcome, that is, whether reputation concerns can provide incentives for auditors to expend effort in order to produce high quality auditing. This paper also investigates whether competition among the auditors improves reputational incentives.Reputation of an auditor is modeled as the market belief about his informativeness, which is exogenously given. There are two types of auditors, \u201cinformative\u201d and \u201cuninformative\u201d. In a monopoly set up, under imperfect monitoring, the informative auditor is diligent only for a low range of reputation. Gains from reputation shrink as the market becomes almost convinced about the auditor's type which leads to a continuum of threshold equilibria. The desired \"high effort\" equilibrium, which is also socially efficient, occurs only under the restrictive assumption of perfect monitoring. Comparing a duopoly and a monopoly model, I show that the range of reputation for which diligence can be sustained (when cost of diligence is small) is larger under monopoly. Reputation incentives are further weakened in a duopoly set up when firms have private information about the quality of their projects.\n\n\nThe second chapter \u201cCompetition: Boon or Bane for Reputation Building Behavior\u201d is a joint work with Yu Awaya.  This paper  investigates  whether  competition  aids  or  hinders  reputation  building behavior in experience goods markets. We examine a market where long lived firms face a short term incentive to put low effort. There are two types of firms, \u201cgood\u201d firms to whom high effort is costless and \u201copportunistic\u201d firms who have to pay a small cost for high effort. We characterize the equilibrium strategies of a monopolist and a duopolist for a two period model. Contrary to the prevalent idea that competition improves reputation-building behavior we find that competition may hinder reputation building behavior by shrinking expected future payoffs. Horner (2002) talks about a perfectly competitive market and emphasizes the importance of outside options generated through competition. Our model on the other hand compares a duopoly model with a monopoly model in an environment of price competition. This paper focuses on how competition shrinks expected future payoff and reduces reputation incentives. We also examine the case where a planner can observe the hired firm's type and can dictate the chosen firm's actions. We show under such circumstances the duopolist's choice of effort always coincides with or falls below the effort level the planner prescribes. \n\n\nThe third chapter \u201cInformal Insurance and Group Size Under Individual Liability Loans\u201d is a joint work with Souvik Dutta. There has been a recent shift from joint liability to group loans with individual liability by the Grameen Bank and some other prominent micro lending institutions across the world. Under the joint liability lending mechanism a group of individuals were given a loan and individuals in a group were jointly liable for the loan given. Under the new lending regime a group of individuals are given their individual shares of a group loan. Although they have to be in a group in order to have access to the loan, individuals are not liable for the loan of other members in the group. An individual is only liable for her share of the loan. Some recent field experiments observed no change in repayment rates with this regime change. This paper investigates the role of informal insurance among group members to explain the success of group lending with individual liability. We consider a model with finite number of players (villagers) who interact repeatedly. Each villager can invest in a project that can be a success or a failure. Villagers simultaneously obtain a loan from the microcredit organization (bank) at a fixed interest rate. The bank specifies a punishment function which is increasing and convex in the amount of loan not repaid.  Individuals have exogenous bilateral arrangements specifying the amount a successful individual transfers to an unsuccessful individual. The realization of output is private information and villagers pay back their loans in a public meeting. An individual\u2019s true outcome is revealed with a positive probability in the meeting. We consider a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium where players repay the entire amount to the bank and keep their promises if successful. We show that with informal insurance individual liability lending can lead to the same repayment rates as joint liability. However individuals\u2019 welfare is strictly lower under individual liability lending. In addition, this paper also sheds light on the optimal group size that villagers should maintain under the new lending mechanism.

During the PEFC assembly the flexible gas diffusion layer (GDL), either carbon paper or carbon cloth, is compressed for excellent electronic and thermal contact with bipolar plates. Therefore, it intrudes into the end gas channels (i.e. channels near the tightening bolts) and cause non-uniform distribution of reactants in the PEFC. This maldistribution of flow in parallel channels decreases the ability of the flow to carry away liquid water in the intruded channels. Therefore more liquid water is accumulated in these channels and even less flow goes through, resulting in severe flow maldistribution among parallel channels \nA one-dimensional analytical model based on multiphase-mixture formulation is developed in this thesis to elucidate the two-phase flow maldistribution in the cathode channels. The channels of dimensions on the order of 0.5-1 mm are considered as structured porous media. Relative humidity (RH) at the inlet and flow stoichiometry are found to be the two key parameters strongly influencing the flow maldistribution. Interestingly, our analysis shows that decreasing the inlet RH worsens flow maldistribution.\nThis model is then applied to a two-dimensional (extendable to three-dimension) numerical model for the cathode flow channels only. The effects of electrochemical reactions are considered in the model through uniform water injection along channels. This stand-alone channel model could simulate the liquid saturation distribution in the parallel channels as well as predict the two-phase pressure drop.\nThe stand-alone channel two-phase model is then integrated with a two-phase PEFC model previously developed in our laboratory. The predicted surface coverage by liquid water at the GDL-channel interface is validated against experimental results for a wide range of parameters showing excellent agreement. The anode channels are modeled using the same two-phase model, capturing the dry-wet-dry transition existing in the anode. The effect of reactant maldistribution in the gas channels is found to have important effect on the current density distribution, implying non-uniform catalyst utilization. Therefore it would almost certainly accelerate the aging of the PEFC, exacerbating the already existing low durability issue. Interestingly, the amounts of liquid water in anode and cathode channels are found to be of the same order for the whole range of parameters. \nAnother important physical phenomena occurring in a PEFC is liquid-vapor phase change, i.e. evaporation and condensation. To date, these phenomena have not been explored by the fuel cell community. In the present work, a two-phase, non-isothermal numerical model is used to elucidate the phase-change rate inside the cathode GDL of a PEFC. We could locate the major condensation and evaporation sites and quantify phase-change rate. Relative humidity at the inlet flow and thermal conductivity of the cathode GDL are found to have major influence on the rate of phase change. Condensation under the cooler land could be reduced substantially by decreasing the inlet relative humidity or increasing the GDL thermal conductivity. Inlet relative humidity effect is more pronounced near the inlet of the cell whereas the GDL thermal conductivity affects the phase change rate more uniformly throughout the flow length.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5917], "author_name_tesi": "Basu, Suman ", "last_name_ssi": "Basu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Channel Flow", "Phase Change", "Two-Phase flow", "PEFC"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Could Empathy Lead to Community Development?

Interpreting these atmospheric signals poses a new challenge to planetary science. In contrast to jovian-like atmospheres, whose bulk compositions consist of hydrogen and helium, terrestrial planet atmospheres are likely comprised of high mean molecular weight secondary atmospheres, which have gone through a high degree of evolution. For example, present-day Mars has a frozen surface with a thin tenuous atmosphere, but 4 billion years ago it may have been warmed by a thick greenhouse atmosphere. Several processes contribute to a planet's atmospheric evolution: stellar evolution, geological processes, atmospheric escape, biology, etc. Each of these individual processes affects the planetary system as a whole and therefore they all must be considered in the modeling of terrestrial planets.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the intricacies in modeling terrestrial planets, I use early Mars as a case study. I leverage a combination of one-dimensional climate, photochemical and energy balance models in order to create one self-consistent model that closely matches currently available climate data. One-dimensional models can address several processes: the influence of greenhouse gases on heating, the effect of the planet's geological processes (i.e. volcanoes and the carbonate-silicate cycle) on the atmosphere, the effect of rainfall on atmospheric composition and the stellar irradiance. After demonstrating the number of assumptions required to build a model, I look towards what exactly we can learn from remote observations of temperate Earths and Super Earths. \n\nHowever, unlike in-situ observations from our own solar system, remote sensing techniques need to be developed and understood in order to accurately characterize exo-atmospheres. I describe the models used to create synthetic transit transmission observations, which includes models of transit spectroscopy and instrumental noise. Using these, I lay the framework for an information content-based approach to optimize our observations and maximize the retrievable information from exo-atmospheres. First I test the method on observing strategies of the well-studied, low-mean-molecular weight atmospheres of warm-Neptunes and hot Jupiters. Upon verifying the methodology, I finally address optimal observing strategies for temperate, high-mean-molecular weight atmospheres (Earths/super-Earths).", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14873], "author_name_tesi": "Batalha, Natasha Elaine", "last_name_ssi": "Batalha", "middle_name_ssi": "Elaine", "first_name_ssi": "Natasha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Kasting", "Steinn Sigurdsson", "Jason Thomas Wright", "Eric B Ford", "Chris Eliot Forest"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Kasting, Dissertation Advisor", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Committee Chair", "Jason Thomas Wright, Committee Member", "Eric B Ford, Committee Member", "Chris Eliot Forest, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Exoplanets", "astrobiology", "planetary science", "James Webb space telescope", "spectroscopy", "atmospheric science", "transiting exoplanets", "information content theory", "atmospheric retrieval", "mars", "early mars", "energy balance model", "photochemical model", "climate model", "carbonate silicate cycle", "atmospheres"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Predictors of Working Alliance Efficacy Among State VR Counselors as a Function of Ex-offender Status\n", "id": "15562", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7946", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to determine if statistically significant relationships existed between burnout, stigma, flourishing, caseload size, experience, and working alliance self-efficacy and to assess the predictive power of these variables on levels of working alliance self-efficacy with clients with disabilities alone and clients with disabilities with criminal histories in state VR providers.

Paradoxically, cigarette smokers have exhibited little to no decrement in FEV1.  We hypothesized that smoking-induced changes in the epithelial lining layer, such as increased thickness or lower antioxidant capacity, may allow O3 to penetrate deeper into the lungs of smokers versus non-smokers, thereby reducing the conducting airway responsiveness. If O3 penetrates deeper longitudinally, O3 may alter markers of distal airway function in smokers, notably the normalized slope (SN) of the CO2 expirogram.  \n\nMETHODS:  We recruited 30 smokers (19M, 11F, 24 \u00b1 4 years, 6 \u00b1 4 total years smoking, 4 \u00b1 2 packs/wk) and 30 non-smokers (17M, 13F, 25 \u00b1 6 years) with clinically normal lung function, who had no history of respiratory or cardiovascular disease.  Volunteers participated in two research sessions where they exercised for one hour on a cycle ergometer while breathing either filtered air or 0.30 ppm O3 at a workload sufficient to elicit a minute volume equal to 15 liters per minute times body surface area (m2).  Exposure gases were delivered through a Hans Rudolph mask that allowed for oral breathing only.  Breath-by-breath measures of tidal volume, breathing frequency, and the dose of O3 retained by the lung were made.  Before and after each exposure, subjects completed lung function tests, a symptom questionnaire, and a series of breaths during which the CO2 expirograms were recorded.  From the CO2 expirograms, we calculated values of conducting airway volume (VD) and SN.   Additionally, pre- and post- exposure we sampled the nasal epithelial lining fluid (ELF) via nasal lavage and measured the ELF antioxidant capacity.  Pre-O3 exposure, we obtained blood plasma and quantified circulating uric and ascorbic acid concentrations.   Uric and ascorbic acid concentrations were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography and the total antioxidant capacity was determined using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay.\n\nIn order to test our hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model which describes the longitudinal partitioning of the inhaled dose of O3 to the conducting airways and alveolar airspaces.  This model relates the fraction of the total O3 dose reaching the alveolar region to the rate of transport of O3 to the ELF in the conducting airways (Ka) and the ratio of the VD to tidal volume (VD/VT) during exercise.  Ka is determined largely by the availability of ELF antioxidants.\n\nRESULTS:  Both smokers and non-smokers experienced no significant changes in FEV1, VD, or SN with air exposure.  However, with O3 exposure, we found smokers and non-smokers to be equally responsive in terms of FEV1 (-9.5 \u00b1 1.8% versus -8.7 \u00b1 1.9%).  While smokers were responsive in terms of VD (-6.1 \u00b1 1.2%) and SN (9.1 \u00b1 3.4%), non-smokers were not.    We compared pre-and post-O3 exposure values of VD with values of VT measured in the 10th and 55th minute of exposure and found that in the 10th minute of exposure, smokers and non-smokers had similar values of VD/VT.  However, in the 55th minute of exposure, non-smokers increased VD/VT (16.4 \u00b1 2.8%) while smokers did not (8.4 \u00b1 4.2%).  Post-O3 exposure, smokers experienced fewer respiratory-related symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, and chest burning) compared to non-smokers.\n\nIn terms of antioxidant status, smokers and non-smokers were not different in terms of plasma or nasal ELF ascorbic or uric acids.  The ELF of both smokers and non-smokers had similar ORAC values.  This led us to conclude that, because ELF antioxidant capacities were similar between both groups, Ka is not different.  In applying our findings to our model, we concluded that, because Ka and initial VD/VT were not different in non-smokers and smokers, initial differences in longitudinal dose distribution are not responsible for the increased changes in SN experienced by the smokers.  However, because smokers fail to increase VD/VT over the course of the exposure, they receive a higher cumulative dose to the peripheral airspaces compared to non-smokers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:  Young cigarette smokers retain their responsiveness to O3 in terms of FEV1.  Uniquely, these smokers experience changes in VD that lead to heterogeneity in airway morphometry.  This conclusion is supported by the observed increase in SN.  We have determined that changes in the expirogram are not a result of initial differences in the dose penetrating to the peripheral airways.  However, a decrease in VD/VT over the course of the exposure increases the dose to which the peripheral lung is exposed relative to the conducting airways.    These findings demonstrate that young smokers are more sensitive to the health effects of O3 than non-smokers.    Because we have identified that this population of young smokers responds differently to O3 in terms of FEV1 than the populations of older smokers reported in the literature, future studies of the health effects of airborne pollutants in smokers should include a cohort of young smokers.\n\n \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3942], "author_name_tesi": "Bates, Melissa Lowe", "last_name_ssi": "Bates", "middle_name_ssi": "Lowe", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James S Ultman", "Abdellaziz Ben Jebria", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Rebecca Bascom"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James S Ultman, Committee Chair", "Abdellaziz Ben Jebria, Committee Member", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Member", "Rebecca Bascom, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ozone", "Pulmonary Function", "Dose Response", "Carbon Dioxide Expirogram", "Cigarette Smokers", "Nasal Lavage"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "INTEGRATED MECHANICAL WEED MANAGEMENT IN HIGH RESIDUE CROPPING SYSTEMS\n\n", "id": "10608", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5333", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this research was to evaluate the potential of select mechanical tillage implements and reduced herbicide inputs in integrated high-residue corn and soybean systems. This integrated approach attempted to reduce the negative effects from herbicides and intense inversion tillage, while providing effective economical weed control.

Conventional no-till using herbicides and a weedy check were included for comparison and the weed seed bank was supplemented to help ensure an effective assessment. Evaluation parameters included crop population, weed density, end of season weed biomass, surface residue, grain yield, and costs.\n\nWeed density, crop, and production year influenced the efficacy of the mechanical implements. Treatments including herbicides reduced weed density and weed biomass compared to treatments relying on mechanical control alone. The vertical coulter and rotary harrow controlled weeds similar to a herbicide burndown treatment in corn, while with the later planting date of soybean, this treatment was not as effective as a burndown herbicide. While the rotary hoe had a minimal impact on surface residue, weed densities were higher than with the soil-applied broadcast herbicide treatments. In addition, the rotary hoe did not increase weed control in banded herbicide treatments. Treatments that included banded herbicide tended to have better weed control than treatments that relied strictly on mechanical implements, but lower weed control than broadcast herbicides. Of the mechanical tools tested, the high residue cultivator was the most effective in reducing weed density and weed biomass, while maintaining crop yield. The greater reliance on mechanical implements reduced weed control cost, but tended to have higher breakeven prices due to lower yields. Overall, mechanical tillage implements alone did not provide adequate weed control, while integration with reduced herbicide inputs maintained acceptable weed control and competitive crop yields.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5328], "author_name_tesi": "Bates, Ryan Timothy", "last_name_ssi": "Bates", "middle_name_ssi": "Timothy", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Curran", "William Curran", "Robert Paul Gallagher Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Curran, Thesis Advisor", "William Curran, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Paul Gallagher Iii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["high residue rotary hoe", "rotary harrow", "vertical coulter", "conservation tillage", "mechanical weed control", "integrated weed management", "soyben", "corn", "high residue cultivator", "banded herbicides"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Aptamer-functionalized Hydrogels for the Programmable Release of Growth Factors", "id": "23344", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10633", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Growth factors are potent signaling molecules that regulate numerous physiological processes. However, the safe and efficient delivery of growth factors remains an unmet goal when growth factors are applied to treat various pathologies. To control the spatiotemporal delivery of growth factors, material carriers such as hydrogels have been investigated. Hydrogels are promising growth factor delivery systems for their high water content and similarities to native tissue. However, the high permeability of hydrogel releases the loaded growth factors rapidly. In addition, the release rate of multiple growth factors cannot be controlled individually when multiple growth factors are incorporated. In order to better control the release rates of growth factors from hydrogels, functionalization strategies using affinity ligands should be explored.\n\nNucleic acid aptamers are synthetic oligonucleotides that bind to target molecules with high specificity and high affinity. In addition, these aptamers can be chemically modified with various functional groups and conjugated to a variety of biomaterials. For these reasons, hydrogels functionalized with aptamers could be a valuable tool for controlling the release of growth factors. Two main objectives were pursued in this work: 1) characterizing the molecular interactions of aptamers with cognate biomolecules, and 2) develop aptamer-functionalized delivery systems for the controlled release of growth factors. Modulation of the binding affinity can occur through the introduction or removal of steric hindrance or the use base substitutions. In addition, the use of an oligonucleotide complementary to the aptamer can be used to inactivate the aptamer.

These features are compatible with the observation of small inter-population genetic distances and relative lack of population structure compared to other continents. However some phenotypic features such as lightness in hair, skin and eye pigmentation are specific to Europe and diverse throughout the continent. I present a survey of variation of these phenotypes among population samples collected in 2005 and 2006 in the US and Europe (by me and collaborators, with proper consent from participants), including some 1,000 European Americans and 720 Europeans, and focusing on samples of French, US Ashkenazi Jews, Irish, Italian, Polish and Portuguese descent (respectively 169, 39, 147, 140, 84 and 187 individuals). In order to study genetic variation in Europe a variety of population samples without phenotypes was also assembled. These samples from Europe and neighboring regions were obtained from various sources, including the CEPH-HGDP, the Coriell Institute, and many collaborators. The genetic ancestry and population structure of Europe were first investigated through a commercial genetic test, EuroDNA 1.0 by the company DNAPrint (Sarasota, FL). In parallel this allowed evaluating the usefulness and performance of this test to predict individual ancestry and possibly pigmentation phenotypes; both possibilities appeared rather limited, mainly because of the low informativeness and size of the marker panel used. I then report on genome-wide typing of 297 individuals for ca. 10,000 (10k) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)\u2014using Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) 10k mapping array; the data reveal significant axes of population structure in Europeans of known and unknown ancestry, mainly differentiating Iberians, northern Europeans and southeastern Europeans, as well as Basque and Finnish individuals. A proper understanding of population genetic stratification\u2014differences in individual ancestry within or among populations\u2014is crucial in attempts to find genes for complex traits through association mapping. This section using the 10k array demonstrates the selection and application of EuroAIMs (European Ancestry Informative Markers) for ancestry estimation and correction of stratification, using validated Bayesian analysis (structure program) and Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) from individual allele sharing distances. Based on the latter I present methods for detecting and measuring genetic population structure in individual population samples\u2014one based on ANOVA, the other being an expansion of a split-half reliability method. The Coriell \u201cCaucasian\u201d and CEPH Utah sample panels, often used as proxies for European populations, are found to reflect different subsets of the continent\u2019s ancestry. Finally, using Illumina 317k mapping array data, both from 29 population sample pool and 180 individual genotypes (mainly from Ireland, Italy, Poland and Portugal), I confirm and expand the description of European population structure. A preliminary panel of 12k EuroAIMs was selected from the population pools, and applied to the 180 European individuals, which cluster apart based on country of origin (Ireland, Italy, Poland and Portugal). Individuals from other countries are also presented in this context. The availability of pigmentation phenotypes for these individuals will allow gene association studies and possibly admixture mapping. I finally discuss the potential of such data for biomedical research and understanding human genetic variation, as well as the danger in overstating commercial genetic test results to the public.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4443], "author_name_tesi": "Bauchet, Marc Philippe", "last_name_ssi": "Bauchet", "middle_name_ssi": "Philippe", "first_name_ssi": "Marc", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Shriver", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss", "Alan Walker", "Hiroshi Akashi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Shriver, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Committee Member", "Alan Walker, Committee Member", "Hiroshi Akashi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Europe", "population genetics", "human pigmentation", "genetic ancestry"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A Recommendation for the Backpack Load Limit of Middle School Students Based on Physiological and Psychophysical Measurements", "id": "7927", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1404", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over 40 million students in the United States use a backpack to carry items to and from school everyday as it is designed to hold different objects in an organized manner. However, the load of children\u2019s backpacks has caused debate over the recent years. Whether the problem is thought to be related to the belief that textbooks are too large for children to carry or the backpacks are loaded and carried incorrectly, the consensus is that there is a definite safety issue present and a need to be proactive in providing recommendations before severe health issues present themselves. The purpose of the planned research is to use electromyography (EMG), posture evaluation, heart rate, and ratings of perceived exertion and perceptions of pain to find an acceptable backpack load limit. These experiments will help narrow the acceptable load limit by providing additional analysis to the current literature on backpack loads and children. The study will also explore the possible differences between a backpack with many ergonomic features and a more generic backpack with only a couple ergonomic features. It may be that the type of backpack used is more of a problem than the actual load.\nTwenty middle school students aged 11 to 14 (10 female and 10 male) volunteered for the study. Two backpacks were used in the study: one with standard comfort features and one with ergonomic features. The subjects completed two tests: standing stationary and walking on a treadmill. For both tests, the subjects first had two trials without any load (0%) then two trials with each of the two backpacks at loads of 10, 15, and 20% of the subject\u2019s body weight (BW). EMG activity of the trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and erector spinae was collected using triode surface electrodes while the subjects stood for 3 min. For the walking trials, the subjects walked on a treadmill at 2.41 km/hr for 3 min. In both tests, every 1 min the subjects were asked to give a Borg-RPE and their heart rate. The subjects were also asked to rate the pain they felt in their shoulders, middle back, lower back, and whole body using the Borg CR10 Scale of Perceived Pain.\nThe study was conducted to gather more evidence on the vital problem of children carrying backpacks that may cause long-term harm, and to attempt to support one load limit over the other. The possibility of needing to adjust the Borg RPE-Scale for the study age was also explored. The research indicated that: (1) The CR10 ratings and trunk forward lean for the walking trial indicated a possible load limit of 10% BW due to the significant difference between 10 and 15% BW. (2) There was no significant difference between backpacks, concluding that the best backpack may just be a matter of personal choice. (3)The data was inconclusive on whether the RPE-Scale should be adjusted for children. Further studies on various dynamic activities should be explored.\nFuture research should be conducted to include factors such as testing actual backpack mass instead of %BW, using BMI to group subjects, more subjects for each age, and different backpacks to generalize the results for the general population.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1393], "author_name_tesi": "Bauer, Denise Helen", "last_name_ssi": "Bauer", "middle_name_ssi": "Helen", "first_name_ssi": "Denise", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds", "Leah C Newman", "Ling Rothrock", "Richard Donovan Koubek", "John Henry Challis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds, Committee Chair", "Leah C Newman, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Richard Donovan Koubek, Committee Member", "John Henry Challis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["children and backpacks", "backpack load limits"]}]
