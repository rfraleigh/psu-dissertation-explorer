A fifteen-segment 3D inverse dynamic model was developed for a biomechanical analysis based on the 3D kinematics of head/trunk, pelvis, upper arms, forearms, hands, thighs, shanks, feet and luggage.\nThe Taguchi method was employed for an experimental design. There were two types of the dependent variables: 1) observed stress levels on luggage users and 2) signal-to-noise ratios for luggage design. Each group had 227 dependent variables, such as angles, linear accelerations, peak angular accelerations, joint reaction forces, joint moments, L4/L5 compression forces, energy expenditures, percent of maximum oxygen uptake, heart rates and Borg\u00a1\u00afs RPE. Four male students pulled a luggage prototype in all configurations of handle length (100 cm and 110 cm), handle rotation (parallel and rotated handles), pole angle (0\u00a8\u00ac and 10\u00a8\u00ac), wheel diameter (8 cm and 15 cm), load weight (15 kg or 23 kg), center of mass of luggage (low and middle), carpeting (present and not present), experimental day (1st and 2nd) and subject height (short and tall). MANOVA and ANOVA were administered to identify the main effects.\nOverall the luggage-pulling task was considered light work in terms of evaluation criteria adopted in the study and mainly affected the right arm. Handle height, handle rotation and pole angle primarily influenced the kinematic variables, while wheel diameter, load weight and center of mass of luggage influenced the biomechanical, physiological and subjective rating variables. Subject height was the most important variable because it was significant for all variables. From a robust design standpoint, the combination of a long handle, a parallel handle, a straight pole and a large wheel diameter were optimum luggage design criteria. However, the combination of a long handle, a rotated handle, an angled pole and a large wheel diameter might be better from an ergonomics standpoint due to less stresses on luggage users.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4385], "author_name_tesi": "Jung, Myung-Chul ", "last_name_ssi": "Jung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Myung-Chul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joel B Haight", "Andris Freivalds", "M Jeya Chandra", "Ling Rothrock", "M Susan Hallbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joel B Haight, Committee Chair", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Chair", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "M Susan Hallbeck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Luggage Pulling Task", "Luggage Design Criteria", "Kinematics", "Biomechanics", "Work Physiology", "Subjective Ratings"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Information Processing and Semantic Correlation\nin Multimodal, Multilingual, Human Computer Interfaces", "id": "16001", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8037", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One long-term goal in human computer interaction (HCI) study has been to migrate the \u201cnatural\u201d means that humans employ to communicate with each other into the HCI system. Any HCI system that aspires to have the same naturalness as that of an interaction between humans should be multimodal, thus requiring a need for developing a multimodal HCI system.\nMultilingual collaboration through a multimodal human computer interaction (HCI) interface needs to handle differences among the multiple human languages used by the collaborators. The difficulties of handling the multilingual information are partially caused by the linguistic differences in grammar, vocabulary, idiom, expression, word-formation, and the existence of unique homonym, polysemy, and homophone in each human language. Due to the difficulties, a semantic extraction and correlation process among the multilingual information becomes a further difficult task in a multimodal HCI system. \nIn this dissertation, a deterministic information processing framework for multilingual collaboration in the context of geo-spatial collaborative crisis management is proposed. The deterministic information processing framework comprises an information unit augmentation step, called object verification, and operating mechanism for the augmented information unit, called polymorphic operator, as a part of the proposed approach to process the multilingual information. In the subject of the multilingualism, the deterministic information modeling approach is an attempt to reduce the complexity in handling the multilingual information by replacing the language modeling process with the information modeling approach.\nIn this dissertation, the term \u201crule\u201c is defined as an agreement or guideline based on the intention for achieving a goal among the users of a particular embodiment of the approach in a specifically predefined domain for defining a set of relationships among the verified information units that are used in the specifically predefined domain. \nIt is an objective of the proposed approach to see whether the deterministic information processing approach can efficiently handle the multilingual collaboration and semantic correlation with feasible computational complexity and processing time through algorithm analysis and discussion of exemplary experimentation.

On the anode side, methanol-water solution is oxidized to produce carbon dioxide (CO2), whereas gaseous oxygen from air is reduced to form liquid water on the cathode side. Prediction and control of two-phase flow is of paramount importance for performance and fuel efficiency of DMFC in portable application. This dissertation aims to accurately predict and control two-phase flow in the channel and porous media of a DMFC to enable novel design and selection of components.  \nCO2 gas produced during methanol oxidation reaction in a DMFC is the reason for the two-phase flow in the anode. This CO2 gas is typically removed through the anode channel for steady cell operation, which makes a strong two-phase flow in the anode channel. As this channel two-phase flow causes a large pressure drop which is not desired, the present work modeled a CO2 breathing DMFC which directly vents CO2 to the ambient through the porous surface film. Although the CO2 breathing DMFC shows similar cell performance with the conventional DMFC, the net power throughput and the system efficiency are improved since required pumping power is reduced due to reduced anode pressure. The role of CO2 in controlling water and methanol transport in a DMFC is elucidated with a computational method for the first time. It is found that the amount of CO2 in the anode (CO2 level) determines capillary diffusion which dominates water transport in a DMFC. In addition, the multi-D DMFC model explains that methanol is transported not only by molecular diffusion but also by capillary diffusion in the anode porous media, and both transport mechanisms are strong functions of the CO2 level. \nThe present study predicted a significant cell performance loss due to severe non-uniform distribution of methanol concentration under ultra-low anode stoichiometry condition. After identifying the controlling parameters of the anode non-uniformity, two strategies to mitigate the anode non-uniformity and to boost cell performance as well as fuel efficiency are proposed. First, streamline-graded structures (SGS) which control methanol transfer resistance are devised and studied through a statistical analysis. Second, an interdigitated fuel distributor which converts the fuel transport mechanism from diffusive to convective is developed. It is found that cell performance and fuel efficiency are improved by mitigating fuel concentration non-uniformity due to reduced methanol crossover in the inlet region and improved fuel supply in the outlet region.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6061], "author_name_tesi": "Jung, Seung Hun ", "last_name_ssi": "Jung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seung Hun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Chao Yang Wang", "John Michael Cimbala", "Seungjin Kim", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "John Michael Cimbala, Committee Member", "Seungjin Kim, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fuel cell", "direct methanol fuel cell", "two-phase flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "MICROBIAL COMMUNITY AND ELECTROCHEMISTRY OF BIOELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS \n", "id": "10856", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5961", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-01-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are an emerging technology that converts organic matter to electricity using an exoelectrogenic biofilm on the electrode as the biocatalyst. The complexity of anode biofilms makes it hard to elucidate electrochemical mechanisms at the bioanode, but a precise understanding of exoelectrogenesis and competition in anode biofilms will aid in improving performance of these systems. Various factors such as substrate, external resistance, pH, or exoelectrogenic mode were tested to investigate the bioanode process and its influence on system performance. \n\tThe external resistance in MFCs regulates both the anode availability as an electron acceptor and the electron flux through the circuit. I evaluated the effects of external resistance (Rext) on MFCs using acetate or glucose. I showed that Rext affects not only anode potential (Ean) and current generation but also anode biofilm community and methanogenesis. Acetate-fed MFCs produced higher Coulombic efficiencies and energy efficiencies than glucose-fed MFCs because of electron and potential losses from glucose fermentation. However, total methane production in acetate-fed reactors increased as Rext increased, suggesting that Ean might influence the competition for substrate between exoelectrogens and methanogens with this substrate. Increasing Rext to 9800 &#8486; significantly changed the anode bacterial communities for both acetate- and glucose-fed reactors relative to communities in systems operating at 970 &#8486;, but decreasing Rext to 150 &#8486; had little effect. \n\tpH influences both anode and cathode performance in MFCs. The polarization behavior and impedance of the bioanode in an MFC was analyzed in medium pH of 6.0 to 8.0, at 0.5 pH-unit intervals. In this research, I characterized the performance of the anode, cathode, and whole cell using polarization behavior. I also developed a new equivalent circuit model for fitting electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, and it was used to explain electrochemical phenomena of the bioanode. The electrode potentials changed with pH (ca. -60 mV/pH for anode and ca. -68 mV/pH for cathode), coincident with thermodynamic estimations. Open circuit voltage reached a maximum (-517 mV) at pH 7 and maximum power density was highest (741 mW/m2) at pH 6.5 due to the effect of cathode performance. Maximum current density increased, and apparent half-saturation potential (EKA) decreased with increasing medium pH due to improved bioanode performance. Impedance analysis showed that intracellular processes were the rate-limiting step for acetate-oxidizing exoelectrogenesis based on charge transfer resistance estimates, and a majority of charges were stored in intracellular processes based on capacitance values. Intracellular resistance was lowest near EKA and increased by several orders of magnitude above EKA, while extracellular resistance decreased by only a few ohms as potential increased. However, EIS fittings deviated slightly at potentials above EKA due to an emerging impedance presumably associated with diffusive impedance and excessive potential. \n\tThe two model exoelectrogens Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 have very different electrochemical physiologies. To understand exoelectrogenic processes better, the electrochemistry of these distinct exoelectrogens was characterized. Duplicate anode electrodes were enriched with G. sulfurreducens, S. oneidensis, or their coculture. In both the PCA anodes and the MR-1 anodes, extracellular resistance was a few orders of magnitude larger than intracellular resistance, showing that the extracellular resistance process was rate limiting. Total capacitance values of both cases were dominated by C2 ranging from 3 to 10 mF, whereas C1 ranged from 10-3 to 10-2 mF. Different morphologies of HF arcs were created among the three defined cultures. The coculture reactors were expected to increase current production due to exoelectrogenic contribution from both community members, but these anodes produced lower current and higher impedance at the bioanode, probably due to substrate limitation as the more exoelectrogenically productive community member (i.e., G. sulfurreducens) was constrained by the conversion of lactate to acetate by S. oneidensis MR-1.\n\tThe impedance attributes and thermodynamics of a mixed-culture bioanode and an abiotic anode were comparatively analyzed, along with the effects of riboflavin on EIS-determined charge transfer processes. Our results successfully identified and quantified their extracellular electron transfer properties. Activation overpotential was insignificant in the bioanode compared with the abiotic anode. The bioanode had ~30-fold lower charge transfer resistance and 2-fold higher capacitance for the low frequency reaction than the abiotic anode. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5955], "author_name_tesi": "Jung, Sokhee ", "last_name_ssi": "Jung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sokhee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Regan", "John Michael Regan", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "Brian Dempsey", "Matthew M Mench"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Regan, Dissertation Advisor", "John Michael Regan, Committee Chair", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Member", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "Matthew M Mench, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["exoelectrogenesis", "extracellular electron transfer", "pH", "external resistance", "exoelectrogenic biofilm", "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs)", "EIS", "imepdance spectroscopy", "bioanode"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Subsurface Utility Engineering for Highway Projects: A Study of Utility Impact Rating and Benefit-Cost Analysis", "id": "7968", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6840", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Accurate locations of buried utility infrastructures are very important for utility owners, utility managers and engineers, designers, and contractors that perform new installations, repairs, and maintenances in highway projects. A lack of reliable information on underground utilities not only can result in property damages, construction delays, design changes, claims, injuries, and even deaths, but also cause traffic delays, local business disruptions, environmental problems, and utility service breakdowns. Subsurface Utility Engineering (SUE) is an engineering process to reduce the potential of underground utility conflicts in the project planning phase. SUE utilizes new and existing technologies to accurately identify, characterize, and map underground utilities with three major activities including designating utilities, locating utilities, and data management. SUE can be the most suitable method for mitigating risks associated with uncertain underground information. Although many damage prevention practices have existed, the damage prevention practice using the SUE concept has not been developed for contractors, designers, engineers, and other stakeholders associated with or impacted by underground utilities. This study focuses on an in-depth analysis of SUE projects executed by Penn DOT districts. Based on this analysis and the utility impact score which refers to utility complexity at the construction site, a decision-support tool called utility impact rating form has been developed to determine which projects should include SUE and identify the appropriate levels of SUE investigation to be used. The computerized utility impact rating form is developed using Visual Basic software to provide a graphical interface for the purpose of enhancing the efficiency of the calculation and selection processes. A detailed benefit-cost analysis is also performed on twenty-two SUE projects and eight non-SUE projects. All of the projects show a strong relationship between SUE benefit-cost ratio and complexity level of buried utilities. The analysis clearly indicates that there is no relationship between SUE benefit-cost ratio and project cost and also no relationship between complexity level of buried utilities and project cost.

Although office blood pressure measurement is highly predictive when performed correctly, measurement errors are inevitable in clinical practice. Due to limitations in accurately measuring blood pressure, it is recommended by experts that clinicians should diagnose hypertension only after they obtain two or more elevated blood pressure readings at each of two or more separate visits over a period of one to several weeks. However, in our modern busy life style, it is not easy for patients to visit the doctor multiple times to test blood pressure. Therefore, this thesis develops a simple risk index for hypertension using risk indicators of hypertension that can help detect potential misclassifications in initial blood pressure measurements.\nThe hypertension risk utility index is built using multi attribute utility theory. Six attributes both clinical and non-clinical were initially considered as hypertension risk indicators which include blood pressure, age, BMI, physical activity, cigarette usage, and sleep duration. The 2005-2006 NHANES data was utilized to determine the utility index using the data of 1674 individuals. Using the Box Plot analysis, utility ranges were defined for each blood pressure classification using clinical attributes and using both clinical and non-clinical attributes. The reliability of the hypertension risk index using both clinical and non-clinical attributes is 93.1% and that of the risk index using clinical attributes is 92%. The proposed hypertension risk utility index incorporates all six risk factors.\n Incorporating this hypertension risk utility index into the process of diagnosing hypertension may help doctors appropriately schedule follow-up meetings through detecting potential misclassifications in initial blood pressure measurements. Reversely, it can help confirm the accuracy of blood pressure measurements which may reduce the number of visits needed to establish the presence of hypertension. It can also motivate patients to re-visit the clinician blood pressure by explaining the potential misclassification risk to the patient. Overall, this may help people get the right treatment at an earlier stage which may improve quality of lives and ultimately reduce the mortality rate due to hypertension.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6762], "author_name_tesi": "Jung, Yonmi ", "last_name_ssi": "Jung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yonmi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard", "Harriet Black Nembhard", "Gul Kremer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard, Thesis Advisor", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Thesis Advisor", "Gul Kremer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["risk", "hypertension", "utility"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Building Strong Bridges between the Museum and Its Community: An Ethnographic Understanding of the Culture and Systems of One Community\u2019s Art Museum", "id": "16047", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8153", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is a holistic, qualitative, ethnographic case study of a medium-size art museum in the Midwestern United States based on interviews with all levels of staff and board members, community leaders, visitors, and educators.

The goal of this dissertation is to answer the question: Is enhanced N2-fixation a necessary response to widespread oceanic anoxia? Understanding the N-cycle is important because N is one of the primary nutrients limiting carbon fixation on Earth. Over geologic time scales, N availability, along with that of P and Fe, impacts the regulation of atmospheric CO2 and climate through the limitation of carbon fixation by photoautotrophs in the oceans and on land.  This work focuses on understanding the geologic record of the nitrogen cycle during episodes of ancient oceanic oxygen deprivation during the mid-Cretaceous and Neoproterozoic, and the processes controlling the preservation of N-cycle proxies in Holocene surface sediments of the Peru Margin. Under anoxic conditions, nutrient N is lost from the ocean through microbial metabolic processes but P is more efficiently recycled (Ingall and Janke, 1993). It could be envisioned that intervals of more widespread marine anoxia would significantly impact the balance of the marine nutrient cycles, affecting biological productivity. As geoscientists, we provide a unique perspective that can help answer some of the most important questions regarding the evolution of the N-cycle through time, the biological evolution of the earth, and the potential impacts of natural and anthropogenic climate change. \n\nTo assess the state of the ancient nitrogen cycle I have focused on the isolation and N-isotopic analysis of chlorophyll derivatives (e.g. porphyrins and chlorins), and bulk organic extracts. Utilization of porphyrins and chlorins for compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis requires an in-depth analysis of the processes that control their transformation and preservation over geologic time and in modern environments. A significant proportion of this work focuses on the abundances and distribution of porphyrins and chlorins in addition to N-isotopic analysis.  \n\nIn this study, initial investigation focused on the preserved chlorophyll derivatives of the Cretaceous strata recovered from the Demerara Rise. This work yielded unexpected discoveries of high abundances of bicycloalkanoporphyrins (BiCAPs), present as free bases (metal free) and Zn and VO2+ complexes. The occurrence of Zn bicycloalkanoporphyrins represents the first occurrence of primary Zn porphyrins found in the geologic record. Structural confirmation of the chlorin mesochlorophyllone in the Demerara Rise black shales represents the oldest such occurrence in the geologic record by over 70 million years; its presence suggests that the abundant bicycloalkanoporphyrins in the Demerara Rise sediments are derived from chlorophyll a, the only possible precursor for mesochlorophyllone. \n\nThe stratigraphic distribution of BiCAPS is controlled, foremost, by metal availability in the water column and sediments rather than early diagenesis Eh/pH conditions, or post depositional thermal maturity. Titration of the local water-column metal reservoir by sulfide during Oceanic Anoxic Event II (OAE II) resulted in high concentrations of FB BiCAPs and very low concentrations of metallo-BiCAPs. The highest total concentrations of porphyrins are found where metal concentrations are highest, suggesting that porphyrin preservation is enhanced by the increased stability that results from formation of metal complexes. Paradoxically, the total concentration of porphyrins is lowest during the heart of OAE II, in an interval of higher TOC where enhanced organic matter preservation would be expected; this may be the result of decreased preservation of tetrapyrroles in the absence of the stabilizing effect of metals. \n\nThe nitrogen isotopic composition of BiCAPs confirms that the &#948;15N of dissolved inorganic nitrogen becomes 15N-depleted probably in response to expanded nitrogen fixation during Oceanic Anoxic Event II. These data support a strong spatial and temporal link between nitrogen fixation and loss of nutrient nitrogen via suboxic metabolisms. I have also found that the &#948;15N values of the three porphyrins are systematically different despite a common chlorophyll source; the origin of this difference is related to nitrogen isotopic effects associated with the formation of metal complexes. These results demonstrate that direct reconstruction of primary phototroph biomass from porphyrins can be misleading without a full assessment of the &#948;15N of the range of structures present in ancient sediments. \n\nAnalysis of the &#948;15N record of bulk sediments and co-occurring chlorins from Peru Margin surface sediments demonstrates that downslope transport and degradation of organic matter results in an isotopic depletion of bulk sedimentary nitrogen. Despite an order of magnitude decrease in the sedimentary concentration of chlorins downslope, their &#948;15N values remain constant, demonstrating that chlorin degradation causes no significant nitrogen isotopic effects. These data suggest that studies that utilize bulk &#948;15N for paleoceanographic studies in dynamic environments need to account for possible diagenetic effects even in low oxygen settings.   \n\nThe factors controlling carbon burial in the Neoproterozoic are illustrated by the range of processes associated with the deposition of the Kwagunt Formation sediments.

Exploring a single cell is important since there is a connection between single cell biomechanics and human cancer. Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) has been accepted and extensively utilized for acoustical cellular and tissue imaging including measurements of the mechanical and elastic properties of biological specimens. SAM provides superb advantages in that it is non-invasive, can measure mechanical properties of biological cells or tissues, and fixation/chemical staining is not necessary. The first objective of this research is to develop a program for simulating the images and contrast mechanism obtained by high-frequency SAM. Computer simulation algorithms based on Matlab\u00ae were built for simulating the images and contrast mechanisms. The mechanical properties of HeLa and MCF-7 cells were computed from the measurement data of the output signal amplitude as a function of distance from the focal planes of the acoustics lens which is known as V(z) . Algorithms for simulating V(z) responses involved the calculation of the reflectance function and were created based on ray theory and wave theory. The second objective is to design transducer arrays for SAM. Theoretical simulations based on Field II\u00a9 programs of the high frequency ultrasound array designs were performed to enhance image resolution and volumetric imaging capabilities. Phased array beam forming and dynamic apodization and focusing were employed in the simulations.

While many trusted practitioner sources confirm that outsourcing is gaining popularity, many efforts to pursue outsourcing are reported to be problematic or, even, a failure. Among such failures and successes, most of the thriving firms have undergone a second attempt by paying intensive attention to the knowledge transfer process, which is at the heart of the knowledge management problem. Knowledge is recognized by firms as a critical source of power that is derived from its scarcity in its environment. Hence, as a critical determinant of its value and to maximize the productivity of the firm itself, knowledge could be completely kept confidential from certain entities such as employees, a firm\u2019s subsidiaries, and business partners, especially in knowledge intensive businesses. This leads to a dilemma in pursuing optimality in knowledge transfer in an outsourcing relationship: the competing goals of preventing the most critical business knowledge components from becoming visible to the partners while facilitating all subunits being able to successfully carry out a project. Since high-tech work is regarded as knowledge intensive activities, it is critical that a firm balance, cooperation and competition in terms of its knowledge assets. \n\nMuch attention has been paid to knowledge transfer among subunits in outsourcing schemes and has sought a method of minimizing the conflicting interests among subunits. However, the findings seem to be limited due to the theories traditionally adopted (i.e. knowledge-based theory, transaction-cost theory, agent-cost theory, game theory). Furthermore, many issues remain to be addressed, especially the dynamic interactions and exchange processes that facilitate knowledge transfer. This thesis explored the knowledge transfer issues with respect to facilitators and barriers among outsourcing subunits, the vender\u2019s and the client\u2019s, by adopting social exchange theory (SET). Although relatively new to IST literature, SET proved potentially useful for studying knowledge transfer. Moreover, the concept of reciprocity, balance, cohesion, power, trust, and cultural sensitivity of SET have proven to be promising for theoretical applications in a very large array of knowledge management settings, especially in knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer because SET is applicable to any level of analysis (individual, group, organizational or societal).\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5826], "author_name_tesi": "Juntiwasarakij, Suwan ", "last_name_ssi": "Juntiwasarakij", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suwan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eileen M Trauth", "Eileen M Trauth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eileen M Trauth, Thesis Advisor", "Eileen M Trauth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cooperation competition", "knowledge transfer"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Harnessing Social Media Collaborative Intelligence to Champion Enterprise Innovation ", "id": "14179", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7051", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Innovation is a survival tool for the corporate world to play in the ever competitive free global market in the 21st century.

The data acquired may be of use to determine elementary steps in a larger catalytic mechanism.  This provides information on the sites necessary for the promotion of the desired process as well as on the sites which can either prohibit the desired process or encourage the generation of unwanted side products.\n\nThe guided ion beam mass spectrometer used in these studies allows for the individual analysis of clusters to determine the conditions required for a desired process.  These results are part of an on-going study to systematically investigate the Group V metal oxide cluster ions toward hydrocarbons of interest to the catalytic community.\n\nThe experiments discussed herein include a variety of reactant gases from saturated hydrocarbons to aromatic molecules.  These studies provide a sampling of the power of this technique to evaluate different systems.  These will be briefly summarized below.\n\nThe reactions between the Group V metal oxides with the C2 hydrocarbons, ethane and ethylene, conducted previously have shown a dramatic preference of the (V<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB5</SUB>)<SUB>1-3</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> clusters to transfer an oxygen atom to the hydrocarbon.  We were unable, however, to determine the neutral product generated by experimental means.  Therefore, we formed a collaboration with a theoretical group in Berlin, to ascertain the most probable product energetically.  Density functional calculations showed the structures of the two reactive clusters, V<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> and V<SUB>4</SUB>O<SUB>10</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>, both exhibited an oxygen centered radical moiety as part of their structure which was not observed with any other cluster studied.  It was also determined that acetaldehyde was the preferred product when (V<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>)<SUB>1,2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> reacted with ethylene.  The calculations also showed that the reactions with ethane showed that it was energetically possible for V<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> to dehydrogenate ethane to yield ethylene and to proceed further to eventually give acetaldehyde as a neutral product.  \n\nA second study discussed here involves the reactions between the vanadium and niobium oxide cluster cations with methanol.  Methanol is of interest industrially as an alternate fuel source.  Hence, any information one may obtain to improve the selectivity and overall efficiency is of vital interest.  Certain clusters demonstrated the association of molecular hydrogen.  This was determined using deuterated methanol.  These products were also observed under single collision conditions with the only possible mechanism being dehydrogenation of methanol to yield H<SUB>2</SUB>, adsorbed to the cluster, and CH<SUB>2</SUB>O, the neutral product.  In addition, the association of C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>6</SUB>O was also observed.  Among the possible structures of C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>6</SUB>O is dimethyl ether.  This is not the only structure though and additional experiments are required to ascertain the exact structure on the cluster.\n\nThe reactions between vanadium and niobium oxide cluster cations and propylene were also investigated.  The polyolefin industry is a considerable part of the economy itself as well as producing precursors to several other substances.  The oxidation of propylene is also a useful process, generating products such as propylene oxide.  Considering the closeness in structure from propylene to ethylene, there was hope that the Group V metal oxide clusters would also show a significant oxygen transfer pathway for the propylene.  The reactions between the vanadium and niobium oxide cluster cations mainly consisted of the formation of the monomer and dimer and even went as high as the pentamer.  The addition of methyl and ethyl groups to the monomer and dimer were also observed.  The oxygen transfer from the metal oxide cluster to the propylene was also noted for V<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> and Nb<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> but not for V<SUB>4</SUB>O<SUB>10</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>.  The reactivity was greater for the V<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> than for the Nb<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>, however this is to be expected since the V-O bond is more easily cleaved than the Nb-O bond.\n\nThe last study included here involves the reactions between the vanadium and niobium oxide cluster cations with ortho-xylene.  Xylene is of interest in the production of phthalic anhydride which is used to produce polyester resins and polyvinylchloride.  Xylene is also worth studying to determine if the methyl groups affect the reactivity with the metal oxide cluster ions.  The V<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> cluster was the only species to exhibit an oxygen transfer pathway.  The majority of the products observed were charged hydrocarbons.  Among these were the production of C<SUB>7</SUB>H<SUB>7</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>, the loss of a methyl group, C<SUB>8</SUB>H<SUB>10</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>, charge transfer, C<SUB>8</SUB>H<SUB>10</SUB>CH<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>, addition of a methyl group to the charged xylene molecule, and (C<SUB>8</SUB>H<SUB>10</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> and (C<SUB>8</SUB>H<SUB>10</SUB>CH<SUB>3</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>, single and double methyl addition to the xylene dimer, respectively.

Chronic exposure appears to cause alterations in the neuronal morphology of brain regions implicated in opioid dependence and addiction.  Many of these changes reflect the inhibitory effects of these drugs and other opioid receptor agonists on neuron size, neurite outgrowth, dendritic arborization, and neurogenesis that occur in brain regions important for reward processing, learning, and memory.  The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) primarily responsible for mediating the analgesic and rewarding properties of opioid agonist drugs such as morphine, fentanyl, and heroin.  However, the precise role of the MOR in the development of these neuronal alterations remains elusive.  A growing body of evidence suggests that G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is modulated by proteins that bind GPCRs and form multiprotein signaling complexes.  A number of proteins that interact with the MOR have recently been identified and have been shown to affect MOR biogenesis, trafficking, and signaling.  Therefore, identifying and characterizing MOR interacting proteins (MORIPs) may help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of opioid addiction.\nUsing a combination of conventional and modified membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) screening methods, a cohort of novel MOR interacting proteins (MORIPs) was identified.  The interaction between the MOR and a subset of MORIPs was validated in pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-localization studies using HEK293 cells stably expressing the MOR as well as rodent brain.  Additionally, a subset of MORIPs was found capable of interaction with the delta (DOR) and kappa (KOR) opioid receptors.  Finally, three of these proteins showed altered expression in the brains of morphine treated mice.\nThe ubiquitin pathway has been shown to be altered in the addiction process, therefore two novel MORIPs, seven in absentia 1(SIAH1) and 2 (SIAH2), were of particular interest due to their known function as E3 ligases in the ubiquitin pathway.   The effects of altering SIAH1 and/or SIAH2 protein expression on opioid receptor ubiquitination and protein levels was investigated using human embryonic kidney (HEK) stably transfected with MOR, delta opioid receptor (DOR), or kappa opioid receptor (KOR).  These experiments suggest that SIAH2 is an E3 ligase for the MOR, while both SIAH1 and SIAH2 may conjugate ubiquitin to DOR and KOR.  The ubiquitination by SIAH2 appears to signal for degradation of the MOR, whereas SIAH1 seems to act as a shuttle protein or chaperone assisting in degradation.  In contrast, the ubiquitination of DOR and KOR may be a signal for degradation or trafficking of receptors.  Additionally, opioid agonist treatment of neuroblastoma cells promoted the formation of MOR/SIAH1 complexes.  Based on the known function of these newly identified MORIPs, the interactions forming the MOR signalplex are hypothesized to be important for MOR signaling and intracellular trafficking.  Understanding the molecular complexity of MOR/MORIP interactions provides a conceptual framework for defining the cellular mechanisms of MOR signaling in brain and may be critical for determining the physiological basis of opioid tolerance and addiction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7935], "author_name_tesi": "Justice-bitner, Stephanie Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Justice-bitner", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson", "Robert G Levenson", "Victor J Ruiz Velasco", "Laura Carrel", "Vincent Chau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Chair", "Victor J Ruiz Velasco, Committee Chair", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member", "Vincent Chau, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mu-opioid receptor", "ubiquitin", "G-protein", "kappa-opioid receptor", "delta-opioid receptor", "yeast two-hybrid", "SIAH1", "SIAH2"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Characterizing Differing Modes of Supraglacial Lake Drainage Events along the Western Margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet using GPS,\nPassive Seismic, and MODIS Satellite Data", "id": "16382", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7353", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fast-draining supraglacial lakes along the ablation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) have been the focus of extensive scientific research, chiefly on their role in routing large volumes of surface melt water to the ice sheet base, thus facilitating basal sliding, and creating a mechanism for accelerated ice flow to rapidly affect climate.

Laser-based powder bed fusion, in particular, is a promising metal AM process to fabricate complex metal parts that are otherwise difficult, costly, or impossible to manufacture using traditional means.  Many techniques for lightweighting designs and improving part performance such as topology optimization, lattice structures, and part consolidation, often result in designs with complex features that can only be made with AM.  Although AM is not necessarily constrained by this geometric complexity, it does require unsupported/overhanging features in the design to be structurally supported by additional structures that can be later removed by post-processing using various techniques such as hand tools, machining, wire EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining), etc.  Depending on the complexity of the part, support structures can often be substantial, difficult to access, and complex in shape; therefore, removing the support structures may be very difficult and require multiple post-processing steps.  As a result, overall manufacturing cost, material consumption, and manufacturing time may unnecessarily increase, making AM less economical than initially conceived.  Additionally, the thermo-mechanical nature of the metal AM process induces residual stresses and distortions in the built parts.  In-process distortions can lead to build failures, part curling and warping, and material waste.  Therefore, many designs cannot be easily manufactured using AM or may actually cost more to produce with AM. \n             Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) can remedy these limitations.  DfAM encompass a set of principles or guidelines based on theory and experience to help design parts to be manufactured easily with AM.  Effective implementation of DfAM during the design phase can result in parts suitable for AM, which can be affordable to make and easier to produce.  However, the strategies to implement DfAM principles are not generalized and vary from part to part, process to process, and material to material.  These part-specific requirements may require modifications in the existing design workflow, and a single workflow may not be suitable for all the design cases.  To understand some of these differences, this thesis focuses on investigating the design process for leveraging metal AM capabilities at different levels of design complexities by redesigning three industry relevant components for additive manufacturing.  In each case, the design conceptualization, workflow, design tools, DfAM principles, and improvement in product performance are compared and contrasted.  Based on these three cases, recommendations are made for improving the design tools, and ultimately for improving the design workflow to reduce the computation time and improve the information flow across the software platforms.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12421], "author_name_tesi": "KANTAREDDY, SAI NITHIN REDDY ", "last_name_ssi": "KANTAREDDY", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "SAI NITHIN REDDY", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson", "Mary  Frecker", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor", "Mary  Frecker, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Laser-based powder bed fusion", "Additive Manufacturing", "Design for Additive Manufacturing", "Topology Optimization", "Lightweighting", "Lattice Structures", "Design Workflow"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Double-Shift Schools: Architectural Strategies to foster Place Attachment.\n\n\n", "id": "10325", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2053", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-01-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Double-shift schools are vehicles of change in developing countries such as India. Through efficient management of resources such as the school building and playgrounds, they are providing greater access to primary and secondary education, consuming fewer resources in terms of land usage and reducing costs of education. The system is beneficial economically as it cuts operative costs, however the reduction in cost comes at a significant price.  The shift operation creates a crunched school day, lowers quality of education, creates conflicts of ownership of space between shifts and induces a feeling of detachment or lack of belonging to the school.  This thesis delves into the question: Does the built environment of the double-shift school induce feelings of alienation; and if it does, then how can we as designers create better and more responsive spaces for the double-shift school. \n   The study was divided into three stages. First, the concept of alienation was grounded in theories of place attachment. It was found that the environment acts as a vehicle through which the attachment processes are manifested and fosters positive self and communal identity. Through the process, people (children), processes (act of appropriation and activities) and the built environment (attributes and affordances) were established as the key players in the processes of alienation. Finally alienation was defined as a sense of detachment to place caused due to changes in people, processes and places and the environmental attributes that lead to detachment were defined and established.\n   In the second stage, case studies of a double-shift school in Navi Mumbai, India was conducted to document goals, activities of the two shifts in order to understand the differences and similarities in the user - environment interaction between the two shifts.

This fungal species can be differentiated into several genetically distinct host specific groups. Rice pathogenic M. grisea strains cause rice blast disease that limits rice production worldwide. One desirable strategy for controlling the disease is to use blast-resistant rice cultivars. However, resistance has not been durable because of the frequent appearance of new races in the field with the ability to infect previously resistant cultivars. Because the interactions between M. grisea and rice follow the gene-for-gene model, the mutations of avirulence (AVR) genes can lead to the generation of new races. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning the evolution and variation of AVR genes is critical to understanding how the pathogen overcomes host resistance. \nThe AVR gene MgMEP1 (previously called AVR-Pita), which was cloned from a rice pathogenic field isolate of M. grisea (O-137), prevents the fungus from infecting rice cultivars containing the corresponding R gene Pi-ta. A survey of more than 300 M. grisea strains isolated from diverse hosts identified sequences homologous to the MgMEP1 gene with varying degrees of sequence similarity, suggesting that the MgMEP1 gene is a member of a gene family. Two other family members, termed MgMEP2 (functional as an AVR gene) and MgMEP3 (nonfunctional as an AVR gene), were cloned based on their homology to the O-137 MgMEP1 gene. The MgMEP1 and MgMEP2 genes were present widely even among strains that are not pathogenic to rice and genetically distant from the rice pathogens. Among these strains, substantial variation was observed with respect to the gene copy number (ranging from zero to three) and gene-linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). The MgMEP3 gene was present only among rice pathogens and those that are genetically close to rice pathogens (forming a new phylogenetic species termed M. oryzae) and did not exhibit much variation in its copy number and RFLPs. This suggests that the MgMEP3 gene was the newest member of the gene family generated only after the divergence of M. oryzae from M. grisea and is genetically more stable than the MgMEP1 and MgMEP2 genes. Sequence analysis of avirulence and virulence alleles of the MgMEP gene family members showed that most of them are likely to encode a functional metallopeptidase, suggesting that the evolution of the MgMEP gene family involves modifications of a protein to preserve enzymatic function while altering its recognition specificity as an avirulence factor.    \nTo determine the molecular mechanisms underpinning the genetic variability of the gene family, the genomic context of its members was analyzed in eight different M. grisea strains isolated from diverse hosts. The MgMEP1/MgMEP2 (probably allelic) genes were located near a telomere and flanked by diverse DNA repeats. This suggests that frequent deletion/amplification of the MgMEP1/MgMEP2 genes have resulted from their telomeric location and recombination mediated by the DNA repeats flanking them. The relative stability of the MgMEP3 gene was probably due to its internal location and absence of DNA repeats at flanking regions. \n\nRapid progress in fungal genome sequencing presents many new opportunities for studying fungal biology through a systematic mutagenesis of the genes identified through sequencing. However, the lack of efficient tools for targeted gene replacement is a limiting factor for fungal functional genomics, as it often necessitates the screening of a large number of transformants to identify the desired mutant. An efficient method of gene replacement was developed, and factors affecting the efficiency of this method were evaluated using two plant pathogenic fungi, Magnaporthe grisea and Fusarium oxysporum. This method is based on Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation with a mutant allele of the target gene flanked by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene as a conditional negative selection marker against ectopic transformants. The HSVtk gene product converts 5-fluoro-2\u2019-deoxyuridine to a compound toxic to diverse fungi. Because ectopic transformants express HSVtk, while gene replacement mutants lack HSVtk, growing transformants on a medium amended with 5-fluoro-2\u2019-deoxyuridine facilitates the identification of targeted mutants by counter-selecting against ectopic transformants. In addition to M. grisea and F. oxysporum, the method and associated vectors are likely to be applicable to manipulating genes in a broad spectrum of fungi, thus potentially serving as an efficient, universal functional genomic tool for harnessing the growing body of fungal genome sequence data to study fungal biology.\n\n\n\n \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1094], "author_name_tesi": "KHANG, CHANG HYUN ", "last_name_ssi": "KHANG", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "CHANG HYUN", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seogchan Kang", "Gary William Moorman", "David Michael Geiser", "Gretchen Anna Kuldau", "Timothy W Mcnellis", "Surinder Chopra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seogchan Kang, Committee Chair", "Gary William Moorman, Committee Member", "David Michael Geiser, Committee Member", "Gretchen Anna Kuldau, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Targeted gene replacement", "Transposable element", "Telomere", "Molecular evolution", "Genetic variability", "Gene-for-gene interaction", "AVR-Pita", "Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation", "Positive-negative dual selection"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MIXTURE INFERENCE AT THE EDGE OF IDENTIFIABILITY\n", "id": "8581", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1687", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parameter identifiability is very useful if one wishes to make inferences in a statistical model.

Note that the simulation based visualization method is a generally useful tool for picturing any inference function and its confidence sets in a frequentist framework.

Nonetheless, dynamics, such as various unexpected disruptions and uncertainties, in business operations have significant impact on decision-making efficiency. Adoption of wireless communication and sensor technologies has facilitated real-time visibility of the operational dynamics in manufacturing and supply chains. The availability of real-time information requires that new decision-making strategy design should consider: (1) constantly changing operational environment and (2) large amount of distributed information.\nThis thesis is motivated by a real world example relating to outbound logistics of an automobile manufacturers\u00a1\u00af supply chain. In specific, this thesis addresses the shipment yard operations, such as vehicle deployment and shipment load makeup, where an RFID-based wireless tracking system provides real-time information of vehicles. In order to investigate the impact of RFID-based wireless tracking on the shipment yard operations, new operational processes and corresponding decision-making models, which can effectively utilize real-time vehicle information, are designed.\nTo support and solve new decision-making models for vehicle deployment and shipment load makeup, this research introduces a market-based control mechanism, which is supported by a multiagent-based information system architecture. As a market-based control mechanism for vehicle deployment, an ascending price iterative auction mechanism is designed. For shipment load makeup, two different market structures, called a two-tier auctioning process and a single-tier auctioning process, are designed. In order to control each local market in these auctioning processes, an iterative bundle auction mechanism and an iterative high-bid auction mechanism are developed. The performance of the market-based mechanisms is verified through intensive empirical analysis supported by optimal solutions obtained by solving the mathematical programming models. The results support point to high levels of solution quality and computational efficiency of the proposed market-based mechanism. Finally, the proposed decision-making models and market-based control mechanisms improve the operational performance of vehicle deployment and shipment load makeup by effectively responding to the operational dynamics and incorporating the real-time information from the RFID-based wireless tracking system.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3166], "author_name_tesi": "KIM, JIN DAE ", "last_name_ssi": "KIM", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "JIN DAE", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "M Jeya Chandra", "Susan H Xu", "Shang Tae Yee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Chair", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Member", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Susan H Xu, Committee Member", "Shang Tae Yee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["RFID", "Multiagent-based Systems", "Market-based Control", "Supply Chains"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Forced Response of Swirl Stabilized Flames in Hydrogen Enriched Gas Turbines\n", "id": "9750", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3639", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The forced response of swirl-stabilized lean-premixed turbulent flames to inlet velocity and/or equivalence ratio oscillations in hydrogen enriched laboratory-scale gas turbine combustors was experimentally investigated. To characterize the response of premixed and partially premixed flames, several measurement techniques were used. Inlet velocity and equivalence ratio fluctuations were measured by the two-microphone method and the infrared absorption technique, respectively. Global heat release oscillations were determined by measuring naturally occurring flame chemiluminescence emissions using photomultiplier tubes. Steady-state flame structure and phase-resolved flame dynamics were characterized by CH* chemiluminescence imaging using an intensified CCD camera. \nResults show that the response of a premixed flame to inlet velocity oscillations is strongly dependent on the effective flame length. This extends previous experimental and analytical results from laminar to turbulent premixed flames. The nonlinear response of the flame is manifested by shear layer rollup and unsteady flame liftoff, depending on the amplitude of perturbations. The response of hydrogen-enriched flames is linear, irrespective of vortex shedding. The forced response of a flame to equivalence ratio oscillations alone was achieved by using a fuel modulation method. When the flame is perturbed by mixture ratio modulations, it shows both linear and nonlinear responses. The nonlinearity is associated with the intrinsically nonlinear dependence of burning velocity and equivalence ratio upon the heat release. Finally, the response of a partially premixed flame to perturbations of both inlet velocity and equivalence ratio was studied. Unsteady local extinction events were identified as a mechanism of nonlinearity, which results from flame stretching effects. In particular, unsteady local extinction is more obvious in the nonlinear dynamics of hydrogen enriched partially premixed flames. The phase difference between inlet velocity and equivalence ratio nonuniformities is a key parameter controlling the linear and nonlinear response of a partially premixed flame. Results also show that in the linear regime, the response of a partially premixed flame can be reconstructed using the responses of a flame to velocity and equivalence ratio, using a vector summation rule.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3619], "author_name_tesi": "KIM, KYU TAE ", "last_name_ssi": "KIM", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "KYU TAE", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Karen Ann Thole", "Vigor Yang", "Steven Lurie Garrett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca, Dissertation Advisor", "Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Chair", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member", "Vigor Yang, Committee Member", "Steven Lurie Garrett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogen", "combustion instability", "flame transfer function", "partially premixed", "swirl stabilized"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DYNAMIC CONGESTION GAMES AND DYNAMIC TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT\n", "id": "11316", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6356", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The notion of a game-theoretic equilibrium that we study called Nash equilibrium has been arisen by many economists and engineers but the relationship of such equilibria to certain nonextremal problems has not been discussed well. Variational inequality, fi\u2026xed point problem and nonlinear complementarity problem is known as a formalism for Nash Equilibrium. In vehicular traffic science, a Nash-like equilibrium is know as user equilibrium. In this dissertation, we study a dual-time-scale formulation of dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) with demand evolution. Our\nformulation belongs to the problem class that Pang and Stewart (2008) refer to as differential variational inequalities. It combines the within-day time scale for which route and  departure time choices \u2021actuate in continuous time with the day-to-day time scale for which demand evolves in discrete time steps. Our formulation is\nconsistent with the often told story that drivers adjust their travel demands at the end of every day based on their congestion experience during one or more previous days. We show that analysis of the within-day assignment model is tremendously\nsimplified by expressing dynamic user equilibrium as a differential variational inequality. We also show there is a class of day-to-day demand growth models that allow the dual-time-scale formulation to be decomposed by time-stepping to yield a sequence of continuous time, single-day, dynamic user equilibrium problems. To solve the single-day DUE problems arising during time-stepping, it is necessary to repeatedly solve a dynamic network loading problem. We observe that the network loading phase of DUE computation generally constitutes a differential algebraic equation (DAE) system, and we show that the DAE system for network loading based on the arc delay model (LDM) of Friesz et al. (1993) may be approximated by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). That system of ODEs, as we demonstrate, may be e\u00a2 ciently solved using traditional numerical methods for such problems. To compute an actual dynamic user equilibrium, we introduce a continuous time fi\u2026xed-point algorithm and prove its convergence for effective path delay operators that allow a limited type of nonmonotone path delay. We show that our DUE algorithm is compatible with network loading based on the LDM and the cell transmission model (CTM) due to Daganzo (1995).We provide a numerical example based on the much studied Sioux Falls network. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6356], "author_name_tesi": "KIM, TAE IL ", "last_name_ssi": "KIM", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "TAE IL", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Terry Lee Friesz", "Tao Yao", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Robert D Weaver", "Terry Lee Friesz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Terry Lee Friesz, Dissertation Advisor", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Member", "Robert D Weaver, Committee Member", "Terry Lee Friesz, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Differential Algebraic Equation", "Dynamic Traffic Assignment", "Dynamic User Equilibrium"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "EFFECT OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF COGNITION AND INTERACTIVITY OF ADJUNCT QUESTION ON INDIVIDUALIZED WEB-BASED INSTRUCTION", "id": "7218", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6843", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the instructional relationship between the cognitive level of adjunct question type (fact vs. comprehension) and the type of student interactivity (Type 1: Associative processing with simple-click activity vs. Type 2: Associative and referential processing with drag-drop activity) on tests measuring different instructional objectives. 106 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to four treatment groups.

Organic electronics, which utilizes the electrical properties of organic materials in the active or passive layers, is an emerging technology that has received much attention.  In conjunction with today\u2019s demands for new materials and devices, many technologies have emerged for developing organic electronics and consolidating applications and markets.  An organic thin-film transistor is the essential device in this paradigm in addition to organic photodiodes and organic light emitting diodes.\n\nThis thesis presents advances made in design and fabrication of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) using small-molecule organic semiconductors (pentacene, anthradithiophene, and their derivatives) as the active layer with record device performance.  In this work OTFT test structures fabricated on oxidized silicon substrates were utilized to provide a convenient substrate, gate contact, and gate insulator for the processing and characterization of vapor-deposited organic materials and their transistors.  By developing a gate dielectric treatment using silane coupling agents the performance and yield of pentacene OTFTs was improved and a field-effect mobility of larger than 2 cm2/V-s was achieved.  Such device performance is comparable to a-Si:H TFTs and have the potential for electronic applications.\n\nIn addition, the first direct photolithographic process for top contacts to pentacene OTFTs on oxidized silicon with an acceptable performance (a field-effect mobility of > 0.3 cm2/V-s, an on/off current ratio of 10^7, and a subthreshold slope of 1 V/decade) was developed.  The multiple layer photoresist process demonstrated the feasibility of creating source and drain metallic electrodes on vapor-deposited pentacene thin films with a resolution less than 10 \u00b5m.\n\nSubsequently solution-processed OTFTs were then investigated and high performance transistors with a processing-temperature of less than 90 \u00baC, with field-effect mobilities > 1 cm2/V-s and an on/off current ratio of 10^6.5, developed.  This record performance was obtained with devices based on triethylsilylethynyl anthradithiophene (TES ADT) and triisopropylsilylethynyl pentacene (TIPS pentacene).  Chemically modified source and drain contacts and gate dielectric were used to achieve such device performance, a performance that is still limited by the contacts.  The studies were extended to several solution deposition methods which included blade coating, bar coating, dip casting, and spin casting.  In addition to the above two materials, the design and characterization of four synthesized organic semiconductors with substituted functional groups was carried out.  In this work it was found that the stacking of molecules with a large and two-dimensional pi-orbital overlap is crucial in determing its device performance and electron transport.  The results of such molecular design approach offer great potential of obtaining suitable materials for large-area, low-cost electronic applications using low-temperature solution-processing technology.\n\nIt is shown in this work that desirable performance can be achieved both vapor-deposited and solution-processed OTFTs.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1232], "author_name_tesi": "KUO, CHUNG-CHEN ", "last_name_ssi": "KUO", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "CHUNG-CHEN", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Christopher Roman Wronski", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Qing Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Chair", "Christopher Roman Wronski, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["solution processing", "silane coupling agent", "organic semiconductors", "organic thin film transistors", "pentacene", "anthradithiophene", "field effect mobility"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "HIERARCHICAL SPARSE GRAPH COMPUTATIONS ON MULTICORE PLATFORMS", "id": "15185hzk134", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15185", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Graph analysis is widely used to study connectivity, centrality, community and path analysis of social networks, biological networks, communication networks and any interacting objects that can be represented as graphs.

PKC uses less memory and has less synchronization overhead as compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

Despite continual controversy over the definition of the categories of art and artifacts, researchers generally agree that visual culture in the postmodern and post-historical context, must embrace all forms of expression.  That the word \"artifact\" has art embedded in it is no mere coincidence.  Art and artifacts are a reflection of a culture, past and present.  As such all objects, grand and small, good and bad, become part of the material culture of any given society.  These cultural artifacts, once considered \"craft\" narrow the gap between European and non-European cultures.  Hence, the focus of my inquiry is on how the study of artifacts can help to eliminate distinctions that have been drawn and are still prevalent between art and artifacts.  \nUsing the pedagogy of material culture studies, I examine three questions:  (a)  How can material culture studies, mediated by the cultural artifacts of the Bohra, be integrated into art education at the same level as the study of paintings and sculptures?  (b)  What is the link between the artifactual and art, vis-\u00e0-vis the dress, containers, and furniture of the Bohra?  (c)  How can artifacts become markers of a cultural identity for a people who are dispersed throughout the world as the Bohra are?  These primary questions provoke further inquiry and analysis of the meaning Bohra families attach to their material world.  \nThis research is an ethnographic study of the culture of a specific community-the Bohra.  As such, the interconnectedness of informants, artifacts and researcher was crucial.  I employed participant observation as the main tool, supplemented by interview \nquestions, for data collection.  I used an intensive sampling of three families and 24 informants to provide me with information.  The selection criterion was based on the socio-economic status of each family.  In preparation for this study, I made preliminary contacts and conducted interviews with four Bohra families living in the state of Pennsylvania.  The pilot study was particularly useful for revising some of my interview questions and how I presented myself to my informants.  My research venue was Kenya, and although I interacted with the informants for only six weeks, any disadvantage accrued by this relatively short period was in part mitigated by my emic role.  As a Bohra, I was able to capture the subtle nuances of attitudes to interpret the significance of artifacts and bring to the research the viewpoint of an observer as participant.  Furthermore, knowledge of their language, customs, rites and rituals created an instant rapport between the researched and the researcher.  I have also interspersed this study with narratives of experiences and memories that are inherent to the understanding of the close relationship between artifacts and artificers.  \nThe raison d'\u00eatre of this study was the hypothesis that material culture studies and art education can be partners-each supporting and complementing the other.  This research study enabled me to understand the role of artifacts and how the Bohra make sense of their lives through using them.  Because I am a Bohra, I opted to study the artifacts of my culture.  I suggest that art educators can utilize artifacts that are familiar to their students to include material culture studies in an art education program.  Toward this end, I discuss three inquiry methods that can be employed to teach art.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6109], "author_name_tesi": "Kader, Themina ", "last_name_ssi": "Kader", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Themina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius", "Patricia Marie Amburgy", "Dr Paul Bolin", "E Paul Durrenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Committee Member", "Patricia Marie Amburgy, Committee Member", "Dr Paul Bolin, Committee Chair", "E Paul Durrenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Material culture studies", "artifacts of the Bohra", "Art education"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "TERRAIN-AIDED LOCALIZATION USING FEATURE-BASED PARTICLE FILTERING", "id": "11892", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5976", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The localization of vehicles on roadways without the use of a GPS has been of great interest in recent years and a number of solutions have been proposed for the same.

Conventional hot wire measurements in isothermal flow systems could generate highly repeatable and accurate instantaneous velocity measurements. The temporal response of these sensors could be in a range from a few Hertz to a few hundred Kilo Hertz depending upon the diameter of the hot wire, thickness of the hot film, fluid type, flow Reynolds number and the type of the hot wire bridge employed. However, when the local temperature in a flow system noticeably varies during the experiment, instantaneous velocity measurements starts producing non-negligible measurement errors. This is especially true if the hot wire/hot film sensor is calibrated at a single \"pre-selected\" flow temperature. The present thesis uses a non-linear curve fitting approach for a temperature dependent calibration of the hot wire/hot film sensor.\nThe method discussed in this thesis is geared towards obtaining accurate instantaneous velocity measurements in turbomachinery systems in which the mainstream temperature variations from the start to the end of a given test is strong. The current methodology was developed and tested in the Axial Flow Turbine Research Facility AFTRF at Penn State in which a typical temperature rise is about 15oC for every hour of operation. The specific non-linear curve fitting approach selected corrects the hot wire based instantaneous velocity measurements with great effectiveness as long as the mean flow temperature at the inlet of the turbine facility AFTRF is known. In general, another source like a thermocouple or thermistor based temperature probe is utilized in parallel to the hot wire sensor based velocity measurements.\nCimbala & Park (1990) developed a new method for calibrating hot-wire/film anemometer that can be utilized in the incompressible flow, where there are significant ambient temperature variations. The current study implemented the specific non-linear curve fitting\niv\napproach in a turbomachinery research facility where the operating temperature at the inlet varies at a non-negligible rate.\nAfter calibrating a hot-film sensor using the calibration method, a hot-film anemometer was utilized to measure turbulent flow characteristics at the inlet of the AFTRF which is located at the Turbomachinery Aero-Heat Transfer laboratory at Pennsylvania State University.\nThe AFTRF turbine was run for twice; the first time was in a cold day (301oK) and the second run of the facility was done in a hot day (309oK). Then results from the both days, proved that by calibrating the output signal utilizing the non-linear curve fitting method, they will be almost the same and the uncertainty of the flow velocity will be minimized to about 1.25% of the mean flow velocity. Furthermore, the calculated velocity from the Cimbala & Park calibration method was used to obtain the turbulent flow characteristics, such as RMS velocity, mean velocity, turbulence intensity, turbulence length scale and etc. The present thesis explains the first implementation of the non-linear curve fitting based instantaneous velocity measurement method in a turbomachinery research facility where temporal and spatial temperature variations are significant.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9918], "author_name_tesi": "Kafaee Razavi, Abbas ", "last_name_ssi": "Kafaee Razavi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abbas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Turbomachinery", "Turbulence", "Hot-Film", "Hot-Wire", "Fluid Dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Understanding The Structure Of Cellulose Microfibrils Using Vibrational Sum-frequency-generation (SFG) Spectroscopy In Intact Plant Cell Walls And Processed Biomass", "id": "29042", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12409", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the plant growth and development requires a comprehensive knowledge of hierarchical structure of cellulose in the plant cell wall.  Higher plant cell walls consist of cellulose that forms an ordered fibrillary structure, called cellulose microfibril (CMF), which makes up the important three-dimensional architecture of the plant cell wall together with non-cellulosic cell wall polymers like hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin. To probe the structural ordering of CMFs in the intact plant cell wall, this study uses vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy due to its unique detection selectivity towards crystalline cellulose.  SFG spectral features of plant cell wall derives from several different structural aspects of cellulose such as crystal structure, crystalline amount, orientation, packing and bundling of CMF in the mesoscale. Careful interpretation of SFG spectral features complemented by the nanoscale structural information from well-established analytical techniques (including x-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared vibrational spectroscopy) has uncovered rich information on the assembly of CMF. Hence, these structural insights can provide important implications on plant growth and development as well as biomass utilization.\nWe utilized SFG to probe the CMF orientation, which has been shown to play an important role in plant cell wall biomechanics and expansion. To better understand the changes in CMF orientation through developmental stages, the epidermal cell walls from different scales of onion bulb were used. SFG analysis of the cell wall showed that the CMF from older scales were aligned along the transverse axis of the cell. This was observed through the large difference in alkyl/hydroxyl peak intensity ratio between cell longitudinal and transverse axis. The lack of differences in alkyl/hydroxyl peak intensity ratio of younger epidermal walls indicated a dispersed CMF arrangement. The net orientation observed from SFG matched the surface orientation imaged by atomic force microscopy.  In addition, the effect of CMF arrangement on the SFG peak profile was investigated using highly oriented and thick CMFs from tension wood and the spatially distributed CMFs from compression wood. The hydroxyl peak along the alignment direction in tension wood was highly enhanced, indicating the orientation of CMFs along the fiber cell wall direction; the alkyl/hydroxyl peak intensity ratio was lowered in compression wood, indicating the spatial dispersion of CMFs. These studies from the onion epidermal cell walls, tension wood and compression wood concluded that alkyl/hydroxyl peak intensity ratio is an important determinant of CMF alignment and packing.    \nSFG was employed along with x-ray diffraction (XRD) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy to detect the presence of cellulose polymorphs in cotton fabrics processed with mercerization and liquid ammonia treatment in the commercial textile mills. Partial conversion of cellulose I to cellulose II and III were identified by SFG, XRD and IR, which is important in determining the physical property of cotton fabrics. In addition, application of SFG alongside other complementary techniques has helped to characterize the structural state of cellulose in the lignocellulosic biomass during multiple cycles of delignification using oxygen and sodium chlorite. The cellulose crystalline amount was quantified using SFG calibration curve and we found that both delignification methods showed an increase in cellulose crystalline amounts but did not show 1:1 correlation with measured glucan amounts from sugar analysis. The non-linear increase in crystalline amounts calculated from SFG intensity also accompanied aggregation of CMFs, observed from an increase in XRD crystal size. Furthermore, common physical factor responsible for decrease in cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis rate in Avicel, bleached softwood and bacterial cellulose was investigated using several characterization techniques. The degree of polymerization, XRD crystal size, XRD crystallinity and mesoscale packing of cellulose in the tested substrate did not correlate well with the decreased hydrolysis rate. From the elemental analysis of cellulose substrate using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we showed that the adsorption of denatured protein or hydrolysis products blocked the fresh substrate sites limiting the hydrolysis rate. The accessibility of the CMF surface was deemed to be the most common physical factor responsible for decreased hydrolysis rate over the long hydrolysis duration. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11775], "author_name_tesi": "Kafle, Kabindra ", "last_name_ssi": "Kafle", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kabindra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong H Kim", "Daniel J Cosgrove", "Harry R Allcock", "Lasse Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seong H Kim, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel J Cosgrove, Committee Member", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Member", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cellulose", "sum frequency generation spectroscopy", "cellulose microfibril orientation", "polarized infrared", "biomass"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Visualizing the Chaotic Body in Popular Culture\n", "id": "10231", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5488", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The proliferation of traumatized bodies on screen is matched by the proliferation of body studies in the humanities and social sciences. The interest in the body has exploded among a number of fields of study and is a staple in visual culture. What is happening in contemporary representation and spectatorship of pain and \u2018ruined bodies\u2019?  What is the relationship of contemporary visuality, the ruined body, and the social? Finally, what is the mode of selfhood deployed in contemporary visual culture and how is it related to other discursive-institutional realms of practice?\n\tIn this dissertation I consider three fictional visual texts that elucidate particular institutional realms within which the body is centrally figured; these texts are the medical drama House M.D., the first three films of the horror series Saw, which draws heavily on religious discourse and  iconography, and the forensic investigation drama Bones. The purpose is to consider the ways in which these texts represent the practices of each realm as well as the visualization of the body itself and the model of the self and the social deployed in each. I am proposing that these texts are not just symptomatic of cultural concerns, but that they help to articulate and constitute these concerns by incorporating and articulating them with other regimes of knowledge and representation. Moreover, as the literature on visual media, science, and culture has shown, the visual conventions developed and deployed in one arena of inquiry are rarely, if ever, unaffected by developments in other arenas of knowledge and culture nor do they remain in in the \u2018originating\u2019 realm of practice but become quickly entangled in or create new nodes with other institutional-discursive realms. I conclude in the final chapter by arguing that the use of open bodies in contemporary visual culture -- a characteristic of all three analyzed texts and others -- can be read through the notion of the grotesque body, and I will discuss the ways in which each text\u2019s treatment of the grotesque body reflects broader socio-cultural shifts. I also consider some of the themes that emerge across the texts, which I suggest, are symptomatic of broader cultural concerns. Each text privileges the body as a means of knowing the other and cultivates an attitude of awe toward an authority figure who is a master of reading the body and its visual artifacts. I argue that this privileging of the body in popular culture is one cultural manifestation of an emerging challenge to dialogic and confessional practices in other realms. I then consider the implications of this for our notions of subjectivity by placing the challenge to confession alongside the implications of another conceptual recuperation in the texts studied here, that of the indexical property of the image. Bringing together two trends documented by a number of scholars, I suggest that visual mediation of the body may soon become a dominant means of understanding the self and others and speculate on some of the implications of this for contemporary modes of self making, the possibility for communication and cooperation, the limits of surveillance practices, and the nature of evidence in several (legal, medical, interpersonal) settings.   \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5479], "author_name_tesi": "Kahle, Shannon  Miller", "last_name_ssi": "Kahle", "middle_name_ssi": "Miller", "first_name_ssi": "Shannon ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Dennis Karl Davis", "Matthew Frank Jordan", "Stephen Howard Browne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Paul Mcallister, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Paul Mcallister, Committee Chair", "Dennis Karl Davis, Committee Member", "Matthew Frank Jordan, Committee Member", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["visual rhetoric", "the body", "popular culture"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Variable Selection in Robust Linear Models\n", "id": "8276", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "806", "abstract_tesi": "Variable selection plays very important roles in statistical learning.

A number of authors have systematically studied the theoretical properties of various penalized least squares estimators.

The concerns of the research are efficiency, robustness and sparsity.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we propose complete composite quantile regression (CQR) procedures for estimating both the regression function and its derivatives in fully nonparametric regression models by using local smoothing techniques. The CQR estimator was recently proposed by Zou and Yuan (2008) for estimating the regression coefficients in the classical linear regression model. The asymptotic theory of the proposed estimator was established. We show that, compared with the classical local linear least squares estimator, the new method can significantly improve the estimation efficiency of the local linear least squares estimator for commonly used non-normal error distributions, and at the same time, the loss in efficiency is at most 8.01% in the worst case scenario.\n\nIn Chapter 4, we further consider semiparametric models. The complexity of semiparametric models poses new challenges to parametric inferences and model selection that frequently arise from real applications. We propose new robust inference procedures for the semiparametric varying-coefficient partially linear model. We first study a quantile regression estimate for the nonparametric varying-coefficient functions and the parametric regression coefficients. To improve efficiency, we further develop a composite quantile regression procedure for both parametric and nonparametric components. To achieve sparsity, we develop a variable selection procedure for this model to select significant variables. We study the sampling properties of the resulting quantile regression estimate and composite quantile regression estimate. With proper choices of penalty functions and regularization parameters, we show the proposed variable selection procedure possesses the oracle property in the terminology of Fan and Li (2001).\n\nIn Chapter 5, we propose a novel estimation procedure for varying coefficient models based on local ranks. By allowing the regression coefficients to change with certain covariates, the class of varying coefficient models offers a flexible semiparametric approach to modeling nonlinearity and interactions between covariates. Varying coefficient models are useful nonparametric regression models and have been well studied in the literature. However, the performance of existing procedures can be adversely influenced by outliers. The new procedure provides a highly efficient and robust alternative to the local linear least squares method and can be conveniently implemented using existing R software packages. We study the sample properties of the proposed procedure and establish the asymptotic normality of the resulting estimate. We also derive the asymptotic relative efficiency of the proposed local rank estimate to the local linear estimate for the varying coefficient model. The gain of the local rank regression estimate over the local linear regression estimate can be substantial. We further develop nonparametric inferences for the rank-based method. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to access the finite sample performance of the proposed estimation procedure.

Translational diffusion studies focus on ionic liquid solvents N-alkyl-N-methyl-pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imides [Prn1][Tf2N], with n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [P14,6,6,6][Tf2N].  Solutes include fused or bridged aromatics, fluorinated and nitrile-substituted benzenes, tetraphenylphosphonium benzoate, and other ionic liquids.  Translational diffusion coefficients were measured using the longitudinal-eddy-current delay (LED) stimulated echo NMR pulse sequence with bipolar gradient pulse pairs.  Applied field strengths were 400 and 850 MHz for 1H frequency.  Additional data were collected, from various sources in the literature, for both IL solvent and conventional solvent systems.  These data were used both as a point of comparison for our own measurements and as a broader sampling of solutes and solvents, allowing for an assessment of the effect of solute-solvent properties on the friction coefficient.  \n\nAlthough the diffusion of solutes has been widely studied in conventional solvents and, to a lesser degree, in ionic liquids, many deviations from hydrodynamic predictions continue to be reported, often accompanied by their own competing models and hypotheses.  One common deviation is that of sub-slip diffusion of small solutes in dilute solution.  Study of such cases has been difficult because many of the more commonly-used analysis techniques are unable to measure small solutes or are prone to error.  By contrast, NMR spectroscopy is ideal for such studies in that it is applicable for nearly all solutes, and provides more reproducible data than do several competing techniques.  Despite this fact, NMR has been little used in studying dilute small molecule diffusion in ionic liquids. As a result, our work in this area provides a significant amount of new data and insight.  \n\nWe find that deviations of translational diffusion coefficients from the Stokes-Einstein (SE) equation in ILs are analogous but more pronounced than those in conventional solvents, in part due to the typically larger size of IL solvents.  The ratio of solute-to-solvent size in IL solutions has a significant effect on the friction coefficient for translational diffusion, as it does for conventional solutions.  The friction coefficient is also affected, in both conventional solvents and ILs, by the difference in the intermolecular forces of the solute and of the solvent.  We find that the effect of solute shape on translational friction coefficient is minimal with respect to other sources of deviation from SE behavior.  We also consider several SE corrections which were proposed by other researchers for conventional solutions, and assess their accuracy for IL solutions.  \n\nRotational diffusion studies focused on a different set of (deuterated) samples; neat 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Im21][Tf2N], and a dilute solution of benzene  in1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate [Im41][BF4].  A series of solutions spanning 0 to 1 mole fraction of [Im21][Tf2N] in tetrahydrofuran (THF) was also analyzed.  Rotational diffusion coefficient measurements utilized a deuterium inversion recovery NMR pulse sequence, with spectrometers ranging in magnetic field strength from 300 to 850 MHz proton frequencies.  \n\nThe calculation of rotational correlation times, \uf074c, from NMR longitudinal decay times, T1, is so complex that it has often been simplified to the point of inaccuracy.  Any given molecule will likely have multiple rotational correlation times, depending on structure, symmetry, and internal rotational dynamics.  All correlation times, which may be similar in value, are comprised by a single T1 for each observed nucleus in a molecule.  The fractional contribution of each \uf074c to an observed value of T1 depends upon the placement of the observable nucleus within the molecule.  These multiple correlation times, combined with such factors as the structure and symmetry of the molecule, result in strikingly disparate correlations between \uf074c and T1 for different molecules.  Currently, it is common practice to calculate \uf074c using a single exponential dependence, the simplest of all relations to T1, despite the fact that this is only expected to be strictly correct for spherical molecules.  In this work, we present a method of interpreting NMR data in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to allow for a more accurate calculation of \uf074c.  \n\nThe temperature dependant rotational diffusion data we acquire by this method also contributes to the understanding of sub-slip rotations of small solute molecules in ionic liquids.  Although many authors have proposed many different hypotheses in an attempt to explain this behavior, there is still no consensus.  A systematic study by NMR has the advantage of accommodating smaller solute molecules than is possible using several of the more commonly-used techniques, while simultaneously providing greater reproducibility than can many other methods.  \n\nIn comparing rotational diffusion measurements made over a range of temperatures with three different magnetic field strengths to molecular dynamics simulations, we are able to fit various possible models for rotational correlation functions.  Specifically, we generate time correlation functions via variable-temperature MD simulations, fit them to a parameterized functional form, in order to represent the simulated time and temperature dependence.  Varying the parameters of such representations enables us to extract more meaningful rotational correlation functions and their temperature dependence from the measured NMR T1 data.  For both benzene and 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium, we find very fast dynamics that fall within the extreme narrowing regime at laboratory-accessible conditions, as well as slower dynamics.  The faster dynamics likely correspond to in-plane rotations, while the slower correspond to tumbling.  The slower component may be described with a single exponential or stretched exponential decay, but the faster component requires a bi-exponential.  Solutions of [Im21][Tf2N] and THF display a single-exponential decay with increasing viscosity.

Delivery of these pharmaceuticals to the retina, across the various barriers present in the eye, poses a significant hurdle that inhibits the full therapeutic potential of many drugs. Nanoliposomal technology is a promising drug delivery system that could be employed to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of clearance and distribution in ocular drug delivery to the retina. We developed a nano-scale version of an anionic, cholesterol-fusing liposome that can encapsulate therapeutic levels of minocycline capable of drug delivery. We demonstrate that size-extrusion followed by size-exclusion chromatography can form a stable 80nm liposome that encapsulates minocycline at a concentration of 450\u00ecM \u00b1 30\u00ecM, which is 2-3% of loading material. More importantly, these nontoxic nanoliposomes can then deliver 40% of encapsulated minocycline to the retina after a subconjunctival injection in the STZ-model of diabetes. Efficacy of therapeutic drug delivery was assessed via a transcriptomic biomarker panel previously validated as a surrogate endpoint for this animal model of DR. Although this liposomal drug combination displays efficacy similar to minocycline alone, the data presented here show the promise of nanoscale liposomal delivery systems to cross the tissues of the eye and deliver increased amounts of a drug directly to the retina.

In another study, we provide insights into the mechanism through which two pro-neuronal basic helix loop helix factors, Ascl1 and Ngn2, program general neurons with preferential inclinations towards specific neuronal subtypes.

Ideal prosthetic biomaterials should provide biomechanical stability to the abdominal wall, promote adequate tissue infiltration, decrease the risk of infection and scar tissue formation, and prevent intestinal adhesion development. In this study, we employed a novel approach to promote wound healing within the abdominal wall by creating layered, hierarchically porous tissue scaffolds using a soft, elastic, citrate based biodegradable photo-luminescent polymer (BPLP). These scaffolds were designed to provide a mechanical barrier for abdominal wall hernias while accelerating the tissue regeneration within the wound site. BPLP hernia scaffolds contain a unique three layer (wound, middle, protective) construction with varying porosities and pore sizes within each layer. The goal of this porosity gradient is to encourage cell in-growth, migration, and proliferation, while gradually transferring mechanical loads from prosthesis to newly generated tissues. Three different biodegradable photo-luminescent polymers, BPLP-Cys, BPLP-Cys-PEG (10%), and BPLP \u2013Cys-MDEA (10%), were synthesized to fabricate scaffolds with ranging degradation rates. The design for each materials scaffold was identical and contained 80%, 60%, and 30% porosities for the wound adjacent, middle, and protective layers, respectively. The pore sizes for each layer starting with the wound layer and moving outward are 250\u00b5m, 100\u00b5m, and 10\u00b5m, respectively. Polymers were mechanically mixed with salt of varying sizes and concentrations combined with salt leaching post crosslinking to fabricate the porous nature of the tested scaffolds. \nAdditionally, the in vivo compliance of citrate based BPLP-Cys polymer coatings was tested on two commercially available hernia meshes, BardSoft\u00ae and DualMesh\u00ae. Coated and non-coated meshes were compared in order to determine potential benefits of citrate based biomaterials for hernia applications. Overall, the results of these studies suggest that the use of citrate based biomaterials for hernia repair may provide significant advantages over conventional permanent prostheses. In general, citrate based biomaterials appear to demonstrate more cytocompatible behavior by mitigating foreign body response, promoting cell infiltrations, and preventing intestinal adhesion formation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11854], "author_name_tesi": "Kalaba, Srdan Ha", "last_name_ssi": "Kalaba", "middle_name_ssi": "Ha", "first_name_ssi": "Srdan", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jian Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jian Yang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hernia repair", "Hernia mesh", "Hernia prosthesis", "Hernia", "Citric Acid", "Citrate", "Biomaterials"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE REGULATION OF HIV REPLICATION IN MACROPHAGES: ROLE OF RON RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE", "id": "7532", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4971", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although the hallmark of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the depletion of CD4+ T cells, macrophages play an important role during HIV-1 infection and progression to AIDS. AIDS is a multifactorial disease characterized by inflammatory disorders, including those of the brain. Macrophages are early targets for HIV infection and play an important role in the development of pathologies such as HIV-associated dementia (HAD). In addition to being a significant source of virus in tissues, macrophages serve as long-term virus reservoirs due to their resistance to cytopathic effects of HIV.\nDuring a normal inflammatory response, negative feedback mechanisms exist within macrophages to regulate inflammatory signals, including HIV infection. One factor that negatively regulates inflammation in macrophages is the receptor tyrosine kinase RON. Our data indicate that RON is able to inhibit HIV transcription in part by decreasing the binding activity of NF-\u00eaB to the HIV LTR. Furthermore brain samples obtained from AIDS patients exhibited reduced RON protein. We also show that the docking site tyrosines 1353 and 1360 are required for RON to inhibit HIV transcription. These data suggest that RON initiates signaling pathways that negatively regulate HIV transcription in macrophages and that HIV infection is associated with decreased RON expression in the brain to assure efficient replication.\nOne of the strategies by which viruses evade the immune response is by down regulating cell surface receptors that are critical in innate immunity and protection of the host cell against inflammation. HIV encodes several proteins, including Tat, which have been demonstrated to modulate the expression of receptors critical for innate immunity including MHC class I, mannose receptor and \u00e22- microglobulin. We show that Tat produced intracellularly or in soluble form strongly promotes the ubiquitin proteosomal-dependent degradation of RON leading to a decrease in RON cell surface expression in monocytic cells and primary peritoneal macrophages. Cells expressing RON have decreased receptor expression following infection with HIV, whereas RON protein expression was not altered following infection with HIV clones that expressed a missense Tat. The Tat-mediated RON down regulation is a specific event and does not lead to a general turnover of the cell surface receptors since monocytic markers CD14 and ICAM-1 cell surface expression were not altered in presence and absence of Tat. We also find that the transactivation domain of Tat and the RON kinase domain are required for degradation of RON protein.\nIn summary, for disease progression, HIV would need to circumvent pathways, such as those initiated by RON, that negatively regulate inflammation. In this study we show that Tat is a potent repressor of RON leading us to speculate that this may be a mechanism to circumvent negative signals that inhibit HIV transcription and to evade the host immune response. The results of our studies highlight how HIV has evolved multiple mechanisms to manipulate the biochemical activities of the host cell to influence the cell\u2019s function and assure its efficient replication. In addition, understanding whether HIV modulates RON activity will provide critical insights into mechanisms that initiate and sustain HIV-associated pathologies as well as provide novel cellular targets that might be employed to control HIV replication and to treat AIDS.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4948], "author_name_tesi": "Kalantari, Parisa ", "last_name_ssi": "Kalantari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Parisa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Avery August", "Richard John Frisque", "Zhi Chun Lai"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HIV", "RON receptor tyrosine kinase", "Tat", "proteosome dependent degradation"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "O6-ALKYLGUANINE-DNA ALKYLTRANSFERASE - MEDIATED TOXICITY OF BIS-ELECTROPHILES: BIOCHEMICAL MECHANISMS\n", "id": "7914", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "127", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bis-electrophiles are compounds that are capable of forming cross-links between two nucleophilic sites. This chemical attribute has contributed to increased genotoxicity of such compounds in a variety of in vitro and in vivo biological test systems. Dibromoalkanes, which are one class of bis-electrophiles, are environmental toxic agents that have been used globally as pesticides, chemical intermediates and solvents in agriculture and industry. It has been shown that the DNA repair protein, O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), paradoxically augments the mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE) in Escherichia coli (E.coli). DBE reacts with AGT to generate a S-(2-bromoethyl) intermediate which forms a highly reactive half-mustard at the Cys145 alkyl acceptor site. Due to its DNA-binding ability, AGT can readily facilitate the reaction between DNA and the half-mustard thus causing the formation of DNA adducts. It is likely that in E. coli these covalent AGT-DNA adducts are the major factor mediating DBE-promoted genotoxicity. \nThe studies described in this thesis have examined human alkyltransferase (hAGT)-mediated toxicity with other bis-electrophiles, specifically butadiene diepoxide (BDO) and epibromohydrin (EBH), which are epoxide compounds. In vitro studies were performed to investigate the reaction of hAGT with BDO and EBH. Covalent binding to DNA was observed when purified recombinant wild-type hAGT (wt-hAGT) was incubated with either BDO or EBH in the presence of an [35S]\u2013labelled oligonucleotide. Unlike similar experiments with DBE, hAGT-DNA cross-link formation was also observed with both compounds when a mutant hAGT protein was used with its Cys145 active site residue altered to an alanine (C145A). This verified the ability of these epoxide compounds to cross-link at another residue on hAGT aside from its active site. Further analyses indicated the alternate cross-link site to be Cys150, a residue situated on the periphery of the repair protein active site pocket, in close proximity to the DNA binding motif of hAGT. Results obtained using gel electrophoresis assays led us to conclude that both BDO and EBH exhibit two different mechanisms for generating the AGT-DNA adducts. This adduct formation can occur via an initial reaction between both the protein and compound or between protein and DNA. \nStudies in hAGT-expressing E.coli and CHO cells have confirmed the potentiation of toxicity by BDO, EBH and the dibromoalkanes in both model systems. With EBH and BDO, the enhancement in genotoxicity was also observed in E.coli expressing the inactive C145A-hAGT mutant, albeit not to the same degree as seen with wt-hAGT. This AGT-mediated toxicity was eliminated following expression of a C145A/C150S-hAGT double mutant indicating that covalent DNA adduct formation at the Cys150 residue were likely responsible for the increased toxicity observed in E.coli expressing the C145A mutant. \nInvestigation into the types of genomic alterations induced at the bacterial rpoB gene locus and the mammalian CHO-HPRT gene locus reveal at least two distinct mechanisms for mutagenesis mediated by bis-electrophiles upon reaction with AGT. Previous mass-spectrometry studies revealed an N7-guanine adduct formed by an in vitro reaction between AGT and DBE, which can depurinate resulting in toxic abasic sites. Subsequent rounds of replication result in preferential mis-incorporation of adenine across from the adducted base resulting in G:C to T:A transversions, which we have detected in our mutation spectrum analyses. The other pathway(s) responsible for the additional mutations observed with our model systems has yet to be defined. However, our work in E.coli with and without a functional nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway have yielded some interesting insight into alternative processing of bis-electrophile induced covalent AGT-DNA cross-links.\nData from our laboratory utilizing E. coli with a proficient and deficient NER system indicate that this DNA repair pathway may augment hAGT-mediated dibromoalkane toxicity. Furthermore, we have extended these findings to include both BDO and EBH. Bacteria lacking a functional NER system are less susceptible to the mutagenic potential of the hAGT-DNA adducts formed during bis-electrophile exposure suggesting that the UvrABC complex of the bacterial NER pathway potentially binds to the site of the lesion. In this way, the UvrABC complex effectively shields the adduct from proteolysis and/or the action of other, more efficient repair proteins, while enhancing its susceptibility to error-prone trans-lesion synthesis, which manifests as an increase in mutation frequency of NER-proficient bacteria upon exposure to these compounds. \nOverall, these studies have extended the hAGT-repertoire of genotoxic activation to include epoxides, another class of bis-electrophiles. These compounds, unlike the dibromoalkanes, can react at both the Cys145 and Cys150 residues of hAGT. Furthermore, both BDO and EBH can potentiate their toxicity in the presence of AGT by two different mechanisms \u2013 via a compound-AGT intermediate or a compound-DNA intermediate. The ability to cross-link at two residues on hAGT as well as the two modes of mediating toxicity probably contribute to the increased toxicity seen in vivo. Our NER findings suggest that this pathway amplifies the genotoxicity observed with hAGT and bis-electrophiles and demonstrates the interaction of two DNA repair pathways to promote DNA damage induced by a group of environmental carcinogens. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [126], "author_name_tesi": "Kalapila, Aley George", "last_name_ssi": "Kalapila", "middle_name_ssi": "George", "first_name_ssi": "Aley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Edward Pegg", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Philip Lazarus", "Lisa M Shantz", "Robert G Levenson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Edward Pegg, Committee Chair", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member", "Philip Lazarus, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dibromoalkanes", "dibromomethane", "dibromoethane", "AGT", "O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase", "DNA repair", "Bis-electrophiles", "butadiene diepoxide", "epibromohydrin", "epichlorohydrin", "epoxides"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Production of Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and Related Sterols in Mushrooms with Exposure to Pulsed Ultraviolet Light", "id": "13864", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7196", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vitamin D status in humans worldwide presents itself as one the most important factors in human health. The classic bone diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency, rickets and osteomalacia, are still prevalent among certain subpopulations. In addition, modern research has found a putative link between vitamin D status and the risk of a host of diseases including various cancers, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, among others. Compounding the issue is the fact that in modern society, individuals spend less time exposed to sunlight due to various factors. Sunlight exposure is the main source of vitamin D, which is produced from the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the epidermis through UV irradiation. As such, the use of vitamin supplements and foods containing vitamin D are an important source. However, the number of foods that are sources of vitamin D is limited and more sources are needed.\n\nMushrooms are an abundant source of ergosterol, which is the precursor to vitamin D2. Mushrooms have been shown to contain small amounts of vitamin D2 when grown in the wild. Furthermore, the vitamin D2 content of cultivated mushrooms has been shown to increase with exposure to artificial UV light. The use of conventional continuous UV systems has been shown to take on the order of minutes to hours of exposure to increase the vitamin D2 levels to a significant level. The main objective of this study was to investigate the use of pulsed UV (PUV) light as a rapid and predictable method for increasing the vitamin D2 content of mushrooms and mushroom products.\n\nA study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a PUV system to increase the vitamin D2 content of a variety of mushrooms species (Agaricus bisporus, white and brown button mushrooms; Pleurotus ostreatus, oyster, and Lentinula edodes, shiitake) as well as several mushroom powders (Pleurotus eryngii, king oyster and Agaricus bisporus) and spent growing substrates containing mycelial biomass. Sliced white button mushrooms showed an increase from an initial level of 0 \u03bcg/g dw to 5.11 \u03bcg/g dw (325% DV/84g serving) after just one pulse. The PUV system generated 3 pulses per second, achieving an exposure time of less than one second with one pulse. Similar results were observed with brown button mushrooms, wherein vitamin D2 levels increased to 4.43 \u03bcg/g dw (362% DV/serving) with one pulse. Oyster mushrooms and shiitake contained higher initial levels of vitamin D2, 0.16 \u03bcg/g dw and 0.037 \u03bcg/g dw respectively, and the vitamin D2 content increased to 7.95 \u03bcg/g dw and 5.71 \u03bcg/g dw respectively after one pulse. All mushrooms tested had increasing levels of vitamin D2 with each additional pulse. The study also found that PUV was effective in increasing the vitamin D2 content of dried mushroom powders. With 4 pulses the vitamin D2 content of white button mushroom powder increased from near 0 to ca. 12 \u03bcg/g dw and increased with additional exposure of 16 total pulses to ca. 26 \u03bcg/g dw. Similar results were seen in king oyster mushroom powder with 10.4 \u03bcg/g dw and 23.0 \u03bcg/g dw vitamin D2 with 4 and 16 pulses, respectively. Spent mushroom substrate containing mycelial biomass contained lower levels of vitamin D2 (under 2 \u03bcg/g dw, with a maximum 16 pulses) when exposed to PUV. This study suggests that PUV is an effective and rapid means of increasing the vitamin D2 content of mushrooms and mushroom products with exposure times on the order of seconds.\n\nA dose-response study of the effect of PUV treatment on vitamin D2 content of Agaricus bisporus was conducted. In addition, factors influencing the conversion of ergosterol to vitamin D2 and effects of PUV on shelf life were also investigated. Fresh white button mushrooms were treated with PUV wherein vitamin D2 was found to rapidly increase to over 100% of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) per serving following 3 pulses. Following 12 pulses, vitamin D2 levels began to approach a maximum concentration of 27 \u03bcg/g dw. A shelf life study of PUV-treated mushrooms was carried out, where it was observed that the vitamin D2 produced with 3 pulses dropped from 11.9 \u03bcg/g dw to 9.05 \u03bcg/g dw after 3 days of storage; however, vitamin D2 levels remained nearly constant after this point throughout the 11-day study. The effect of PUV treatment on sliced and whole mushrooms was also evaluated. Significantly more vitamin D2 was produced in sliced mushrooms than in whole mushrooms: 113% and 81% less for brown and white button mushrooms, respectively. Vitamin D2 production in brown compared to white button mushrooms were also examined, and it was observed that whole and sliced brown mushrooms exposed to PUV generated significantly less vitamin D2 than their white counterparts (33% and 21% less for whole and sliced, respectively). Finally, several quality attributes were assessed in PUV-treated mushrooms. No significant differences between control and PUV treated mushrooms were observed. These findings suggest that PUV treatment is a viable method for increasing the vitamin D2 content of fresh mushrooms without adversely affecting quality.\n\nThe effect of PUV treatment of mushrooms on the production of photoproducts of ergosterol was investigated. In addition to vitamin D2, it is known that with UV exposure of ergosterol other products including previtamin D2, tachysterol2 and lumisterol2 are produced. White button mushrooms were sliced and treated in a single layer system with PUV irradiation increments from 0 to 60 pulses to determine the dose-response relationship between irradiation and photoproduct content. All photoproducts increased in a non-linear but dose-dependent manner as a function of increasing PUV irradiation. Vitamin D2 content approached a maximum value of ca. 124 \u03bcg/g dw with 60 pulses, and was observed to be the most abundant photoproduct with respect to yield. With 60 pulses, previtamin D2 content approached a maximum value of 44.6 \u03bcg/g dw, while lumisterol2 and tachysterol2 reached maximum levels of 30.5 \u03bcg/g dw and 24.7 \u03bcg/g dw, respectively.\n\nPUV has been shown to be an effective and rapid means of increasing the vitamin D2 content of mushrooms. Exposure times of approximately one second are more than sufficient to increase vitamin D2 to levels that are biologically significant. The shortest exposure time of any previous study using continuous UV regimes to achieve a level equivalent to 100% DV/serving was ca. 8 minutes. PUV treatment of mushrooms was also shown to have little to no effect on quality parameters as they relate to appearance and product quality. The presence of additional photoproducts of ergosterol in mushrooms was also demonstrated for the first time. These products may have some biological significance, which should be investigated in future studies. With the use of PUV, mushrooms can be a viable source of vitamin D2, which can aid in alleviating the persistent problem of vitamin D deficiency in humans.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7189], "author_name_tesi": "Kalaras, Michael David", "last_name_ssi": "Kalaras", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias", "Joshua D Lambert", "Robert Bruce Beelman", "Ali Demirci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias, Dissertation Advisor", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member", "Robert Bruce Beelman, Committee Member", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vitamin D", "mushrooms", "pulsed ultraviolet light"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EMISSION CHARACTERISTICS OF JP-8, JP-900, FISCHER-TROPSCH (FT) AND JP-8/FT BLENDS IN A MODEL GAS TURBINE COMBUSTOR \n", "id": "10080", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6389", "abstract_tesi": "The increasing usage of coal-based fuels in aviation turbines and fluctuating prices of the crude oil imports emphasizes the need to study and analyze alternate coal-based fuels like JP-900 and Fischer-Tropsch (FT), which can be obtained from nationally owned sources. Currently, JP-8 fuel is being used as an aviation fuel for the U.S. Air Force operations. The properties of JP-900 and FT need to be characterized and compared with JP-8 in order to determine their feasibility as the next generation aviation fuels. JP-900 is a coal-based fuel which has been developed to serve two purposes: providing propulsion energy and providing good heat sink capabilities. FT fuel, in contrast, is a clean burning fuel expected to produce very low pollutant emissions, soot and highly stable operation. \n\tGas turbine engines have temperature limitations. All efforts are being made to increase the operating pressure regimes of modern day combustors to improve overall combustion performance and achieve greater efficiencies. Increase in the operating pressures gives rise to higher adiabatic flame temperatures. High temperature is undesirable for the combustor linings and components downstream of the combustor, therefore, new methods are being developed to improve heat transfer from the combustor walls. A fuel with excellent heat sink capabilities can serve as a coolant for hot engine components. JP-900 exhibits good heat sink capability and oxidative stability at higher temperatures (9000F). However, successful development of a versatile, multiple-use fuel must achieve the desired operational characteristics of high combustion efficiency, excellent combustion stability, acceptable pollutant emission levels, and compatibility with current engine seals.\n\tCurrent requirements of strict emissions standards and improved stability are major areas of concern with regards to the usage of alternative jet fuels. Combustion instability can have damaging effects on combustor components. These instabilities are closely tied to the combustion geometry, fuel injection, fuel/air mixing properties and heat release characteristics. Combustion instability, CO and NOx emissions, and mean soot volume fraction vary with fuel composition. Therefore, changes in fuel composition may drastically affect the overall combustion and emission characteristics. These fuels would require a vigilant consideration through a well synchronized research program prior to being used in existing engines.\n\tThe current study investigates the feasibility of alternative coal-based jet fuels considering the combustion requirements of aviation turbines. JP-900, FT and (25/75), (50/50) JP-8/FT blends are studied and compared with JP-8. Experiments included in this research involve studying the combustion instability patterns, mapping emission levels and determining the sooting proclivity of the alternative fuels and blends. Results of this study indicate that the FT fuel produces lower soot volume fraction and emissions; however, this fuel cannot be used solely in current combustors due to inadequate seal swelling characteristics and fuel lubricity requirements. JP-900 and (25/75), (50/50) JP-8/FT blends, on the other hand, show acceptable results and, hence, can directly replace the existing JP-8 fuel, thereby reducing the dependence on crude imports.

However, the effects of fuel compositional variation have not been fully explored. The first study focusses on three different fuels, where each of them were evaluated using a single cylinder boosted HCCI engine using negative valve overlap. The three fuels investigated were: a regular grade gasoline (RON = 90.2), 30% ethanol-gasoline blend (E30, RON = 100.3), and 24% iso-butanol-gasoline blend (IB24, RON = 96.6). Detailed sweeps of intake manifold pressure (atmospheric to 250 kPaa), EGR (0 \u2013 25% EGR), and injection timing were conducted to identify fuel-specific effects. While significant fuel compositional differences existed, the results showed that all these fuels achieved comparable operation with minor changes in operational conditions. Further, it was shown that the available enthalpy from the exhaust would not be sufficient to satisfy the boost requirements at higher load operation by doing an analysis of the required turbocharger efficiency. \nWhile the first study concentrated on load expansion of HCCI, it is important to mention that controlling LTC strategies is difficult under low load or idle operating conditions. To ensure stable operation, fuel injection in the negative valve overlap (NVO) is used as one of method of achieving combustion control. However the combustion chemistry under high temperature and fuel rich conditions that exist during the NVO have not been previously explored. The second study focused on examining the products of fuel rich chemistry as a result of fuel injection in the NVO. In this study, a unique six stroke cycle was used to segregate the exhaust from the NVO and to study the chemistry of the range of fuels injected during NVO under low oxygen conditions. The fuels investigated were methanol, ethanol, iso-butanol, and iso-octane. It was observed that the products of reactions under NVO conditions were highly dependent on the injected fuel\u2019s structure with iso-octane producing less than 1.5% hydrogen and methanol producing more than 8%. However a weak dependence was observed on NVO duration and initial temperature, indicating that NVO reforming was kinetically limited. Finally, the experimental trends were compared with CHEMKIN (single zone, 0-D model) predictions using multiple kinetic mechanism that were readily available through literature. Due to the simplicity of the model and inadequate information on the fuel injection process, the experimental data was not modeled well with the mechanisms tested. Some of the shortcomings of the 0-D model were probably due to the model ignoring temperature and composition spatial inhomogeneities and evaporative cooling from fuel vaporization.\nThough the results from the NVO injection and boosted NVO-HCCI studies are enlightening, the fundamentals of the autoignition behavior of gasoline, alcohols, and their mixtures are not entirely understood despite the interest in high octane fuels in compression engines from a point of view of better thermal efficiency. The third study focused on higher octane blends consisting of binary and ternary mixtures of n-heptane and/or iso-octane, and a fuel of interest. These fuels of interest were toluene, ethanol, and iso-butanol. In this study, the autoignition of such blends is studied under lean conditions (\u03a6 = 0.25) with varying intake pressure (atmospheric to 3 bar, abs) and at a constant intake temperature of 155 \u00b0C. The blends consisted of varying percentages of fuels of interest and their research octane number (RON) approximately estimated at 100 and 80. For comparison, neat iso-octane was selected as RON 100 fuel and PRF 80 blend was selected as RON 80 fuel. It was observed that the blends with a higher percentage of n-heptane showed a stronger tendency to autoignite at lower intake pressures. However, as the intake pressure was increased, the non-reactive components, in this case, the higher octane blend components (toluene, ethanol, and iso-butanol), reduced this tendency subsequently delaying the critical compression ratio (CCR) of the blends. The heat release analysis revealed that the higher octane components in the blends reduced the low temperature reactivity of n-heptane and iso-octane. GC-MS and GC-FID analysis of the partially compressed fuel also indicated that the higher octane components did affect the conversion of the more reactive components, n-heptane and iso-octane, into their partially oxidized branched hydrocarbons in the binary/ternary blends, and reduced the overall reactivity which resulted in a delayed CCR at higher intake pressures.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10927], "author_name_tesi": "Kalaskar, Vickey Baliram", "last_name_ssi": "Kalaskar", "middle_name_ssi": "Baliram", "first_name_ssi": "Vickey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Randy Vander Wal", "Chunshan Song", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "James Szybist"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Dissertation Advisor", "Randy Vander Wal, Dissertation Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "James Szybist, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Autoignition", "Combustion", "Compression ignition", "Negative valve overlap", "Ignition behavior", "LTC", "HCCI", "PPC"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Women Writing War: The Evolution of the Girl Reporter 1845-1945\n", "id": "10530", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6409", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation traces the evolution of the \u201cgirl reporter\u201d in modern American literature and culture.

Several strategies have been designed to block metastasis of cancer cells (e.g. matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, HGF/c-Met inhibitors, and \u03b15\u03b21-integrin inhibitors). However, these approaches have yielded limited clinical success, in part, due to plasticity of cancer cells. RhoA and Cdc42 play critical roles in the regulation of plasticity of cancer cell migration/invasion and cell proliferation. Rho associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK1/2) and myotonic dystrophy kinase related Cdc42 binding kinase (MRCK\u03b1/\u03b2) are two structurally related Ser/Thr protein kinases. These kinases are downstream in the RhoA and Cdc42 signaling pathways associated with cancer cell migration and invasion. Hence, we hypothesized that simultaneous targeting of these two kinase families would be an effective therapeutic strategy to block migration, invasion, and growth of metastatic cancers.  \nTo this end, we identified DJ4, [(5Z)-2--5-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine-3-ylmethylene)-1,3-thiazol-4(5H)-one], as a novel inhibitor of ROCK and MRCK kinases. Using cell-free biochemical kinase activity assays, we showed that DJ4 potently inhibits the activity of ROCK and MRCK. In cellular functional assays, DJ4 treatment significantly blocked stress fiber formation, and inhibited migration and invasion of multiple cancer cell lines in a concentration dependent manner. In time-lapse microscopic cell migration studies, 5 \u00b5M DJ4 reduced migration of lung  and breast cancer cells by 2.7 and 5.5 fold respectively. We further examined the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of DJ4 in lung- and breast cancer cells. DJ4 treatment arrested the cancer cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle and/or induced the intrinsic apoptotic cell death pathway.\nTo study the critical functional groups required for its activity, we modified the chemical structure of DJ4 at various functional groups and synthesized analogs of DJ4. The resulting analogs were assessed for their ROCK1 inhibitory activity. We found that the chemical group containing pyridine, pyrrole, and thiazole moieties is critical and any modification on this group loses the activity of DJ4. However, modifications on phenethylamine group modulated the selectivity and potency of DJ4. These modifications resulted in four additional active analogs of DJ4: D110, DJ Allyl, DJE4, and DJ Morpholine. In cell-free kinase activity assays, DJ110 more potently inhibited ROCK and MRCK activity than DJ4. DJE4, DJ Allyl, and DJ Morpholine analogs have selectivity for ROCK over MRCK kinases. All these analogs were tested for anti migration, pro-apoptotic, and anti-proliferative effects in breast cancer cells. In cellular functional assays, DJ110, which was designed by reducing a carbon atom from DJ4, was the most efficacious. The effectiveness of these compounds was further investigated using National Cancer Institute\u2019s drug screening program in 60 human cancer cell lines representing nine different cancer types. All these results show that reduction in a single carbon atom from DJ4 increases its potency and efficacy. We also observed that dual inhibitors of ROCK and MRCK are more efficacious than ROCK selective inhibitors.  \nTogether, our studies strongly indicate that DJ4 and its analog, DJ110, are potent inhibitors of ROCK1, ROCK2, MRCK\u03b1, and MRCK\u03b2. These compounds effectively inhibit migration and invasion of multiple cancer cell types. Additionally, these inhibitors arrest the cancer cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. These compounds need to be further studied for their pharmacokinetics, anticancer, and toxic effects in relevant animal models.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11291, 11292, 11293, 11294, 11295, 11296, 11297], "author_name_tesi": "Kale, Vijaykumar P", "last_name_ssi": "Kale", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Vijaykumar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Toxicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jong Kak Yun", "Shantu G Amin", "Jong Kak Yun", "Shantu G Amin", "Dhimant Desai", "Victor J Ruiz Velasco", "Jeremy Andrew Hengst"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jong Kak Yun, Dissertation Advisor", "Shantu G Amin, Dissertation Advisor", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Chair", "Shantu G Amin, Committee Chair", "Dhimant Desai, Committee Member", "Victor J Ruiz Velasco, Committee Member", "Jeremy Andrew Hengst, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rho kinase", "MRCK", "anti-cancer drug development", "multikinase inhibitor"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Low-pH Fe(II) Oxidation Using a Bioreactor for the Treatment of Acid Mine Drainage", "id": "19837", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9529", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThis thesis examines the ability of a bioreactor to oxidize ferrous iron (Fe(II)) in acid mine drainage (AMD).  An abandoned coal and clay mine near Dean, PA produces AMD at a site known as Brubaker Run, and this site was used in the study.  Sediment and AMD were collected from Brubaker Run and used to enrich mixed-culture bioreactors in automated chemostats.  The reactors were periodically dosed with ferrous sulfate to increase the Fe(II) concentrations.  After the bioreactors were established, a series of flow-through experiments, with the reactors operating as completely-stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), were conducted to determine oxidation and removal rates at various operating conditions.\n\tTwo initial flow-through experiments were performed to determine an optimal hydraulic residence time.  These tests were performed the same way, and from the calculated oxidation efficiencies for each hydraulic residence time tested, 6 h was chosen as the optimal value. \n\tUsing this hydraulic residence time, experiments were then conducted by varying the reactor pH and influent Fe(II) concentration of the bioreactors.  Oxidation rates for these experiments increased with a decreasing reactor pH and with an increasing effluent Fe(II) concentration.  Although the influent concentration was varied, the effects of the effluent concentration were examined because this is the concentration that was present in the bioreactor and available to the microorganisms.  A saturation-like effect appeared to occur when the influent Fe(II) concentration reached the higher set points (1200 and 2400 mg/L).  There was also a possible saturation-like effect from the hydrogen ion concentration when the reactor pH was decreased to 2.6 and 2.3.  \n\tFrom the experimental data, a general rate law model can be written for biological Fe(II) oxidation.  Once simplified, it is only a function of the hydrogen ion and effluent Fe(II) concentrations.  Measured pH and effluent Fe(II) values at the different operating conditions can be input into the simplified equation to predict the oxidation rates that should have been measured.  The model\u2019s predicted rates are not very accurate in terms of being similar to the actual measured rates.  More experimental data or possibly even additional terms in the rate law equation are needed to produce a more accurate model.\n\tThe recorded addition of acid and base during the experiments can be used to show whether mainly Fe(II) oxidation or both Fe(II) oxidation and Fe(III) precipitation are occurring in the bioreactor.  The data show evidence that at pH < 2.9 there is mainly Fe(II) oxidation occurring, while at pH > 2.9 both Fe(II) oxidation and Fe(III)  precipitation are occurring.  pH=2.9 needs to be explored more because the data do not show evidence for the occurrence of only oxidation or both oxidation and precipitation.  The operating conditions are important because of the resulting reactions that they cause, and these reactions can be critical to the success of a treatment system.\n\tThe loading rates per area of the reactor (GDM) were found to be in the range of 9-448 g Fe(T)/d/m2 (Fe(T)=total iron), depending on the operating conditions.  Although this is a large range, the majority of the GDM values were above 60 g Fe(T)/d/m2, and many were even above 100 g Fe(T)/d/m2.  The measured bioreactor GDM values were much larger than those reported in the literature.

Bismuth-chalcogenide topological insulators have large spin orbit coupling leading to surface states defined by a helical Dirac cone. These surface states have potential for spintronics due to the \u201cspin-momentum locking\u201d of the surface electrons, and could be efficient for the generation or detection of spin currents. To study the efficiency of topological insulators for spin to charge conversion, heterostructures of topological insulator/ferromagnetic insulators were studied by ferromagnetic resonance spin pumping. To facilitate this work different topological insulators were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on the ferromagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet.\nThe first challenge in this work was to grow crystalline topological insulator thin films on the yttrium iron garnet substrate. This involved utilizing multiple temperature step growth via molecular beam epitaxy. While the Bi-chalcogenide topological insulators are reasonably well latticed match to InP(111)A (a=0.415 nm, <0.2% with Bi2Se3), yttrium iron garnet has a larger cubic unit cell with 1.24 nm lattice constant. Since the Bi-chalcogenide interlayer bonds are van der Waals forces, it is possible to overcome the lattice mismatch by lowering the surface energy to promote nucleation of the topological insulator film.\nNext, these topological insulator/yttrium iron garnet heterostructures were used for spin pumping studies of a pure spin current sourced from yttrium iron garnet to the topological insulator. In the topological insulator, this pure spin current is converted into a charge current. In this work, we explore the mechanism for the spin to charge conversion and determine it to be from the inverse Rashba-Eldelstein effect. The spin-charge conversion in the topological insulator is determined to be dominated by the surface states at the interface.\nWhile the spin pumping measurements are all performed at room temperature, magnetotransport measurements were performed on the topological insulator/ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures. At temperatures below ~2K, we observed features in the magnetoresistance that are not observed in topological insulators on non-magnetic substrates. These features have a long relaxation time and the mechanism is still being explored. We hypothesize that it originates in the relaxation of paramagnetic impurities in the yttrium iron garnet substrate, resulting in a phonon bottleneck that results in a magnetocaloric effect.\nLastly, we present work on a ferromagnet metal \u03c4-MnAl with strong out of plane magnetization. This material has a strong out of plane magnetic anisotropy and could be used for spintronics applications. We demonstrated successful growth by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs(001)B to stabilize the meta-stable tau phase. The magnetization of the film was characterized by SQUID and magneto-transport and shown to be robust with ~1T coercivity. The long term goal is to integrate this ferromagnetic layer with a topological insulator for spin-orbit torque switching devices.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16132], "author_name_tesi": "Kally, James Cameron", "last_name_ssi": "Kally", "middle_name_ssi": "Cameron", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth", "Nitin Samarth", "Chaoxing Liu", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Roman Engel-Herbert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth, Dissertation Advisor", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Chair", "Chaoxing Liu, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Roman Engel-Herbert, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Topological insulator", "ferromagnetic insulator", "MnAl"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Evaluating radiance and retrieval assimilation of Mars Thermal Emission Spectrometer Spacecraft observations", "id": "26390", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11449", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the current study two types of data assimilation approaches for updating atmospheric temperature profiles on Mars are explored.

In particular, these temperature profiles serve as the prior to the applied  filtering technique, an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Direct satellite measurements in  the form of Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) spectra of radiance available from the Planetary Data System (PDS), as well as Optimal Spectral Sampling (OSS) temperature retrievals deduced from PDS TES radiance spectra, are considered as the observations to be assimilated.

This need to communicate in a different language and culture remains a challenge for many immigrant families, forcing a number of them to rely on younger family members as \u201ccultural brokers.\u201d The literature on cultural brokering reveals that although such activities may be important for family, they may have both positive and negative consequences for the cultural brokering children. The pervasiveness of the immigrant experience suggests that this may present a significant public health concern and challenge to communication theory.\n\nThis dissertation called upon role theory, general strain theory, independent/interdependent scripts, and a translation-based theory to guide a line of research to address this concern. The first study examined a model of cultural brokering derived from the four theoretical perspectives. Tenets of these four perspectives argued that: (1) cultural brokering leads to parentification, (2) cultural brokering leads to stress, (3) cultural brokering does not lead to parentification, and (4) cultural brokering improves cognitive and linguistic skills. In turn, these processes, parentification, stress, and skills, influence health-related behaviors and academic performance. A more complex conceptualization of cultural brokering that separates the frequency of these actions from the attitudes toward these actions were posed as a means for resolving some of the inconsistencies in previous studies and synthesizing the theories. \n\nMexican-heritage youth (N = 1,110) from 23 public schools in Phoenix, AZ completed surveys at four waves, from 6th through 8th grades. Cultural brokering frequency had an indirect effect on alcohol use through adult parentification. Negative cultural brokering attitudes had an indirect effect on cigarette use through acculturation stress. English reading speed partially mediated the association between brokering frequency and grades, along with negative cultural brokering attitudes and grades. These findings emphasize how researchers must consider various aspects (e.g., frequency and attitudes) of cultural brokering because they are likely to operate differently in relation to health behaviors and academic performance. \n\nBecause cultural brokering frequency and negative cultural brokering attitudes have potentially harmful effects on Mexican-heritage youth, the second study examined whether a culturally-grounded school-based substance use prevention program, keepin\u2019 it REAL, had effects on initial levels and changes in ethnic identification and whether these changes, in turn, were associated with changes in cultural brokering frequency or negative cultural brokering attitudes. Mexican-heritage youth (NW4 = 676, NW5 = 586, NW6 = 508) from 23 public schools in Phoenix, AZ completed surveys at three waves, from 7th through 8th grades. The results revealed no significant program effects on initial levels or changes in ethnic identification. Only initial levels of ethnic identification were significantly associated with initial levels of cultural brokering frequency and negative cultural brokering attitudes. \n\nThis current body of research reveals that cultural brokering frequency places Mexican-heritage youth at risk for alcohol use through adult parentification, whereas negative cultural brokering attitudes place these youth at risk for cigarette smoking through acculturation stress. With respect to grades, as youth participated in cultural brokering more often, they were more likely to read English faster, and in turn, more likely to report higher grades. In contrast, as these youth reported higher levels of negative cultural brokering attitudes, they were less likely to read English fast and less likely to report higher grades. Given these key findings, prevention researchers must identify and target factors that will decrease negative cultural brokering attitudes and that will promote healthier coping strategies for cultural brokering youth. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2503], "author_name_tesi": "Kam, Jennifer A.", "last_name_ssi": "Kam", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael L Hecht", "Michael L Hecht", "Jon F Nussbaum", "Michelle E Day", "Pui Wa Lei"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael L Hecht, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael L Hecht, Committee Chair", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member", "Michelle E Day, Committee Member", "Pui Wa Lei, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mexican-heritage youth", "academic performance", "cultural brokering", "language brokering", "parentification", "general strain theory", "substance use"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "MULTIPARTY PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION:\nA PERSPECTIVE FOR EVOLVING SHARED MENTAL MODELS", "id": "7673", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3637", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Psychologists who have studied human team  performance point out that helping\nbehavior (e.g. proactive sharing of relevant information) in effective teams\nis achieved via an overlapping \u201cshared mental model\u201d that is developed and\nmaintained by members of the team.

As\na result, the irrefutable influence of anthropogenic CO2 released into the environment has\nconsiderably intensified global warming. Coal- and gas-fired power plants are considered one of\nthe major source points of fossil fuel consumption. Although renewable energy (i.e., solar, wind,\nand others) is considered as the ideal alternative to satisfy the future energy demand, in the\ninterim an actual solution is essential to remove the CO2 produced before its emission into the\natmosphere. Among various capturing processes, post-combustion capture is highly promising\ndue to the flexibility of CO2 removal via liquid or solid materials. The captured CO2 is then\nsequestered or converted into new chemical compounds. The capturing process is the most\nimportant and energy-intensive step. A major advantage of liquid phase adsorbents is their high\ncapacity; however, they suffer significantly from a high energy penalty. Solid phase adsorption,\nwhich has a lower energy requirement for regeneration, has therefore attracted much attention. In\nthe operating conditions of power plants, amine-impregnated support (Type I) sorbents are the\nmost promising among various solid sorbents, due to the high density of nitrogen-active sites, but\nsuffer from low capacity and efficiency compared to liquid phase absorption process. In order to\napproach the problem and understand the origin of this low efficiency, a scientific understanding\nof the interaction between CO2 and amine-impregnated supports and the influential parameters\ninvolved is necessary to further develop new and high-efficiency amine-based adsorbents.\nNovel experimental techniques have been utilized in this research to assess the kinetics\nand thermodynamics of CO2 adsorption. The influence of structure (linear vs. branch), amine\ndensity, amine type (primary, secondary, and tertiary), support surface functionalization, and\noperating conditions on the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO2 adsorption have been studied. A\niv\ncombination of volumetric adsorption (VA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) have\nbeen used to study the equilibrium capacity and thermodynamic parameters. The kinetic study has\nbeen conducted through a breakthrough reactor (BTR) coupled with a DSC to evaluate CO2\nadsorption kinetics.\nAt the equilibrium, linear amines, compared to branched amines, indicate a larger CO2\nadsorption capacity and lower apparent heat of adsorption. For example, the capacity and heat of\nadsorption for 40 wt% linear and branch polyethylenimine (PEI) measured to be 3.68 and 2.36\nmmolCO2/g, along with 68 and 71 kJ/molCO2 at 60oC and 1 bar CO2, respectively. The apparent\nheat of CO2 adsorption on amine sorbents consists of the intrinsic heat of adsorption, the energy\nrequirement for diffusion, and amine reorganization, which then approached the intrinsic heat of\nadsorption when the necessary energy was provided for CO2 diffusion and amine conformation.\nAugmenting the amine weight loading also increased the capacity and heat of adsorption. For\ninstance, TETA/SiO2 samples showed adsorption capacity enhancements from 0.34 to 1.87\nmmolCO2/g and heat of adsorption from 45 to 77 kJ/molCO2 as the weight loading increased\nfrom 5 to 40 wt% at 60oC and 1 bar CO2. Increasing the secondary amine in the linear structure\nalso assisted in enhancing capacity and decreasing heat of adsorption. For example, the CO2\nuptake for TETA and PEI423 increased from 1.87 to 3.68 mmolCO2/g and the heat of adsorption\ndeclined from 77 to 68 kJ/molCO2 at 60oC and 1 bar CO2. Polyethylenimine therefore presented\na better performance than molecular amines, which makes PEI more suitable for industrial\napplications. The criteria defined by the National Energy and Technology (NETL) for industrial\nutilization requires 3-6 mmolCO2/g adsorbent capacity to compete with current for carbon capture\nand sequestration (CCS) technologies. As yet, the criteria have been met; nevertheless, the\nadsorption efficiency displayed much lower values compared to the theoretical expectations\nbased on the proposed mechanism. For example, in theory, the efficiency for dry conditions is\nexpected to be 0.5, while reports in the literature revealed values of less than 0.3 in experiments.\nv\nEfficiency increases directly enhance on total capacity. Moreover, a decrease in heat of\nadsorption also provides a more appealing situation for real application in view of the fact that the\nenergy penalty for regeneration is reduced.\nThe kinetic investigation on the BTR/DSC combination showed similar results in terms\nof capacity, heat of adsorption, temperature variation, and secondary amine addition. High amine-\nOH interaction and low CO2 diffusivity into multilayer amines were found as the major issues for\nthe reduction in amine capacity and efficiency. For instance, the efficiencies for 10 wt% TETA\nimpregnated on silica and silica-modified surfaces (with octyl groups) at 60oC increased\nsignificantly from 0.16 to 0.35, respectively, indicative of reduced amine-OH interaction. In\naddition, efficiency was enhanced from 0.17 to 0.26 for 40 wt% TETA/SiO2 as the temperature\nascended from 25oC to 80oC, revealing the effect of facilitated diffusion. Increasing the number\nof secondary amines decreased the optimum heat of adsorption for the highest overall rates and\nalso increased the overall rates. For example, as the 2o/1o ratio increased from 1 to 2 for 40 wt%\namine-impregnated silica at 40oC, the optimum heat of adsorption was reduced from 85 to 69\nkJ/molCO2 and the overall rates were enhanced from 0.013 to 0.015 mmolCO2/g.s. This indicates\nthat an increase in the secondary amine ratio offers several benefits for CO2 adsorption. Surface\nfunctionalization toward hydrophobicity could also assist to improve capacity, efficiency, and\nCO2 adsorption kinetics as exemplified above for efficiency. For example, the overall adsorption\nrate for 10 wt% TETA/SiO2 at 25oC increased from 0.0075 to 0.0122 mmolCO2/g.s as the\nhydroxyl groups on the support were replaced with methyl groups. A rigorous spatiotemporal\nmodeling was applied to the BTR/DSC data to estimate the kinetics and thermodynamic\nparameters at isothermal conditions. This unique mathematical model predicted the adsorption\nand desorption rate constant as well as the heat of adsorption. The model circumvented\nunphysical simplifications, such as linear driving force and uniform adsorption rates, by\nconsidering dispersion and convection phenomena.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14378], "author_name_tesi": "Kamali Shahri, Seyed Mehdi Mehdi", "last_name_ssi": "Kamali Shahri", "middle_name_ssi": "Mehdi", "first_name_ssi": "Seyed Mehdi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Rioux", "Caroline Clifford", "Chunshan Song", "Xiaoxing Wang", "Ramakrishnan Rajagopalan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Rioux, Dissertation Advisor", "Caroline Clifford, Committee Chair", "Chunshan Song, Committee Member", "Xiaoxing Wang, Committee Member", "Ramakrishnan Rajagopalan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CO2 adsorption", "Kinetics", "thermodynamics", "heat of adsorption", "efficiency", "aminosilica material", "type I adsorbent", "surface chemistry", "surface modification", "CO2 adsorption modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A two-step CO<sub>2</sub> laser-sustained plasma nitriding process for deep-case hardening of commercially pure titanium", "id": "13576amk410", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13576", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Titanium and its alloys possess several attractive properties that include a high strength-to-weight ratio, biocompatibility, and good corrosion resistance. However, due to their poor wear resistance, titanium components need to undergo surface hardening treatments before being used in applications involving high contact stresses. Laser nitriding is a thermochemical method of enhancing the surface hardness and wear resistance of titanium. This technique entails scanning the titanium substrate under a laser beam near its focal plane in the presence of nitrogen gas flow. At processing conditions characterized by low scan speeds, high laser powers, and small off-focal distances, a nitrogen plasma can be struck near the surface of the titanium substrate. When the substrate is removed, this plasma can be sustained indefinitely, away from any potentially interacting surfaces, by the laser beam power and a cascade ionization process. This dissertation explores the unique effects of nitriding titanium in the presence of such a laser-sustained plasma (LSP) in a processing chamber open to the atmosphere, with the ultimate objective of forming wide-area, deep, crack-free, wear-resistant nitrided cases on commercially pure titanium substrates.\n\nFirst, nitriding experiments were conducted at three processing conditions with and without a prestruck LSP. From optical and scanning electron microscopy, weight measurements, and temperature measurements, it was found that LSP nitriding increased nitrogen intake into the titanium melt pool, reduced surface oxidation, and broadened the energy distribution without causing energy attenuation when compared to conventional laser nitriding; these effects were most pronounced at the highest scan speed and lowest off-focal distance. Next, the effect of processing conditions on surface and cross-sectional microstructures during LSP nitriding was systematically evaluated by studying twenty experimental cases at varying off-focal distances, scan speeds, and gas flow compositions (nitrogen diluted by varying amounts of argon). X-ray diffraction conducted on the top surface of the nitrided trails confirmed the presence of TiN and TiN<sub>0.3</sub> phases. Although nitrogen dilution by argon was found to be necessary to prevent crack formation, microstructural characterization and weight measurements revealed that argon addition limited nitrogen intake into the melt pool by reducing Marangoni convection in the melt pool. Elimination of surface cracks thus came at the expense of reduced nitrogen content, shallower melt depths, and a reduced control over the microstructure of the resulting nitrided layer. To overcome these problems, a two-step process was proposed and developed. In the first step, a prestruck nitrogen LSP was used to deposit a single nitrided trail on the substrate; in the second step, a prestruck argon plasma was used to remelt the nitrided trail laid in step one. The nitriding and remelting steps were modeled using an analytical heat conduction solution valid for a moving heat source. Remelting the nitrided trail was found to refine the microstructure and reduce solute segregation, resulting in the formation of deep, hard, homogenous, and crack-free nitrided cases. Optimal processing conditions required to tailor the case microstructure from: (a) a two-phase mixture of TiN<sub>x</sub> dendrites embedded in a titanium matrix, to (b) a uniform solid solution of nitrogen in titanium, \u03b1-Ti(N), were identified. Microstructure-property relationships were proposed, and values for the nitrogen flux into the melt pool and the efficiency of nitrogen intake were estimated. The nitriding-remelting treatment resulted in the formation of nitrided cases having depths up to 800 \u03bcm, and average Vickers hardness values in the range of 475-730 HV<sub>0.3</sub>. Selected single trail processing conditions were used to deposit multiple overlapping trails to increase surface coverage. For the same processing conditions, an increase in average hardness was observed in the overlapping trail runs compared to the single trail runs. Crack-free nitrided cases of average case hardness values up to 643 HV<sub>0.3</sub> and case depths up to 600 \u03bcm were deposited. Reciprocating ball-on-flat wear tests were conducted to assess their wear resistance. The two-step treatment was found to enhance the wear resistance of the base material by up to 80%.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13607], "author_name_tesi": "Kamat, Amar ", "last_name_ssi": "Kamat", "first_name_ssi": "Amar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith Todd Copley", "Judith Todd Copley", "Stephen M Copley", "Albert Eliot Segall", "Fan-Bill B Cheung", "Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith Todd Copley, Dissertation Advisor", "Judith Todd Copley, Committee Chair", "Stephen M Copley, Committee Member", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Member", "Fan-Bill B Cheung, Outside Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["titanium", "laser-sustained plasma", "laser nitriding", "case hardening", "wear resistance", "laser materials processing"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "APPLICATION OF REAXFF BASED REACTIVE MOLECULAR DYNAMICS TO SIMULATE LASER INDUCED INCANDESCENCE OF SOOT AND CHAR OXIDATION\n", "id": "11698", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "277", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Laser Induced Incandescence (LII) of soot has developed into a popular method for making in-situ measurements of soot volume fraction and primary particle sizes.

The reactive force field enables us to simulate the effects of conduction, evaporation and oxidation of the soot particle on the cooling signal. Simulations were carried out for both reactive and non-reactive gas species at various pressures, and the subsequent cooling signals of soot were compared and analyzed. To correctly model N2 \u2013 soot interactions, optimization of N-N and N-C-H force field parameters against density functional theory (DFT) and experimental values was performed, as described in this thesis. Subsequently, simulations were performed in order to find the thermal accommodation coefficients of soot with various monatomic and polyatomic gas molecules like He, Ne, Ar, N2, CO2 and CH4. For all these species, good agreement was found between our ReaxFF results and previously published accommodation coefficients. Initial simulations were also performed to study the oxidative pyrolysis of an Illinois char model containing about 7000 atoms. Analysis of the reactive behavior of char was carried out based on the temporal change of the concentration of oxygen, and the rate of change of five and six member rings present in char as a function of temperature. The utility of ReaxFF based Molecular Dynamics to simulate the physical and chemical behavior of carbonaceous materials is thus illustrated through this research.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [274], "author_name_tesi": "Kamat, Amar ", "last_name_ssi": "Kamat", "first_name_ssi": "Amar", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Adri Van Duin", "Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof Adri Van Duin, Thesis Advisor", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["laser induced incandescence", "soot", "reaxff", "molecular dynamics", "accommodation coefficients"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Changes in phenotype and function of myeloid lineage cells during early pregnancy in dairy heifers", "id": "02870v844", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13050", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Successful establishment of pregnancy requires interaction between the developing conceptus and the uterine mucosal immune system. Little is known regarding the role of myeloid lineage cells (macrophages and dendritic cells) during early pregnancy in ruminants. The effects of early pregnancy on endometrial and circulating immune cells of the myeloid lineage were studied here. \nDairy heifers were inseminated using sperm from a single bull (Day 0), and uteri and blood were collected at slaughter on Day 17 and 20 of pregnancy to investigate the response of uterine myeloid lineage cells to the presence of a conceptus. Responses were compared to uterine myeloid lineage cells of noninseminated heifers on Day 17 of the estrous cycle. The immune cells were isolated from the endometrium using enzymatic digestion, followed by magnetic sorting to obtain a pure CD45+ cell population. Flow cytometry was used to examine surface proteins. Immunofluorescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to evaluate immune cell proteins and transcripts in myeloid cells in the uterus. Total CD45+ immune cells were fewer (P \u2264 0.05) in pregnant compared to cyclic heifers. Abundance of transcripts for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, cluster of differentiation (CD) 80 and CD86, CD163 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) 1 were greater (P \u2264 0.05) in the endometrium of pregnant compared to cyclic heifers. Proteins for MHC II, IDO1, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA), CD163 and CD47 were greater (P \u2264 0.05) in pregnant compared to cyclic heifers. Many of these proteins were spatially regulated in the uterine wall, with the shallow stroma and shallow glands showing the most prominent differences. Transcripts for dectin1, mannose receptor C 1 (MRC1), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) were not affected (P > 0.1) by pregnancy. There were 50 % more CD14+CD11c+ cells (dendritic cells) in the peripheral circulation of pregnant compared to cyclic heifers. Overall, there were a greater (P \u2264 0.05) number of myeloid lineage cells in the endometrium during early pregnancy compared to the cycle. These cells were then evaluated for their ability to phagocytose, which is a primary function of myeloid cells.\nFunctional phagocytic assay using propidium iodide-labeled Streptococcus uberis did not show any difference in the phagocytic ability of macrophages treated with interferon tau (IFNT) and pregnancy specific protein B (PSPB). There were no differences in the phagocytic ability of the macrophages with or without interferon gamma (IFNG) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, both for resident and circulating immune cells. \nWe also studied two immune cell-related signaling pathways. Upregulation of IDO1 during early pregnancy could result in tryptophan catabolism leading to formation of kynurenine. Kynurenine is a ligand for the AHR and we studied the spatial and temporal regulation of AHR in the bovine uterus. There was a tendency for greater (P < 0.1) protein abundance for AHR in the shallow stroma and myometrium of pregnant animals, compared to cyclic controls. This increase could be involved in regulation of T cell proliferation, formation of regulatory T cells and increase in antiinflammatory cytokines including IL10 and transforming growth factor beta (TGFB). We studied another downstream metabolite of this pathway using immunofluorescence analysis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), which did not show any spatial or temporal differences during early pregnancy. However, both AHR and PPARG were abundantly expressed in the bovine uterus, suggesting a possible role for these proteins in regulating immune function, as seen in rodents and humans. Loss of AHR in mice models affects reproductive function, development of oviducts and impairs implantation. Kynurenine is known to reduce proliferation of T cells, however we did not detect any difference in proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with varying doses of kynurenine, in the presence or absence of stimulation.\nFinally, we studied the distribution and role of CD47 in the uterus of pregnant ruminants. Signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA) is a receptor expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) that binds to CD47 and initiates downstream signaling via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM). We detected expression of CD47 in uterus and conceptus tissue, suggesting a role of these proteins in regulating myeloid cell function during early pregnancy. The engagement of these proteins arrests phagocytosis of the CD47-expressing cell and prevents DC maturation. Effect of blocking the interaction between CD47 and SIRPA using a bovine trophoblast cell line CT1 and immune cells from Day 17 pregnant heifers was determined. In vitro treatment with blocking antibody to CD47 did not affect phagocytosis of uterine MHC II+ cells. Interactions between CD47 and SIRPA are possibly the most prominent in areas of shallow glands, since both were present in greater abundance in in shallow glands during pregnancy. In addition, interaction of CD47 with TSP1 is known to regulate angiogenesis, however there was no change in mRNA abundance of TSP1 between cyclic and pregnant heifers.\nOverall, results indicate a role for myeloid cells in the uterus during early pregnancy and support the hypothesis that pregnancy signaling results in an alternatively-activated phenotype of the myeloid lineage cells, which may be important for establishment of pregnancy in dairy heifers.  These cells function through various signaling pathways and downstream metabolites of those pathways are essential for regulating function of T cells and secretion of immunomodulatory cytokines. Determination of whether these changes results in induction of tolerance to the developing conceptus requires further study using inhibitors of the enzymes and proteins upregulated during early pregnancy. Functional assays to test for macrophage function and interactions between myeloid and lymphoid cell types also need to be conducted to better understand the immune cell changes in the pregnant bovine uterus. This would eventually help to develop strategies to reduce infertility in dairy cattle.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12549], "author_name_tesi": "Kamat, Manasi Manohar", "last_name_ssi": "Kamat", "middle_name_ssi": "Manohar", "first_name_ssi": "Manasi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Troy Ott", "Troy Ott", "Joy Lee Pate", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Alan Leslie Johnson", "Connie Jo Rogers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Troy Ott, Dissertation Advisor", "Troy Ott, Committee Chair", "Joy Lee Pate, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Alan Leslie Johnson, Outside Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heifers", "macrophages", "dendritic cells", "uterus", "conceptus", "aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway", "CD47 pathway", "interferon tau"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Applying Netlabel to Network Access Control in a Virtualized Environment\n", "id": "8454", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5273", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We consider the problem of transmitting authorization data in a distributed environment comprised of applications hosted on paravirtualized Virtual Machines.

But, Labeled IPSec incurs heavy performance penalties and hinders the scalability of Mandatory Access Control of Network Communication, because it does not leverage the underlying mechanisms offered by the hypervisor and Virtual Machine kernels to provide secure communication channels.  We exploit the Netlabel mechanism provided by the Linux Kernel to transmit authorization data in packets, while leveraging the Trusted Computing Base comprised of the Xen hypervisor, paravirtualized guest kernels, and the Dom-0 to isolate and protect network communication.  In order to test our claim that the Netlabel mechanism is more efficient than Labeled IPSec, we build a prototype that consists of modified guest kernels and Dom-0 kernel, along with user space tools in the Dom-0 which enable monitoring and dynamic control of the packet labeling state on guests.  Using micro benchmarks that measure the impact of labeling on performance measures such as latency and bandwidth, we provide a quantitative comparison of Labeled IPSec and Netlabel in various communication scenarios.  We find that Netlabel consistently outperforms Labeled IPSec on all performance measures, validating our claim that authorization data can be transmitted at lesser cost using Netlabel, and relying on the TCB to protect network traffic in transit.  As a result, while we conclude that Netlabel can be applied successfully to provide Mandatory Access Control of Network Communication, we also believe that more extensive performance analyses, better support for security-aware applications and a standardized policy management interface will go a long way toward securing applications.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5250], "author_name_tesi": "Kamath, Radhesh Muralidhara", "last_name_ssi": "Kamath", "middle_name_ssi": "Muralidhara", "first_name_ssi": "Radhesh", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Trent Ray Jaeger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Trent Ray Jaeger, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["network security", "virtualization", "security", "system security"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "DYNAMIC HETEROGENEITIES IN GLASSES AND MISCIBLE POLYMER BLENDS: COMPUTER SIMULATIONS USING THE BOND FLUCTUATION MODEL\n", "id": "6049", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6044", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-12-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While the glass transition has been the subject of a considerable\namount of research over the past few decades, it is still an unsolved\nproblem in condensed matter physics and there is considerable debate\nabout the exact nature of the glass transition.

The conventional approach to\nassure adequate whirl flutter stability margins for tiltrotors is to design the wings\nwith high torsional stiffness, typically using 23% thickness-to-chord ratio wings.\nHowever, the large aerodynamic drag associated with these high thickness-to-chord\nratio wings decreases aerodynamic efficiency and increases fuel consumption.

Local plant communities provision wild bees with crucial floral and nesting resources, but the distribution of floristic diversity in North American agricultural landscapes and effects on pollinators are poorly understood. Therefore, I documented floristic diversity in orchard, forest, and forest edge habitats in an apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) production region in south-central Pennsylvania, USA. I tested the correlation between plant diversity and orchard pollinator communities in two field seasons. \n\nI showed that local non-crop habitats, specifically forest edges, contain a majority of the floristic diversity in this agricultural landscape. Plant diversity in forest and forest edge habitats is correlated with bee richness, abundance, and community composition in apple orchards. Within an orchard, I found a significant spatial pattern in wild bee abundance as a factor of proximity to the adjacent forest edge. Wild bee abundance substantially decreased with increasing distance from the forest edge.

Even in heterogeneous landscapes, the proximity to and quality of resources in local semi-natural habitats is correlated with wild bee communities in agricultural fields.

Intersectionality is used as a lens to describe how being Black, a woman, and a nontraditional student forms a unique individual.\nDevelopmental mathematics has acted as a gatekeeper in academics, in that failing to complete a required developmental mathematics sequence prohibits a student from pursuing certain majors. The literature on developmental mathematics is primarily written from a deficit perspective, emphasizing failure and noncompletion rates, and the experiences of Blacks, women, and nontraditional students are treated independently.\nGiven the lack of literature on the intersectionality of race, gender, and age, I decided that the first step to understanding this phenomenon was to listen to the stories that these women have to tell. Therefore I chose to employ narrative methods to allow their stories to be told in their own words. Being aware of my positionality as a White male mathematics professor, I used Reissman's (2008) Dialogic/Performance Analysis model because it acknowledges how stories are affected by the interviewer/interviewee relationship.\nThree women participated in this study. They shared stories about their educational and life experiences both before beginning college as nontraditional students and while attending college.

Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been integrated for the continuous monitoring of machine and patient conditions. As such, large amounts of data are generated with high dimensionality and complex structures. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to realize smart automated systems such as smart manufacturing and connected health care. However, it also raises new challenges in data analysis and decision making. Realizing the full potential of the data-rich environment calls for the development of new methodologies for data-driven information processing, modeling, and optimization.\nThis dissertation develops new methods and tools that enable 1) better handling of large amounts of multi-channel signals and imaging data generated from advanced sensing systems in manufacturing and healthcare settings, 2) effective extraction of information pertinent to system dynamics from the complex data, and 3) efficient use of acquired knowledge for performance optimization and system improvement. The accomplishments include:\n1)\tFusion and analysis of multi-channel signals. In Chapter 2, a spatiotemporal warping approach was developed to characterize the dissimilarity among 3-lead functional recordings. A network was then optimally constructed based on the dissimilarity and network features were extracted for the identification of different types of diseases. \n2)\tStatistical process control based on time-varying images. In Chapter 3, a stream of time-varying images were represented as a dynamic network. Then, community structure of the network was characterized and community statistics were extracted from time to time. Finally, a new control charting approach was developed for in-situ monitoring of manufacturing processes. \n3)\tMonitoring and Control of large-scale Industrial Internet of Things. In Chapter 4, a stochastic learning approach was developed to construct a large-scale dynamic network from IIoT machines. A parallel computing scheme was further proposed to harness multiple computation resources to increase the efficiency. The constructed large-scale network can be used to visually and analytically monitor machine condition, inspect product quality, and optimize manufacturing processes. \n4)\tModeling and Analysis of large-scale Internet of Health Things. In Chapter 5, the large-scale network model was extended to the Internet of Health Things. A new IoT technology specific to the heart disease, namely, the Internet of Hearts, was proposed. Dynamic network modeling and parallel computing schemes were designed and developed for multi-level cardiac monitoring: patient-to-patient variations in the population level and beat-to-beat dynamics in the individual patient level.

Study 1 examined dimensions, predictors, and correlates of adolescents\u2019 perceived power in their romantic relationships. Global power, emotional investment, and availability of relationship alternatives were identified as three distinct indices of power among 199 adolescents aged 14 to 19. Gendered characteristics and family and individual resources one to two years earlier were investigated as predictors of power, and concurrent adjustment correlates of power were examined. Results supported a resource perspective on relationship power more consistently than a gender perspective, in that positive family and personal characteristics were associated with having equal or more power in romantic relationships. Greater power was negatively related to internalizing symptoms but positively related to externalizing behaviors. Study 2 examined longitudinal associations between couple violence and parenting and coparenting experiences across the transition to parenthood. A community sample of 162 couples reported on violence in their relationships when they were expecting their first child, and reported on their parenting stress, parental efficacy, and coparenting after the child was born. Mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 violence perpetration was related to both parents\u2019 parental distress and coparenting. Couple relationship distress, and to a lesser extent parent physical and mental health, mediated the links between violence and parenting and between violence and coparenting. Study 3 extended family systems research on associations between intergenerational coalitions in the family and the quality of marital relationships. Specifically, longitudinal links between incongruence in mothers\u2019 versus fathers\u2019 differential treatment of adolescent-age siblings and parents\u2019 marital quality were examined. Multilevel models, examining 200 families over 4 waves spaced across six years, tested whether incongruence in differential parent-offspring intimacy and conflict predicted trajectories of mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 reports of marital conflict and satisfaction, and vice versa. Analyses showed that changes in interparental incongruence covaried longitudinally with changes in marital quality and that these linkages became stronger over time. Together, these three studies provide a picture of the associations between features of romantic relationships and characteristics of other family relationships in adolescence, early adulthood, and middle adulthood.

Alarming reports indicate that between 16 to 50 percent of women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer experience symptoms of cognitive impairment.  These symptoms include subtle changes in memory, concentration, and some higher order processes that include psychomotor speed and executive functioning.  In addition, it has been reported that these symptoms may persist even years after completion of treatment.  Research is limited that has explored the lived experience of the phenomenon of chemotherapy-related cognitive change in breast cancer survivors.  \nPurpose:  The purpose of this study was to uncover the meaning of cognitive change in women with breast cancer, how symptoms are experienced and become evident, how it impacts roles in personal and professional lives, and how women cope with these changes.  \nMethods:  An interpretive phenomenological study was conducted with seven women with breast cancer, between the ages of 42-59, who had completed standard chemotherapy treatment within the past 12 months.  Each woman participated in two in-depth semi-structured interviews one month apart and maintained a written journal. Reflective journaling and total immersion in the data enhanced the rigor of the methodology.  In addition, a panel of three faculty members, with expertise in qualitative analysis, reviewed interview transcripts and provided insights which led to the refinement of essential themes and subthemes. \nResults:  Phenomenological analysis employing van Manen\u2019s framework for interpretive phenomenology revealed five major essential themes: Noticing the difference, experiencing cognitive changes, interacting socially, coping, and looking forward.  Subthemes, both essential and incidental, were identified within each major theme.  Analysis provided a description of the phenomenon in relation to the lifeworld existentials of lived space, lived body, lived time, and lived human relation.  \nConclusions:  The experience of cognitive change could not be isolated nor studied separately from the greater context of the women\u2019s reality of having breast cancer.  This study provides clarity related to the impact of cognitive change and how women cope with these changes in relation to their daily roles and responsibilities.

Height and phase images from tapping mode AFM experiments, acquired at various tapping forces, reveal that the morphology and lamellar thickness of the L-lactide/meso-lactide copolymers are strongly influenced by meso-lactide content and crystallization conditions. Good agreement was observed between mean lamellar thicknesses derived from AFM and previous small-angle X-ray scattering experiments. The considerable decrease in lamellar thickness with increasing comonomer content suggests that meso-lactide units are substantially excluded from the L-lactide crystal lattice, at least under the isothermal crystallization conditions used here.\nA dielectric study of amorphous and crystalline samples of the L-lactide/meso-lactide copolymers demonstrates that the relaxation strength and mean relaxation time (and its distribution) of the segmental process are modified by the presence of the crystalline phase. The mean segmental relaxation time is longer and its distribution is broader in the samples with higher degrees of crystallinity. The significant difference in the fraction of mobile segments (determined from the relaxation strength) and the amorphous fraction derived from DSC) indicates the existence of the so-called \u201crigid amorphous phase\u201d. This conclusion is also supported by the observation of a difference in temperature dependent behavior of the relaxation strength of amorphous and crystalline samples. Differences in the details of the relaxation processes, as well as the fraction of rigid amorphous phase of these copolymers, suggest that the chain dynamics of amorphous segments are influence by both degree of crystallinity and lamellar organization.\nFor D-PLA/L-PLAs blends, stereocomplex crystallites are observed along with homopolymer crystals. The content of each crystal type is found to depend strongly on the composition and molecular weight of the component polymers. These parameters have only a small influence on the melting temperature of the stereocomplex but significantly affect those of homopolymer crystallites. It is suggested by the results of real-time dielectric crystallization experiments, along with WAXD and DSC measurements after crystallization, that crystallization of the stereocomplex is faster than homopolymer crystallites. Consequently, the homopolymer crystals developed under these conditions are influenced significantly by constraints imposed by existing racemic crystallites and, therefore, have lower melting temperatures than those of the neat polymers. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4466], "author_name_tesi": "Kanchanasopa, Mantana ", "last_name_ssi": "Kanchanasopa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mantana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt", "Ian Roland Harrison", "Evangelos Manias", "Christopher Alan Siedlecki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt, Committee Chair", "Ian Roland Harrison, Committee Member", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Member", "Christopher Alan Siedlecki, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lactide", "crystallinity", "copolymer", "blends", "AFM", "dielectric relaxation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Reacting to OS/System Resource Partitioning Decisions: Tiling Example\n", "id": "11944", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3013", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Iteration space tiling is an important technique for loop optimizations in compiler theory.

These surface states have very exciting properties such as suppressed backscattering and spin-momentum locking, which are of great interest for research efforts towards dissipation-less electronics and spintronics. The popular thermo-electrics from the Bi chalcogenide family \u2013 Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 \u2013 have been experimentally demonstrated to be promising candidate TI materials, and form the chosen material system for this dissertation research. \n\nThe first part of this dissertation research focuses on low temperature magneto-transport measurements of mesoscopic topological insulator devices (Chapter 3). The top-down patterning of epitaxial thin films of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 (that are plagued with bulk conduction) is motivated, in part, by an effort to enhance the surface-to-volume ratio in mesoscopic channels. At cryogenic temperatures, transport measurements of these devices reveal periodic conductance fluctuations in straight channel devices, despite the lack of any explicit patterning of the TI film into a ring or a loop. A careful analysis of the surface morphology and comparison with the transport data then demonstrate that scattering off the edges of triangular plateaus at the surface leads to the creation of Aharonov-Bohm electronic orbits responsible for the periodicity. \n\nAnother major focus of this dissertation work is on combining topological insulators with magnetism. This has been shown to open a gap in the surface states leading to possibilities of magnetic \u201cgating\u201d and the realization of dissipation-less transport at zero-field, amongst several other exotic quantum phenomena. In this dissertation, I present two different schemes for probing these effects in electrical transport devices \u2013 interfacing with insulating ferromagnets (Chapter 4) and bulk magnetic doping (Chapter 5). In Chapter 4, I shall present the integration of GdN with Bi2Se3 thin films. Careful structural, magnetic and electrical characterization of the heterostructures is employed to confirm that the magnetic species is solely restricted to the surface, and that the ferromagnetic GdN layer to be insulating, ensuring current flow solely through the TI layer. We also devise a novel device geometry that enables direct comparison of the magneto-transport properties of TI films with and without proximate magnetism, all, in a single device. A comparative study of weak anti-localization suggested that the overlying GdN suppressed quantum interference in the top surface state. In our second generation hetero-structure devices, GdN is interfaced with low-carrier density, gate-tunable thin films of  (Bi,Sb)2Te3 grown on SrTiO3 substrates. These devices enable us to map out the comparison of magneto-transport, as the chemical potential is tuned from the bulk conduction band into the bulk valence band.\n\nIn a second approach to study the effects of magnetism on TI\u2019s, I shall present, in Chapter 5, our results from magnetic doping of (Bi,Sb)2Te3 thin films with Cr \u2013 a system that was recently demonstrated to be a Quantum Anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator. In a Cr-rich regime, a highly insulating, high Curie temperature ferromagnetic phase is achieved.  However, a careful, iterative process of tuning the composition of this complex alloy enabled access to the QAHE regime, with the observation of near dissipation-less transport and perfect Hall quantization at zero external field. Furthermore, we demonstrate a field tilt driven crossover between a quantum anomalous Hall phase and a gapless, ferromagnetic TI phase. This crossover manifests itself in an electrically tunable, giant anisotropic magneto-resistance effect that we employ as a quantitative probe of edge transport in this system. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11163], "author_name_tesi": "Kandala, Abhinav ", "last_name_ssi": "Kandala", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abhinav", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth", "Nitin Samarth", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Chaoxing Liu", "Mauricio Terrones"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth, Dissertation Advisor", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Chaoxing Liu, Committee Member", "Mauricio Terrones, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Topological Insulators", "Magneto-transport", "Quantum anomalous Hall effect", "Magnetism", "Quantum interference"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "NOVEL FUNCTIONAL ETHYLENE/PROPYLENE ELASTOMERS: \nSYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION ", "id": "6693", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6361", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nThis thesis discusses novel chemical approaches to prepare functional ethylene/propylene elastomers. The chemistry involves the preparation of poly(ethylene-co-propylene) reactive intermediate in which the reactive groups are randomly distributed in EP-backbone or located only at the chain-end, depending on the employed metallocene catalyst, type of comonomer/chain transfer agent, and reaction conditions. Several reactive comonomers can act as chain transfer agents, including p-methylstyrene (p-MS), p-hydroxystyrene (p-OHSt), allyl alcohol, allyl amine, and butenyl amine. They are systematically investigated to find the suitable reaction conditions. In turn, the resulting EP copolymers containing such reactive moieties, located in the side chain or at the chain end, are versatile for a wide range of applications. The combination of this reactive approach and metallocene technology enables us to prepare many novel reactive ethylene/propylene (EPR) copolymers with terminal functional groups. \n\nIn chapter I and II, some historical aspects related to Zieglar-Natta catalysts and subsequent polyolefin developments are discussed, and then followed with a brief summary of the current approaches of polyolefin modifications. I will provide some background information, especially the prior research approaches and experimental results in functionalization of polyolefins. So far, the most effective functionalization chemistry involves the combination of metallocene catalysis and reactive comonomers (or reactive chain transfer agents), which was developed in our group. The chemistry has also been extended to prepare block and graft copolymers having a polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) main chain. \n\nThis thesis focuses on ethylene/propylene copolymerization that not only produces useful materials for a wide range of applications but also provides a good understanding in the involved chemistry and reaction mechanism. \n\nIn chapter III, a chemical route to prepare new ethylene/propylene copolymers (EP) containing a terminal reactive group, such as -CH3 and       -OH is discussed. The chemistry involves metallocene-mediated ethylene/propylene copolymerization in the presence of a consecutive chain transfer agent\u00a1Xa mixture of hydrogen and styrene derivatives carrying a CH3 (p-MS) or a silane-protected OH (St-OSi). The major challenge is to find suitable reaction conditions that can simultaneously carry out effective ethylene/propylene copolymerization and incorporation of the styrenic molecule (St-f) at the polymer chain end. In other words, the reaction conditions can alter the St-f incorporation mode from copolymerization to chain transfer. A systematic study was conducted to examine several metallocene catalyst systems and reaction conditions. Both [(C5Me4)SiMe2N(t-Bu)]TiCl2 and rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2, under certain H2 pressures, were found to be suitable catalyst systems to perform the combined task. The presence of ethylene along with propylene in the polymerization system provides one more advantage in understanding the chemistry involved and consequently, the detailed behaviors of the applied catalysts. Therefore, the copolymer composition can be derived from an ethylene/propylene mole ratio which is very important information that affords a good understanding of the polymerization mechanism. A broad range of St-f terminated EP copolymers (EP-t-p-MS and EP-t-St-OH), with various compositions and molecular weights, have been prepared with polymer molecular weight inversely proportional to the molar ratio of [St-f]/[monomer]. \n\nIt is also interesting to search for other olefinic species that can behave like styrenic molecules in selective copolymerization or chain transfer reactions by controlling the reaction conditions. Therefore, in chapter IV, we describe the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene in the presence of protected allylalcohol, allylamine and butenylamine. These monomers were reported to be difficult in the preparation of functional PE and PP polymers, with low catalyst activities and low polymer molecular weights. Our strategy is to first protect the functional monomers with bulky protecting groups from poisoning the catalyst. Then, the protected functional monomer is introduced in the copolymerization reaction. It is very possible that the incorporated functional monomer at the propagating chain-end may stop the polymerization due to steric or electronic reasons. However, subsequent chain-transfer to hydrogen or MAO could take place and regenerate the catalyst for a new polymerization cycle. Therefore, the resulting polymer should contain a terminal functional group. The protection methods have been chosen in such a way that they would not only lead to the steric shielding, but also to afford electronic neutralization of the functional groups. A systematic study of metallocene-mediated ethylene/propylene /protected polar monomer polymerization in the absence and presence of H2, with varying catalysts, polar monomer concentrations, and hydrogen pressures, has been conducted. With a combination of a metallocene catalyst and controlled hydrogen pressure, it is possible to direct the incorporation of simple polar monomers, from copolymerization to chain transfer mode, to form NH2 and OH terminated EP copolymers with a broad range of polymer molecular weight and E/P mole ratios.\n\nIn chapter V, a new chemical route to prepare graft copolymers containing both an elastic main chain and elastic side chains is discussed, especially EP-g-PI graft copolymers having ethylene/propylene copolymer (EP) main chain and several polyisoprene (PI) side chains. Such a polymer may provide the much needed solution to address the weak rubber-rubber interface adhesion problem, currently facing the tire industry. The chemistry is centered on a reactive EP copolymer intermediate containing few reactive side groups that are very effective for subsequent grafting reactions. The reactive EP-copolymers are used as the main chains for preparing graft copolymers, which involve both \u00a1\u00a5living\u00a1\u00a6 anionic graft-from and graft-onto polymerization with isoprene monomers. The incorporated reactive sites randomly distributed along the EP chain provide the grafting points to join the PI side chains. In the EP copolymer containing p-MS reactive groups, the benzylic protons in p-MS units were transformed to benzylic anions before introducing isoprene for an anionic graft-from reaction to prepare EP-g-PI graft copolymer. \n\nAnother way to prepare such a graft copolymer was the coupling reaction between the chloro group in EP-p-CMS and living polyisoprene anions via graft-onto reaction. A third studied system was the graft-from and graft-onto anionic copolymerization between EP-co-DVB and isoprene. An effective fractionation method was developed to separate any traces of isoprene homopolymer that might be generated during such grafting copolymerizations and all the fractionation products were subjected to composition analysis using FT-IR and 1HNMR spectroscopy. The purity of the spectra and the increase in molecular weight provide another indication of the success of such grafting and fractionation techniques. Various grafting techniques, including graft-onto and graft-from processes, have been studied. As will be discussed, the suitable grafting chemistry is dependent on the reactive sites.\n\nIn chapter VI, a novel method to synthesis reactive rubber particles is described. Considered as a frontier engineering material, reactive rubber particles will find the way in almost all applications. The process involves two steps: metallocene-mediated E/P/DVB terpolymerization followed by emulsion or suspension thermal crosslinking. The particles contain reactive styrenic moieties on the surface which are very versatile in many applications. The first step of preparing these reactive rubber particles involves the synthesis of linear ethylene/propylene/divinylbenzene (EP-DVB) terpolymer via metallocene-mediated polymerization using selected catalysts. Then, in the second step, this soluble EP-DVB terpolymer is emulsified using soap-in-situ method to sub-micro size particles, followed by crosslinking via a thermal coupling reaction of pendent styrene moieties in the bulk of particle. A suspension process in which EP-DVB terpolymer is suspended in water containing PVOH then thermally crosslinked to form 1 to 10 \u0192\u00ddm size particles was also developed. Some remaining styrene moieties on the surface were then used for further functionalization reactions, including maleation and epoxidation or graft reactions (via graft-onto, graft-from, and graft-through mechanisms) which provide excellent adhesion with brittle polymers. Several polymers have been studied, including Nylon, PP, PS, and SAN polymers. The combination of SEM and TEM results indicates the effectiveness of the grafting reaction and consequently the interfacial adhesion between the dispersed rubber particles and the continuous polymer domain.\n\nFinally, in Chapter VII, the conclusions of this work, with the emphasis on some important topics that need further investigation for future work are summarized.            \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6361], "author_name_tesi": "Kandil, Usama ", "last_name_ssi": "Kandil", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Usama", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["T C (Mike) Chung", "Ian Roland Harrison", "Q Wang", "Chunshan Song"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["T C (Mike) Chung, Committee Chair", "Ian Roland Harrison, Committee Member", "Q Wang, Committee Member", "Chunshan Song, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Functional Polyolefins", "Metallocene Catalysts", "Chain Transfer", "Reactive Approach", "Reactive Rubber Particles"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Towards Self-Optimizing Memory Management", "id": "6276", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2028", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-12-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Systems today are application driven.

The disturbance covariance matrix should be inferred from training sample observations in practice. Traditional maximum likelihood (ML) estimators are effective when homogeneous (target free) training data is abundant but lead to poor estimates, degraded false alarm rates, and detection loss in the regime of limited training. However, large number of homogeneous training samples are generally not available because of difficulty of guaranteeing target free disturbance observation, practical limitations imposed by the spatio-temporal nonstationarity, and system considerations. The problem has been exacerbated by recent advances that have led to more antenna elements (J) and higher temporal resolution (P) time epochs resulting in a large dimension (N = JP).\nIn this dissertation, we look to address the aforementioned challenges by exploiting physically inspired constraints into ML estimation. While adding constraints is beneficial to achieve satisfactory performance in the practical regime of limited training, it leads to a challenging problem. Unlike unconstrained estimators, a vast majority of constrained radar STAP estimators are iterative and expensive numerically, which prohibits practical deployment. We focus on breaking this classical trade-off between computational tractability and desirable performance measures, particularly in training starved regimes. In particular, we exploit both the structure of the disturbance covariance and importantly the knowledge of the clutter rank to yield a new rank constrained maximum likelihood (RCML) estimator of clutter/disturbance covariance. We demonstrate that the rank-constrained estimation problem can in fact be cast in the framework of a tractable convex optimization problem, and derive closed form expressions for the estimated covariance matrix. In addition, we derive a new covariance estimator for STAP that jointly considers a Toeplitz structure and a rank constraint on the clutter component. Past work has shown that in the regime of low training, even handling each constraint individually is hard and techniques often resort to slow numerically based solutions. Our proposed solution leverages the rank constrained ML estimator (RCML) of structured covariances to build a computationally friendly approximation that involves a cascade of two closed form solutions. Performance analysis using the KASSPER data set (where ground truth covariance is made available) shows that the proposed RCML estimator vastly outperforms state-of-the art alternatives even for low training including the notoriously difficult regime of K <= N training regimes and for the experiments considering real-world scenarios such as target detection performance and the case that some of training samples are corrupted by target information.\nFinally, we address the problem of working with inexact physical radar parameters under a practical radar environment. As shown in this dissertation, employing practical constraints such as a rank of the clutter subspace and a condition number of disturbance covariance leads to a practically powerful estimator as well as a closed form solution. While the rank and the condition number are very effective constraints, often practical non-ideality makes it difficult to be known precisely using physical models. We propose a robust covariance estimation method via an expected likelihood (EL) approach. We analyze covariance estimation algorithms under three different cases of imperfect constraints: 1) only rank constraint, 2) both rank and noise power constraint, and 3) condition number constraint. For each case, we formulate estimation of the constraint as an optimization problem with the expected likelihood criterion and formally derive and prove a significant analytical result such as uniqueness of the solution. Through experimental results from a simulation model and the KASSPER data set, we show the estimator with optimal constraints obtained by the EL approach outperforms alternatives in the sense of a normalized signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR).", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11014], "author_name_tesi": "Kang, Bosung ", "last_name_ssi": "Kang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bosung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vishal Monga", "David Miller", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Jesse Louis Barlow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vishal Monga, Dissertation Advisor", "David Miller, Committee Member", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Member", "Jesse Louis Barlow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["convex optimization", "STAP", "radar signal processing", "constrained optimization", "detection and estimation"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Issues in low-power and reliable wireless commuication system design", "id": "6270", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "860", "abstract_tesi": "The demands of broadband services are growing rapidly in personal wireless terminals, such as PDAs, cell phones, and laptops. These demands can be fulfilled by developing high-performance processors. Advances in CMOS technology have served these needs. For example, the rapid scaling of CMOS technology enables the implementation of highly integrated fast processors. However, these advances are also accompanied by increasing power dissipation. This power dissipation problem is a major concern in personal wireless terminals since these devices have limited battery life and re-chargeable battery technology has seen very little improvements in efficiency.\n \nIn the mean time, analog circuits are being implemented in deep sub-micron CMOS technology and integrated along with high-speed digital circuits (such as high-performance processor cores) for cost-efficiency. In these mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs), high-speed digital circuits generate noise when they are switching.

This substrate noise is considered a critical parasitic in mixed-signal ICs.\n\nThus, power consumption and substrate noise are currently two very important issues in implementing wireless communication systems.

In the measurement, all precursor gases are rapidly oxidized with extreme amounts of oxidants to low volatility compounds, resulting in the aerosol formation. Oxidation occurs in a small, simple, flow-through chamber that has a short residence time and is irradiated with ultraviolet light. The amount of the oxidants ozone (OB3B), hydroxyl (OH), and hydroperoxyl (HOB2B) were measured directly and can be controlled by varying the intensity of UV light and the relative humidity. Maximum values were 40 ppmv for OB3, B900 pptv for OH, and 4 ppbv for HOB2B. The oxidant amounts are 100 to 1000 times tropospheric values, but the ratios OH/OB3B and HOB2B/OH are similar to troposphere values. The aerosol production mechanism and the aerosol mass yield were studied for several controlling variables, such as temperature, relative humidity, oxidant concentration, presence of nitrogen oxides (NOBxB), precursor gas composition and amount, and the presence of acidic seed aerosol. The measured secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yield of several natural and anthropogenic volatile organic compounds and a mixture of hydrocarbons in the PAM chamber were similar to those obtained in large, batch-style environmental chambers. The similarity of the mass spectra for SOA in the PAM chamber to the large environmental chambers provides evidence that the highly oxidizing environment of the PAM chamber has the same oxidation processes that occur at ambient oxidant levels. The dependence of the formation and aging of SOA on precursor organic amount and more importantly on OH were studied by the measurement of evolution of chemical composition and size distribution of SOA in PAM. This PAM method is being developed for measuring potential aerosol mass in the atmosphere, but it is also useful for examining SOA processes in the laboratory and in environmental chambers.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1858], "author_name_tesi": "Kang, Eunha ", "last_name_ssi": "Kang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Eunha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Henry Brune", "Dennis Lamb", "Jerry Y Harrington", "James Freihaut"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Henry Brune, Committee Chair", "Dennis Lamb, Committee Member", "Jerry Y Harrington, Committee Member", "James Freihaut, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["potential aerosol", "photo-oxidation", "ozonolysis", "secondary organic aerosols", "Secondary aerosol", "SOA aging", "mass spectra"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE DISTANCE EDUCATION HISTORY IN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES: A SOCIO-HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE", "id": "9875", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2340", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<p>The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of international distance education development through comparison of the distance education historical developments in China and the United States (U.S.).</p>\n<p>This study, utilizing a document analysis method, studied historical documents, explored the historical development of distance education in China and the U.

The basic feature of this approach is the use of tuned vibration absorbers along the blades.  This concept can use a portion of the leading edge weights that are already incorporated into the blade as a part of the mass of the absorbers.  It has the potential to replace current blade lag dampers and reduce complexity, aerodynamic drag, and weight.  The effectiveness of the embedded absorbers was evaluated by analyzing and testing blade lag damping and rotor system aeromechanical stability.\n\tAn aeromechanical stability analysis of the rotor system with embedded chordwise absorbers was developed.  The rotor blade was modeled as an elastic beam undergoing axial, flapwise, lagwise, and torsional deflections.  The fuselage was modeled as a rigid body with roll and pitch rotations about its center of mass.  Each embedded absorber was modeled as a mass-spring pair.  The rotor-absorber-fuselage system equations of motion were formulated using Hamilton?s Principle and spatially discretized using the finite element method.  The modal frequencies and damping of the system were found using complex eigenvalue solutions of the linearized equations.\n\tA rigid blade-absorber model was developed to explore the dynamic response of the embedded absorbers, including the static and steady-state dynamic response, and to examine the effect of the embedded absorber on rotor blade aeroelastic stability, including flap-lag flutter, pitch-flap flutter, and pitch divergence.\n\tA small-scale model rotor system with embedded absorbers was designed and constructed.  A set of experiments measuring blade lag frequency and damping was conducted.  The effects of the blade and absorber system parameters, including blade lag stiffness and absorber mass, location, and tuning frequency were examined experimentally.\n\tThe analytical results were correlated with the experimental data.  The theoretical lag frequencies and damping of the blade with embedded absorbers agreed well with the experimental data.  The aeromechanical stability analysis of the rotor-fuselage system also showed good agreement with the experimental data.  The theoretical and experimental results both showed promising blade lag damping augmentation using embedded chordwise absorbers.  The damping augmentation using embedded chordwise absorber varies from 0.3% to 15% critical damping ratio, depending on blade and absorber parameters.  The ground resonance stability analysis of the hingeless rotor system and articulated rotor system showed that the blade lag damping augmentation using embedded chordwise absorbers improves the ground resonance stability.\n\tA parametric study was performed.

Inefficiency and disintegration of its structure and operations reveal serious issues in many sectors of the system. In particular, emergency departments (ED) and primary care face a growing crisis although they play significant roles in our healthcare system as a safety net for the U.S. population  and as the backbone of the nation\u2019 healthcare system. Long waiting times, increasing left without being seen rates, and frequent ambulance diversions in the ED jeopardize patient safety. The lack of care coordination between primary care and specialty care does not optimally improve outcomes of the increasing patient population with multiple chronic diseases, which leads to high mortality and excessive costs.\n \nTo tackle these problems facing EDs and primary care, significant efforts have been made from streamlining operational processes to changing organizational structures to enforcing new healthcare policies. However, many of the needs that drove these attempts still remain unfulfilled. The limited success of the improvement efforts is probably because many of the approaches have focused on optimizing sub-systems in isolation. Another main reason for the gap is probably that research addressing the healthcare problems has not reached its full potential for translation into practice. To improve these challenges in the current healthcare systems, we must understand their complexity and bridge the gaps that exist within them. \n\nTherefore, the objective of this dissertation is threefold: 1) to propose innovative solutions that address the improvement needs, 2) to develop models that integrate systems engineering methodologies to analyze the solutions from a holistic perspective, and 3) to lay the groundwork for translational research that promotes the implementation of innovative solutions for an efficient and integrated healthcare system. To achieve these objectives, this dissertation investigated three different levels of the healthcare system architecture \u2013 process, system structure, and environment.\n\nFirst, we focused on admission processes between the emergency department (ED) and inpatient wards in a hospital to improve ED crowding problems. The objective of this study was to build a better understanding of admission process policies (APPs) in the ED and to investigate the systemic effect of APPs on patient flow. Various APPs were modeled using discrete-event simulation, and their impacts on patient flow were evaluated with respect to a set of performance measures. The simulation results of the case study at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center showed that the alternative APPs were all effective in reducing the length of stay (LOS) of admitted patients compared to the current APP. The improved flow of admitted patients affected the LOS of discharged patients and the overall LOS. This study highlighted the importance of the integrated point of view to improve patient flow by demonstrating that ED change made in the model did not yield results in a linear fashion because of the interrelated actors and processes of a system. It also showed the potential value of leveraging APPs to reduce ED crowding. \n\nThen, we extended our research scope to include organizational structures of primary care and nephrology care for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The objective of this study was to develop interventions that facilitate a transformation of the current healthcare delivery system into a patient-centered medical home for CKD care and to assess potential impacts of the interventions on the system. This study applied system dynamics methodologies to build conceptual and simulation models. Then, a multi-criteria goal programming was developed to determine the required capacity of resources for a new system. Results from both qualitative and quantitative models revealed the crucial roles of primary care physicians and care coordination between care settings in improving care for CKD patients. The study results also emphasized the importance of well-balanced allocations of resources and attentions to meet multiple concurrent goals. \n\nFinally, we developed an aggregated ED performance measure that incorporates multifaceted aspects of the care system ranging from processes to environment. Using the proposed ED performance measure, this study aimed to benchmark EDs and capture the overall performance of EDs with respect to technical and scale efficiencies. This study used a two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach in which the efficiencies of EDs were estimated in the first stage and the significant exogenous factors affecting EDs\u2019 technical efficiency were investigated in the second stage. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that examines the scale and technical efficiencies of a large number of EDs. The results of input-oriented DEA models indicated that many EDs deployed their key inputs at less than the optimal level. Further analysis of the DEA models indicated that the scale and technical efficiencies among the small, medium, and large groups are statistically different. Based on the DEA results, a multivariate logit model was constructed to investigate significant exogenous factors that impact the technical efficiency of EDs. This research is significant in that hospitals can use these models as benchmarking tools, and the findings can be a basis to redesign EDs with respect to critical hospital resources for performance improvement.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10605], "author_name_tesi": "Kang, Hyo Jung", "last_name_ssi": "Kang", "middle_name_ssi": "Jung", "first_name_ssi": "Hyo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard", "Harriet Black Nembhard", "Paul M Griffin", "Guodong Pang", "Kyoungrae Jung", "Colleen M Rafferty"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard, Dissertation Advisor", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Paul M Griffin, Committee Member", "Guodong Pang, Committee Member", "Kyoungrae Jung, Committee Member", "Colleen M Rafferty, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Healthcare systems engineering", "operations research in healthcare", "patient flow", "emergency department performance measure"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Am I more easily convinced when I am the source?

In the context of mass communication vehicles, such as online Web portals, customization allows users to not only configure the background color of their page but also to specify the kinds of news feeds they receive, thus making the users de facto gatekeepers of their own information universes. The user in essence becomes the source of communication. But does this sense of \u201cself as source\u201d alter the way the users process information received via customized interfaces? This dissertation attempts to answer this question by employing a between-subjects experiment (N = 146) that examined the effect of self-driven customization (high vs. low self-as-source) on persuasive message processing. In particular, it investigated the role played by three major psychological consequences of customization\u2014perceived control, perceived identity, and perceived involvement\u2014in shaping the nature of information processing of persuasive messages. Customization lets users be the controllers of the communication process, and at the same time, it helps them to express themselves. Based on the paradigm of self-control as a limited resource, it was hypothesized that the user-control aspect of customization would deplete self-control resources thereby dampening systematic processing of a persuasive message, whereas expressing identity would counteract such depletion effects and therefore enhance systematic processing. It was also expected that perceived involvement would positively mediate the relationship between customization and persuasive message processing. \n\tThe results showed that, in the low self-as-source condition, perceived control showed a negative effect on self-control resources, whereas perceived identity showed a positive effect. However, this effect was not found in the high self-as-source condition. The results also indicated that perceived identity was a significant mediator between self-as-source in customization and message processing. Participants scoring higher on perceived identity from the customized interface tended to process persuasive messages less systematically, perceived the message topic as more important, and showed higher intention to follow what the message recommended, than those who perceived lower level of identity. However, counter to expectations, manipulated credibility of the source (i.e., doctor vs. layperson) to test heuristic processing did not moderate these effects. \n\tTheoretical implications for persuasive technologies, dual process models and the agency model of customization are discussed, followed by practical implications for communicators who wish to incorporate new media technologies into their social influence campaigns.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8833], "author_name_tesi": "Kang, Hyunjin ", "last_name_ssi": "Kang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyunjin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Media Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["S.

Utilizing methylaluminoxane (MAO) as a co catalyst, 3 and 4 produced poly(norbornene) in good yield with no activity difference between 3 and 4.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4327], "author_name_tesi": "Kang, Myeongsoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Kang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Myeongsoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Alan James Benesi", "Ralph H Colby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Alan James Benesi, Committee Member", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["late transition metal", "catalysis", "polymerization", "polar vinyl monomer"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Advanced Magneto-optical Materials and Devices\n", "id": "7686", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5750", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The magneto-optical materials with both high Faraday rotation and high transmittance capabilities are greatly desired in high speed switches, isolators, and visible imaging systems. In this thesis work, new magneto-optical materials that possess both high Faraday effect and high transmittance in the visible range of the spectrum were studied and synthesized. The work done includes material synthesis, material properties testing, optical and magneto-optical properties testing, switching speed testing, and theoretical investigations. Specifically, garnet films, iron borate crystals and nanoparticles, and garnet particle films were successfully synthesized and switches made of these new materials were designed and tested at the wavelength of 532 nm, which is at the shorter wavelength of visible spectrum and is also among to the most sensitive range of the normal human eye at night. \n\nNew Bismuth iron gallium garnet thin-films (Bi3Fe4Ga1O12, BIGG) have been successfully deposited on gadolinium gallium garnet substrates with a pulsed laser deposition technique in our lab. X-ray diffraction analyses have proven that the BIGG films are of good epitaxial quality with a lattice constant close to 12.61+-0.01&#506;. The bandwidth of BIGG\u2019s transmittance spectrum has been extended and its left edge has been shifted about 50nm towards the shorter wavelengths relative to those of Bi3Fe5O12 (BIG) films. The BIGG film is more transparent than a BIG film although BIGG\u2019s Faraday rotation angle is slightly less than that of a BIG film. The figure of merit of the BIGG garnet film has reached 16.5 degree, which is about 1.8 times that of a typical BIG film. Currently, the switches using BIGG films were tested and a 2.4 ns response time had been reached with a ~1 mm circular aperture at the wavelength of 532 nm.\n\nIron Borate (FeBO3) is another material that is far superior in terms of the transmittance in the visible spectrum at room temperature to most garnet materials. In this study, a flux sintering technique was used to grow highly perfect iron borate platelet-like single crystals.  Our test showed that the green platelets we obtained have a (001) crystallization orientation. Our switching testing experiments showed that the speed of the switch using FeBO3 platelets has reached 1.2ns with a ~1 mm circular aperture at the wavelength of 532nm. The switching speed is high, but the Faraday rotation could not reach more than 5 degree because of the natural birefringence of the material. The FeBO3 is one of the orthoferrites with a large natural birefringence for the light propagated along the magnetization direction. The effect of birefringence on Faraday rotation reduced the maximum obtainable rotation. In order to eliminate the birefringence and further improve the transmittance, a high energy ball-milling technique was used to synthesize FeBO3 nanoparticles. Our numerical simulation shows the nanoparticles could eliminate the birefringence, and concurrently keep the intrinsic Faraday rotation. After milling and centrifuging, the FeBO3 nanoparticles\u2019 sizes reached down to 30nm so far. The nanoparticles are to be hot-pressed and re-formed into an orientation-randomized new crystal. It is expected that the nanoparticles approach will overcome the birefringence, improve the transmittance, and concurrently keep the same switching speed. Further tests need to be conducted on these FeBO3 nanoparticles.\n\nNew Bi1.8Y1.2Fe4Ga1O12 (BYIGG) nanoparticles were fabricated with coprecipitation and annealing processes. The advantages of these techniques are high yield and relatively low cost. When substituting Ga by Fe, BYIGG nanoparticles improved the transmittance compared to Bi1.8Y1.2Fe5O12 (BYIG) nanoparticles. The BYIGG nanoparticles are more yellowish, while the BYIG nanoparticles are more reddish.  With high energy ball-milling and spin-coating techniques, new BYIGG films were coated on a Corning 1737 glass substrates.  Our test showed that the Faraday rotation angle was about 2.5 degree for a 500 micron thick BYIGG film, and the transmittance at the wavelength of 532nm was about 1%. The figure of merit was found to be 2.2 degree, which is among the reported ones from 0.2 to 9.6 degree. It was observed that contamination from ball-milling process decreased the transmittance.  Further experiments need to be conducted, and one more challenge is to eliminate the contamination.\n\nThe switches made of the above materials are tested for speed response. As we know, if the circuit response time is larger than the films/crystals\u2019 response times, the speed tested is limited by the driving circuit board. For this reason, a RF circuit and a miniature coil were specially and successfully designed to generate a magnetic field about 400 Oe and a circuit rise time less than 1 ns.\n\nIn the theoretical study part of this dissertation, we proposed an new technique and successfully simulated an optimized aperiodic multilayer structure to enhance both the Faraday effect and the transmittance. Bi-substituted yttrium\u2013iron\u2013garnet films and dielectric SiO2 films were used in our simulation at the wavelength of 532nm. One-dimensional magneto-optical aperiodic multilayer structures were theoretically studied and optimized by means of a genetic algorithm. For one structure we optimized, its Faraday rotation per magnetic material thickness has been enhanced 13.6 times compared to a single magnetic layer, from 2.06 degree per micron to 27.98 degree per micron. For another optimized structure, the total Faraday rotation angle and figure of merit are 3.7 and 2.5 times larger than those of a single magnetic layer, respectively. All these results prove the effectiveness of this newly developed optimization technique.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5746], "author_name_tesi": "Kang, Shaoying ", "last_name_ssi": "Kang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shaoying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shizhuo Yin", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Zhiwen Liu", "Karl Martin Reichard", "Qi Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shizhuo Yin, Committee Chair", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Karl Martin Reichard, Committee Member", "Qi Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Garnet", "Faraday Effect", "Ultrafast switch", "Magneto-optical", "Nanoparticles", "Iron Borate"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Soil-landscape and Water Quality in the East Mahantango Creek Watershed\n", "id": "7307", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5968", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " Nonpoint source pollution is a world-wide concern for its exacerbation of water quality. Understanding spatial and temporal distribution of nonpoint source pollutants associated with soil-landscape variability can assist in predicting and monitoring water quality in watersheds. Variability of landscape features, soil properties, and water quality in the stream-order-based sub-watersheds and buffer zones was investigated in the East Mahantango Creek Watershed (EMC) located in the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province of east-central Pennsylvania. In addition to spatial analysis of soils and landscape features in the EMC, a systematic temporal analysis (traditional time series analysis, spectral analysis, and wavelet analysis) was conducted for the WE-38 Watershed, a third-order sub-watershed within the EMC using 15 years of monitoring data of hydrology and water quality. \n       Variability of elevation, slope, and land uses along different order sub-watersheds is influenced by the watershed topography (ridges and valleys). The coarse data of surface geology and the STATSGO soils database do not reflect actual variations among different order sub-watersheds. With more detailed SSURGO soils database, the area-weighted method recommended by the USDA-NRCS tends to smear out soil variations. A series of soil property trends were observed in buffer zones of different order streams along the stream network. Within the buffer distance of 150 m, the top two soil layers in lower order stream buffer zones have higher clay content and higher bulk density than those of higher order streams, but have shallower depth to bedrock, lower available water capacity, and lower organic matter content compared to higher order streams. Beyond the buffer zone of 150 m, variations of soil properties appear to stabilize.  The buffer distance of 70-100 m seems to be a threshold value that reflects significant changes of soil properties in the buffer zones along the stream network. These trends of soil properties in the buffer zones of different order streams can be explained by the effects of local topographic features and soil transport processes such as colluvial and alluvial process. The soil variability analysis along stream buffer zones provides useful information regarding soil distribution along stream network that would benefit buffer zone management and environmental modeling.  The three zones (hillslope zones, transitional zones and floodplain zones) reflecting soil formation and transport can be applicable to generate representative soil properties for environmental modeling and management at watershed or catchment scales.\n        Baseflow water quality in different order streams was investigated using one year of monitoring dataset together with two historical sampling datasets. Overall, a negative correlation between baseflow nitrate concentration and stream order was observed; however, significant spatial-temporal variations existed. Nitrate concentration was also linearly correlated to agricultural land use. The decreasing trend of nitrate concentration with increasing stream order can be explained by the reducing nitrate sources related to decreasing agricultural land use and possible increased in-stream processes along the stream network (such as denitrification and dilution). A positive power function relationship was identified between nitrate loads and stream order.  This was mainly due to the power function between discharge and stream order.  Overall, it appears that stream order is a helpful index of predicting and monitoring nitrate concentration and loads during baseflow in this agricultural watershed.\n        Stream flow and concentrations of nitrate, sodium, and chloride collected in the past 15 years showed different weak seasonal trends. Both sodium and chloride had a reverse sine-curve trend to flow. Autoregressive analysis demonstrated that high autocorrelations of all variables were within six days (coefficient > 0.5). Nitrate and flow appeared to be with high cross-correlations. Negative cross-correlation between sodium and flow was also found. Sodium was damped compared to chloride. Although no fractal property was found for flow and nitrate with spectral analysis, they showed highly coherence from their higher variations for short wavelengths. A multi-variate temporal model of nitrate was developed to assist in predicting and monitoring nitrate dynamics.  \n       Using wavelet analysis, we analyzed temporal characteristics of three hydrological variables (precipitation, stream flow, and well water level) for three periods (15 years, 3 year, and a hydrological year). For three unevenly sampled water quality variables (nitrate, chloride, and sodium), the weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) method was employed.  No strong temporal pattern of precipitation was found for all three periods.  For the 15 year of continual monitoring datasets, a strong consistent annual temporal pattern of well water level and an intermittent annual temporal pattern of stream flow were observed.  For the relative short time periods (three years and a hydrological year), strong seasonal temporal patterns of stream flow and well water level were noticed.  Using the WWZ method, seasonal patterns of three stream water quality indicators can be associated with their seasonal shifts.  Sodium and chloride peak concentrations in the winter season were well captured by the wavelet analysis. Using wavelet analysis, the degree of temporal patterns was found to decrease in the following general order: well water level > stream flow > precipitation, and nitrate > sodium \u201ed chloride, suggesting an increasing dynamics of processes involved in ground water, stream water, and rain water systems, and a decreasing temporal periodicity associated with nitrate, sodium, and chloride concentrations in the stream with the weighted wavelet Z-transform.  Wavelet analysis together with other time series analysis tools can be a potential tool to quantify hydrological and water quality dynamics from a stochastic perspective.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5962], "author_name_tesi": "Kang, Shujiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Kang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shujiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hangsheng Lin", "Gary Walter Petersen", "William Gburek", "David Russell Dewalle", "Patrick M Reed"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hangsheng Lin, Committee Chair", "Gary Walter Petersen, Committee Member", "William Gburek, Committee Member", "David Russell Dewalle, Committee Member", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["water quality", "landscape", "soil", "temporal analysis", "spatial analysis", "stream order", "stream network"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF MESOSCALE SURFACE HETEROGENEITY ON THE FAIR-WEATHER CONVECTIVE ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY LAYER\n", "id": "7634", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6071", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "New insight into the structure of the fair-weather daytime ABL (about 1130-1430 LST) over heterogeneous surfaces at a 10-km-order scale is obtained from observational and numerical studies of data collected by aircraft and at surface flux sites during the International H2O Project (IHOP_2002) and using a recently-developed large eddy simulation (LES). From theses studies, the key findings to the ABL structure over the mesoscale surface heterogeneity are the following.\nFirst, the ABL over mesoscale surface heterogeneity has a considerably different structure, depending on the heterogeneity intensity. In the ABL with a low amplitude of surface heat flux variation, the microscale (turbulent) variances and fluxes, after filtering out the mesoscale contribution, can fit to the values predicted by the mixed-layer similarity which is built based on the assumption of a homogenous ABL. However, the ABL with a high variation amplitude can contain temporally oscillating mesoscale horizontal flows and thus does not satisfy the quasi-steady state condition. \nSecond, even in the ABL over mesoscale surface heterogeneity, the microscale (turbulent) vertical flux is found to be much more significant than the mesoscale vertical flux, the product of mesoscale fluctuations of vertical velocity and a scalar (potential temperature or water vapor mixing ratio), due to the absence of mesoscale fluctuation of vertical velocity. However, as the amplitude of surface heat flux variation increases, the interscale component of the vertical flux, the product of miscroscale (turbulent) vertical velocity and mesoscale fluctuation of potential temperature or water vapor mixing ratio, becomes significant and can be comparable to the microscale (turbulent) vertical flux at certain times only in the non-quasi-steady state ABL. \nThird, the advection of moisture by the surface-heterogeneity-induced mesoscale horizontal flows can be significant from a perspective of the environment for moist convection. Even for the ABL with a low amplitude (here 100 Wm-2 or lower) of surface heat flux variation, the amount of moisture transported from the cooler region (the region over the surface having heat flux below the domain average) to the warmer region (the region over the surface having heat flux above the domain average) is as much as 130 % of the amount of moisture supplied from the surface in the warmer region.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6063], "author_name_tesi": "Kang, Song-Lak ", "last_name_ssi": "Kang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Song-Lak", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis", "John Corry Wyngaard", "Nelson Lawrence Seaman", "David R Stauffer", "Yvette Pamela Richardson", "Andrew Mark Carleton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis, Committee Chair", "John Corry Wyngaard, Committee Member", "Nelson Lawrence Seaman, Committee Member", "David R Stauffer, Committee Member", "Yvette Pamela Richardson, Committee Member", "Andrew Mark Carleton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["daytime atmospheric boundary layer", "mesoscale surface heterogeneity", "mixed-layer similarity", "absence of mesoscale vertical velocity", "mesoscale vertical flux", "advection of moisture"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Bisociative design: concept exploration by mining design associations across multiple products", "id": "28827", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12278", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " More than 250,000 engineering products are released into the market each year. The increasing quantity and diversity of products makes it difficult to search through the entire design space for knowledge that may lead to the successful creation of new product concepts. Researchers have presented engineering design methodologies for new product development processes, such as design by analogy and bio-inspired design, which can discover design inspirations across multiple domains. In order to develop new design solutions, existing design methodologies focus on improving products\u2019 functional aspects and engineering performance based on experts\u2019 manual investigations. Although these methodologies have shown great promise in solving design issues in the engineering design field, they have not fully addressed approaches that can increase next generation products\u2019 market sales. In the context of engineering design, a next generation product incorporates significant improvements in performance and design over the preceding generation\u2019s product by changing or adding with new product attributes that addresses the needs of customers. Current design methodologies rely on manual investigations for analyzing and generating ideas, a process that is time consuming and costly. As products increase in quantity and complexity in the market space, such manual approaches to concept exploration become challenging. \nIn order to mitigate these challenges, this dissertation proposes Bisociative Design; a methodology that efficiently searches for product attributes that increase the novelty, market sales, and sustainability of next generation products. Koestler defined the concept of Bisociation as \u201ca synthesis of elements drawn from two previously unrelated matrices of thought into a new matrix of meaning by way of a process involving comparison.\u201d The Bisociative design methodology proposed in this dissertation provides designers with new product attributes (i.e., elements) that can increase next generation products\u2019 (i.e., new matrix) novelty, market sales, and sustainability (i.e., synergies arise from a synthesis). This dissertation hypothesizes that product attributes discovered using the Bisociative design methodology will the increase sales, novelty and sustainability of next generation products. \nIn this dissertation, a product represents an artifact that is manufactured for sale. Using this definition, a module, which is a subassembly of the artifact, can also be considered a product since it is also manufactured for sale. In the context of engineering design, a product is assumed to be characterized by its form attribute and function attribute. The form attribute represents the product\u2019s shape, while the function attribute represents the product\u2019s objective. The methodology presented in each chapter of this dissertation automatically analyzes product attributes across multiple domains by employing natural language processing algorithms and 3D image mining techniques. Case studies related to each step of the new product development process demonstrate the Bisociative design methodology in chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7. Chapter 4 demonstrates how the methodology provides new product attributes that increase market sales. In Chapter 5, the methodology generates initial design concepts, which improve product distinctiveness compared to existing products, and establishes the feasibility of developing next generation products. Once designers select modules containing product attributes in order to create detailed designs for next generation products, the methodology presented in Chapter 6 automatically quantifies each module\u2019s functional interaction, which reduces the manual efforts needed to analyze the interaction. In order to increase product sustainability, Chapter 7 extends the concept of Bisociative design to End-Of-Life products. Each chapter aims to reduce the manual efforts required for discovering product attributes across multiple products during the product design process. The \"new matrix\" is analogous to the next generation products that are launched into the market space.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11659], "author_name_tesi": "Kang, Sung Woo", "last_name_ssi": "Kang", "middle_name_ssi": "Woo", "first_name_ssi": "Sung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Conrad S Tucker", "Conrad S Tucker", "Soundar Kumara", "Gul Kremer", "C Lee Giles"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Conrad S Tucker, Dissertation Advisor", "Conrad S Tucker, Committee Chair", "Soundar Kumara, Committee Member", "Gul Kremer, Committee Member", "C Lee Giles, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["engineering design", "product design", "new product development process", "text mining"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Demystifying the Popular Narratives of English Fever in South Korea: From Mothers' Perspectives", "id": "24866", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10941", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While some scholars look at the spread of English as a global language a neutral or positive process in the history of English language (Crystal, 1997; Graddol, 1997), other scholars see it differently (Canagarah, 1999; Kumaravadivelu, 2003; Pennycook, 1998, 2007; Phillpson, 2002; Rassol, 2007; Watts, 2011).
