In 1972, Congress passed Title IX, an education amendment that would lead to an exponential increase in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s participation in sport. A few weeks later, Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut dominated the televised coverage of Munich Olympics, conveying images about femininity and athleticism in popular imagination to audiences in the United States. The next year, the \u201cBattle of the Sexes,\u201d Billie Jean King\u2019s tennis match against Bobby Riggs, became a symbol of women\u2019s fight against sexist attitudes and practices in sport. These moments, although credited with spearheading social change and challenging cultural norms, gave only temporary visibility to women\u2019s sport. Ultimately, these efforts did not lead to a substantial shift in gender representations, nor did they challenge gender norms in the sports journalism industry. \n\tIn this dissertation, I draw upon oral history interviews to illuminate how journalists remembered women\u2019s sport during this time of social change. I interviewed sports journalists who throughout their careers extensively covered women\u2019s sports for their respective newspapers. By centering the voices of journalists, this story foregrounds memories of everyday lived experiences of covering women\u2019s sports. With a focus on one media market, Chicago, the dissertation offers an in-depth analysis of the social, legislative, cultural, and institutional factors that shaped women\u2019s sports coverage in the 1970s and 1980s.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10653], "author_name_tesi": "Antunovic, Dunja ", "last_name_ssi": "Antunovic", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dunja", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marie Hardin", "James Ford Risley", "Patrick Robert Parsons", "Jessica Lynn Schultz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marie Hardin, Dissertation Advisor", "James Ford Risley, Committee Member", "Patrick Robert Parsons, Committee Member", "Jessica Lynn Schultz, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["journalism", "women's sport", "history", "oral history"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "SEMI-ACTIVE CONTROL OF HELICOPTER VIBRATION \n USING CONTROLLABLE STIFFNESS AND DAMPING DEVICES\n", "id": "5986", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4988", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Semi-active concepts for helicopter vibration reduction are developed and evaluated in this dissertation.  Semi-active devices, controllable stiffness devices or controllable orifice dampers, are introduced; (i) in the blade root region (rotor-based concept) and (ii) between the rotor and the fuselage as semi-active isolators (in the non-rotating frame). Corresponding semi-active controllers for helicopter vibration reduction are also developed.  The effectiveness of the rotor-based semi-active vibration reduction concept (using stiffness and damping variation) is demonstrated for a 4-bladed hingeless rotor helicopter in moderate- to high-speed forward flight.  The rotor blade is modeled as an elastic beam, which undergoes elastic flap-bending, lag-bending, and torsional deformations, and is discretized using finite element analysis.  Aerodynamic loads on the blade are determined using blade element theory, with rotor inflow calculated using linear inflow or free wake analysis. The stiffness variation is introduced by modulating the stiffness of the root element or a discrete controllable stiffness device that connects the rotor hub and the blade.  The damping variation is achieved by adjusting the damping coefficient of a controllable orifice damper, introduced in the blade root region.  Optimal multi-cyclic stiffness/damping variation inputs that can produce simultaneous reduction in all components of hub vibrations are determined through an optimal semi-active control scheme using gradient and non-gradient based optimizations.  A sensitivity study shows that the stiffness variation of root element can reduce hub vibrations when proper amplitude and phase are used.  Furthermore, the optimal semi-active control scheme can determine the combination of stiffness variations that produce significant vibration reduction in all components of vibratory hub loads simultaneously.  It is demonstrated that desired cyclic variations in properties of the blade root region can be practically achieved using discrete controllable stiffness devices and controllable dampers, especially in the flap and lag directions.  These discrete controllable devices can produce 35-50% reduction in a composite vibration index representing all components of vibratory hub loads.  No detrimental increases are observed in the lower harmonics of blade loads and blade response (which contribute to the dynamic stresses) and controllable device internal loads, when the optimal stiffness and damping variations are introduced.  The effectiveness of optimal stiffness and damping variations in reducing hub vibration is retained over a range of cruise speeds and for variations in fundamental rotor properties.  The effectiveness of the semi-active isolator is demonstrated for a simplified single degree of freedom system representing the semi-active isolation system.  The rotor, represented by a lumped mass under harmonic force excitation, is supported by a spring and a parallel damper on the fuselage (assumed to have infinite mass).  Properties of the spring or damper can then be controlled to reduce transmission of the force into the fuselage or the support structure.  This semi-active isolation concept can produce additional 30% vibration reduction beyond the level achieved by a passive isolator.  Different control schemes (i.e. open-loop, closed-loop, and closed-loop adaptive schemes) are developed and evaluated to control transmission of vibratory loads to the support structure (fuselage), and it is seen that a closed-loop adaptive controller is required to retain vibration reduction effectiveness when there is a change in operating condition.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4965], "author_name_tesi": "Anusonti-Inthra, Phuriwat ", "last_name_ssi": "Anusonti-Inthra", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Phuriwat", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Smith", "George A Lesieutre", "Farhan Gandhi", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Smith, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member", "Farhan Gandhi, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["controllable damper", "controllable stiffness", "semi-active control", "helicopter vibration reduction"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "examining the impact of community policing activities on crime reporting in Jefferson County, West Virginia, the United States of America", "id": "24990", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10991", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Police administrators and government officials have agreed that traditional policing strategies cannot reduce the high crime rates in urban and nonurban areas.

Traditional skills are still taught to journalism students and still employed in traditional newsrooms. This study sought to determine the psychological effect of journalistic writing conventions on modern audiences. Through the paradigm of dual-processing models of persuasion (i.e., the Elaboration Likelihood Model and the Heuristic-Systematic Processing Model), this study explores two possibilities: Do readers notice mistakes and then consciously decide not to trust the content? Or do mistakes serve as distractions that unconsciously inhibit understanding? In other words, are errors heuristic cues, or are they inhibitors that block in-depth processing?\n\nA between-subjects experiment (N = 504) was conducted to observe the relationship between errors and perceptions. Participants were shown news articles with various mistakes (i.e., grammatical errors, AP style errors, and inverted pyramid structure errors) and responded to questions about their perceptions. Participants also were put in either a high-motivation or low-motivation condition to determine whether perceptions differed based on attention.\n\nResults showed no significant effects of errors on recall, writing quality, message credibility, or informativeness. These results held regardless of which errors were considered and which article was read. Power analysis showed that the sample was large enough to detect even a small effect size. This suggests that the effects are either contingent on study design or no longer existent. Future studies could determine whether such effects are still present. \n\nIf, as this study suggests, these effects can no longer be found, then we could be observing a shift in the way readers view historic standards for writing. Based on this study, readers are more willing to overlook style and structure errors than has been found in previous research. Therefore, this study proposes that journalists and journalism educators in the 21st century need to rethink the emphasis on style in the newsroom and the classroom.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10612], "author_name_tesi": "Appelman, Alyssa Jill", "last_name_ssi": "Appelman", "middle_name_ssi": "Jill", "first_name_ssi": "Alyssa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Grant Schmierbach", "Michael Grant Schmierbach", "S.

The issue of CAOs opting out has been identified as a component of impending leadership crises in higher education, including a shortage of executive leaders in U.S. community colleges. This qualitative research study examined the lived experiences of nine CAOs (two males and seven females) from Pennsylvania community colleges to understand the reasons why community college chief academic officers in Pennsylvania are opting not to pursue the college presidency.

CAOs make the decision to opt out of the presidency pipeline because the functions of the presidency are not aligned with their passions and interests. College presidents are externally focused and more engaged with the wider external community, than they are with day-to-day academic operations.

Cosmogenic exposure dating of moraine boulders provides a method for estimating moraine ages.  However, geomorphic processes interfere with cosmogenic exposure dating.  To improve the accuracy of the cosmogenic exposure dating method, quantitative methods for assessing the effects of geomorphic processes on cosmogenic exposure dating are needed.  \n\nTo address this need, this dissertation describes models of two geomorphic processes and their effects on the cosmogenic exposure dating of moraines.  These processes are moraine degradation and inheritance.  Both models use Monte Carlo techniques to estimate the statistical distributions of exposure dates from moraine boulders, given specific assumptions about the histories of the boulders.  The moraine degradation model is based on prior examples from the literature; the inheritance model is novel.  \n\nSome implications of this work for cosmogenic exposure dating of moraines follow.  \n\nDifferent geomorphic processes give rise to different statistical distributions of cosmogenic exposure dates.  Moraine degradation produces distributions that are skewed toward the young tail of the distribution, whereas inheritance produces distributions that are skewed toward the old tail of the distribution.  \n\nSimple procedures for estimating moraine ages from cosmogenic exposure dates perform well in some cases and poorly in others, sometimes producing moraine age estimates that are incorrect by thousands of years.  Simple estimators tested here include the mean, the mean after discarding outliers, the youngest date, and the oldest date.  \n\nExplicit inversion of the models against \ncollections of cosmogenic exposure dates may represent an improvement over simple methods of estimating moraine ages.  These inverse methods yield estimates of the rates and magnitudes of geomorphic processes acting in glaciated basins, as well as the moraines\u2019 ages.  \n\nField sampling criteria that preferentially choose pristine boulders may yield exposure dates that underestimate the ages of moraines by thousands of years.  This statement assumes that the moraines lose several meters of material from their crests over their lifetimes, that the boulders erode at a constant rate after being exhumed, and that inherited nuclides are not present in the boulders.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4864], "author_name_tesi": "Applegate, Patrick J.", "last_name_ssi": "Applegate", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Patrick", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard B Alley", "Richard B Alley", "Michael Mann", "David Pollard", "Andrew Mark Carleton", "Thomas V Lowell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard B Alley, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard B Alley, Committee Chair", "Michael Mann, Committee Chair", "David Pollard, Committee Member", "Andrew Mark Carleton, Committee Member", "Thomas V Lowell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["moraine", "cosmogenic", "geomorphology", "geochronology", "hillslope"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "\u201cASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT\u2026\u201d GIFTING AND DETAILING: HOW THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS INCREASED THE SIDE EFFECTS WHILE JEOPARDIZING PATIENT CARE\n\n\n", "id": "11756", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2956", "abstract_tesi": "If health communication research is meant to improve the alliances between physicians and their patients, and also to strengthen public health practices, then one would assume that the patient must be perceived as a primary construct in the equation.

Beyond informing consumers about pharmaceutical drugs on the market, these advertisements additionally model for consumers that these prescriptions should serve as forms of health intervention in their lives.  This dissertation is designed to achieve several goals: (1) to replicate previous studies of DTCA (2) to examine levels of medicalization and pharmaceuticalization within these ads and the potential resulting influence upon society, and (3) to apply elements of critical advertising studies to direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertisements, including the prevalence of what this project will call \u201cpharmaceutical fetishism\u201d in such ads (i.e., the portrayal of DTC advertisements as increasing happiness or control over one\u2019s life and how this term relates to \u201ccommodity fetishism\u201d; how prescription drugs are glorified as a form of positive consumption).\nUsing a multi-method approach to DTC advertisements which include quantitative content analysis, qualitative textual analysis, political economy, and a case study of a particularly notable example of DTCA, this dissertation will argue that the symbolic complexity of television DTC advertisements not only attempts to influence how effective these drugs seem to be, but also how drugs are used as key interventions in life, and how drugs may solve a host of personal and social problems.  At the same time, the way that people are portrayed in DTC advertisements also has implications for the mediated representation of gender, age, class and other social categories. \nThis dissertation found four major themes that are representative of the mixed-methods analyses chapters (four, five, and six).  The first common theme features a continuation, and increase, of DTC advertisements undermining their informational function by emphasizing overwhelmingly positive outcomes of drug use, decreasing the educational content that focuses on health ailments particular drugs are designed to treat, and discouraging serious considerations of risk factors and other treatment options.  The second major theme to result from this research involves the use of positive emotional appeals in DTCA.  The third, and arguably most notable, theme found in this research is the practice of pharmaceutical advertisements explicitly utilizing advertising as a means of presenting prescription drugs as cures for more than just health conditions.  Drugs are advertised in a way that presents them as having the added benefit of selling a particular lifestyle to individuals -- one that emphasizes happiness, successful relationships, nuclear family activities, and personal fulfillment.  Finally, the fourth major theme to result from this research is the ways in which DTC advertisements perpetuate normalized conceptions of particular representations, featuring characters that portray stereotypical gender roles, youthfulness even in cases of being older, heteronormative relationships, familial relationships as being central to health, and patients as being autonomous from their physicians.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10535], "author_name_tesi": "Applequist, Janelle ", "last_name_ssi": "Applequist", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Janelle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Charles Elavsky", "Fuyuan Shen", "Jon F Nussbaum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Paul Mcallister, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles Elavsky, Dissertation Advisor", "Fuyuan Shen, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Direct-to-Consumer Advertising", "DTCA", "pharmaceutical advertising", "critical advertising studies", "pharmaceutical fetishism"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "COMPUTER AIDED PROCESS PLANNING SYSTEM FOR PIPE WELDING\n", "id": "9684", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1834", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, a Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) system for pipe welding is presented.

Hence, the modeling of such antennas is a challenging problem. The most frequently used numerical techniques either require excessive computational resources or cannot effectively model such structures. Thus, hybrid techniques have recently been employed to take advantage of each method\u2019s strengths, while minimizing weaknesses.\n   To enhance computational efficiency, a new methodology is introduced in this thesis, based on a combination of the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) and the Method of Moments (MoM) numerical techniques in conjunction with the Surface Equivalence and Reciprocity Theorems. Several antenna configurations are considered to illustrate the new methodology: 1) radiating slots on conducting cylinders, 2) microstrip patch antennas mounted on large conducting structures, and 3) reflector antennas with partial circular symmetry.\n   In the transmit mode, the region containing the radiation source is first analyzed using either the MoM or FDTD technique to determine \u201cequivalent currents\u201d at the radiating aperture. The Surface Equivalence Principle is then applied, allowing the material in the radiating region to be theoretically modified to match its surroundings. This creates a homogeneous structure for the first two antenna types, and a circularly symmetric structure for the last type.\n   The operation of the antenna system is then reversed to the receive mode, and the fields produced at the radiating aperture are determined. By analyzing this mode of operation, difficult integrals and asymmetric sources are avoided for antenna types 1 and 2, and 3, respectively. For antenna types 1 and 2, the MoM technique is used to compute the surface fields, which reduces computational resource requirements since the surface of the structure \u2013 as opposed to its volume \u2013 is modeled. For antenna type 3, the effective removal of asymmetric sources allows a 2-D FDTD simulation of the antenna structure, instead of a full 3-D model.\n   Finally, utilizing the Reciprocity Theorem, the surface fields determined for the receive mode case are combined with the \u201cequivalent currents\u201d calculated in the transmit mode in order to compute far-zone fields. Through use of the technique, computational savings on the order of 95% are realized.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1667], "author_name_tesi": "Arakaki, Dean Yasuo", "last_name_ssi": "Arakaki", "middle_name_ssi": "Yasuo", "first_name_ssi": "Dean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner", "Raj Mittra", "Lynn A Carpenter", "Raymond J Luebbers", "Anthony J Ferraro", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Chair", "Raj Mittra, Committee Chair", "Lynn A Carpenter, Committee Member", "Raymond J Luebbers, Committee Member", "Anthony J Ferraro, Committee Member", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["numerical methods", "antennas", "electromagnetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Diversity, Ecology and Evolution of Myrmecophilous Ophiocordyceps", "id": "14076jua23", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14076", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Entomopathogenic species are found within five of the eight phyla of Fungi (Microsporidia, Chytridiomycota, Entomophthoromycota, Basidiomycota and Ascomycota).

The \"up\" and \"down\" polarization states created in a ferroelectric material can act as data storage bits. Domain shaping into diverse shapes and length scales is also critical to THz surface accoustic wave devices.

Nonlinear optics is demonstrated to be an excellent tool to probe the onset of ferroelectric and ferroelastic order parameter, as well as their orientation in ferroelectrics. Scanning probe microscopy is demonstrated to be a quantitative technique to study domain walls in ferroelectric materials with a resolution of about 10nm. This technique is then used to demonstrate that real 180 degree domain walls in ferroelectric materials can be as broad as 10-100nm.

Biobased lubricants have lower coefficient of friction, improved wear characteristics, a higher viscosity index, and lower volatility and flashpoints than mineral based oils. Polymerized vegetable oils have found their way into many industrial applications such as inks, polymers, and hydraulic fluids. The initial objective of this thesis is to formulate a bio-based gear lubricant from thermally polymerized vegetable oils.\nIn order to synthesize a variety of new gear oil formulations of desired properties, materials without the glycerol moiety, which is naturally in thermally modified soybean oil were desired. It was thought that Diels-Alder chemistry could be used where the thermally polymerized soybean oil could be transesterified with the desired alcohol leading to the desired thermally modified alkyl ester products. However, examinations of resultant materials showed that the cyclohexene structures expected from the type reactions are not found in these products. A new structure for thermal polymerization is suggested.\nBiobased gear oil was developed from soybean oil, capitalizing on the knowledge of the new structure. The soybean oil was first thermally polymerized and then mixed with additives and diluents.  The effect of pour point depressants, co-base oils, anti-oxidants and anti-wear additives are reported.  The final formulation of biobased gear oil gives excellent viscosimetric and wear protection properties.  Lubricant testing results, including oxidation resistance are comparable to or better than commercially available gear oils. \nThe last study of the thesis investigated oxidative degradation kinetics of vegetable base fluids. Thermal stability and deposit formation characteristics of soybean oil are studied by an isothermal thermogravimetric analyzer. Heating rate, catalysis, isothermal time, purge flow and oxygen diffusion are studied at different temperatures. Kinetic rates found from the new method are comported with the well-known Penn State Micro Oxidation test.\nIn summary this thesis has three main objectives. The first objective is to understand the structure of thermally polymerized vegetable oils. The second one is to formulate a gear lubricant from thermally polymerized vegetable oils. The final objective of this study is to develop a method to calculate the oxidation kinetics of lubricants utilizing a readily available thermogravimetric analyzer. Soybean oil is predominantly used as a vegetable oil due to the technical properties and its worldwide availability.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4441], "author_name_tesi": "Arca, Mert ", "last_name_ssi": "Arca", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mert", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Manuel Perez Sr.", "Joseph Manuel Perez Sr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Manuel Perez Sr., Thesis Advisor", "Joseph Manuel Perez Sr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermal polymerization", "ASTM", "DSC", "TGA", "NMR", "lubricant", "Vegetable oil", "diels alder"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "In Search of a Break in the Clouds: An Ethnographic Study of Academic and Student Affairs Cultures", "id": "8354", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6398", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigates the cultures of the academic and student affairs divisions within one selective residential liberal arts institution.

The goal is for students to develop an appreciation for the interconnectedness among components of their lives, strengthen their intellectual development, and cultivate a disposition toward life-long learning. This ethnographic study explores the tension between academic and student affairs staff members\u2019 roles on campus by exploring people\u2019s perceptions that influence the potential for a synergistic relationship between the divisions. \n\nAt Crossroads University [pseudonym], I immersed myself in the campus culture for a complete academic year employing a three-pronged approach to data collection (interviews, participant observation, and artifact analysis) in order to understand the institutional culture, the divisional cultures, and their interactions. I conducted 154 formal interviews with 96 faculty, administrators, and students, and observed roughly 250 separate meetings and events. \n\nThe Crossroads case presents a comprehensive collage of perspectives shared by faculty and staff that reveal underlying perceptions, biases, and stereotypes that influence people\u2019s interpretation of the campus culture, climate, and staff members\u2019 roles within the organization.

The Crossroads case explores a campus debate that informs researchers, practitioners, and graduate students of the various competing issues and perspectives of which they should be aware as they grapple with their own discussions and planning for a future in higher education where learning-centeredness is the goal.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6398], "author_name_tesi": "Arcelus, Victor John", "last_name_ssi": "Arcelus", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Victor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick T Terenzini", "Lisa Lattuca", "James Fredericks Volkwein", "Edward Paul Durrenberger", "Peter Magolda"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick T Terenzini, Committee Chair", "Lisa Lattuca, Committee Member", "James Fredericks Volkwein, Committee Member", "Edward Paul Durrenberger, Committee Member", "Peter Magolda, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["higher education", "college", "university", "academic affairs", "student affairs", "collaboration", "partnership", "enthnography", "learning-centered", "intragroup dialogue", "intergroup dialogue", "case study", "culture", "climate", "leadership"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Composite Fermion Crystals in the Lowest Landau Level", "id": "22987", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10561", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two-dimensional electrons systems (2DES) exposed to strong magnetic fields at electron den-\nsities above 10*10 cm^{\u22122}, such as those realized in AlGaAs/GaAs semiconductor heterostructures and quantum wells, exhibit a host of fascinating quantum phenomena. The most notable of these, the integer quantum Hall effect and fractional quantum Hall effect, continue to\nbe a source of intense theoretical and experimental scrutiny. It has been hypothesized that,\nat the large magnetic fields where the fractional quantum Hall effect manifests, the ground\nstate consists mostly of a liquid state, with a small fraction of the system forming a crystal.\nAt even larger magnetic fields, the fractional quantum Hall effect no longer manifests and\nthe two-dimensional electron system becomes insulating. It is suspected that this insulating\nphase is a consequence of the formation of a crystal state.\nDespite more than two decades of experimental work, the question as to whether the\n2DES at strong magnetic fields forms crystalline phases remains unanswered. While it has\nlong been understood that the ground state of the 2DES at exactly the rational filling factors\n\\nu = n/(2pn +/- 1), where n and p are both integers, consists entirely of a liquid state, the\nhypothesis that a small fraction of the 2DES forms an ordered crystalline state when the\nfilling factor \\nu is in the vicinity of (but not exactly equal to) the rational values n/(2pn +/- 1)\nhas received support from only a few experiments, largely due to a dearth of both theoretical\npredictions and experimental studies. The low filling factor insulating phase of the 2DES has\nbeen subject to much greater scrutiny, and the consensus is that it possesses some type of\nlong-range order and that its properties are a consequence of electron-electron interactions,\nand not disorder. However, no experiment offers direct evidence of crystalline ordering, such\nas the observation of Bragg diffraction peaks or the k^{3/2} dispersion (where k is the magnitude\nof the wavevector \\vec{k}) characteristic of a 2D crystal, nor is the importance of quantum effects\nclear. Support of the proposal that the insulating phase is crystalline has only emerged by\nconsidering all of the experimental evidence that has accumulated as a whole over the last\ntwo plus decades. The goal of this dissertation is to establish theoretically some physical signatures of a\ncrystalline ground state in a 2DES exposed to a strong magnetic field that would enable\nexperimentalists to conclusively identify the presence of crystalline states. To this end, I,\nin collaboration with my advisor J. K. Jain, have proposed two classes of ansatzes for the\n2DES ground state. The first, which we refer to as a `type-1 composite fermion crystals\u2019, are\nstrongly correlated hexagonal crystals of electrons and are our model for the low-filling-factor\ninsulating state. We solve a longstanding experimental puzzle (nearly 25 years old) by show-\ning that a type-1 composite fermion crystal is responsible for the reentrant insulating phase\nbetween the \\nu = 1/5 and 2/9 fractional quantum Hall phases. We predict that, at low filling\nfactors, there is a series of phase transitions between different composite fermion crystals\nand that an unambiguous signature of these phase transitions would be the observation of\nan abrupt change in the shear modulus of the 2DES ground state, which magnetoabsorption experiments may be able to measure. We also calculate the energies of defects in the type-1 composite fermion crystals. We show that a defect of non-classical origin, the `bubble\ninterstitial\u2019, has the lowest energy, the low defect energy of these crystal states is a unique\nquantum signature of the ground state, and that the defect energies are comparable to the\nactivation energies measured in transport experiments, thus providing further support for\nthe notion that the insulating phase is crystalline. The second class of ansatzes, referred to\nas `type-2 composite fermion crystals\u2019, is a model for the ground state of the 2DES in the\nvicinity of the filling factors \\nu = n/(2pn +/- 1). These ansatzes consist of placing most of the\n2DES into a liquid state, while taking the remaining fraction and forming a crystalline state,\ni.e., a type-2 composite fermion crystal. One characteristic of these ansatzes is that the\ndensity of the type-2 composite fermion crystal goes to zero as the filling factor approaches\nthe rational values \\nu \\rightarrow n/(2pn +/- 1). These wavefunctions enables us, for the first time,\nto calculate the energy of fractional quantum Hall states as a continuous function of filling\nfactor. We predict that, in the filling-factor range 1/3 \\leq \\nu \\leq 4/9, a series of spin polarization\nphase transitions will occur as a continuous function of filling factor. We also predict that these type-2 composite fermion crystals will be stable only in a narrow range around the\nfilling factors \\nu = n/(2n + 1), for n = 1, 2, and 3.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10202], "author_name_tesi": "Archer, Alex Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Archer", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Alex", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain", "Jainendra Jain", "Gerald Dennis Mahan", "John C Collins", "Stephane Coutu", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain, Dissertation Advisor", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Chair", "Gerald Dennis Mahan, Committee Member", "John C Collins, Committee Member", "Stephane Coutu, Committee Member", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FQHE", "fractional quantum Hall effect", "ionic crystal", "2DES", "two dimensional electron system"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "UTILIZING IN VITRO CELLULAR SYSTEMS TO PROBE THE ROLE OF NEUROCHEMICALS ANALYTICALLY", "id": "9803", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2436", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The dynamic interplay between the different types of cells in the brain involves the release and uptake of multiple chemical factors and their resulting signaling cascades in response to stimuli.

Consequently, dissecting particular aspects of cellular communication is difficult in an in vivo environment. To better dissect particular aspects of cellular communication, controlled in vitro environments are combined with established techniques and novel platforms in this dissertation. Following\nan introduction to cellular communication and the methods utilized to investigate how it occurs, the development and fabrication of a microfluidic device to examine the interaction of a network of cells is described in chapter 2. This device, composed of a lower pharmacological layer and an upper bulk flow layer, utilizes hydrodynamic\nfocusing to individually address cells without exposing the entire population. Fluorescent and electrochemical data illustrate how the flow streams introduced through the lower layer can be manipulated by fluid sent through the above bulk channels to limit diffusion.  In chapter 3, a novel patterning technique, sucrose lift-off lithography, is reported as an alternative to traditional patterning schemes. With this technique, a sacrificial layer of sucrose is initially deposited onto a substrate, which is then coated with photoresist. The resist is then patterned lithographically to expose the substrate in defined well areas. The wells are subsequently loaded with adhesion proteins and a cell suspension, whose culture medium dissolves the sucrose over time, leaving only the patterned cells on the substrate. In chapters 4 and 5, amperometry is utilized to examine the effects of drug treatment and gene modification by knockout on exocytosis. Incubation with the D2 agonist, pramipexole, is found to cause an acute decrease in extracellular calcium influx and a decrease in the amount of dopamine released from in PC12 cells following potassium stimulation in chapter 4. Additionally, the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) is found to package the agonist as well as DA into secretory vesicles. The\neffects of GODZ and SERZ-&#946; gene knockout on calcium influx and release from intracellular stores in both murine hippocampal neurons and peritoneal mast cells are discussed in Chapter 5. The processes of double knockout neurons, lacking both GODZ and SERZ-&#946;, were found to have decreased calcium influx and release when compared to wild type processes. Moreover, the exocytotic release of histamine and serotonin from\nmast cells was also examined following stimulation. The release kinetics for both\ncompounds was observed to change with gene deletion as did the number of molecules released from the granules. Loss of GODZ and SERZ-&#946;, whose main function is the posttranslational modification of proteins by palmitoylation, likely causes alterations in the function of proteins that dictate the binding of granules to the plasma membrane.  Lastly, pyrolyzed photoresist microelectrodes were characterized for use as a coulometric detector in a microchannel separation device in chapter 6.

The resulting hypermodification confers improved anticodon-codon base pairing, resulting in greater accuracy and reading frame maintenance during translation The radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzyme MiaB catalyzes the methylthiolation of the unactivated carbon 2 bearing an isopentenyl modification to their exocyclic nitrogen (i6A), to generate the 2-methylthio-N6- isopentenyladenosine group (ms2i6A). As a Radical SAM (RS) enzyme, MiaB harbors a canonical, redox active [4Fe\u20134S]2+/1+ RS cluster ligated at three Fe ions by cysteinyl residues within a typically conserved CX3CX2C motif, leaving an uncoordinated unique Fe site. In its reduced state ([4Fe\u20134S]1+), the RS cluster catalyzes the reductive cleavage of SAM to generate a 5\u2019-deoxyadenosyl 5\u2019-radical (5\u2019\u2013dA\u2022) that abstracts a hydrogen radical (H\u2022) from the C2 position of the substrate adenosine. A second, \u201cauxiliary\u201d [4Fe\u20134S] cluster (AC) in the UPF0004 domain of MiaB, shared among MTTases, also bears a unique Fe site similar to the RS cluster. As an MTTase, MiaB utilizes SAM as both a methyl donor, as well as a precursor to the 5\u2019\u2013dA\u2022 species. The methyl group in the methylthiol (\u2013SCH3) modification is known to derive from SAM, a common methylating agent in the cell, and the sulfur is expected to originate from the AC in MiaB itself, and therefore be sacrificial in nature.\n\nThe methylation of MiaB in the presence of SAM, a common methyl donor within the cell, was first detected by to the formation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the product of methyl transfer. The formation of SAH, and methylation of MiaB by SAM, was determined to be independent of i6A tRNA substrate binding as well as reduction of the RS cluster to the [4Fe\u2013 4S]1+ state by artificial chemical reductants such as sodium dithionite. MiaB methylation was observed using radioisotope labeling assays with [methyl-14C]SAM, which indicated the stoichiometric methylation of MiaB after gel filtration chromatography to separate protein from small molecules. Upon acid or base treatment of the methylated MiaB, the radioactivity was lost from the protein fraction and generated CH3SH gas. Time-dependent methylation of MiaB, acid quenched at specific times indicated the simultaneous formation of CH3SH and SAH, detected by GC-MS and LC/MS, respectively, at similar rates and final concentrations. The formation of CH3SH upon acid quenching MiaB incubated with SAM suggested that the methyl group acceptor from SAM is likely a [4Fe\u20134S] cluster of MiaB itself. Methanethiol was determined to be chemically competent as an intermediate species on the basis of its competitive incorporation into ms2i6A in MiaB assays incubated with CH3SH and reacted in the presence of [methyl- d3]SAM. Assays with MiaB incubated with SAM prior to catalyzing turnover in the presence of [methyl-d3]SAM generated ms2i6A during early time points and at faster rates than [methyl- d3]s2i6A, which contains a methyl group originating from the deuterated SAM. The concentration and rate of ms2i6A formation was coupled with that of 5\u2019\u2013dA-H, indicating the methylated MiaB intermediate was kinetically competent. The initial formation of ms2i6A prior to [methyl-d3]s2i6A suggested a single site for methyl transfer, and sequential methylation events. Based on the stoichiometry and final concentrations of natural abundance and deuterated products, a polysulfide species that is exogenously bound to the unique Fe site of the AC was proposed to be the methyl group acceptor from SAM.\n\nMethylthiolation by MiaB involves the cleavage of an unactivated C\u2013H bond at the sp2- hybridized C2 center of the i6A substrate. The carbon site undergoing methylthiolation possesses a homolytic bond dissociation energy (HBDE) significantly higher than those of other bonds cleaved by the 5\u2019\u2013dA\u2022 radical. The investigation of whether the C2 site undergoes a hybridization change to sp3, or if a mechanism not involving direct abstraction of H\u2022 is operant, was pursued. MiaB assays conducted with [C2-d]i6A tRNA substrate demonstrated the stoichiometric formation of ms2i6A and deuterated 5\u2019\u2013dA (5\u2019-dA-d) whereas assays using natural abundance i6A tRNA conducted in deuterium oxide (D2O) yielded ms2i6A coupled to 5\u2019\u2013dA formation. The formation of natural abundance 5\u2019\u2013dA and ms2i6A in experiments conducted in D2O indicates the H\u2022 abstracted by 5\u2019\u2013dA\u2022 originates from a non-solvent exchangeable position on the substrate, rather than a solvent-exchangeable heteroatom position. The C2 H\u2022 is therefore directly abstracted by 5\u2019\u2013dA\u2022 itself. A deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 1.84 was observed between 5\u2019\u2013 dA-H and 5\u2019-dA-d formation, indicating that H\u2022 abstraction in this position is at least partly rate limiting. Assays to trap substrate intermediates involved in nucleophilic addition to C2 utilized halogenated adenosine substrate analogs (2-Cl, 2-F)N6-isopentenyladenosine but failed to yield ms2i6A and 5\u2019\u2013dA. Additionally, attempts at observing radical substrate intermediate species by rapid freeze quench EPR also did not reveal any pertinent paramagnetic species.\n\nIn addition to the origin of the methyl and sulfur moieties of methanethiol and the mechanistic details involved in its attachment to substrate, the in vivo reducing system that acts upon MiaB from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (Tm) was investigated. Five ferredoxin genes (TM0927, TM1175, TM1289, TM1533 and TM1815) and the ferredoxin reductase (TM1639) from Tm were identified through sequence conservation and annotation, and were PCR amplified, ligated into an expression vector, overproduced and the resulting protein purified. The redox potential analysis of the ferredoxin Fe/S clusters, combined with sequence analysis, homology modeling and continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) analysis were consistent with the presence of paramagnetic half-integer spin (S = 1\u20442) ground states of a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster(s) upon dithionite reduction. Coupled activity assays with MiaB, TM1639 and the present ferredoxins support MiaB catalysis, and displayed decreased abortive cleavage of SAM to 5\u2019\u2013dA\u2022, demonstrating improved coupling with the native reducing system.\n\nProtein Film Voltammetry (PFV), Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy and crystallography were utilized to characterize a [3Fe\u20134S] cluster species formed upon methylation of MiaB from the human gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt). PFV was utilized to determine that the redox potentials of the Bt MiaB clusters are centered at -425 mV with protein at rest, but one cluster undergoes a dramatic shift to -650 mV after incubation with SAM for 20 min. The formation of the low potential cluster could not be recapitulated with methanethiol, i6A tRNA substrate nor SAH. The assignment of the AC undergoing the negative potential shift conversion was consistent with EPR analysis indicating decreased signal amplitude for the paramagnetic S = 1\u20442 ground state signal of the cluster. The conversion of the AC from a cubane [4Fe\u20134S] species into a [3Fe\u20134S] form was identified in a preliminary crystal structure of Tm MiaB in complex with i6A tRNA and SAM. The ejected Fe ion was visible the structure and coordinated by conserved Asp and His residues among MTTases that catalyze methylthiolation of sp2 carbons (MiaB, MtaB). The [3Fe\u20134S] cluster species was confirmed by M\u00f6ssbauer analysis indicating a field-strength dependent signal for a high\u2013spin Fe3+ and a partially valence delocalized Fe2.5+ pair (37 % total Fe, ~1 cluster per MiaB) and the N/O coordinated high spin Fe2+ signal (12 % total Fe). Quantitation of the [3Fe\u20134S] cluster indicated a nearly complete conversion of the AC. The lack of significant paramagnetic S = 1\u20442 ground state [3Fe\u20134S]1+ signal assigns the cluster in the 0 oxidation state. Due to the similarities between the 3Fe4S cluster in MiaB with that observed in LipA, a reinvestigation of MiaB mechanism is necessary, in light of the potential mechanistic relevance of the cluster species.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14457], "author_name_tesi": "Arcinas, Arthur ", "last_name_ssi": "Arcinas", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Arthur", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Squire J.

If these theories are correct, it is difficult to explain why wars involving democracies occur at all as well as why democracies sometimes find themselves fighting prolonged, politically divisive wars. To explain these puzzles, I argue that we need to move past static conceptions of accountability (which is assumed to be constant within and across democracies) and resolve (which is often seen simply as the willingness to fight or not). I develop two game-theoretic models illustrating how domestic political processes within the state (such as party competition, the popularity of the leader, and the electoral cycle) can produce variation in the degree to which leaders expect to be held accountable for foreign policy outcomes, and the implications such variation has for the level of resolve the leader will exhibit in international crises.  I derive several novel predictions regarding the duration of interstate conflict, the timing of low-level disputes, the outcomes of conflicts, and the domestic political consequences of international outcomes. Statistical analyses provide at least qualified support for nearly all of the theoretical expectations. Several illustrative cases for each theoretical model are discussed.

Unique difficulties are presented in optimizing for short-duration dynamic loading, viz. transient dynamic response, monitoring of maximum plastic strain failure at every point in the panel over time, optimizers that can handle non-differentiable, non-convex and computationally expensive functions, and mesh distortion. The goal is to minimize the dynamic displacement of the plate relative to the test fixture, while monitoring plastic strain values, mass, and envelope constraints.  An approach based on coupling LS-DYNA finite element software and a differential evolution (DE) optimizer is presented. Since DE involves a population of designs which are then mutated and crossed-over to yield an improved generation, it is possible to use coarse parallelization wherein a computing cluster is used to evaluate fitness of the entire population simultaneously. However, owing to highly dissimilar computing time per analysis, owing to mesh distortion and variable time step in explicit finite element analysis, implementation of the parallelization scheme is challenging. Sinusoidal basis shapes are used to obtain an optimized \u2018double-bulge\u2019 shape for a centrally located charge.

This project, however, explores religious and secular concepts of America by examining how twentieth-century works employ imagery, structures, and themes that can be read as typological. The works analyzed in this study have been selected based on their contributions to the larger conversation about the typologically derived concept of the Americas as a providential New World. Many of the works foreground typological representations of a new covenant between God and America; some employ types in hybridized forms that can be read through the lens of typology as tools to resist oppression. \n\nThis study examines the use of typology and hybridized types in utopian and dystopian representations of American Edens, Afro-Caribbean messianic figures, Native American counternarratives, and engagements with the concept of the posthuman.

Consequently, incidence of injury varies among different sports in which women engage; specifically, women\u2019s ice hockey players display a markedly lower rate compared with lacrosse, and field hockey.  While the inherent dynamics of individual sports influence incidence, modifiable factors may also contribute to these disparate ACL injury rates, and represent variables that clinicians could address to reduce risk.  Core strength, and endurance are such variables proposed to be related to ACL injury risk, and intervention programs targeted at improving these measures are suggested to curb incidence.  During dynamic movement tasks in sports, such as landing, lesser measures of core performance may cause the center of mass to shift in a manner that heightens knee valgus angle, which may load the ACL, and result in injury.  Landing represents a common non-contact mechanism of ACL injury, and biomechanical approach to studying body segment responses to knee joint loading; thus, the aim of this study was to compare core performance, and kinematic landing profiles among Division-I collegiate female student-athletes participating in ice hockey, lacrosse, and field hockey.  We hypothesized that ice hockey players would demonstrate greater core performance measures as well as lesser lateral trunk lean, and knee valgus angles upon landing compared with lacrosse, and field hockey.  The outcomes of this study demonstrate that ice hockey players demonstrate greater core performance measures, which may influence body segment kinematics associated with knee loading mechanisms that result in ACL injury.  Practitioners that operate in competitive athletics may use these data to identify modifiable factors, like core performance, in an effort to potentially improve body segment responses to destabilizing loads imparted to the knee joint for diminishing ACL injury risk in collegiate women\u2019s sports.

I argue that the primary ethical concern in the work (exhibited most fully at 6.3751-6.3752) is with our tendency to reduce to humans to \u201cwhat can be said,\u201d i.e., to the facts that science makes available to us. In doing this, we run the risk of ignoring the transcendent and transient dimensions of human existence, i.e., that that can only be shown and the fact that things can be other than what we anticipate. Given Wittgenstein\u2019s concern with this risk, I argue that the ethical purpose of the work is to help us to attend to what can be gathered from looking closely at the world as it is, since doing so will (he believes) lead us to recognize the marks of transcendence and transience that make us human. In developing this argument, I reject two current strains of interpretation. First, I reject the \u201cineffabilist\u201d reading of the Tractatus, according to which its ethical purpose requires that we posit both ethical value and the will as metaphysical, nonnatural entities. Second, I reject the \u201cresolute\u201d reading of the Tractatus, according to which all talk of ethics is pure nonsense. Finally, I reject the implication (found in both readings) that Wittgenstein endorsed a form of moral quietism that would have us acquiesce to the world as it is and maintain literal silence on ethical matters. Instead, I argue that Wittgenstein offers us a project of committed, intentional, discursive engagement with ourselves and others in order to make the world better than it is. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [596], "author_name_tesi": "Armstrong, Brian Arthur", "last_name_ssi": "Armstrong", "middle_name_ssi": "Arthur", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dale Jacquette", "Vincent M Colapietro", "Emily Rolfe Grosholz", "Denise Haunani Solomon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dale Jacquette, Committee Chair", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Member", "Emily Rolfe Grosholz, Committee Member", "Denise Haunani Solomon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tractatus", "Wittgenstein", "ethics"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "PREDICTORS OF INTERNAL STATE TALK AMONG PARENTS OF TODDLERS\n", "id": "8331", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3922", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Internal state language (ISL) appears to be an important component of developing socio-emotional competence (Dunn, Brown, & Beardsall, 1991; Saarni, 1999).

Recent innovations in wearable technology have allowed researchers to track specific recovery metrics such as sleep and heart rate variability. This study utilized the WHOOP Performance Optimization System to measure sleep and heart rate variables in a group of 11 NCAA Division 1 swimmers (Males= 8, Females= 3) for the duration of their season. Data related to covariables including training load and body composition were also recorded. Outcomes of interest were injuries, illnesses, and missed participation days.

The first committed step in the metabolism of MI occurs predominantly in the kidney and involves the oxidative cleavage of the ring to give D-glucuronic acid (Howard and Anderson, 1967;Charalampous and Lyras, 1957).  This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme myo-inositol oxygenase (EC 1.13.99.1, MIOX).  In order to generate sufficient pure enzyme for mechanistic study, as well as to clarify the discrepancies of past research, a porcine MIOX clone was generated and expressed in a bacterial system.  A full-length cDNA was isolated from a porcine kidney library with an open reading frame of 849 bp and a corresponding protein subunit molecular mass of 32.7 kDa. The cDNA was expressed in a bacterial pET expression system and an active recombinant MIOX was purified from bacterial lysates to electrophoretic homogeneity. The purified enzyme displayed the same catalytic properties as the native enzyme with Km and kcat values of 5.9 mM and 11 min-1, respectively.  The pI value was estimated to be 4.5. Preincubation with 1 mM Fe2+ and 2 mM cysteine was essential for the enzyme activity. D-chiro-inositol, a myo-inositol isomer, is a substrate for the rMIOX with an estimated Km of 33.5 mM.  Both myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes.\nPreviously the native MIOX enzyme was reported to be likely found in a complex with the enzyme responsible for the second step of MI catabolism, i.e. glucuronate reductase (Reddy et al., 1981a), which is also known as aldehyde reductase or ALR1 (EC 1.1.1.2) (De Jongh et al., 1987).  The MIOX:ALR1 complex was partially purified and the activity examined.  MIOX activity was present without reactivation with Fe/Cys, as is required with pure MIOX.  When inositol is supplied to the complex as substrate, activity can be detected by the consumption of NADPH by the reductase.  Adding similar concentrations of free glucuronate as that produced by the MIOX activity resulted in no detectable activity, indicating the ALR1 was trapping acyclic glucuronate from MIOX.  However, no activity was detected with inositol as substrate when the aldose reductase inhibitor Sorbinil was added at 10\u00b5M.  The same concentration inhibited pure ALR1 by 90% when glucuronate was the substrate.  No inhibition of recombinant MIOX by Sorbinil was observed.  These results suggest the possibility that aldose reductase inhibitor treatment for diabetes complications may have an impact on the inositol catabolic pathway.\n\tIn order to study the physiological relevance of the MIOX:ALR1 complex, the expression pattern of MIOX must be established.  The expression pattern of MIOX in hog tissues was examined by Western blot, Northern blot, and RT-PCR methods.  The predominant source of protein and mRNA was found in kidney.  In situ hybridization further localized the MIOX to the kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells.  However, protein was also detected by Western blot in retina tissue.  To examine the lens, a human lens epithelial cell model, HLE-B3, was employed for protein and mRNA detection.  Both MIOX protein and mRNA were detected in these cells.  In human and mouse, in situ hybridization detected MIOX in the kidney.  Sections of other human organs failed to detect MIOX.  LLC-PK1 were tested as a model for the study of MIOX expression in kidney.  These cells expressed low levels of MIOX compared to kidney tissue, and the MIOX was unresponsive to inducers and hyperglycemia.  It was concluded that an animal model would be necessary for future studies of MIOX in vivo.\n\tIn conclusion, this work represents a foundation for the future study of MIOX and its physiological relevance.

My project challenges prevailing notions of the function of Troy as England\u2019s foundational myth in both the political and literary cultures of the medieval and early modern periods.  In the Middle Ages the English claimed to be descended from the Trojans who had survived the war and participated in the founding of Rome alongside Aeneas.  Many modern critics argue that the conflation of the historical and the literary in this myth of national origin worked to forward the imperial agendas of English monarchs, and that these agendas found support in the medieval retellings of the Trojan War narrative.  I argue that the political formulation of England\u2019s national identity puts certain pressures how a writer can express his own authorial identity and that one form of identity constantly threatens to undermine the other.  My work locates authorial politics \u2013 that is, authorial self-definition in response to both literary tradition and issues in English court culture \u2013 within the Trojan narratives of Chaucer, Lydgate, Caxton, and Shakespeare.  This approach demonstrates how authorial identity is expressed textually through the negotiation of genre and competing narrative forms with respect to cultural context. \nFor medieval and early modern English authors, the truth of the story is merely a surface concern as the author seeks to lay claim not to the Trojan legend but simply the right to tell it.  Whereas the Arthurian legend seems to be available to writers who wish to invent new episodes or reformulate established narratives, the Troy story necessitates that an author justify his literary project by showing appropriate deference to the other poetic texts in the Trojan tradition.  In so doing, the writer claims a right to author his own account of the legend.  No other story in English literature requires such a claim, and it is for this reason that the Trojan War narrative functions as an important site for investigating English authorship.  \nThe dissertation\u2019s title, Trojan Wars, is meant to remind the reader of the multitude of competing narratives that constitute the legend of the destruction of Troy.  At the center of the legend lies neither a war nor a city but a conspicuous absence, and it is around this absence that Trojan Wars have been fought by poets and historians trying to claim authority over a disputed territory that was never really there in the first place.  The medieval Troy story conflates the historical and the literary, and recent scholarship on Trojan texts tends to privilege the former over the latter.  My dissertation will use the important observations made by recent critics concerning the historiographic importance of Troy in order to highlight its significance in the formation of an English literary tradition as defined by the idea of authorship and negotiated through genre.  My thesis that is each author\u2019s appropriation and idiosyncratic fashioning of various genres, particularly epic, romance and history, allows him to claim authority over the Trojan legend that he chooses to tell while simultaneously critiquing any royal or imperial agenda that seeks to do the same.  The specific choices in genre, I argue, are inherently intertextual and entirely self-conscious, as each Trojan text functions as a response to the other works in circulation as well as the political concerns of the nation during the time of its writing.  Through this approach, I identify the emergence of an English authorial identity that begins with Chaucer and trace its development through the Middle Ages and Renaissance in order to demonstrate how literary authority functions in relation to political authority.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6145], "author_name_tesi": "Arner, Timothy D.", "last_name_ssi": "Arner", "middle_name_ssi": "D.", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert R Edwards", "Patrick G Cheney", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt", "Sherry Lynnette Roush"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert R Edwards, Committee Chair", "Patrick G Cheney, Committee Member", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt, Committee Member", "Sherry Lynnette Roush, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Trojan War", "Chaucer", "Lydgate", "Caxton", "Shakespeare", "Troilus", "epic", "medieval romance", "medieval English literature"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "FORCE CHARACTERIZATION OF MICRO GRINDING IN ZIRCONIA", "id": "14017hxa5143", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14017", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An ultra-precision lathe is used to carry out micro surface grinding experiments in zirconia.

Disruptions in feeding are associated with a number of negative behavioral and developmental outcomes in children, and may to lead to disruptive mealtime behavior, picky eating, less-than-optimal growth, and obesity.  The Satter Feeding Dynamics Model (fdSatter) has been proposed to guide parents and professionals in optimizing the feeding relationship between parent and child.  fdSatter is an authoritative model that proposes that parents guide the feeding process based on cues coming from the child, and as a result, the child will be competent with eating attitudes, food regulation and growth, food acceptance, and mealtime behavior.  Maintaining a division of responsibility in feeding and trusting a child to grow and eat as intended is suggested to be an effective means of reducing child feeding problems. To evaluate and develop effective interventions, a tool that can capture the division of responsibility and can identify positive and negative feeding behaviors is needed.  Among existing tools assessing child feeding, few are validated, and few assess the dynamics between the parent and child in the feeding relationship.  To address this need, a prototype instrument was offered by Satter that addressed parent\u2019s leadership and autonomy roles incumbent in adhering to the division of feeding responsibility as defined by fdSatter; this measure is the Satter Feeding Dynamics Inventory (fdSI).     \n This project summarizes the iterative process of developing and testing the fdSI.  Included in this summary are details and findings from 4 early phases and a fifth phase resulting in a version ready for construct validation and intensive psychometric analyses.  The fifth phase was accomplished with cognitive interviews of 9 low-income and 5 middle-income parents of preschool aged children to assess comprehension of survey items using response mapping and thematic analysis.  Findings revealed low respondent burden of the fdSI and led to revisions of 2 items and the elimination of one item.  Eating competence (EC) was examined as a moderator of adherence to fdSatter by comparing fdSI scores to those on the Satter Eating Competence Inventory for Low-Income.  Despite the small sample size of the fifth phase of testing, trends were apparent that supported EC as a moderating influence.  Eating competent parents were more likely to perceive their child\u2019s eating positively, compared to non-eating competent parents.   \n Outcomes from the iterative fdSI testing plan supported cognitive testing as an essential step in readying an instrument for the validation and psychometric studies necessary to support its use in intervention assessment.  Multi-phase and constant comparative testing have resulted in an instrument ready for validation as a measure of adherence to the division of feeding responsibilities as defined by fdSatter.  Subsequent availability of this valid measure is essential for study of interventions that seek to improve the parent-child feeding relationship, especially those with the goal of understanding the role of parenting in child obesity prevention.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7258], "author_name_tesi": "Arnold, Kristen Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Arnold", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Kristen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Ann Lohse", "Lori Anne Francis", "Jill Patterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Ann Lohse, Thesis Advisor", "Lori Anne Francis, Thesis Advisor", "Jill Patterson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Child obesity", "child feeding", "feeding problems"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "REGIONAL DEPOSITIONAL TRENDS IN THE DEVONIAN GENESEO/BURKET BLACK SHALE BASED ON GAMMA RAY-DENSITY TRENDS\n\n", "id": "10978", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3694", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nGas shales are becoming increasingly important as new technologies are applied to enhance their production of natural gas. The Barnett, the Fayetteville, and the Haynesville have all been successful gas shale plays in North America. In addition, the Marcellus has recently stimulated a boom in Pennsylvania shale-gas production. The Geneseo-Burket is a Middle Devonian black shale of the Genesee Group that overlies the Tully Limestone and Hamilton Group, which includes the Marcellus Black shale. It is currently unclear whether it is prospective as a gas shale or not. This study seeks to examine the commercial value of the Geneseo-Burket Shale through the characterization of the relationship between density and organic matter. This relationship, in conjunction with thickness trends in a sequence stratigraphic framework, can be used as an exploratory tool for gas shale reservoirs in the Appalachian Basin. \n\nThis study uses 280 well logs used to conduct a petrophysical evaluation of the Geneseo-Burket Shale in Pennsylvania and New York. Gamma ray and bulk density well logs, supplemented by well cuttings, are used to derive isopach/structure maps, density-gamma ray trends and the spatial distribution of organic matter. The relationships among these characteristics and the mechanisms that produce their regional patterns are also explored. Distinctive density patterns can be observed in well logs of the Geneseo-Burket throughout the basin. Density vs depth trends illustrate considerable deviation from normal shale sections. Observed lower densities in the Geneseo-Burket are a likely indicator of increased organic matter. Density data are compared with gamma ray logs to quantify the relationship between density and organic content. They are correlated with a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (R2) equal to 0.65. Organic matter percentages in the Geneseo-Burket are calculated and range from 2-18 percent by volume. An empirical relationship is developed to convert organic matter in volume percentages to total organic carbon in weight percent. The spatial distribution of organic matter is mapped and increasing concentrations in western Pennsylvania suggest a decrease in clastic dilution. Also, the variation in formation thicknesses is illustrated by construction of an isopach map. The Geneso-Burket extends throughout the northern Appalachian Basin and thicknesses exceed 150 feet in eastern Pennsylvania.  \n\nThe internal stratigraphy of the Geneseo-Burket is defined in terms of its well log (density, gamma ray) character. Locally, the interval is characterized by at least 4 gamma ray maxima and density minima that correlate. These patterns are repeatable throughout northern Pennsylvania and west-central Pennsylvania and ultimately demonstrate the extent and structure of the basin. Regional variations in the interval of the Geneseo-Burket are identified, defined and summarized into a depositional sequence, using a sequence stratigraphic framework. Finally, the distribution of systems tracts in the Genseo-Burket, Lodi limestone and Penn Yan Members of the Genesee Group suggest that these units are analogous to the Union Springs, Cherry Valley, and Oatka Creek members of the Marcellus Formation in Hamilton Group.   \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3674], "author_name_tesi": "Arnold, LaMichelle Andrea", "last_name_ssi": "Arnold", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrea", "first_name_ssi": "LaMichelle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Terry Engelder", "Terry Engelder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Terry Engelder, Thesis Advisor", "Terry Engelder, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["organic matter", "black shale", "Geneseo", "Burket", "gamma ray", "bulk density", "thickness"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A Traffic Engineering Attribute for BGP\n\n", "id": "8223", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6307", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the Internet, ``traffic engineering' seeks to satisfy a packet\nstream's, or flow's, quality of service requirements while\nsimultaneously leveraging existing resources to distribute a network's\ntraffic load across all available paths, in order to provide congestion\ncontrol.

In addition to telecommunications, fiber optics play important roles in fields such as optical sensing, medical surgery, and manufacturing. Despite this success, there are limits to the amorphous glass fiber optic technology in use today. Specifically, when compared to crystalline materials, glasses exhibit higher fundamental loss limits and lower damage thresholds. Additionally, the lanthanide doped glass fiber lasers that have seen great commercial success to date are not continuously tunable over large wavelength ranges, limiting their applicability. \nHowever, despite the potential benefits of crystalline fiber optics and fiber lasers, their synthesis has proven challenging, due to their general incompatibility with traditional fiber optic fabrication methods, limiting the advancement of this promising field. This dissertation presents novel chemical, analytical and materials processing methodologies to create crystalline fiber optics and fiber lasers. Specifically, both ZnSe waveguides and the world\u2019s first continuous wave Cr:ZnSe fiber lasers are presented. \nIntrinsic and doped crystalline ZnSe fiber optics with centimeter lengths and axial dimensions of microns have been created using high pressure chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD), in which MPa pressure gradients drive gas-phase precursors into ultra-high aspect ratio templates, such as silica microcapillaries. In order to decrease the optical loss in these structures due to impurities, gas-phase mass spectroscopy of precursor mixtures and ultra-high vacuum precursor preparation have been integrated into the HPCVD methodology. To decrease loss owing to the scattering of light from grain boundaries, microscale chemical vapor transport and in-fiber laser annealing have been developed. These techniques have been shown to impart improvements in material crystallinity as measured by Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction, while decreasing thermal requirements by hundreds of degrees. Additionally, by establishing an analytical feedback loop using photoluminescence and micro-FTIR spectroscopies to inform modifications to microbubbler technology, dopant concentration in fabricated Cr:ZnSe structures has been increased, increasing optical gain. In addition, the optical losses stemming from several mechanisms in the fiber optics have been improved. Together, this has led to the Cr:ZnSe fibers displaying continuous wave laser emission from an end-pumped geometry, an important indicator of practical applicability.

The realization of devices using ultra-thin film semiconductor specimens entails a thorough understanding of surface properties, it\u2019s response to various physical and chemical treatments, behavior of electrical defects present at the surface, near-surface carrier profiles, mobilities and potential distributions. These parameters have been effectively measured for bulk semiconductors using well-established commercial tools, and fairly reproducible results have been produced and published. However, the final device performance will depend on and be reflected by surface dominated phenomena because only the near-surface region is contributing towards the \u2018active\u2019 layer in the device operation, and most of the tools fail to characterize this region. Therefore, a fast, reliable and non-destructive in-situ characterization technique is required to monitor and quantify the quality of the surface and sub-surface regions in thin-film structures. Near-surface photo-conductance decay tool utilized in this work makes an attempt in this regard by measuring the near surface minority carrier decay lifetime after the cessation of an external excitation provided in the form of a laser pulse. \n\nPrevious works done using this tool demonstrate its sensitivity to surface treatments and the ability of the tool to capture changes in the semiconductor surfaces, interfaces, and three-dimensional structures. This work particularly focusses on exploring the capability of the tool to respond to different excitation wavelengths and intensities. Bulk silicon and germanium samples have been used to demonstrate this experiment by measuring the \u2018effective\u2019 minority carrier lifetime. An attempt is made to distinguish the surface lifetime from its bulk counterpart, depending on the difference in the nature of defects, thus leading to \u2018defect specific photo-conductance\u2019. Theoretical background of this concept has been summarized and verified by experimental data on electronic grade bulk n-type and p-type silicon under different surface conditions. Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technology is a keystone in the development of thin-film nano-scale devices. This work presents the characterization of SOI samples with top layer thicknesses in the same range, but manufactured using different fabrication techniques. Because of the inherent physical separation of the \u2018active\u2019 layer from the bulk through a dielectric, the lifetimes measured essentially reflect the properties of the active film.

A heat transfer and visco-plastic flow model is used to calculate the torque, and traverse force on the tool during FSW. The computed values of torque and traverse force are validated using the experimental results for FSW of AA7075, AA2524, AA6061 and Ti-6Al-4V alloys. The computed torque components are used to determine the optimum tool shoulder diameter based on the maximum use of torque and maximum grip of the tool on the plasticized workpiece material. The estimation of the optimum tool shoulder diameter for FSW of AA6061 and AA7075 was verified with experimental results. The computed values of traverse force and torque are used to calculate the maximum shear stress on the tool pin to determine the load bearing ability of the tool pin. The load bearing ability calculations are used to explain the failure of H13 steel tool during welding of AA7075 and commercially pure tungsten during welding of L80 steel.\n\tArtificial neural network (ANN) models are developed to predict the important FSW output parameters as function of selected input parameters. These ANN consider tool shoulder radius, pin radius, pin length, welding velocity, tool rotational speed and axial pressure as input parameters. The total torque, sliding torque, sticking torque, peak temperature, traverse force, maximum shear stress and bending stress are considered as the output for ANN models. These output parameters are selected since they define the thermo-mechanical conditions around the tool during FSW.

The material velocity fields are computed by adopting an analytical method of calculating velocities for flow of non-compressible fluid between two discs where one is rotating and other is stationary. The peak temperature is estimated based on a non-dimensional correlation with dimensionless heat input.

Recent advancements in driving simulation technology allow scenario authoring to create dynamic situations, allow multiple simulations to be connected to each other, and provide the ability to connect hardware to simulations to enable hardware-in-the-loop driving evaluations using simulators. Using this modern technology, mixed traffic environments are modeled to enable the assessment of driver behavior in autonomous environments and to understand the need and type of information to be conveyed. The virtual platform is designed to be visually and geometrically realistic using AASHTO highway design guidelines. Traffic simulations are scripted in the scenarios allowing mixed autonomous environment with manual, ACC and CACC vehicles.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12750], "author_name_tesi": "Arora, Prashant ", "last_name_ssi": "Arora", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Prashant", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean N Brennan", "Matthew B Parkinson", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sean N Brennan, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew B Parkinson, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Driving Simulator", "Autonomous Environments", "Scenario Authoring"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Development of an Artificial Neural Network\nfor Cyclic Steam Stimulation Method \nin Naturally Fractured Reservoirs\n\n", "id": "21880", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9852", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, increased demand of energy requires improvement in recovery factor by implementing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method that can be applied efficiently into the naturally fractured reservoirs. Cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) is one of the thermal EOR techniques in which reduction of oil viscosity is achieved by increasing the reservoir temperature. A single well is applied in the CSS process. The well is used for both injection and production, sequentially. The implementation of CSS into the naturally fractured reservoirs can be considered more appropriate because fractures provide a large area in where injected steam diffused. In the petroleum industry, commercial simulators are applied for forecasting of production profile; however, their algorithms are considerably complex and time-consuming. Usage of artificial neural network (ANN) is getting attention in recent years owing to its ability to provide a solution for non-linear relationship. \nIn this study, an elliptical inner zone that is more fractured than corresponding naturally fractured reservoir is designed to increase the performance of CSS process. A variable number of cycles is studied and production period of each cycle is controlled by specified abandonment oil flow rate. The goal of this study is to provide an accurate estimation for the performance of cyclic steam injection process in relatively short period by developing artificial neural network models. Design parameters of both fractured inner zone and cyclic steam injection are used as variables of ANN models, besides reservoir properties. Production profiles of the first ten cycles of each case are evaluated during the network training. Six ANN models are developed and a total of 555 case samples are generated in order to train the networks. Two of them are assigned to forward-looking problem. Forward ANN-1 is designed as a predictor of oil flow rate and number of cycle whereas Forward-ANN-2 is constructed as a predictor of cumulative oil production of project, cumulative oil production and cycle duration of each cycle. Two of the six ANN models are generated for estimation of design parameters by using performance indicators and properties of corresponding reservoir. Inverse ANN-1A is able to predict fractured inner zone and cyclic steam injection design parameters at the same time. Inverse ANN-1B is developed to improve the capability of design parameters prediction by focusing on only cyclic steam injection design. The last two networks are assigned to prediction of reservoir properties by applying desired production profile and design parameters. Inverse ANN-2A is created for estimation of reservoir properties after fractured inner zone was created, in case performance indicators and CSI design parameters are provided. Inverse ANN-2B is trained as a predictor of only fractured inner zone properties. Significant improvement is observed in terms of accuracy by developing Inverse ANN-1B and Inverse ANN-2B additionally. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9587], "author_name_tesi": "Arpaci, Buket ", "last_name_ssi": "Arpaci", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Buket", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Artificial neural network", "cyclic steam injection", "heavy oil", "naturally fractured reservoirs"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Crustal structure of the mid-atlantic U.s. from P-wave receiver functions", "id": "26702", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11853", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Crustal structure across the Mid-Atlantic portion of the U.S. has been investigated by modeling\nreceiver functions.

Though the literature on teacher mentoring suggests that mentors and mentees should engage in collaborative mentoring sessions, few studies have looked at what actually happens or what is actually learned as a result of mentoring (Harvey, 2011). For the purposes of my study, I created mentoring protocols based on what the mentoring literature (Easton, 2008; Jonson, 2008) suggests mentors and pre-service teachers should do. Then, I implemented the protocols with three mentor\u2013mentee (mentor\u2013pre-service teacher) pairs during a 15-week MA TESOL practicum. Based on my observations, I examined the quality and character of the interactions between the members of each pair and considered the impact of the mentoring on the pre-service teachers\u2019 teaching. \nThe data were analyzed from a sociocultural theory perspective on teacher learning (Johnson, 2009) in order to capture the dynamic nature of the dialogic mediation created by engagement in the collaborative mentoring sessions and to trace the extent to which such meditational means were taken up and internalized by pre-service teachers as they engaged in their initial teaching experience. The results indicate that the mentoring sessions served as mediational spaces wherein the pre-service teachers expressed their ideas and feelings in relation to the classes they taught. The results also indicate that the mentoring protocols helped guide the participants\u2019 interactions during the mentoring sessions. In addition, the analysis of the mentor\u2013pre-service teachers\u2019 interactions during the mentoring sessions shows that the mentors adapted the mentoring protocols provided in order to better meet the pre-service teachers\u2019 developmental level. The mentors were also found to provide the pre-service teachers with significant emotional support, apparently recognizing the challenges that the latter faced in the classroom. Lastly, the study shows that the pre-service teachers learned from conversing with their mentors and applied what they learned (emerging conceptions of teaching) to their own teaching. In one of the pairs, reciprocal mentoring (Wink & Putney, 2002) took place whereby the pre-service teacher, a more capable other (Lantolf & Thorne, 2006), guided the mentor in regard to creating an instructional tool for teaching English grammar. \nThe study demonstrates the importance of providing mentoring experiences that create spaces in which pre-service teachers can externalize their thoughts and feelings about their teaching. In addition, it highlights the significance of the emotional and professional support provided by mentors and the critical role that extended mentoring experiences can have on the development of pre-service teachers\u2019 teaching expertise.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8996], "author_name_tesi": "Arshavskaya, Ekaterina ", "last_name_ssi": "Arshavskaya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ekaterina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen E Johnson", "James Lantolf", "Celeste S Kinginger", "James F Nolan Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen E Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "James Lantolf, Committee Member", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member", "James F Nolan Jr., Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pre-service teacher mentoring", "ESL", "a sociocultural theory perspective", "MA TESOL practicum", "teaching expertise"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "DETECTION AND ESTIMATION OF RAINFALL THROUGH DATA ANALYSIS OF GEOSTATIONARY Ku-BAND SATELLITE SIGNALS", "id": "13892cha5024", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13892", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A Ku-band receiver system is con\ufb01gured in State College, Pennsylvania to evaluate the potential of a rainfall estimation technique using satellite-link wave attenuation measurements.

The method can be used for a precipitation  measurement technique as an alternative or complementary to existing methods such as rain gauge and radar in complex environments, such as over hilly terrains and urban areas as well as parts of the oceans  that lie within the footprint of the satellite. Power law relationships between speci\ufb01c attenuation A (dB/km) and rainfall intensity R (mm/h) are used to estimate R and the rainfall accumulation along the link path. Polarimetric radar measurements obtained from the National Weather Service WSR-88D system located 18.5 km away from the receiver ground station are utilized to provide a comparison of rainfall accumulation estimates. Two tipping-bucket rain gauges, co-located with the satellite receiver, are also used for comparison. The e\ufb00ective rain height (ERH) used in converting total attenuation along the link path to attenuation rate is estimated from polarimetric radar observations. A method based on bit error ratio (BER) measurements for the commercial satellite link is used to identify periods of rain during which rainfall rate is estimated from signal attenuation measurements. Logistic regression analysis that is based on WSR-88D measurements and statistics of BER data during the years 2013 and 2014 is used to develop a rain detection algorithm. The rain detection algorithm is applied and rainfall estimates are presented for the selected days during the years 2015 and 2016. Satellite-based precipitation estimates show good comparisons with radar-based estimates (within 19%) for accumulations greater than 6 mm and not so good (within 43%) for accumulations below 3 mm as Ku-band link becomes less sensitive to light rain events, i.e. R < 1.5 mm/h.

This search becomes even more challenging when demand uncertainty and fluctuations are considered. In order to achieve better profitability, many researchers and practitioners have attempted to search for improvements in the shop floor. However, within the last two decades, it has been determined that the design of the product family also provides opportunities for improvements.  Designing the product family that will respond to the requirements of the customer demand is essential for the survival of companies in today\u2019s competitive markets.  When meeting customer requirements, companies also need to take cost initiatives into account.  Overall, while many approaches have been proposed to optimize product family design for measures of cost and performance, many of these approaches fail to incorporate the complexity of the manufacturing issues into family design decision-making.  The assembly scheduling strategies can be considered as one of the most important of those manufacturing issues.\nThis research presents a computer simulation study by which the impact of assembly scheduling on the product family design outcomes is investigated.  Overall, the research builds upon the foundation provided by Kariyakar (2000), which established computer simulation as a way to investigate product family design decisions; and it extends the studies of Su et al. (2005) wherein cost and expected customer waiting time were estimated using stochastics calculations.  Simulation was used because it can provide a realistic model that is sensitive to the demand randomness and process variations.  Using the results of the simulation study, analysis of different assembly scheduling and product family design strategies can be compared for performance and profitability.  It is expected that when product family design decisions are made with the consideration of assembly scheduling strategies, the outcomes at the shop floor level improve.  The verification of this expectation is investigated.  The results have implications for companies that seek to increase their revenue without extensively increasing their investment in the shop floor.    \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2244], "author_name_tesi": "Artar, Hakan Umut", "last_name_ssi": "Artar", "middle_name_ssi": "Umut", "first_name_ssi": "Hakan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gul Kremer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gul Kremer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["assembly scheduling", "product family design"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Influence Of Headspace Gas Mixture And Oxygen Scavengers On Master Packed Ground Beef Storage And Display Stability", "id": "24985", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10967", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Studies were performed to evaluate the influence of oxygen scavengers and different headspace atmospheres on master packed ground beef storage and display stability, as well as their effect on package characteristics.

Second we try to explore if there is predictive potential of linear principal components in the case of non linear regression functions and especially in the context of sufficient dimension reduction.  Third we propose an information criterion that in very limited number of cases can be used to check the predictive potential of linear principal components.

The most general form of our result,\nshows that the phenomenon goes far beyond the context of linear regression and classical principal components\nwhere it was originally noticed: if nature selects an arbitrary distribution for\nthe predictor X and an arbitrary  conditional distribution of the response\n$Y$ given X, then Y tends to have stronger correlation with higher-ranking\nkernel principal components than with lower-ranking kernel principal components.

This method is known to have several advantages, in comparison, to previous inverse regression methods like SIR, SAVE and DR.  First, since machine learning methods instead of sample moments are applied in estimating the directions in the Central Dimension Reduction Subspace this method is shown to be robust in the presence of outliers.  Second, through a modification of the objective function that we need to minimize, we can show that dimension reduction without matrix inversion can be achieved.  Third, through simulations our method is shown to be robust in departures from ellipticity as well as in the presence of categorical predictors among our predictors.  Finally, this method gives us a way of estimating nonlinear directions in the Central Dimension Reduction Subspace, and direction in the feature space using kernel functions.   The above are shown in theory, through simulations and by application on real data examples; one to build a regression model for the relative performance of computer CPUs, the second for the classification of E.coli proteins on cellular localization sites.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12767], "author_name_tesi": "Artemiou, Andreas A", "last_name_ssi": "Artemiou", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Andreas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bing Li", "Runze Li", "Michael Akritas", "Francesca Chiaromonte", "Adam Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bing Li, Committee Chair", "Runze Li, Committee Member", "Michael Akritas, Committee Member", "Francesca Chiaromonte, Committee Member", "Adam Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Unitary invariance", "Regression", "Kernel principal components", "Sufficient Dimension Reduction", "Support Vector Machines"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Optimized Design of Cyclic Pressure Pulsing in Naturally Fractured Reservoirs Using Neural-Network Based Proxy Models", "id": "8529", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1951", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Stimulation of oil wells with cyclic pressure pulsing using gases is an IOR method that is effectively applicable to fractured reservoirs. Fractures provide a large contact area for the injected gas to diffuse through and penetrate into the low-permeability matrix. Also, high permeability of the fracture system provides easy delivery of the injected gas and produced oil. The process attracts operators because of shorter payback periods and lower investment requirements as compared to field-scale flooding projects. Designing a cyclic pressure pulsing project requires optimization of the design parameters such as the amount of injected gas, injection rate, and lengths of injection, soaking, and production periods. Due to the computational cost of simulating a large number of scenarios, it is an arduous task to determine the aforementioned design parameters, and to optimize the process. \n\nIn this study, neural-network based proxy models are used to assess the feasibility of these processes in reservoirs with different characteristics, and to develop optimized design schemes to maximize the efficiency of the process. The method of approach includes understanding the mechanics of the process via reservoir simulation studies. Artificial neural network (ANN) based proxy models that accurately mimic the reservoir model efficiently in terms of the computational time are developed. First, the methodology is tested with the reservoir model of the Big Andy Field where cyclic CO2 (since 1985) and cyclic N2 (since 1996) injection have been utilized. Developed proxies were able to estimate the expected magnitudes of some of the critical performance indicators for a given set of process design parameters for CO2 and N2 injection. An inverse proxy is developed that goes beyond the capabilities of a reservoir model by providing optimized combination of design parameters for a given set of desired performance characteristics. Then, the methodology is extended to reservoirs with different characteristics by including reservoir properties in the knowledge base. Universal proxies are developed which can accurately output the performance indicators when the reservoir characteristics and design parameters are input. The hybrid neuro-genetic approach is utilized for optimization studies. This approach uses the genetic algorithm (GA) as the optimization tool. GA uses the neural-network based proxy approximator for evaluation of the specified objective function for computational efficiency. By changing the design parameters, it searches for the best design scenario that would maximize/minimize the objective function that is specified based on the nature of the problem. The reservoir model used in this study is a single-well, compositional reservoir model with a dual-porosity system. A detailed parametric study is conducted using the reservoir model to develop a better understanding of how operational parameters and reservoir conditions affect the performance of the process. Peak oil rate, discounted incremental oil production, and net present value (NPV) are used for performance evaluation. It was observed that the injected gas volume in each cycle is the most critical parameter in affecting the performance. Injecting the same volume at a higher rate for a shorter period of time is found to be more effective than injecting for a longer time at a lower rate.

Despite the widespread use of this technique there is still insufficient knowledge about the long-term durability of FRP systems externally bonded to concrete. FRP bonded concrete members can be exposed to various environmental effects during the lifetime of the structures, as this system is applied for both indoor and outdoor members in buildings and bridges. To ensure the safety of these structures during their service life, durability of the FRP material under such weathering conditions and service loading should be understood.\nIn this study, long term durability of Glass and Carbon FRP reinforced, pre-cracked concrete beams without steel reinforcement under sustained loading is investigated. The flexural test results of seventeen beams, which were casted and reinforced with FRP in 2005 are used. Eight of these beams were tested within eight months after the manufacturing date without any weathering or sustained loading exposure by Whitaker (2007). Nine of them were exposed to indoor and outdoor conditions in State College/PA under sustained loading for 72 months, and tested in 2011. During the tests, in addition to deflection and crack opening measurements, 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used to obtain full field strain and slip distributions. The long term performance of the beams is evaluated by comparing the flexural test results of these unconditioned and 72 months conditioned beams. \nExternally bonded FRP sheets and plates introduce failure modes such as debonding and FRP rupture. Therefore, in addition to the ultimate strength, deflections and strain distributions, the failure modes, and interfacial bond strength between the FRP and the concrete are also compared. \nIn this study, it is observed that; direct exposure to outdoor conditioning causes reduction in the ultimate capacity of FRP reinforced concrete beams. Moreover, the first debonding of the conditioned beams occurred with the tensile rupture of the concrete; also, the moment capacity at the initiation of debonding showed an increasing trend with the increase of the tensile strength of the concrete beams. The furthest debonding propagation before the failure is observed for the outdoor conditioned CFRP and GFRP beams, whose FRP reinforced side is directly exposed to outdoor conditioning.\nIn terms of local behavior, fracture toughness is obtained by a fracture mechanics analysis in which a local non-linear shear stress-slip model is assumed and its parameters are obtained by curve-fitting to experimental slip versus position data. According to the analysis results, the lowest fracture energies are observed for the indoor CFRP beam which had the largest sustained moment with 47% of the ultimate, during conditioning. For this beam; increasing local fracture energy further away from the pre-crack and especially from the active region of the FRP during sustained loading, resulted in no reduction of the ultimate moment capacity. Among the beams that have the same level of sustained moment, the beams, FRP reinforced sides of which were directly exposed to outdoor conditioning have the lowest fracture energies. In eight out of nine beams local fracture energy increases further away from the pre-crack, the location, where the affect of conditioning and sustained loading is assumed to be the most severe.  \nAlso, the 2D DIC Method, which is more practical compared to the 3D DIC, is found to be a successful method to obtain full-field strain and slip distributions of the FRP sheets that are externally bonded to concrete members, under flexural loading, unless there is a movement of the FRP strip relative to the concrete.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7813], "author_name_tesi": "Artun, Kivanc ", "last_name_ssi": "Artun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kivanc", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Associate Professor Of Civil Engineering Dr Maria Lopez De Murpy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Associate Professor Of Civil Engineering Dr Maria Lopez De Murpy, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["durability", "FRP", "debonding", "DIC"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Rotation Powered Pulsars in the X-rays", "id": "27406", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11995", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The dissertation focuses on the study of rotation-powered pulsars, the primary observational manifestation of neutron stars. These objects are powerful sources of electromagnetic radiation and relativistic particles whose emission is provided by the loss of pulsar rotational energy. Understanding the evolution of pulsars, which happens over billion year timescales, requires detection and study of pulsars at different stages of evolution. I present detailed X-ray analyses of pulsars at four distinct stages of evolution and compare their emission behavior with that of other pulsars expected to be in similar evolutionary stages. I also show key characteristics of the pulsars that make them unique in their group. I start with a young and energetic pulsar, PSR J2022+3842 (characteristic age approximately 9 kyr, spin-down power = 3E37 erg/s), with powerful non-thermal emission. X-ray timing of the pulsar revealed double-peaked X-ray profile with a period twice the previously established value. Our analysis allowed us to update the pulsar's spin-down power and X-ray efficiency using the correct timing results, which brought the pulsar more in-line with other young X-ray pulsars. I also provide the phase-dependent behavior of the pulsar's non-thermal emission. Pulsars with true ages, often substituted by characteristic age, below ~ 100 kyr are considered young and ones with ages > 1 Myr are considered old, with the \u2018middle-aged' pulsars in the middle. My next pulsar is a 1.8 Myr old J1836+5925 (spin-down power = 1E34 erg/s), which is perhaps the brightest X-ray source among the oldest pulsars still observable in the gamma-rays. Detailed timing and spectral analyses show strong evidence of an absorption feature (perhaps an electron cyclotron line) in the pulsar's spectrum. Characterizing its thermal emission might have important implications for the neutron star cooling models. Moving another two orders of magnitude up in characteristic age, we have one of the oldest known non-recycled X-ray pulsars, PSR J0108-3430, with characteristic age = 166 Myr and spin-down power = 5.8E30 erg/s. The pulsar's spectrum likely consists of a thermal component, emitted from a hot polar cap, and a non-thermal component, emitted from its magnetosphere. The X-ray pulse profile shows a single, asymmetric peak which could be explained by an axially-asymmetric temperature distribution at the pole or by the non-thermal emission from the outer gap. The three pulsars represent important stages in the evolutionary path that a hypothetical single young pulsar like J2022+3842 might take, as it passes through stages close to gamma-ray emission turn-off (like J1836+5925) and X-ray turn-off (similar to J0108-3430).\n\nPulsars in binaries can follow an alternative path. By accreting matter from their companions they can be \u2018recycled\u2019 to short millisecond periods and emit X-rays and gamma-rays for billions of years. I also present a special class of such recycled pulsars which are believed to be in the process of fatally ablating their companions. I present the X-ray analysis of PSR J1446-4701, a pulsar with spin-down power = 3.6E34 erg/s in a 6.7 hr binary orbit, and PSR J1311-3430, a pulsar with spin-down power = 4.9E34 erg/s, in an extreme 1.6 hr binary orbit. PSR J1446-4701 turned out to be a non-eclipser with possibly low (face-on) orbital inclination, with emission from both the pulsar and the intra-binary shock observable throughout the binary orbit. PSR J1311-3430 is a known eclipser, in which we find hints of spectral variability between pulsar superior and inferior conjunction phases. I also present a comprehensive comparison of the sample of such extremely low-mass binary pulsars. We reveal the true nature of pulsars, slowly and steadily, usually one target at a time, but eventually we expect useful patterns to emerge that improves our understanding of the population of rotation powered pulsars.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11432], "author_name_tesi": "Arumugasamy, Prakash ", "last_name_ssi": "Arumugasamy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Prakash", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George Pavlov", "Michael Eracleous", "Derek Brindley Fox", "Lee S Finn", "Steinn Sigurdsson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George Pavlov, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Eracleous, Committee Member", "Derek Brindley Fox, Committee Member", "Lee S Finn, Committee Member", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pulsars", "Neutron Star", "X-rays", "High-energy Astrophysics"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A Preliminary Study of Food Court Analytics", "id": "21874", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9553", "abstract_tesi": "Embedded software packages have revolutionized the field of data collection, assimilation and associated analytics through the ease of visualization tools such as customized report generation and plug-and-play dashboards.

The  paper then analyzes how data availability constraints identification under four data scenarios from the ideal situation to a more realistic one.  The observed number of accidents for each insuree plays a key role to identify the model.\n\nIn a first part, we consider the case of a continuum of coverages offered to each insuree whether the damage distribution is fully observed or truncated. \nTruncation arises from that an insuree files a claim only when the accident involves damage above the deductible.

When the damage distribution is truncated, the joint distribution is identified up to the probability that the damage is above the deductible.

The data collected from the Yellow Page Association and the phone books suggest that the utility publisher is a leader in the market. Therefore, we consider a Stackelberg duopoly model of nonlinear pricing in which firms buying advertising are characterized by a bi-dimensional vector of tastes for the two directories. The model and the econometric specification incorporate the features observed in the data such as the quadratic price schedules and a basic free advertisement offered to all firms by both publishers. Empirical results show substantial heterogeneity among firms' willingness to pay.

Changing any of these variables can drastically alter adhesion, friction, and/or wear.  Approaches to prevent wear, reduce friction, and control adhesion are determined by the application in question.   In many cases, devices requiring lubrication have predetermined geometries, loads, velocities, and are made of specific materials.  Effective lubrication and wear prevention then depends on engineering constituents utilized as lubricants.  Typically, bulk liquid hydrocarbons are used.  As devices shrink in size, bulk lubricants are not practical due to the large capillary forces they create and extreme viscous dampening forces.  Microscale devices (i.e. MicroElectroMechanical Systems MEMS) require new technologies for lubrication and wear prevention.  \n     This thesis examines the capability of molecular thin films as lubricants and wear prevention films.  These films are maintained by utilizing adsorption equilibrium of vapor-phase molecules.  Water and various linear alcohol molecules are studied as potential vapor-phase lubricants.  Because of the importance of silicon to microscale devices, tribological studies of wear, friction, and adhesion of silicon as a function of alcohol vapor pressure and chain length are studied.  Additionally, the effectiveness of these molecular thin films as lubricants for single nano-asperity contact and macrosopic multi-asperity contacts is studied.  \n     Adsorption of thin water or alcohol films drastically alters adhesion, friction, and wear.  In the case of water adsorption on silicon oxide surface, at low relative humidity, water preferentially adsorbs into the silicon oxide surface in an ice-like structure.  As the partial pressure of water increases, liquid water structure is observed to grow on top of the ice-like water structure. As a consequence of structured water at low relative humidities, adhesion between silicon oxide nano-asperity contacts is significantly larger than predicted from capillary forces alone.  During sliding in humid environments, chemical wear of silicon oxide is accelerated.  Altering the surface chemistry of the silicon oxide surface to prevent water adsorption via chemisorption of self-assembled monolayers is investigated.  While these hydrophobic treatments lower the total average surface coverage of water at the interface, water adsorption is not completely prevented. \n     Adsorption of linear alcohols onto the silicon oxide surface is also investigated.  In the case of alcohol vapors, monolayer coverage is observed to occur at ~10% of the saturation pressure of the alcohol.  In contrast with water, alcohol is observed to drastically reduce adhesion between nano-scale contacts.  The reduction in capillary adhesion is observed to decrease and is inversely proportional to the molar volume.  In the case of contact asperities ranging from a single nano-scale asperity to multi-asperity macro-scale systems, alcohol vapor adsorption successfully lubricates (lowers friction) and prevents wear.  Inside of the sliding contact region, high-molecular weight oligomeric species are formed via tribochemical reactions from alcohol precursor molecules forming wear protective coatings.  Therefore, these oligomeric species/coatings form when and where lubrication is needed most; greatly aiding wear prevention.  In the case of silicon based MEMS devices, these films completely prevent wear and increase the lifetime of these devices over 4 to 5 orders of magnitude compared with current \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d self-assembled monolayer coatings.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1324], "author_name_tesi": "Asay, David Benjamin", "last_name_ssi": "Asay", "middle_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong H Kim", "Erwin A Vogler", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seong H Kim, Committee Chair", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["friction", "adhesion", "wear", "silicon", "MEMS", "vapor phase", "lubrication", "adsorption", "water"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Estrogen occurrence, transport, and biological effects resulting from wastewater reuse in irrigation and aquaculture", "id": "19932", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9383", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT \nWastewater treatment plant effluents (WWTPEs) are a major environmental source of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which have the potential to adversely affect the functioning of hormone systems in humans and wildlife. Most WWTPEs are directly discharged into surface waters where EDCs have been shown to influence reproduction and development of fish and other aquatic organisms. While beneficial reuse of effluents avoids direct discharge and ensuing effects on surface aquatic ecosystems, potential impacts on soils, crops, wildlife, groundwater, and human receptors are possible. Thus, it is important to understand the behavior, fate, and transport of EDCs in various wastewater reuse scenarios. The objective of this research was to investigate the behavior and potential risks associated with hormones (specifically, estrone (E1), 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), and 17\u03b1-ethynlestradiol (EE2)), a ubiquitous and important class of EDCs, in three wastewater reuse scenarios: (i) spray irrigation of wastewater effluent for groundwater recharge, (ii) wastewater-fed aquaculture, and (iii) wastewater-irrigated vegetable production. \nThe extent to which wastewater E1, E2, and EE2 applied at the Penn State University Living Filter site via effluent irrigation moved downward in the soil profile was investigated. Patterns of estrogen occurrence were first established by analyzing WWTPE samples (n = 269) for 12 months under different flow and seasonal conditions. The order of frequency of occurrence based on percentage of sample values above the limit of quantification (LOQ) was: E1 (60%) > E2 (34%) > EE2 (1%). Notably, E1 high-flow concentrations were statistically higher (p = 0.012) compared to low-flow, but no clear patterns were seen for E2 occurrence. The concentration medians (ranges) observed during the high-flow sampling times were E1 [6.1 (<LOQ \u2013 17.0 ng L-1)] and E2 [<LOQ (<LOQ \u2013 37.7 ng L-1)]. During low flows, all medians were <LOQ and ranges were E1 (<LOQ \u2013 5.6 ng L-1), E2 (<LOQ \u2013 37.4 ng L-1) and EE2 (<LOQ \u2013 3.6 ng L-1). The EE2 levels were mostly <LOQ during both high and low flow. Diurnal patterns generally showed peak effluent E1 and E2 concentrations during morning sampling collections capturing peak evening flow of a student-dominated population. Observed variations in E1 occurrence were attributed to differences in the makeup of the service population during different flow regimes.\nAfter baseline estrogen concentrations were established, effluent spiked with 100 \u00b5g L-1 E1, E2, and EE2 and 6.7 mg L-1 Br- (inert tracer) was applied at 5 \u2013 10 cm wk-1 for 6 months to undisturbed column lysimeters (60 x 60 x 60 cm) sampled from two soil types: Hagerstown (silt loam) and Morrison (sandy loam). By design, bypass flow along wall edges was separated from flow within the soil matrix and most (> 85%) of applied liquid bypassed the inner soil matrix. Inverse modeling of transport parameters by the CXTFIT model suggested that although the fractions of mobile water content were small (\u03b2 = 0.37 \u00b1 0.120 and 0.06 \u00b1 0.023 for Br- in Hagerstown and Morrison soils, respectively) it appeared to be a major influence in the leaching of the estrogens. One Morrison soil lysimeter appeared to have one or more continuous macropores from top to bottom; the Br- tracer emerged at C/Co \u2265 1 at only 0.02 pore volumes (PV), and within 0.04 PV, the C/Co for estrogens measured as high as 0.91 (E1), 0.23 (E2), and 0.38 (EE2). \nAt three peri-urban sites in Ghana (West Africa), the effects of wastewater-borne estrogens on growth and reproduction of cultured fish were assessed. African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) raised in a wastewater stabilization pond (WSP) of a functioning municipal wastewater treatment plant, a wastewater polishing holding pond (WWP) of a dysfunctional treatment plant, and a reference pond (RP) unimpacted by wastewater were studied. Pond water estrogenicity (E2Eq) assayed by E-SCREEN and E2 concentrations followed the trend WWP > WSP > RP and estrogen levels in wastewater ponds were comparable to other reports for effluents worldwide. Fish serum estrogenicity assayed by E-SCREEN showed significantly higher concentrations in female vs. male catfish in the RP and WSP but not in the WWP (\u03b1 = 0.05). Histological examination of liver and gonad tissue showed no apparent signs of intersex or pathology. The similarities in various measures of body indices between fish of this study and African catfish from freshwater systems suggest that aquaculture may be a suitable reuse option for treated municipal wastewater in regards to estrogenic effects.\nPlant uptake of environmental E1, E2, and EE2 as a result of wastewater irrigation were studied by evaluating the occurrence of estrogens in irrigation water, vegetables, and soils from three study sites in Ghana where raw wastewater (site RWW), partially treated wastewater (site PTWW), or impounded drinking water (reference site IDW) were used to irrigate vegetables in peri-urban agriculture. Samples of irrigation waters and vegetables [spring onions (Allium wakegi), green bell pepper (Capsicum annuum), and lettuce (Lactuca sativa)] were collected weekly for six weeks from the three sites. Soils were also collected and tested. Estrone concentrations in irrigation water were not found to be significantly different (\u03b1 = 0.05) with median values as follows: RWW (5.5 ng L-1) > PTWW (3.6 ng L-1) > IDW (<LOQ). The E2 occurrence in water at the sites were statistically different with median concentrations at PTWW being 2.0 ng L-1 while both IDW and RWW were <LOQ. The median EE2 concentration at site RWW was 15.1 ng L-1 (comparable only to upper limits reported in wastewater treatment plant influent by a few other studies) while both IDW and PTWW were <LOQ. The higher than average concentration of EE2 at site RWW suggest high use of oral contraceptives in the service population. No estrogens were detected in soils from the study sites. Results of estrogen concentrations in plant tissue were limited and levels in all vegetables from all sites were mostly below the LOQ of 0.1 ng g-1. Lettuce showed the highest estrogen concentrations but these levels may be due to foliar deposition during wastewater application rather than direct uptake and translocation in plant tissue. At site RWW, lettuce E1, E2, and EE2 concentrations of up to 1430.4, 28.2, and 4.3 ng g-1 (dry weight), respectively, and 53.4 ng g-1 E1 in spring onions were recorded. Estimated human dietary intake of EE2 (18 \u00b5g d-1) based on the highest observed estrogen levels in lettuce were found to be comparable to therapeutic doses in oral contraceptives (10 \u2013 50 \u00b5g d-1). Results indicated that although E1 and EE2 concentrations comparable to those of previous studies were detected in irrigated wastewater, these levels were not reflected in plant tissue estrogen levels most of the time or in soils. \nBased on the estrogen attenuation mechanisms in soils (sorption and microbial degradation), and uptake and effects in biota (plant and fish) in the scenarios studied, spray irrigation of treated wastewater effluent for groundwater recharge, wastewater-fed aquaculture, and wastewater-irrigated vegetable production may be viable reuse options for mitigating the impacts of wastewater-borne estrogens. It is recommended that fate and transport studies of wastewater-borne hormones recognize and account for the high variability in effluent concentrations arising from seasonal and service population changes. Secondly, studies and assessments of leached compounds at effluent irrigation sites should recognize macropore flow as an important transport mechanism. Finally, attention should be given to human risks of exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds as a result of foliar deposition on irrigated vegetables consumed raw and potential bioaccumulation in wastewater-raised fish.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9184], "author_name_tesi": "Asem-hiablie, Senorpe ", "last_name_ssi": "Asem-hiablie", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Senorpe", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott", "Herschel Adams Elliott", "John Earl Watson", "Rachel Alice Brennan", "Albert R Jarrett", "Clinton D Church"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott, Dissertation Advisor", "Herschel Adams Elliott, Committee Chair", "John Earl Watson, Committee Member", "Rachel Alice Brennan, Committee Member", "Albert R Jarrett, Committee Member", "Clinton D Church, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Estrone", "Estradiol", "Ethynylestradiol", "Endocrine disrupting compound", "Emerging contaminant", "E-SCREEN", "Effluent", "Africa", "Ghana"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF VIDEO GAME AVATAR RACE ON IN-GAME BEHAVIORS AND POST-PLAY AGGRESSION", "id": "11478", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1807", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Video game researchers have begun to examine the effects of the avatar on game play, a phenomenon referred to as the Proteus effect.

Critical scholarship would classify such portrayals in film as fitting a \u201cWhite-savior\u201d format that emphasizes the morality of White characters and, often, the moral deficiency of non-White characters (Giroux, 1997; Vera & Gordon, 2003). Scholars argue these films may lead to several negative outcomes with regard to issues of race, such as the reinforcement of beliefs associated with modern forms of racism and the naturalization of stereotypes about African Americans. However, an alternate perspective suggests seeing someone perform acts of moral beauty, such as going to great lengths to help another person, induces elevation, an other-focused moral emotion thought to motivate prosocial action and produce more accepting attitudes toward members of out-groups. Therefore, feelings of elevation generate counter-stereotyping outcomes in spite of the problematic ideologies that may be inherent in the elevation-inducing act(s). \n\nThis research proposed competing sets of hypotheses with regard to the effects of viewing a savior film on racial attitudes. One set of hypotheses reflects critical assumptions and proposed that the elevation elicited by savior films would encourage perceptions of racial harmony and egalitarianism that contribute to traditional and modern forms of racism. The second set of hypotheses represented the perspective of positive psychologists and predicted elevation in response to viewing a savior film would lead to prosocial outcomes and other-oriented thoughts that would reduce racism. The study also examined the role of identification with a savior character and subsequent changes in perceptions of one\u2019s own morality in the effects of savior films.  The potential influence of moral evaluations of film\u2019s non-central Black characters (i.e. members of the community, family members, etc.) on racial attitudes was also examined. Finally, the study compared portrayals of White saviors to those of Black saviors which are also common in the media landscape to determine (a) whether White privilege can be maintained even in the absence of White characters, and (b) how responses to these films may differ. \n\nAn experiment was employed to examine the hypotheses proposed by this research. Specifically, participants (N = 149) viewed a White-savior, a Black-savior, or a control film and subsequently responded to items that represented each of the variables of interest. The results of the experiments indicated that, overall, neither the positive psychology nor the critical race theory perspectives was fully supported. Whereas results indicated that savior films did elicit elevation that led to greater levels of universal orientation, prosocial motivations, and perceptions of racial harmony, viewing a savior film had no indirect effects for racial attitudes. Results did reveal effects for two of the outcomes of elevation and indicated that universal orientation, or feelings of connectedness with humanity, was associated with reduced levels of traditional and modern racism. In contrast, prosocial motivations, in the absence of universal orientation, were associated with greater levels of traditional and modern racism. The results of this research also showed participants who identified with the savior character that perceived themselves as more moral. Further, perceptions of self-morality had an indirect effect on traditional and modern racism via prosocial motivations such that perceiving the self as more moral led to greater racial bias. In addition, results demonstrated evaluations of the film\u2019s secondary Black characters as immoral were associated with greater levels of traditional racism. Finally, results of a multiple group analysis indicated the effects of viewing a White-savior film on racial attitudes did not significantly differ from the effects of viewing a Black-savior film.

By scaling the dimensions of an FSS unit cell for use in a nano-fabrication process, these concepts have recently been adapted for use in optical applications as well. While early optical designs have been limited to well-understood geometries or optimized pixelated screens, nano-fabrication, lithographic and interconnect technology has progressed to a point where it is possible to fabricate metallic screens of arbitrary geometries featuring curvilinear or even three-dimensional characteristics that are only tens of nanometers wide.\n\nIn order to design an FSS featuring such characteristics, it is important to have a robust numerical solver that features triangular elements in purely two-dimensional geometries and prismatic or tetrahedral elements in three-dimensional geometries. In this dissertation, a periodic finite element method code has been developed which features prismatic elements whose top and bottom boundaries are truncated by numerical integration of the boundary integral as opposed to an approximate representation found in a perfectly matched layer. However, since no exact solution exists for the calculation of triangular elements in a boundary integral, this process can be time consuming. To address this, these calculations were optimized for parallelization such that they may be done on a graphics processor, which provides a large increase in computational speed. \n\nAdditionally, a simple geometrical representation using a B\u00e9zier surface is presented which provides generality with few variables.

More specifically, glucocorticoids, such as cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents, which are elevated during conditions of psychological stress, are generally immunosuppressive.  At the cellular level, glucocorticoids impair cytokine production, NK cell cytotoxicity, microglial expression of MHC Class I, and CD8+ T cell proliferation and migration to the site of infection.  These findings have dramatic effects at the organismal level.  For example, glucocorticoids have previously been implicated in reduced vaccine-elicited immune responses, delayed wound healing, and increased pathology/mortality during herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection.  Earlier work has investigated the effects of stress on the immune response to HSV following infection via the footpad, ocular and intranasal routes.\nAlthough the aforementioned studies provided valuable insight into the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids modulate cell-mediated immune responses, they neglected to examine the immune response at the site of initial infection, focusing instead on the virus\u2019 progression to the nervous tissue.  Additionally, there have yet to be any published studies examining the effects of psychological stress on the immune response at mucosal sites.  In the studies described herein, we used a well-defined murine model of restraint stress to define the effects of stress during primary HSV-1 infection within nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue and vaginal mucosa.  These studies revealed that corticosterone exerted a two-pronged attack on the initial mucosal immune response via a glucocorticoid-receptor mediated mechanism.  First, restraint stress-induced increases in serum corticosterone decreased the number of immune cells at the site of infection, thereby impairing clearance of the infection and allowing for increased titers of HSV.  These results could be mimicked with either the provision of exogenous corticosterone via the drinking water, or by surgically reducing the number of cells within the mucosa prior to infection.  In addition, the decrease in cellularity was partially prevented following pharmacological blockade of the type II glucocorticoid receptor.  Second, glucocorticoids reduced the number of CD8+ T cells which undergo degranulation, or produce interferon-&#947; within the draining lymph nodes.  These findings have serious clinical implications, in that increased viral titers and associated pathophysiology increase the length of infection, thereby augmenting the risk of transmission to non-infected individuals.  Additionally, an impaired immune response to intranasally-acquired antigens may compromise the efficacy of aerosolized vaccines.\nHaving characterized the effects of stress at the organismal level, we next turned our attention to the effects of ex vivo corticosterone exposure on CD8+ T cells.  Although there are numerous reports of glucocorticoids impairing CD8+ T cell activity (including proliferation, cytokine production and the ability to lyse target cells), there are no studies focusing on specific mechanisms by which granule-mediated cytotoxicity is impaired.  Using antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, of either a naive and memory phenotype, we assessed the ability of cells to respond to antigen in the presence of physiologically-relevant levels of corticosterone.  Naive CD8+ T cells that had been exposed to corticosterone failed to acquire an activated phenotype (CD25+, CD69+) following stimulation with immobilized anti-CD3/anti-CD28, and were subsequently unable to degranulate and lyse peptide-pulsed target cells.  Further examination of these cells revealed that their function was inhibited by increased expression of the inhibitory co-stimulatory molecule, CTLA-4.  Surprisingly, CD8+ T cells with a memory phenotype (CD62Llo, CD44hi) were still able to degranulate in the presence of corticosterone, and were not susceptible to increased CTLA-4 expression.  These findings are the first to suggest that cells with a memory phenotype are more resilient to the effects of glucocorticoids.\nTaken together, the studies described in this thesis demonstrate that stress-induced immunosuppression during mucosal HSV-1 infection begins with a failure to efficiently clear virus at the initial site of infection through both direct and indirect effects of glucocorticoids.  Additionally, we report a CD8+ T cell-specific mechanism by which glucocorticoids inhibit the immune response.  These findings help explain the increase in HSV incidence and pathology in individuals experiencing psychological stress.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3294], "author_name_tesi": "Ashcraft, Kathleen Andrea", "last_name_ssi": "Ashcraft", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrea", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Harold Bonneau", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Richard James Courtney", "Todd Schell", "David Joseph Spector", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Harold Bonneau, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Chair", "Richard James Courtney, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Glucocorticoids", "Intranasal Vaccines", "Psychological Stress", "Herpes Simplex Virus", "CD8+ T cells", "Mucosal Immunology"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Investigating the physiology and behavior of the panamanian bishop fish", "id": "18060", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7359", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Aquatic environments can present a number of challenges for the organisms that inhabit them.\nSome of these challenges are physiological, like the need to take up oxygen from the water\nthrough gills, and, as some animals have higher oxygen demands than others, a way to regulate\nthe efficiency of gas exchange may be needed. Teleost fish use their gills for respiration and ion exchange, among other things. These adaptations allow them to inhabit many kinds of aquatic ecosystems, from freshwater to seawater, acidic to alkaline water, extreme high or low temperatures, and hypoxic or anoxic environments. One physiological adaptation that allows them to inhabit different environments is the ability to remodel their gills to change their respiratory surface area, and thus alter their ability to uptake oxygen and discard waste gases. One aim of this thesis was to examine the plasticity of the gills of Panamanian Bishop fish, Brachyrhaphis episcopi. Previous work has shown that these fish differ in temperament with some individuals being bolder than others. Such traits will demand different levels of oxygen thus degree of boldness may be related to gill morphology and specifically how much of the respiratory surface area is exposed to the environment. Here I show that there is no difference in\nrespiratory surface area for bold and timid fish.\nOther challenges faced by fish are more ecological in nature such as the threat of\npredation. Many fish have other fish that create a dangerous threat in terms of predation. Fish can adjust their behavior to decrease their risk of predation.

However, the reaction rate constant was not significantly affected by pH. A Response Surface Methodology (RSM) model was developed that adequately described the reaction. It was significant at p<0.001, and explained 99.30% of the variability in the reaction rate constant.

Currently, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cancer killer in the United States and the fourth most common form of cancer diagnosed. Many epidemiologic and laboratory studies have found that food and nutrition play an important role in both the incidence and progression of colorectal cancers. \nData for the following studies were collected from adult men and women in central and northeastern Pennsylvania, which has higher CRC incidence and mortality rates than the United States average. Cases were identified from the Pennsylvania cancer registry and population-based controls were identified via random-digit dialing. Dietary information was collected via a modified Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ) developed by Subar and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) including supplement use and an additional meat module. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and buccal cells for genomic DNA analysis were collected during in-person interviews. \nThe objective of the first study was to examine colorectal cancer risk associated with iron intake (total, dietary, supplemental, and heme). Heme iron content from the diet was calculated using a new heme iron database developed by the NCI using information from a detailed meat module that was added to the food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. After multivariate adjustment, there were no significant associations between heme iron or total iron intake and CRC incidence. Dietary iron was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk in women (OR Q5 vs. Q1\u00ac= 0.45; 95% CI = 0.22-0.92), but not men. Lastly, supplemental iron intake of >18 mg/d vs. none was positively associated with colorectal cancer risk (OR = 2.31; 95% CI = 1.48-3.59; P-trend <0.001). In summary, these findings suggest that consumption of >18 mg/d of supplemental iron may increase risk for colorectal cancer.\nIn the second study, our objective was to examine the associations between calcium and vitamin D intake (total, dietary, and supplemental) and incident colorectal cancer. We found an inverse association between total vitamin D intake and colorectal cancer risk (OR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.49-0.91; P-trend < 0.01). Higher levels of total calcium intake were also inversely associated with colorectal cancer incidence (OR Q5 v. Q1= 0.48; 95% CI = 0.35-0.66; P-trend <0.01). In addition, high supplemental intakes of vitamin D (>10 \u03bcg/d) and calcium (>500 mg/d) were associated with reduced risk (OR High v. None = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.53-0.89, P-trend = 0.05; OR High v. None = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.46-0.81, P-trend < 0.01, respectively). Overall, our results indicate reduced risk of colorectal cancer with higher total and supplemental intakes of vitamin D and calcium.\nIn our final study, we examined the associations between folate intake (total, dietary, and supplemental) and incident colorectal cancer. We also assessed the impact of 35 polymorphisms from three folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM)-related genes on colorectal cancer risk. Finally, we examined whether there were any gene-diet interactions between folate intake and FOCM-related polymorphisms that alter colorectal cancer risk within the present multi-site population-based case-control study. After multivariate adjustment, colorectal cancer risk was not significantly associated with dietary or supplemental folate intake overall. Four polymorphisms from three genes had significant interactions with dietary intake factors associated with colorectal cancer risk.

EDs are a safety net within the health care system; they serve all patients regardless their conditions, funds, or characteristics. The demand on EDs is variable and ever increasing, often leaving them overcrowded. Many hospitals are utilizing triage algorithm to rapidly sort and classify patients based on the severity of their injury or illness.\nTriage is a pre-hospital patient sorting process in EDs. Decision making is a crucial aspect of the process due increasing concern for ED productivity and the need to reduce waiting time for patients requiring immediate medical intervention. To improve decision making and the productivity in EDs, researchers have implemented different tools and models from various fields. Engineering tools and methods have been used extensively and successfully in manufacturing systems. Similarities between manufacturing systems and EDs are identifiable. Therefore, certain tools and methods can be applied to ED practices to improve productivity, safety, patient satisfaction, and critical decision making. \nGroup Technology (GT) is a management philosophy meant to improve manufacturing efficiency by sorting and classifying parts into part families. It builds on the concept that a group of problems sharing common concepts, principles, and tasks can have a single solution, thus saving time and effort. GT involves the identification of part families. In manufacturing, a part family is a group of parts which share similar design and/or manufacturing characteristics. In healthcare systems, patients are the parts. Thus, a patient group is a collection of patients sharing similar demographic and physiological characteristics (patient-related) and operational characteristics (system-related).    \nThis dissertation provides a framework for the definition, identification, and impact of patient grouping and prioritization on the ED static complexity and system performance. The proposed methodology would be able to identify patients groups and treatment priorities according to patient characteristics using the newly developed GT triage algorithm. Then, quantify the information-theoretic static complexity of the ED system after using the GT. The output of this process represents a scientific basis for making informed and logical decisions to support improved ED patient sorting based on patient and treatment requirements information.    \nBy applying the methodology, patient groups and treatment priorities are identified and the static complexity assessed for the ED system. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is utilized to compare the current ED system which uses the ESI triage algorithm to two other systems; one ED system using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process - Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (FAHP-MAUT) triage algorithm (developed by the author of the dissertation [1]), and another ED system using the GT triage algorithm. Comparisons are made in terms of systems performance measures. The results show the GT system typically outperforms the others in terms of the percentage of tardy patients and their associated risk. Tardy patients are the patients that were not seen as quickly as needed to maximize safety and provision of care within the recommended window of time, based on their acuity and the associated needs.     \nStatic complexity was also measured to compare two systems: the current system which uses the ESI triage algorithm and the one that uses the GT triage algorithm. Result shows that the GT system tends to have lower static complexity. This finding suggests GT may have a positive impact on the ED crowding challenge, which is logical based on current literature that reports a positive correlation between system inefficiencies and system complexity.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8078], "author_name_tesi": "Ashour, Omar ", "last_name_ssi": "Ashour", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Omar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gul Kremer", "Gul Kremer", "Andris Freivalds", "Paul Griffin", "Carol A Smith", "M Jeya Chandra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gul Kremer, Dissertation Advisor", "Gul Kremer, Committee Chair", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "Paul Griffin, Committee Member", "Carol A Smith, Committee Member", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Group Technology", "Triage", "Emergency Department", "Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process", "Multi-Attribute Utility Theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Assessment, prioritization, and communication of risks of failures of a bridge scour countermeasure over a range of flow events", "id": "26375", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11672", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Assessment, prioritization, and communication of risks of failures of countermeasures over a wide range of flow events can be very effective in the selection and the design of an appropriate countermeasure considering the uncertainty in the performance of a countermeasure in an uncertain complex river system. In this study, a risk-based approach is developed for assessing, prioritizing, and communicating the risks of failure modes of a bridge scour countermeasure using Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) tool. In FMEA, the risks of failure modes are derived from the severity (S) and occurrence (O) ratings. Widely used approach of Risk Priority Number (RPN), product of the risk ratings, is improved to assess risks overcoming the mathematical limitations of Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs). Another simple and effective approach of assessing risks, Risk Priority Code (RPC), is used to make a comparison between the RPN and RPC results, and to find out which approach is comparatively more rigorous. The appropriate risk assessment approach is then used to build risk matrix. Risk matrix is a table that maps severity (S) and occurrence (O) ratings to the corresponding risk priority level. The developed risk matrix will be able to assess and prioritize the risks of failure modes of a countermeasure using only the qualitative information represented by S and O ratings. An approach of defining and incorporating confidence level in risk matrix is developed to provide more comprehensiveness and/or completeness to the risk matrix. Such an approach of developing risk matrix will enable bridge engineers to use risk matrix as a basis for making risk-informed decision. To determine the relative change in a risk priority level over a range of flow conditions, a study is then carried out focusing on the backwater in the vicinity of a bridge. The backwater is simulated using one dimensional model Hydrologic Engineering Centers River Analysis System (HEC-RAS). The effects of backwater are defined based on the monitoring survey data. Then, the developed risk matrix is used to determine any change in the risk priority level considering the backwater effects. Such an approach is simple enough to implement in the planning phase to account for the effects of flood events in the risk-based approach of selection and design of a countermeasure.

This is due to complexity of these traits, which are also influenced by pleiotrophic and confounding effects of other characteristics. These challenges have undermined breeding efforts to improve tomatoes with genetic resistance to EB and higher fruit quality at the same time. The confounding and pleiotrophic effects of these traits with other horticulturally important traits can be detected by application of molecular breeding tools, such as genetic linkage maps, graphical genotyping, statistics and biometrical procedures and QTL analysis. The objectives of the current thesis research were to find the relationships and to identify QTLs for EB resistance and fruit quality traits. \n\nA Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium accession (PSLP125) was determined to be resistant to EB with exceptionally high lycopene and soluble solid content. In order to exploit the genetic recourses of this accession in breeding cultivated tomato, an F2:7 derived RIL population (n=172) of L. esculentum &#61620; L. pimpinellifolium cross was developed. The population was evaluated for EB resistance under field conditions and for fruit quality characteristics in the field and laboratory for three years and generations (2004-F7, 2005-F8 and 2006-F9).  A genetic linkage map was constructed based on 275 RFLP, ESTs (mainly candidate resistant genes), CAPS and SSR markers to perform QTL analysis. The map spanned 1061 cM of the tomato genome with an average of 3.8 cM between markers. Skewed segregation was observed for ~29.5% of the markers on all chromosomes except chromosomes 11 and 12.  The average heterozygosity in the population was  6.8%, which was 4.7 times greater than what was expected (1.5%) for a RIL population at F7 generation. \n\nIn order to identify QTLs for EB resistance, the population was evaluated for EB resistance for three years in the field. Simple, composite and multiple interval mapping procedures were employed and QTL analysis was carried out. In total 10 QTLs (LOD &#8805; 2.4, P &#8804; 0.001) for resistance to EB were identified with individual effects ranging from 3.0% to 16%. Two QTLs on chromosomes 5 and 6 were highly consistent across the years/generations. Co-localizations of QTLs with several candidate genes such as Mi-1, ethylene response factor-5, lipoxygenase B, wound-induced protein-1 were observed, suggesting potential involvement of these genes in EB resistance. Thus, it is speculated that the candidate-gene approach is an effective way of identifying and mapping new disease resistance genes in tomato. \n\nThe RIL population was also evaluated for three years in the field and laboratory for four fruit quality characteristics, including Fruit Weight (FW), Soluble Solids Concentration (SSC), pH and colorimetric parameters of pur\u00e9e. QTL analysis was employed to identify the QTLs for these fruit quality related traits. Several QTLs for FW on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 11, pH on chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 8, 10 and 12, SSC on chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 8, 9 and 10 lycopene on chromosomes 2, 4, 7, 11 and 12  were identified. The QTL analysis of lycopene using HPLC, spectrophotometer, statistical model derived data in previous generationsand fruit color evolutions in the field, led to the identification of two major QTLs for lycopene on tomato chromosomes 7 and 12 and three minor QTLs on chromosomes 2, 4, and 11. Because of the consistency of the QTLs on chromosomes 7 and 12, they seem to be promising for developing QTL-NILs, as well as for improving tomato lycopene content by marker-assisted breeding.\n\nIn addition to QTL analysis, in 2006 (F9), HPLC and spectrophotometric assays were employed to measure the amount of lycopene in a sample (n=127) of RILs. The results indicate that the spectrophotometric assay preserves the accuracy of the measurement using HPLC but eliminates the cost and degradation issues inherent with HPLC-based assays. Lycopene estimates obtained from this assay were highly correlated (r = 0.94) with estimates obtained from the HPLC method, suggesting the utility of this method as a substitute for HPLC assay. Furthermore, based on the HPLC assay a simple regression model was developed to estimate the amount of lycopene in previous generations/years using colorimetric values as independent variables. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4617], "author_name_tesi": "Ashrafi Nasrabadi, Hamid ", "last_name_ssi": "Ashrafi Nasrabadi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hamid", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Guiltinan", "David Robert Huff", "Seogchan Kang", "David M Braun", "Majid R Foolad"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Guiltinan, Committee Chair", "David Robert Huff, Committee Member", "Seogchan Kang, Committee Member", "David M Braun, Committee Member", "Majid R Foolad, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Genetic map", "DNA markers", "ESTs", "Candidate resistance genes", "QTL mapping", "Early Blight"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "PROTOTYPING AND OPTIMIZATION OF A MINIATURE MICROWAVE-FREQUENCY ION THRUSTER", "id": "15219mxa310", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15219", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents progress on the development of the Miniature Microwave-Frequency Ion Thruster (MMIT), currently being developed at Penn State as a microthruster with high specific impulse that can be used on small satellites for station keeping, attitude adjustments, and modest delta-V maneuvers.

Redesign complexity and change propagation are two of the main foci for such work, but there have been relatively few attempts to quantify design dependencies in product architectures.  Most of these approaches rely on \u201cengineering intuition\u201d of the design teams for determining the redesign effort for a product; however, this introduces uncertainty and bias to metrics from two important aspects:\n\u2022\tSubjective opinions of engineers can lead to company- and product-related results that do not provide good metrics for different types of product architectures; and\n\u2022\tRelying solely on engineering intuition may overlook some important indirect connections in the product architecture.\nAs the complexity of systems increase, the difficulty of accounting for the discrete indirect interactions in these systems also increases.  Considering the disadvantages of using subjective engineering expertise, the need for an unbiased metric is apparent.  For that reason this research develops a simple metric that can be calculated directly using input data retrieved from Design Structure Matrices (DSMs).  DSMs facilitate visualization of both inter- and intra-modular connections that are encompassed in the product, which are critical for understanding the architecture of the product. Connection weights between modules or components are captured by referring to the number of interfaces and different interface types. After determining connection weights within the product architecture, a new algorithm to calculate design dependencies is employed.  This algorithm incorporates the effects of indirect connections in the system to the redesign effort by using a circuit analogy from electrical engineering.\nLastly, this work presents a step-by-step method and analyzes a set of twenty-one small electro-mechanical products. Important statistical data about the interface occurrence frequencies are collected and weight for individual interface types are assigned. The results are validated by several tests including sensitivity analysis and design change analysis within different product architectures. Comparison with existing methods is also provided. \nThe research fills an important gap in the literature by providing a simple, unbiased metric that can be used to compare different product architectures based on their design dependencies as well as evaluating the \u201cchange sensitivity\u201d of individual components in a product architecture. This provides a very important decision-making tool for design engineers to reduce the duration of the redesign process by pointing out the less flexible design architectures or highly change sensitive components.\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4806], "author_name_tesi": "Asikoglu, Oyku ", "last_name_ssi": "Asikoglu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Oyku", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson", "Soundar Kumara", "Gul Kremer", "Sven G Bilen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson, Dissertation Advisor", "Soundar Kumara, Committee Chair", "Gul Kremer, Committee Member", "Sven G Bilen, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Product design", "change propagation in design", "design dependencies", "product architectures", "component interfaces", "design flexibility metric"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE DIFFUSION PROCESS OF\nMOBILE DEVICES IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN BOTSWANA AND NAMIBIA", "id": "27425", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12086", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This comparative study uses the Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theoretical framework to explore factors that influence diffusion of mobile devices in higher education in Botswana and Namibia.

Following this worldwide trend, during the early 1990s the Argentine central administration delegated to the provincial administrations some responsibilities of secondary and tertiary schooling.  Using an integrative approach and methodology, this study traces different sources of explanation\u2014institutional frameworks, socio-political environmental conditions, and civic capacity characteristics\u2014along the different phases of the 1990s Argentine decentralization policy process while looking comparatively at its outcomes in two school districts of the Province of Buenos Aires. \n \nThe results underscores three important points: 1) how Argentina\u2019s institutional framework conditioned the policy adoption by centralizing the decision-making and control over the process of education reform at the national level while delegating the responsibilities for policy implementation to the provincial administration; 2) how the province of Buenos Aires adopted and adapted certain aspects of the decentralization policy through informal institutional funding networks of neo-populist style, vesting the education reform to the political aspirations of the governor and, 3) how the distinct socio-political environment of each school district produced differential policy outcomes towards three policies of the decentralization reform: school autonomy, community participation in education, and the role of the local educational administration.   These differences surfaced through the inefficiencies of the provincial administration to respond to new educational responsibilities.  \n\nEvidence from the two school districts included in the study\u2014La Matanza and Vicente L\u00f3pez\u2014that differ in size, political culture, and socio-economic level illustrates varied resources for adjusting provincial mandates to the socio-political circumstances.  La Matanza\u2019s chaotic environment, inefficient managerial capacities, and its economic and political subordination to the provincial administration, have been the origins of an almost inactive school-community relationship except for the activity promoted by the decentralized and informal provincial social welfare network that used the school as the center of political clientelism.  The school-community relationship\u2019s apathy was also evident among the school, local school board and the local administration interaction.  On the other hand, Vicente L\u00f3pez\u2019s charismatic leadership, accountable and efficient managerial capacity\u2014based primarily on an informal institutional funding channel established between the local administration and a local business association\u2014and its political rivalry with the provincial administration have allowed this district to maintain certain autonomy from the latter and to have an active role at the school level.  This municipality has also proved to be pro-active in establishing participatory channels between the school, the local school board, and local civil associations.  \n\nThe particular state-society relationship established in each district proves that socio-political environments and civic involvement characteristics have an important effect in determining the type of community involvement developed.  However, the effect dilutes at the school level where the formal structure of the provincial educational system is still an important determinant of in-school participatory outcomes.  As a whole the study demonstrates that when global trends are carried out at the national level, they are not only conditioned by national institutional frameworks but also by local socio-political environments in which they operate proving that, in some cases, neither civic involvement nor decentralization equal democratization at the local and school level.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4092], "author_name_tesi": "Astiz, Mar\u00eda Fernanda", "last_name_ssi": "Astiz", "middle_name_ssi": "Fernanda", "first_name_ssi": "Mar\u00eda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David P Baker", "Gerald K Letendre", "David Alexander Gamson", "David Myers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David P Baker, Committee Chair", "Gerald K Letendre, Committee Member", "David Alexander Gamson, Committee Member", "David Myers, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["education policy", "decentralization", "socio-political environments", "civic capacity", "Argentina", "Buenos Aires"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Algorithms for Sum-of-Squares-Based Stability Analysis and Control Design of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems", "id": "16282", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7895", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, we present algorithmic procedures for sum-of-squares based stability analysis and control design for uncertain nonlinear systems. In particular, we consider the case of robust aircraft control design for a hypersonic aircraft model subject to parametric uncertainties in its aerodynamic coefficients.\n\nIn recent years, Sum-of-Squares (SOS) method has attracted increasing interest as a new approach for stability analysis and controller design of nonlinear dynamic systems. Through the application of SOS method, one can describe a stability analysis or control design problem as a convex optimization problem, which can efficiently be solved using Semidefinite Programming (SDP) solvers.\n\nFor nominal systems, the SOS method can provide a reliable and fast approach for stability analysis and control design for low-order systems defined over the space of relatively low-degree polynomials. However, The SOS method is not well-suited for control problems relating to uncertain systems, specially those with relatively high number of uncertainties or those with non-affine uncertainty structure. In order to avoid issues relating to the increased complexity of the SOS problems for uncertain system, we present an algorithm that can be used to transform an SOS problem with uncertainties into a LMI problem with uncertainties. A new Probabilistic Ellipsoid Algorithm (PEA) is given to solve the robust LMI problem, which can guarantee the feasibility of a given solution candidate with an a-priori fixed probability of violation and with a fixed confidence level.\n\nWe also introduce two approaches to approximate the robust region of attraction (RROA) for uncertain nonlinear systems with non-affine dependence on uncertainties. The first approach is based on a combination of PEA and SOS method and searches for a common Lyapunov function, while the second approach is based on the generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansion theorem combined with the SOS method and searches for parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions.\n\nThe control design problem is investigated through a case study of a hypersonic aircraft model with parametric uncertainties. Through time-scale decomposition and a series of function approximations, the complexity of the aircraft model is reduced to fall within the capability of SDP solvers. The control design problem is then formulated  as a convex problem using the dual of the Lyapunov theorem. A nonlinear robust controller is searched using the combined PEA/SOS method. The response of the uncertain aircraft model is evaluated for two sets of pilot commands. As the simulation results show, the aircraft remains stable under up to 50\\% uncertainty in aerodynamic coefficients and can follow the pilot commands.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7818], "author_name_tesi": "Ataei-esfahani, Armin ", "last_name_ssi": "Ataei-esfahani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Armin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Qian Wang", "Dr Qian Wang", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Christopher Rahn", "Alok Sinha", "Joseph Francis Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Qian Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Qian Wang, Committee Chair", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Alok Sinha, Committee Member", "Joseph Francis Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nonlinear systems", "randomized algorithms", "robust control", "uncertain systems", "sum of squares method", "ellipsoid method"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "MORTALITY SALIENCE AND CONSUMER RISK TAKING: STRIVING FOR PERSONAL CONTROL AND SELF-ESTEEM\n\n", "id": "7495", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5463", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "From a terror management perspective, this thesis argues that mortality salience (MS) causes consumers to become risk averse.

It was found that Schottky barrier (SB) lowering can explain the significant increase in the spectral responsivity as the reverse bias increases. The image force and the occupation of surface defects at the metal/semiconductor interface of the SBPD are the main factors for the SB lowering. The occupation of the surface defects was assumed to depend on the photogenerated current under reverse bias. The SB lowering causes a large leakage current that dominates the spectral responsivity at high reverse applied bias. The good agreement between the calculated and experimentally measured spectral responsivities suggests that the model is valid.\nIn chapter 3, the effect of the interfacial region lying in between undoped GaN (u-GaN) and the buffer-layer on the forward current properties of lateral-type GaN Schottky diodes and planar GaN metal-semiconductor-field-effect-transistors (MESFETs) grown on sapphire substrates has been investigated. Experimental results have revealed higher current densities for devices grown on patterned sapphire substrates (PSS) compared to flat sapphire substrates (FSS) owing to the different carrier transport properties of the interfacial regions. Simulations using the charge transport model shows a good agreement with the experimental results. It is disclosed that the interfacial region is acting as channel in which the current passes in between the device metallic contacts. Owing to the presence of the interfacial regions, the lateral Schottky diodes exhibit high current densities but without change in their on-state-voltage, whereas the planar MESFETs could hardly reach cut-off or show saturation behavior. Studying the effect of the interfacial region on the operation of GaN power devices would help in optimizing the device design and efficiency, and further facilitate their monolithic integration with GaN-based LEDs.\nIn chapter 4, design of GaN-based vertical metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs) on commercial light-emitting-diode (LED) epi-wafers has been proposed and proof of principle devices have been fabricated. In order to better understand the IV curves, these devices have been simulated using the charge transport model. It was found that shrinking the drain pillar size would significantly help in reaching cut-off at much lower gate bias even at high carrier concentration of unintentionally doped GaN and considerable leakage current caused by the Schottky barrier lowering. The realization of these vertical MESFETs on LED wafers would allow their chip-level integration. This would open a way to many intelligent lighting applications like on-chip current regulator and signal regulation/communication in display technology.\nIn chapter 5, we investigated canonical boundary-value problem of wave propagation guided by the planar interface of an isotropic homogeneous metal and a dielectric rugate filter with a refractive index that varies periodically normal to the interface. It was shown that this problem admits more than one solution, at a specific frequency. The different solutions indicate surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) waves that differ in phase speed, attenuation rate, linear polarization state, and field distribution. Currently, for the guidance of SPP waves by a metal/rugate-filter interface, attention was confined to SPP waves with low phase speeds  , where   is the speed of light in free space (i.e., vacuum).  In chapter 4, we report that multiple SPP waves with phase speeds   could be guided by a metal/rugate-filter interface.\nIn chapter 6, the propensity of guiding SPP waves by the back-contact of p-i-n solar cell is investigated. For a  - -  thin-film solar cell, the capability of guiding multiple SPP waves depend on the optical parameters of the constituting layers close to the metal/semiconductor interface. By varying the semiconductor layer partnering the metallic back-contact, the number of SPP waves that can be guided by the interface will be affected. The purpose of this study is to investigate to what extent the propensity of guiding SPP waves will be influenced if the layer partnering the metallic back-contact is changed, and to determine phase speeds, polarization states, and localization of the multiple SPP waves that can be guided by the metal/semiconductor interface.\nIn chapter 7, for a p-i-n solar cell, back contact Fourier harmonics (FH) and compound gratings were studied theoretically, using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis. The FH grating was found to enable more efficient multiple surface-plasmon-polariton (SPP) wave excitations compared with a compound grating, while both of them are made of the same constituting simple gratings. The incident plane wave was considered to be TM-polarized. The FH and compound gratings were designed to excite multiple SPP waves at desirable wavelengths by solving a canonical boundary-value problem. The excitation of SPP waves is indicated by the presence of peaks in the absorptance plots. The multiple SPP waves excited by the FH grating were found to increase the external quantum efficiency.\nIn chapter 8, the broadband continuous excitation of SPP waves is demonstrated for a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), and it is shown that it can efficiently propagate the absorbed energy to a neighboring solar cell which will then convert this energy into electricity. It is shown that if the metallic back-contact possesses real part of relative permittivity Re(\u03b5) that broadband increases, there may exist a TM-polarized SPP wave branch with the real part of its relative wavenumber broadband increases. In addition, if multiple layers in the DSSC have broadband increasing Re(\u03b5), multiple broadband increasing TM- and TE-polarized SPP waves could be guided by the back contact. Finally, the conclusions and future work are presented in chapter 9.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12915], "author_name_tesi": "Atalla, Mahmoud ", "last_name_ssi": "Atalla", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mahmoud", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jian Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jian Xu, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Optoelectronic devices", "GaN-based devices", "solar cells", "photodetectors", "MESFETs", "surface waves"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "CALIBRATION UNDER UNCERTAINTY FOR\nFINITE ELEMENT MODELS OF MASONRY MONUMENTS\n", "id": "9864", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2252", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Historical unreinforced masonry buildings often include features such as load\nbearing unreinforced masonry vaults, and their supporting framework of piers, fill,\nbuttresses, and walls. The masonry vaults of such buildings are among the most\nvulnerable structural components and certainly among the most challenging to analyze.\nThe versatility of finite element (FE) analyses in incorporating various constitutive laws,\nas well as practically all geometric configurations, has resulted in the widespread use of\nFE method for the analysis of complex unreinforced masonry structures over the last\nthree decades. However, an FE model is only as accurate as its input parameters, and\nthere are two fundamental challenges while defining FE model input parameters: (1)\nmaterial properties and (2) support conditions. The difficulties in defining these two\naspects of the FE model arise from the lack of knowledge in the common engineering\nunderstanding of masonry behaviour. As a result, engineers are unable to define these FE\nmodel input parameters with certainty, and inevitably uncertainties are introduced to the\nFE model.\n\nAs the complexity of the building increases, as is the case for historical\nunreinforced masonry buildings, the errors and uncertainties in the analysis also increase.\nIn the presence of high and numerous uncertainties originating from multiple sources,\ndeterministic approaches in which parameters are defined as constant values assumed to\nbe known with certainty cannot be implemented reliably. Probabilistic methods, however,\nprovide a rigorous and rational means in treating the uncertainty present in the FE\nanalysis of historical unreinforced masonry buildings. The way in which uncertainty in\nhistorical unreinforced masonry construction is treated is one of the novel and main\ncontributions of this dissertation.\n\nWhile building FE models, sometimes it is advantageous to model only a smaller\nportion of a larger structure. This substructure modelling approach not only reduces the\ncomputational time of FE analysis but also reduces required preliminary work for the\nmodel development. In this dissertation, substructure FE models of vaulted sections of\ntwo Gothic churches are calibrated using a Bayesian statistics-based procedure against\nphysical evidence collected through experimental modal analysis. During calibration\nboth the FE calculations and experimental measurements are treated probabilistically.\nThe probabilistic nature of the FE calculations stems from the fact that several FE model\nparameters which are determined to introduce significant analysis uncertainty, are treated\nprobabilistically. The probabilistic nature of experimental measurements stems from the\nfact that a large number of repeated experiments are compiled in order to determine\nexperimental uncertainty. The fact that uncertainty in both numerical calculations and\nexperimental measurements are accounted for is one of the novelties of this dissertation.\nThe modal parameters measured on the vault are statistically compared to the predictions\nof the FE model during calibration. According to the automated Bayesian statistics based\ncalibration procedure, the posterior distributions for the appropriately selected calibration\nparameters, such as modulus of elasticity of the vault material, and support spring\nconstants of the vaults, are obtained. This stochastic procedure is applied to the\nsubstructure FE models of the choir vaults of the National Cathedral, Washington, DC.\nand to the nave vaults of Beverley Minster, Beverley, UK.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2233], "author_name_tesi": "Atamturktur, Huriye Sezer", "last_name_ssi": "Atamturktur", "middle_name_ssi": "Sezer", "first_name_ssi": "Huriye", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Boothby", "Thomas E Boothby", "Jeffrey A Laman", "Martin Wesley Trethewey", "Andrew Scanlon", "Francois Hemez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Boothby, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Boothby, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey A Laman, Committee Chair", "Martin Wesley Trethewey, Committee Member", "Andrew Scanlon, Committee Member", "Francois Hemez, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sensitivity Analysis", "Uncertainty Quantification", "Verification and Validation", "Nondestructive Testing", "Modal Analysis", "Gothic Cathedrals", "Bayesian Inference", "Markov Chain Monte Carlo", "Vaulted Structures"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION AND ONLINE COUNSELING RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT\n\n\n", "id": "6112", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3804", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Seventy-six Counselor Education doctoral students rated the degree to which text-based computer mediated communication (CMC) counseling exchanges had therapeutic relationship qualities.

It first develops an extension of the classic dividend discount models that differentiates the value of cash flows to the firm and the distribution of these cash flows among shareholders. The single stock valuation model is incorporated into the optimal equity portfolio problem of a large investor. The solution counterweighs the benefits of higher returns through private benefits of control and monitoring efforts when an investor purchases a large equity block with the costs of bearing diversifiable risk. The model predicts that budget-constrained investors will be more likely to buy controlling blocks in smaller firms, and in firms where higher private benefits of control can be secured. The dissertation afterwards presents empirical evidence regarding the predictions of the developed equity valuation and portfolio optimization theory. Using a unique data set containing the valuation of large investors for equity blocks, the existence of private benefits of control for different sized blocks is documented. Further exploration of the determinants of portfolio choices reveals that institutions prefer to obtain large blocks in smaller firms, and in firms located in their geographical proximity. Investors with more capital are more likely to bid for large blocks and to form bidding coalitions.

For example, does an individual's survival time from cancer depend on the treatment that is given? Studies involving event times, such as death time due to cancer, are usually subject to censoring. In the cancer\nexample, censoring refers to the fact that we are unable to observe all death times from cancer before our data analysis. This could be due to the patient being alive by the end of the study, the patient died from another cause, or another reason. Some of the well known models used to examine relationships between an event time and\nexplanatory variables are the Cox proportional hazards model (PH) (Cox, 1972), the additive hazards model for right censored data (AHRC) (Lin and Ying, 1994), and the accelerated failure time (AFT) model.\n\nA common situation that analysts run into is that the explanatory variables used in examining potential relationships are a\u000bffected by unobserved variables which in turn aff\u000bect the event time of interest. This situation is referred to as endogeneity. Currently, there are no methods addressing endogeneity in the context of the PH, AHRC, and AFT models. Methods addressing endogeneity commonly use instrumental variables; some of these methods are two-stage predictor substitution (2SPS) (Terza et al., 2008), two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) (Terza et al., 2008), and jackknife instrumental variable estimators (Angrist et al., 1999).\n\nIn this work, I examine the performances of 2SPS and 2SRI in terms of adjusting for endogeneity in the context of the PH, AHRC, and AFT models.

This dissertation is about the utilization of honeycomb crushing in energy absorbing applications and maximizing their specific energy absorption (SEA) capacity by modifying their geometry. In-plane direction crushing of honeycombs is investigated with the help of simulations conducted with ABAQUS. Due to the nonlinearity of the problem an optimization technique could not be implemented; however, the results of the trend studies lead to geometries with improved SEA.\nThis study has two objectives; the first is to obtain modified cell geometry for a hexagonal honeycomb cell in order to provide higher energy absorption for minimum weight relative to the regular hexagonal cell geometry which has 30\u00b0 cell angle and walls at equal length.  The results of the first objective show that by increasing the cell angle, increasing wall thickness and reducing vertical wall length it is possible to increase the SEA 4.8 times; where the honeycomb with modified geometry provided 3.3 kJ/kg SEA and with regular geometry 0.68 kJ/kg SEA. \nThe second objective considers integration of the energy absorbing honeycombs into the helicopter subfloor, possibly as the web section of a keel beam. In-plane direction crushing of a honeycomb core sandwiched between two facesheets is simulated.  Effects of core and facesheet geometric parameters on the energy absorption are investigated, and modified geometries are suggested. For the sandwich structure with thin facesheets increasing cell angle, increasing wall thicknesses and decreasing the cell depth increase the SEA. For the ones with thick facesheet reducing vertical wall length, increasing wall thicknesses and reducing the cell depth increase the SEA. The results show that regular honeycomb geometry with thin facesheets has SEA of 7.24 kJ/kg and with thick facesheets 13.16 kJ/kg. When the geometries are modified the SEA increases to 20.5 kJ/kg for the core with thin facesheets and 53.47 kJ/kg for the core with thick facesheets. \nThe key finding of the dissertation is that the in-plane direction crushing of the honeycombs with facesheets has great potential to be used for the energy absorbing applications since their SEA levels are high enough to make them attractive for applications where high crash loads need to be absorbed such as helicopter crash. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [877], "author_name_tesi": "Atli Veltin, Bilim  ", "last_name_ssi": "Atli Veltin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bilim ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farhan S Gandhi", "Farhan S Gandhi", "Edward C Smith", "Ashok D Belegundu", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farhan S Gandhi, Dissertation Advisor", "Farhan S Gandhi, Committee Chair", "Edward C Smith, Committee Member", "Ashok D Belegundu, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["honeycomb crushing", "energy absorption", "cellular honeycombs"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "DIELECTRIC SPECTROSCOPY INVESTIGATION OF ION-CONTAINING AND INTERMOLECULAR HYDROGEN-BONDED POLYMER SYSTEMS\n\n", "id": "7531", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4990", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\nIon-containing and intermolecular hydrogen-bonded polymers are used widely in a variety of industrial and commercial applications, from food packaging to battery electrolytes to pharmaceuticals. Yet the dynamics of these polymers, which are both complex and important to the application, are poorly understood. This thesis provides the first systematic study of the dynamics of several ion-containing and intermolecular hydrogen-bonded polymers by broadband dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. The systems under consideration include sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) in acid (SPS-H) and neutralized forms, and mixtures of poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VPy) with lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) and low molecular weight phenolic molecules. Dynamic mechanical analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, small-angle X-ray scattering and wide-angle X-ray diffraction were employed in a complementary role.\nMultiple relaxations were generally observed at high temperatures. For SPS ionomers, the segmental process, Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars interfacial polarization, and electrode polarization were detected. Three relaxations were also found in spectra of SPS-H, attributed to the segmental process, hydrogen bond association/dissociation, and electrode polarization. \nThree dielectric relaxations above the segmental process were observed for P2VPy - LiClO4 mixtures: ion-mode relaxation, slow hindered segmental relaxation and electrode polarization. However, only electrode polarization was observed above the segmental relaxation for all P2VPy \u2013 small phenolic molecule mixtures, except P2VPy + 10 mol % 2,3,3,4,4,5-hexahydroxybenzophenone. This mixture exhibited an additional relaxation due to Maxwell-Wagner\u2013Sillars interfacial polarization, arising from the existence of phase-separated complexes within the P2VPy matrix.\nSub-Tg local relaxations were suppressed by ionic intermolecular interactions for SPS ionomers and P2VPy \u2013 LiClO4 mixtures. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding also suppressed the local relaxation in P2VPy \u2013 small phenolic molecule mixtures by decreasing the mobility of the pyridine-side groups. Both the concentration of small phenolic molecules and the number of hydroxyl groups per molecule played an important role in suppression of the local relaxation, which was significant for all mixtures where the small molecules contained more than one hydroxyl group per molecule.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4967], "author_name_tesi": "Atorngitjawat, Pornpen ", "last_name_ssi": "Atorngitjawat", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pornpen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt", "Qing Wang", "Ronald Hedden", "Janna Kay Maranas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt, Committee Chair", "Qing Wang, Committee Member", "Ronald Hedden, Committee Member", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dielectric relaxation spectroscopy", "ion-containing polymers", "hydrogen-bonded polymers", "polymer dynamics", "sulfonated PS ionomers", "poly(2-vinylpyridine)-lithium perchlorate mixtures"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Scaffolding Proteins IPCEF1/CNK3 and GRASP/TAMALIN Mediate \nArf-to-Rac Crosstalk in Epithelial Cell Migration", "id": "15391", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7759", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Epithelial cells form largely non-motile structures in most circumstances. However, wound healing and developmental processes require epithelial cell motility in normal physiological conditions.  In other instances, cell migration plays a role in pathobiological conditions such as metastases of cancers generating from epithelial tissues. Understanding the triggers and the mechanisms for migration is therefore crucial in attempting to prevent metastasis in cancer or promote it in wound healing. \nThe hepatocyte growth factor, HGF, is a potent inducer of motility for epithelial cells. It activates its receptor the c-Met tyrosine kinase and induces downstream cascades that promote movement. In this study we show that HGF signaling depends on a signal transduction cascade that involves multiple small GTPases downstream of c-Met. We identify two scaffolding proteins, IPCEF/CNK3 and GRASP/Tamalin necessary for assembling a multiprotein complex that brings together Arf6 and Rac1 and their respective GEFs, ARNO and Dock180 to a cellular location where they promote cytoskeletal changes and induce motility. \nWe first identify the role of IPCEF1/CNK3 in this cascade. IPCEF and CNK3 were first thought to be two separate proteins. We found that they are two halves of the same protein. This one protein is homologous to CNK in Drosophila melanogaster. CNK3 not only interacts with ARNO and enhances its activity, but as we demonstrate, has the capacity of anchoring ARNO in a location where it can activate Arf6 downstream of HGF. \nWe subsequently studied the function of GRASP/Tamalin in this multiprotein complex mediating Arf-to-Rac signaling. We found that GRASP acts as the molecular bridge between ARNO and Dock180, facilitating the cascade that promotes cell migration downstream of HGF. Knockdown of GRASP was shown to have detrimental effects on HGF-induced cell migration in general. In addition preliminary data suggest that the absence of GRASP negatively affects the activation of Rac1.\nThese data allow us to describe the importance of protein-protein interactions in the context of cell migration. Despite the absence of catalytic domains on scaffolding proteins, they play an important role in locating the signal and connecting receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to small GTPases crosstalk. The activation of small GTPases does not give a complete picture and definitely does not answer all the questions as to where, when and why cells elect to migrate or not. Scaffolding proteins fill in certain gaps in understanding the fine tuning required for proper protein assembly at the right time and location inside the cell. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7692], "author_name_tesi": "Attar, Myriam ", "last_name_ssi": "Attar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Myriam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lorraine C Santy", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Melissa Rolls", "Graham Hugh Thomas", "Cheng Dong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lorraine C Santy, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Member", "Cheng Dong, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ARF", "RAC", "Crosstalk", "Epithelial", "Migration", "Scaffolding"]}]
