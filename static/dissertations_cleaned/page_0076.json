Although the organizational impact of these citizenship behaviors has been explored, it still remains unclear if customer citizenship is also desirable for service employees. A scale is developed to understand and assess when customers go beyond their required role and engage in citizenship towards service employees. Citizenship towards service employees is predicted to act as a resource to reduce employee stressors and strain and therefore enhance employee well-being; however, not all \u2018help\u2019 from customers may be desired so specific circumstances are explored to understand when and if customer citizenship impacts employee well-being. Two studies are conducted to test these ideas: a validation study of the customer citizenship instrument and repeated measures (daily diary) study that assesses customer citizenship and its corollary employee outcomes over several workdays. In general, it is found that customer citizenship does enhance several different employee well-being indicators, but that the effect is more positive during busy shifts for employees and less effective during shifts where employees have a high rate of aggressive customers. Implications, limitations, and future directions are also discussed.

However, the effects of estrogen placed upon the background of BRCA1 heterozygosity in nontumorigenic, human breast cells have not been elucidated. As a key player in the DNA damage response, we hypothesize that impaired BRCA1 function results in the accumulation of DNA damage secondary to the high level of estrogen metabolites and the generation of reactive oxygen species in breast tissue. Simultaneously, in the face of DNA damage, which might cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in wild type cells, BRCA1 heterozygotes are crippled in their ability to inhibit ER-associated growth stimulation, resulting in mutations. To this end we have treated two nontumorigenic, breast epithelial cell lines, one BRCA1 heterozygote (185del AG) and another wild type, with physiologically relevant doses of estradiol.  Following treatment with 10 and 50 nm estradiol, dichlorfluorescein fluorescence increases similarly in both cell lines, corresponding to a 20-40% transient increase in oxidative stress. Estradiol and  hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) increased the level of lipid peroxides and 8oxoG, an oxidative DNA adduct. The mutation frequency at the HPRT locus was determined following oxidative stress.  Estradiol induced a 2 and 3.7-fold increase in HPRT mutations in wildtype and heterozygous cells. Severe oxidative stress induced by H2O2 did not alter the mutation frequency of wildtype cells but increased it 6-fold in heterozygous cells.  Immunoprecipitation revealed that heterozygotes have less protein than wildtype cells both in the presence and absence of oxidative stress, but both cell lines increased levels of protein following oxidative stress. A proliferation assay demonstrated that while wildtype cells show a transient increase in cell number, growth of heterozygous cells is unaltered following exposure to estradiol.  Cell cycle analyses of estradiol-treated wildtype cells revealed increased transit through G0/G1 into S phase in response to estradiol and a G2-M arrest following exposure to HP.  Both responses were absent in heterozygotes. In multiple cellular and mutagenic assays, BRCA1 heterozygotes display an altered phenotype relative to wildtype cells, consistent with the definition of haploinsufficiency.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4215], "author_name_tesi": "Maneval, Mandy Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Maneval", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Mandy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kristin Ann Eckert", "Diane Thibotout", "Neil David Christensen", "Janette Marie Mcallister"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Chair", "Diane Thibotout, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Janette Marie Mcallister, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["BRCA1", "oxidative stress", "ROS", "breast cancer", "microsatellite instability", "estrogen", "haploinsufficiency"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Reliable Design Flow for Platform FPGAs.", "id": "10497", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5015", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Aggressive technology scaling over the years has led to increased levels of integration and heterogeneity in the design fabric of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Platform FPGAs today have evolved from mere prototyping devices to powerful domain-specific reconfigurable processors. Traditionally FPGA design flows have been designed to optimize the resulting design for area, performance, and power consumption. Such deterministic optimization techniques are oblivious to the changes in the device characteristics due to variations during the manufacturing process and their subsequent degradation in time due to various operational stress phenomenon. Additionally, as the device feature sizes shrink the impact of operation conditions such as temperature and supply voltage on the lifetime degradation of components increases exponentially. Consequently, the resulting designs are sub-optimal in performance and result in a low mean time to failure MTTF of the target FPGA platform. In this work we address the impact of various aging based failure mechanisms, and process variations on the reliability, performance, and power consumption of the resulting design. We present a tool flow that models the device degradation characteristics and incorporates heuristics based on such an analysis into various key stages of the FPGA design flow. We also studied the impact of process variations on various routing elements\nof an FPGA and developed a statistically intelligent routing algorithm SIRA to improve the timing and power yields of the target design.

In order to manufacture such flexible matrix composites of reduced size and thickness (sub-millimeter), traditional continuous fiber composite manufacturing methods are not suitable. Therefore, the objective of the current investigation is to develop a manufacturing method for laminated carbon nanofiber (CNF) reinforced elastomer composites that demonstrate stress-strain behavior similar to laminated continuous fiber composites. The scope of the work includes: (i) the development and refinement of an extrusion-based CNF alignment procedure for sub-millimeter films that is compatible with the short pot life and high viscosity of polyurethane (PU) matrices; (ii) development of a lamination procedure for thin CNF/PU composites; and (iii) testing and analysis of the CNF/PU laminates to demonstrate that the material follows classical laminated plate theory. To-date, there is no published literature on laminated CNF reinforced flexible composites, making the current investigation the first of its kind.\nTheoretical predictions suggest that the ratio of longitudinal to transverse modulus of elasticity of the aligned CNF/PU composite with 10.5% CNFs by volume should be 22. However, the experimental modulus ratio was only in the range of 2.5 to 3.5. The greatest increase in the elastic modulus of the material in the alignment direction was a factor of 19 versus the unreinforced matrix for the case of functionalized CNFs, which is less than the ideal factor of 28 predicted by theory. Both of these results indicate imperfect alignment or bonding of the CNFs in the PU matrix. Once the elastic properties of the as-extruded material were characterized, good agreement with classical lamination theory was obtained for a variety of laminates with different CNF orientations.

Brain damage that results from stroke tends to be predominantly unilateral, due to the hemisphere specificity of cerebral circulation. While a great deal of research has focused on understanding the deficits in the contralateral limbs, very little attention has been given to the fact that the hemispheres are not functionally symmetric for sensorimotor processing. Sainburg et al have previously shown that each hemisphere contributes specific mechanisms to the control of both the arms: the left hemisphere for control of movement trajectory, and the right hemisphere for stabilizing the limb in a steady state position. We propose that each hemisphere imparts its specialized control processes to each arm. A clear prediction of this hypothesis is that damage to the right or left hemisphere due to stroke, should produce hemisphere specific deficits in both the ipsilesional and contralesional arms of stroke patients. In a series of three experiments, we tested whether 1) the contralesional arm motor deficits produced by unilateral stroke patients vary based on the hemisphere of damage and severity of impairment, 2) damage to one hemisphere produces hemisphere-specific motor adaptation deficits in both the arms of the stroke patients and 3) Spontaneous arm selection for reaching tasks are dependent on the hemisphere that is damaged. Our results support our hypothesis that left and right hemisphere damage produces hemisphere-specific deficits in motor control that affect motor adaptation in both the ipsilesional and contralesional arms of stroke patients: While\nleft hemisphere damage produces significantly higher initial direction errors and hand\npath curvatures (trajectory measures), right hemisphere damage produces significantly higher distance and final position errors during reaching movements. In addition, mild to moderately paretic patients with right hemisphere damage preferred to use their contralesional arm significantly less than the respective arm of their age matched control group. In contrast, mild to moderately paretic patients with left hemisphere damage preferred to use their contralesional right arm to the same extent as the control group\u2019s preference to use their right arm.

Families of products that users physically interact with are considered in this thesis with the aim of maximizing the accommodation (a product which fits the users is said to ``accommodate' the user) afforded by these products. The multivariate statistical technique of PCA is employed to assess the anthropometric variability in the target user population. The usual methods of improving the accommodation of a product are: a) incorporating adjustability and b) scaling (offering different sizes). Different sizes can be considered a product family. Among the various components in  the products of the family, some will be similar and others will be distinct. The manufacturing costs can be reduced, and the profits can be increased, if the commonality and distinctiveness are optimized such that accommodation is maximized. Since the products are intended for human use, accommodation will be governed by human variability, particularly anthropometry.

They are also fascinating structures because in some cases they posses unique properties arising from the preferential arrangement of the polymer chains parallel to the fibers axes. Challenges that synthesis techniques for polymer nanofibers face are scalability and control during fabrication. An alternate to current common approaches such as electrospinning and templated-synthesis of polymer nanofibers, is template-less synthesis of polymer nanofibers during polymerization. This approach offers the advantage of bottom-up fabrication and the potential for large scale synthesis. Herein results from an investigation using this approach for poly (ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate) [PECA] nanofiber formation are reported. \nThe template-less growth of PECA nanofibers is first demonstrated using the initiators present in human fingerprint residue via vapor phase polymerization of the monomer under conditions of high humidity. Studies showed that anionic initiators like the Cl- ion present in fingerprint residues is responsible for fiber formation whereas other anions such as OH- results in the formation of a polymer film under the same conditions of polymerization. Insights into individual initiator effects reveal a classification of the initiators to explain the basis for the morphology of the polymer obtained (1D fiber or 2D film). The classification based on the Hard Soft Acid Base principle implies that for faster initiation (achieved by harder anions) a polymer film is obtained versus polymer nanofibers that are obtained for slower initiation (achieved by softer anions). This suggests that for faster initiation two dimensional growth of the polymer occurs versus one dimensional growth for slower initiation rates leading to fiber formation.\nThis technique is also extended to demonstrate growth of PECA nanofibers on silane-modified glass slides with varying fiber densities depending upon ECA (monomer) wettability of the glass surface. These results showcase the ability of control over placement of the fibers using this template-less synthesis approach.\nFinally two examples of exercising control during synthesis of polymer nanofibers are provided. In the first case by controlling conditions during polymerization, termination steps are varied to create polymer nanofibers with different molecular weights. In the second case, random copolymer nanofibers of ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate and methyl 2-cyanoacrylate are formed by introducing both monomers simultaneously during nanofiber synthesis.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4876], "author_name_tesi": "Mankidy, Pratik ", "last_name_ssi": "Mankidy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pratik", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janna Kay Maranas", "Carlo G Pantano", "Henry Foley", "Andrew Zydney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member", "Henry Foley, Committee Chair", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer nanofibers"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Modeling Of Hydrogen And Hydride Formation In Zirconium Alloy Cladding Using High-fidelity Multi-physics Coupled Codes", "id": "27414", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12123", "abstract_tesi": "The reactor environment, in which nuclear fuel operates, requires improved multi-dimensional fuel and cladding simulation and analysis to accurately describe fuel behavior. The high-fidelity fuel performance code BISON was developed at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to address this need. BISON is a three-dimensional finite-element based fuel performance code. In the high temperature environment of a reactor, the zirconium in the cladding undergoes waterside corrosion, releasing hydrogen in the process. Some of this hydrogen is absorbed by the cladding. Once hydrogen is absorbed in the cladding, its distribution is extremely sensitive to temperature, stress, and concentration gradients. Hydrogen migrates down temperature and concentration gradients and at a high enough concentration, precipitates as hydrides which can embrittle the cladding. \n\nHydrogen distribution as a hydride precipitate in cladding has been identified as a possible ersatz for validating reactor simulation code temperature models. This thesis shows development efforts of using high-fidelity multi-physics codes to model temperature, hydrogen, and hydride distribution. Several multi-physics code couplings were used to model pressurized water reactor sub-assemblies. The first was the Penn State University (PSU) developed DeCART-CTF coupling. This thesis outlines a demonstration of this coupling\u2019s ability to predict hydrogen distribution in the two dimensional radial (r, \u03b8) direction. The Consortium for the Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors coupled multi-physics code, Tiamat, was used to model a select sub-assembly with spacer grids. A section of a single fuel pin was then selected from this sub-assembly and modeled in a three-dimensional BISON problem to obtain three-dimensional hydrogen and hydride distributions at selected areas around spacer grids. The hydrogen and hydride model showed results and behavior that accurately produced the expected physics of hydrogen and hydrides in all three dimensions. The hydrogen model is under continuing development at PSU and INL.\n\nThis thesis also presents a code-to-code comparison between CTF, BISON, and FRAPCON to compare the ability of CTF to predict fuel pin temperatures. The evaluations between the codes show good agreement on fuel pin temperature distribution. If CTF is well informed by BISON or FRAPCON with gap conductance, burnup, and radial power profile values, then CTF will accurately reproduce fuel temperatures. The largest difference reported in fuel centerline temperature between CTF and FRAPCON was 6.78 degrees Kelvin or 0.49%. The largest centerline difference between CTF and BISON was 4.39 degrees Kelvin or 0.30%. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11533], "author_name_tesi": "Mankosa, Michael Garan", "last_name_ssi": "Mankosa", "middle_name_ssi": "Garan", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydrogen", "Hydride", "Multi-Physics", "CTF", "BISON", "Tiamat"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Pneumonia Dynamics In Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis)", "id": "13219krm17", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13219", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Infectious pneumonia poses a major challenge toward bighorn sheep restoration efforts throughout the western United States.

Furthermore, nursery groups remain approximately the same size, even as population sizes decline. This provides a behavioral mechanism for frequency-dependent-like transmission, which could eventually drive bighorn sheep extinct.

Specifically, it examined the demographic composition of school districts most likely to lose students to cyber charter schools and how this composition changes over time, the prevalence of a school district response to create a full-time online school, and the effectiveness of this response in recovering student enrollment. The methods used in the study were mainly quantitative (ordinary least squares regression, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazard modeling). Qualitative supplements (interviews of school district administrators) informed patterns seen in the quantitative data.\n\nThree major findings emerged from this study. First, no demographic pattern existed in the districts that lost the most students to cyber charter schools early in the cyber charter movement. Over time, as the reputation of cyber charter school quality skewed negative, disadvantaged districts\u2014particularly those with low levels of education and low statewide test scores\u2014were most likely to experience continually increasing enrollment losses to cyber charter schools. These students overwhelmingly moved into programs with lower academic growth rates compared to the traditional public schools that the students left. Second, based on a random sample of school districts, the majority of school districts in Pennsylvania (more than 80%) created an in-district, full-time online learning option during the cyber charter school movement. The first adoption of school district online programs is explained both by market and institutional patterns. Third, analysis in the trends of choosers before and after a school district created an in-district online program showed that the district\u2019s strategy tended not to decrease enrollment losses to cyber charter schools.\n\nThere are a number of possible implications of these findings. For example, when a new educational reform or program is perceived as an inadequate option in a choice-based system, findings here suggest that advantaged populations will first refuse it and perpetuate their advantage. Additionally, higher student enrollment losses and increased institutional pressures both relate to district adoption of a new online school. Further, since students can leave regardless of whether a district provides the same online options as cyber charters, there exists online learning program redundancy. These trends have placed Pennsylvania in a situation where districts lose millions of dollars per year to cyber charter schools while unsuccessfully recovering student enrollment. The dissertation concludes with leadership and policy recommendations related to these implications.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13827], "author_name_tesi": "Mann, Bryan Arthur", "last_name_ssi": "Mann", "middle_name_ssi": "Arthur", "first_name_ssi": "Bryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Baker", "David Baker", "David Gamson", "Ed Fuller", "Kyle Peck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Baker, Dissertation Advisor", "David Baker, Committee Chair", "David Gamson, Committee Member", "Ed Fuller, Committee Member", "Kyle Peck, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["education policy", "school choice", "charter schools", "cyber charter schools", "K-12 online learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "TOLL LIKE RECEPTOR 4 MEDIATED HOST DEFENSE DURING BORDETELLA INFECTION\n\n\n", "id": "6665", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4859", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The bordetellae are facultative gram negative bacteria that cause respiratory infections in birds, mammals, and humans. The genus includes B. pertussis and B. parapertussis the etiologic agents of whooping cough, a severe acute respiratory disease, in humans. B. bronchiseptica infects a wide range of animals and normally causes asymptomatic chronic infection. These three organisms have recently been reclassified as subspecies and the two human pathogens have evolved separately from a B. bronchiseptica like progenitor. Studies in immunity to the Bordetella have focused on the protective aspects of adaptive immunity against B. pertussis that are associated with clearance of the bacteria from the host and protection from re-infection. The role of innate immunity, the process that controls infection during the first few days after exposure has not been investigated. In these studies we examined the role of Toll like Receptor 4 (TLR4), a mammalian innate immune receptor that detects lipopolysacharide (LPS), a major outer-membrane component of gram negative bacteria. Using mice defective in TLR4, we show that TLR4 is critical for innate host defense against B. bronchiseptica but not B. pertussis or B. parapertussis. Gene expression studies using cells derived from wild type and TLR4 defective mice show that TLR4 regulates early elicited Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFa) expression upon infection with B. bronchiseptica. Depletion of TNFa in wild type mice during the first six hours of infection recapitulates the TLR4 defective phenotype, in that these mice are unable to limit bacterial growth and succumb from severe pneumonia. Using defined virulence factor mutants of B. bronchiseptica we were able to determine that TLR4 and TNFa are required to limit the effects of the Bordetella Type Three Secretion System (TTSS)  by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production that is associated with increased bacterial numbers in the lungs. Lastly, B. pertussis and B. parapertussis, which do not express a functional TTSS, have modified their LPS to be significantly less stimulatory of human TLR4, and thus have apparently altered the balance of host-pathogen interactions, potentially facilitating adaptation to humans.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4835, 4836], "author_name_tesi": "Mann, Paul B", "last_name_ssi": "Mann", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill", "Mary J Kennett", "Avery August", "Michael Pishko", "Baio He"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Chair", "Mary J Kennett, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Michael Pishko, Committee Member", "Baio He, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microbiology Immunology Pathology Infection"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Investigation of the Role of Nonstructural 4B Protein in Hepatitis C Virus Replication Complex Formation and Infectious Virus Production\n", "id": "12560", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1528", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) NS4B protein is one of the least understood viral proteins in terms of contributions to the virus lifecycle. NS4B has many functions related to formation and function of the viral genome replication complex (RC), most notably for its role in inducing a novel membrane structure termed the membranous web which\nhouses the RC. The membranous web is largely believed to be derived from ER membranes, and recent data has also suggested membranes from the early endosome (EE) compartment are part of this membrane structure. This was due to the observation that Rab5, a regulator of EE membrane transport, was required for HCV RNA replication\nand that Rab5 co-localizes with NS4B foci in replicon cells. NS4B foci are considered to\nbe an immunofluorescence marker equivalent to the membranous web. Recent data has also implicated a new role for the C-terminal domain (CTD) of NS4B in facilitating infectious virus production. Both point mutations and entire CTD sequence swaps\nbetween different genotype viruses have highlighted this new and exciting role for NS4B\nin virus production. To test the hypothesis that cellular Rabs are involved in NS4B-mediated HCV RC\nformation, we employed two main methods. First, we modified an existing protocol for NS4B antibody directed immunoisolation of a subcellular fraction enriched in the HCV RC components, and used this fraction for immunoblot analysis. Secondly, we examined Rab co-localization with NS4B foci in replicon cells to compare to the profile in the isolated RC fraction, which was competent for HCV RNA synthesis. Rabs from every cellular compartment tested were present at different levels in the isolated RC fraction, but only the endocytic Rab5 and 7 were found to co-localize with NS4B foci. Dominant negative mutants of Rab5 and 7 disrupt NS4B foci, and silencing of Rab5 or 7 resulted in\na significant decrease in HCV RNA replication. Taken together, our data implicate endocytic Rabs as being important for NS4B-mediated HCV RC formation. To test the hypothesis that the NS4B CTD is involved in virus assembly, we created chimeric virus genomes where the NS4B CTD from JFH1 virus (genotype 2a, gt2a) was replaced with sequences from Con1 (gt1b) or H77 (gt1a) virus. These chimeric genomes had little impact on RNA replication, but showed a significant defect in virus production, likely at the level of virus assembly. Investigation into the causes of lower\nvirus titers showed that the chimeric viruses have lower NS5A protein levels and a decrease in the NS5A p58/p56 ratio relative to JFH1. Cell culture adapted viruses were generated that had similar titer levels to that of JFH1, showed higher levels of NS5A protein, but interestingly did not change in their NS5A p58/p56 ratio relative to JFH1. Sequencing of the adapted viruses revealed four mutations, two in the chimeric NS4B CTD region, one in domain III of NS5A and one adjacent to the cytosolic loop of the p7 protein. Introduction of these mutations back into the parental chimeric viruses rescued\nvirus production, highlighting a genetic interaction between NS4B, NS5A and p7 proteins. These studies illuminate a role for the NS4B CTD in virus production, possibly through interaction or modification of other HCV proteins.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1513], "author_name_tesi": "Manna, David P", "last_name_ssi": "Manna", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kouacou Konan", "Kouacou Konan", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Avery August", "Joseph C.

Presence and expansion of these plants are closely associated with human-caused disturbances.  Conservation biologists have proposed land preservation as a method to limit the spread of exotic plants.  However, despite the removal of human disturbance effects, natural disturbances will continue to affect forests.  I sought to determine how natural disturbance events would affect the susceptibility of eastern deciduous forests to invasion on preserved lands by investigating two questions:\nQuestion 1: In preserved forests, do natural disturbance events facilitate exotic species invasion?  I measured plots with forest canopy disturbances from the 2012 severe storms to quantify the resulting change in species richness and cover. I hypothesized that canopy disturbance and exotic plant expansion were positively correlated.\nQuestion 2: After a natural disturbance event does proximity to edge habitat (e.g., roads, fields, recent logging, and developments) increase the abundance of exotic plants in preserved forests? To address this question, I studied the interaction between plot proximity to edge habitat and plant species composition for disturbed and undisturbed areas.  I hypothesized that canopy gaps with more adjacent edge habitats would have greater exotic plant cover and a proportionally greater increase in these plants correlating to the amount of edge.\nPre and post-disturbance data from the National Park Service Eastern Rivers and Mountains Network\u2019s long-term vegetation monitoring protocol were used to analyze exotic plant richness and abundance in four National Park Service units affected by severe storms in 2012.  Plots damaged by these disturbance events had decreases in live basal area and increases in coarse woody debris compared to undisturbed plots.  \nThere was no significant difference in exotic plant richness or cover between the disturbed and undisturbed plots in the first three years following the disturbance. Overall, average cover of exotic plants decreased, though not significantly, following the disturbance.  Average exotic plant cover was positively correlated with the amount of nearby linear edge habitat prior to the disturbance events, but there were no significant correlations between linear edge and the change in exotic plant cover following the disturbance events.\nThese findings indicate that preserved forests show resistance to exotic plant recruitment and expansion following disturbance in the short-term.  This has important implications for the future of preserved lands as natural disturbances will be a factor in perpetuity.  Land managers may use these finding to justify preserving land or to inform how they respond to natural disturbance events.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14069], "author_name_tesi": "Manning, Douglas Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Manning", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margot Wilkinson Kaye", "Durland Laurence Shumway", "David A Mortensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margot Wilkinson Kaye, Thesis Advisor", "Durland Laurence Shumway, Committee Member", "David A Mortensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Disturbance", "Forest Dynamics", "Invasives", "Invasive species", "Invasive plants", "Preserved lands", "Windthrow", "Understory vegetation", "Natural disturbance"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Evolution of stress and microstructure in Si-doped aluminum gallium nitride thin films\n\n\n", "id": "11647", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2428", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N thin films are foreseen to be of central importance to photoemitters and detectors operating within the ultraviolet spectral range, due to the range of achievable bandgap energies spanned by the endpoint values corresponding to GaN and AlN. Such devices are typically based on the formation of junctions between layers of a given semiconductor that have been doped n- and p-type. The dopant that is most commonly used to obtain n-type conductivity in Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N is Si. However, the incorporation of Si has been found to reduce the critical thickness for crack formation through the generation of tensile stress.\n\tThe present work examines the effects of the Si incorporation on the stress evolution of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N thin films deposited using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. Specifically, tensile stress generation was evaluated using an in situ wafer curvature measurement technique, and correlated with the inclination of edge-type threading dislocations observed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This microstructural process had been theorized to relax compressive strain with increasing film thickness by expanding the missing plane of atoms associated with the dislocations. Prior work regarded dislocation bending as being the result of an effective climb mechanism.\n\tIn a preliminary investigation, the accuracy of the model derived to quantify the strain induced by dislocation inclination was tested. The relevant parameters were measured to calculate a theoretical stress gradient, which was compared with the gradient as extract from experimental stress data. The predicted value was found to overestimate the measured value. It was also confirmed during the preliminary investigation that Si incorporation alone was sufficient to initiate dislocation bending.\n\tThe overestimation of the stress gradient yielded by the prediction of the model was then addressed by exploring the effects of dislocation annihilation and fusion reactions occurring during film growth. Si-doped Al<sub>0.42</sub>Ga<sub>0.58</sub>N layers exhibiting inclined threading dislocations were grown to different thicknesses. The dislocation density at the surface of each sample was then measured using plan-view TEM, and was found to be inversely proportional to the thickness. As the original model assumed a constant dislocation density, applying the correction for its reduction yielded a better prediction of the stress evolution.\n\tIn an attempt to extend the predictive capabilities of the model beyond the single composition examined above, and to better understand the interaction of Si with the host Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N lattice, several sets of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N films were grown, each with a unique composition. The Si-doping level was varied within each set. It was determined that the dominant influence on tensile strain generation is in fact the initial dislocation density, which increased with increasing Al content as observed with plan-view TEM. This was expounded in a series of modeling examples. In addition, threading dislocation inclination was studied in nominally undoped and Si-doped Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N grown under conditions of tensile stress to isolate the influence of Si from that of compressive stress, which had also been found to induce dislocation bending. The effects due to Si and compressive stress were found not to combine as expected, based on a stochastic model of dislocation jog formation that had been developed in prior work to describe the inclination mechanism.\n\tHaving confirmed the strong, direct relationship between the initial dislocation density and the degree of tensile stress generated in the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N epilayers during growth, an effort was made to demonstrate the advantage that might be gained by using AlN substrates rather than SiC. In principle, AlN provides a growth surface that inhibits defect formation due to its close similarity to Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N lattice structure and chemistry, particularly at high Al mole fractions. Threading dislocation densities were reduced by an order of magnitude in comparison with samples grown on SiC, with a corresponding reduction in the stress gradient arising from dislocation inclination.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2412], "author_name_tesi": "Manning, Ian ", "last_name_ssi": "Manning", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Professor Christopher Muhlstein", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "David Snyder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Chair", "Professor Christopher Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "David Snyder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["OMVPE", "wide bandgap semiconductors", "doping", "strain", "stress", "thin films", "MOCVD", "AlGaN"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Stand Level Models for Estimating Sawtimber Growth and Yield in Pennsylvania\n\n", "id": "9784", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4900", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Effectively managing Pennsylvania\u2019s forests requires accurate projections of future sawtimber yields.  Stand-level models to predict net and gross sawtimber volume per acre were developed for Pennsylvania as part of an ongoing forest management planning project for Pennsylvania\u2019s 2.1 million acres of state forest land.  The resulting equations were developed using the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) Bureau of Forestry\u2019s continuous forest inventory plots.  These equations are intended for projecting forest yields across Pennsylvania\u2019s diverse landscape consisting of different forest types, site classes, stocking levels, and ecological regions.  Three models were developed and analyzed, including linear and nonlinear stand-level yield models with age as the main predictor variable and an annual sawtimber basal area growth model that estimates annual sawtimber basal area growth based on initial stand conditions.  Procedures, assumptions, consistency of estimates, and applications of each model, along with parameter estimates and goodness of fit statistics, are discussed for each model.  The linear model results were consistent with the current model used to predict future sawtimber yields in Pennsylvania.  The nonlinear model proved to be more appropriate for projecting future yields than the linear model because it allowed for more flexible modeling of stand growth characteristics such as annual and mean annual increment.  Including sawtimber basal area as a predictor in the nonlinear model substantially reduced the variability in growth and yield estimates compared to the other models.  However, using this approach requires a model to project stand basal area development over time.  Two such models were developed based on different modeling approaches: 1) a compatible model (Sullivan and Clutter 1972) and 2) an annual model.  The annual model performed somewhat better than the compatible model.  As more stand level information becomes available, the nonlinear model with age and sawtimber basal area as predictors can be used to provide better future yield estimates for planning purposes.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4877], "author_name_tesi": "Manning, Phillip John", "last_name_ssi": "Manning", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Phillip", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marc Eric Mcdill", "Marc Eric Mcdill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marc Eric Mcdill, Thesis Advisor", "Marc Eric Mcdill, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["forest management", "growth and yield", "regression"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Healthcare Facility Acquisition Outcomes: The Relationship of Delivery, Procurement, and Contracting To Cost and Schedule Performance", "id": "23547", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10466", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Healthcare facilities are a unique market sector in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) Industry.

One of the ways schools have risen to meet the challenge of ever-increasing demands for success in science and all other curricular areas has been in the development of professional development schools (PDSs).  Dedicated to the simultaneous renewal of schools and teacher education programs, the structure of a PDS plays a significant role in the change process.\nThe purpose of this research study was to investigate the nature of change in mentor teachers' beliefs and pedagogical practices toward science teaching in the elementary school as conveyed through their own \"stories of practice\u201d.  The major research questions that guided the study were:\n1)\tHow do mentor teachers describe their science teaching practices and how have they changed as a result of participation in PDS?\n\na.\tIn what ways do PDS mentor teachers\u2019 descriptions of practice reflect contemporary reform ideas and practices in science education?\n\nb.\tTo what extent do their stories emphasize technical aspects of teaching versus epistemological changes in their thinking and knowledge?\n\nc.\tHow is student learning in science reflected in teachers\u2019 stories of practice?\n\n2)\tWhat is the relationship between the levels and types of involvement in PDS to change in thinking about and practices of teaching science?\n\n3)\tWhat is the depth of commitment that mentors convey about changes in science teaching practices?\n\n\nUsing case study design, the research explored the ways experienced teachers, working within the context of a PDS community, described changes in the ways they think about and teach science.  The connection to the issue of change in teaching practices grew out of interest in understanding the relationship between mentor teachers\u2019 engagement in PDS activities and their thinking about classroom practice.  \nThe main focus of this research study was on change in science teaching within the context of a professional development school.  PDS literature and current literature on the learning and teaching of science in grades K-8 provided a theoretical orientation to guide the research.  Additionally, literature on the process of change in schools helped to narrow the focus of the study while using a lens of situated learning provided additional insight. \nAnalysis of the interview data generated seven assertions that captured the nature of the change process of mentor teachers.  Science-specific professional development as well as strong support and encouragement within an active community of learners played significant roles in the transformation of mentor teachers from traditional or activity-based science teachers into educators who use reform-oriented methods and a lens of evidence and explanation to guide their science teaching.  Mentor teachers acknowledged an increase in student interest and excitement toward science as a result of these changes in science teaching practices.  In addition, data revealed that mentor teachers remained committed to their changed practice after several years.  By examining the change process of mentor teachers in a PDS environment, findings from this study are discussed based on implications regarding the factors that contribute to and affect change as reform-oriented practices are implemented in science, a curricular area that is often neglected by elementary teachers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2505], "author_name_tesi": "Manno, Jacqueline Lilja", "last_name_ssi": "Manno", "middle_name_ssi": "Lilja", "first_name_ssi": "Jacqueline", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carla Zembal Saul", "Carla Zembal Saul", "Bernard Joel Badiali", "Scott P Mcdonald", "Susan Mary Land", "Susan Courson, Ph D"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carla Zembal Saul, Dissertation Advisor", "Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Chair", "Bernard Joel Badiali, Committee Chair", "Scott P Mcdonald, Committee Member", "Susan Mary Land, Committee Member", "Susan Courson, Ph D, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Science education", "professional development school", "science teaching"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Identity and Activism in Twentieth-century and Contemporary American Women\u2019s Memoirs", "id": "23828", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10930", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tIn Identity and Activism I argue that women\u2019s literary memoirs have come to occupy a public role that goes beyond examining and representing the idea of a self. In the wake of second-wave feminism, a significant faction of memoirists intervenes in the debates sparked by gender equality movements. Using the work of theorists Sidonie Smith, Julie Rak, Gillian Whitlock, and Leigh Gilmore, I study texts published in recent decades, along with memoirs from earlier in the twentieth century that established themes like religion, sustainability, health, as topics of concern for women writers. In addition to prose memoirs, I study graphic memoirs, digital life writing sites, and online storytelling projects. These media represent the perspectives of writers who see personal narrative as an opportunity to speak publicly, but who have not composed or published a book-length memoir. Considering these instances of life writing outside of the mainstream publishing industry widens the field of literary studies to include texts produced by a different community of writers and for a different reading public.\n\tEach of the five chapters in this dissertation studies a cluster of texts linked by a similar theme or interest. Chapter one examines American women\u2019s memoirs of the expatriate literary community in Paris during the 1920s. These authors experiment with memoir as a public document and pursue goals other than disclosing personal experience or private observations. Chapter two examines women\u2019s memoirs of living and working in rural environments. Rather than essentializing women\u2019s relationship to the environment, these memoirs envision an ecofeminism based on alternatives to urban gender roles and capitalist ambitions. Chapter three connects the memoir genre to the academic discipline of narrative medicine, which bases diagnoses and treatments on the stories patients tell. Graphic and prose memoirs by Ellen Forney and Kay Redfield Jamison explore the links between manic depression, identity, and creativity, and call into question the usefulness of understanding identity as fragmented. Chapter four examines spiritual autobiographies and argues that the memoir genre is linked to religious themes and religious habits of thought such as confession and conversion. Chapter five examines the personal narratives that men and women write for two sites, \u201cMy Duty to Speak\u201d and the \u201cAfghan Women\u2019s Writing Project,\u201d both projects that have contributed to changes in ideology and tangible reforms for gender equality. These projects are dynamic venues for telling stories that constantly develop and evolve, and reflect the ways personal narratives play a role in digital culture.\n\tThis research demonstrates that a belief that individual stories have persuasive power and currency in social debates has propelled the \u201cmemoir boom\u201d between 1990 and 2010 in North America, and explains why autobiographical narratives continue to proliferate. Memoirs are a form of public discourse shaped by particular historical moments and rhetorical situations, and are a form of feminist rhetoric. I conclude that women\u2019s memoirs rearticulate and reconsider the projects of second-wave feminism and intervene in cultural discourses about gender.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10517], "author_name_tesi": "Mannon, Bethany Ober", "last_name_ssi": "Mannon", "middle_name_ssi": "Ober", "first_name_ssi": "Bethany", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James L W West Iii", "James L W West Iii", "Cheryl Jean Glenn", "Sandra Spanier", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James L W West Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "James L W West Iii, Committee Chair", "Cheryl Jean Glenn, Committee Member", "Sandra Spanier, Committee Member", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Memoir", "Women's Writing", "Feminism", "Digital Rhetoric", "Life Writing", "Comics", "Religion", "Sustainability", "Neuroscience", "Activism"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Reading the Earth Workers: The Georgic Mode in Twentieth-century American Literature and Writing", "id": "22358", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10113", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project aims to interweave three threads of discourse\u2014literary studies, agriculture (or agricultural ecology), and ecocriticism\u2014in order to address the critical neglect of georgic spaces and authors by exploring (predominantly agricultural) work and labor in twentieth-century American writing. Although Virgil\u2019s Eclogues and the pastoral mode it helped create are more familiar and have attracted far more scholarly attention, this dissertation will argue that the georgic mode\u2014and its fountainhead, Virgil\u2019s Georgics\u2014functioned as a vital touchstone for a range of twentieth-century writers. After differentiating the pastoral and georgic modes and establishing the importance of agriculture to several formative environmentalist thinkers, this study takes up its main subjects. The authors of twentieth-century georgics selected for Reading the Earth Workers include canonical figures who cloaked their georgic materials with mantels of pastoralism (Robert Frost and, to a lesser degree, Willa Cather) as well as writers whose blatant focus on agriculture has contributed to their marginalization (Louis Bromfield and Wendell Berry). In an effort to outline the full spectrum of georgic materials generated in the twentieth century, this study ignores the boundaries put in place by genre. That is, Reading the Earth Workers acknowledges that the work of georgic writers includes poetry, fiction, and nonfiction. Finally, this dissertation also challenges anthropocentrism by embracing the importance of nonhuman animals to agriculture, the Georgics, and the georgic mode; thus, the final two chapters collect and analyze the discourse regarding two species of laboring animals\u2014namely, the honey bee and the draft horse.

Such size effects arise from dimensional and microstructural constraints, especially when specimen size coincides with the critical fundamental length scales for various physical properties. While the state of the art practice is to investigate the size effects on \u2018individual\u2019 properties (mechanical or electrical or thermal and so on), the focus of this research is to explore the size effects on the \u2018coupling\u2019 among these domains. In particular, the effect of mechanical strain on various physical properties of materials at the nanoscale is studied. This is motivated by the hypothesis that very small elastic strain could be engineered in micro and nanoscale systems to \u2018tune\u2019 materials properties, which is not possible at the bulk scale using strain as a parameter. \n\nThe objective of this research is to study the influence of strain on various material properties at the nanoscale, such as crystal structure, thermal and electrical conductivity, electronic bandgap and tribological properties through experimental characterization. While characterization of nanoscale materials in single domains remains the state of the art, coupled domain studies usher even stiffer challenges. This is because in addition to the difficulties in nanoscale specimen preparation, handling and properties measurement, meticulous attention has to be given to the boundary conditions for each of the domains. Another desired feature of the experimental setup is the capability for in situ high resolution microscopy so that microstructural details as well as experimental accuracy are achieved. A major contribution of this research is the development of microfabricated integrated systems to perform coupled domain characterization of small scale specimens in situ in thermal (infra-red), micro-Raman and electron microscopes. In addition, conceptual modeling based on the experimental characterization was developed to explain the observed phenomena on the basis of existing nanoscale materials theories, or if none exist, suitable scientific hypothesis were proposed. The salient contributions of this research are summarized below.\n\na) Uniaxial tensile testing was performed on 4 - 6 nm thick amorphous carbon thin film specimens in situ in a scanning electron microscope. The study revealed size effect on the Young\u2019s modulus, which is traditionally a scale independent property. The size effect is explained on the basis of the increased contribution of surface elastic properties (surface stress) at the nanometer length-scale.\n\nb) Significant stress-induced crystallization was observed in about 5 nm thick ion beam deposited amorphous platinum thin films. At 3 % tensile strain, electron diffraction patterns clearly show irreversible transformation to face-centered cubic (FCC) structure even at room temperature. It is proposed that the externally applied stress, in addition to the large tensile residual stress in the films provided the activation energy needed to nucleate crystallization, while subsequent grain growth occurred through enhanced atomic and vacancy diffusion as an energetically favorable route towards stress relaxation at the nanoscale.\n\nc)While it is widely accepted that amorphous materials do not exhibit any size or deformation effects on thermal conductivity, about one order of magnitude reduction in conductivity was experimentally observed at strains of up to 2.4 % for 50 nm thick freestanding amorphous silicon nitride thin films. To explain this unusually strong strain\u2013thermal transport coupling, it is proposed that in silicon nitride, vibration localization due to very strong Si-N bonds decreases hopping mode thermal transport.\n\nd) The friction coefficient between individual zinc oxide nanowires and silicon substrate in ambient conditions was measured to be about two orders of magnitude higher than bulk values, even under zero externally applied normal loads. This anomalous behavior is explained by the compliant nature of the nanowires and the presence of molecularly thin surface moisture layers.\n\ne) Effect of strain on the electronic band gap of single zinc oxide nanowires was studied under a micro-Raman microscope by acquiring the photoluminescence spectra. The bandgap of the nanowires was found to reduce by 25 meV per 1 % of tensile strain applied. This red shift of the near-band-edge emission is largely due to the lowering of the conduction band edge instead of valence band edge.\n\nf) The thermal and electrical conductivity of polyaniline thin films was measured by the 3-omega method and four-point I-V method respectively. The conductivities were found to reduce with increasing tensile bending strains, due to the appearance of cracks in the film.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4486], "author_name_tesi": "Manoharan, Mohan Prasad ", "last_name_ssi": "Manoharan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mohan Prasad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque", "Aman Haque", "Alok Sinha", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Jun Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque, Dissertation Advisor", "Aman Haque, Committee Chair", "Alok Sinha, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member", "Jun Huang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanoscale", "multi domain coupling", "size effect", "thermal conductivity", "electrical conductivity", "bandgap", "crystallization"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DESIGN, SYNTHESES, AND PROPERTIES OF TUNABLE, DUAL-STIMULI (TEMPERATURE AND pH) RESPONSIVE COPOLYMERS\n\n", "id": "11091", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3685", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Stimuli responsive polymers are of great interest in biorelated applications ranging from actuators, microfluidics, delivery systems and tissue scaffolds. The specifications of an appropriate polymer system that shows a response to one or more external stimuli vary from application to application, depending on desired functionality. In most cases, the response to an environmental change is desired to be sharp and fast, such as for microfluidics and actuators, while the stability of the collapsed structure is also typically required, such as in tissue scaffolds and in stimulated delivery systems. In addition, the onset of the stimulus response varies depending on application. Thus, a general design strategy for polymer systems to meet specific applications\u2019 needs can be a big challenge. This dissertation describes the design, syntheses, and aqueous phase behavior of two polymer classes that show a sharp solution phase transition in different manners: The first polymer class is in the form of a segmented/blocky copolymer and its solution phase separation is designed to occur via micellization, while the second polymer class is designed as an alternating copolymer and it exhibits a first order LCST phase behavior.\nCopolymers of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA), poly(MMA-co-MAA)s, were prepared to have a segmental blocky comonomer distribution along the chain backbone, with sequences composed predominantly of MMA or MAA units. Turbidity (cloud point) measurements were employed to investigate the phase behavior of these copolymers in aqueous solution. The solutions showed sharp solubility transitions upon pH change, and the pH-onsets of the copolymers\u2019 transition showed a systematic dependence on the copolymers\u2019 MAA content and an almost-linear dependence on the polymer concentration. A strong hysteresis was observed when lowering versus increasing pH, indicating a stable collapsed structure. Dynamic light scattering demonstrated almost monodispersed polymer aggregates for each pH, rather than random/polydisperse structures. TEM images of the collapsed morphology showed polymer aggregates that included numerous small hydrophobic cores, demonstrating that the phase transition of these copolymers involved the formation of micelles with many hydrophobic clusters. Finally, these copolymers were used to prepare hollow microcapsules that provided an exceptional protection and a prolonged stability of an encapsulated matter at acidic conditions (pH 2) and a sharp and fast pH-triggered release at physiological conditions (pH 7). \nA second series of copolymers was synthesized to compose of ethylene glycol oligomers (EOm) connected in an alternating fashion with hydrophobic alkyls (EEn), (EOm-alt-EEn). Also, terpolymers were synthesized to compose of EOm connected in an alternating fashion with EEn and lysine ethyl ester (LyE), (EOm-alt-(EEn;LyE). Both copolymers and terpolymers demonstrated temperature responsive LCST phase behavior in aqueous solution, whose critical temperature is dictated by the thermodynamics of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. In addition, the terpolymers\u2019 LCST can be further tuned by tailoring the ratio of EEn to LyE yielding dual responsive, viz. temperature and pH responsive, polymers upon conversion of LyE to ionizable Lysine (Lys). These last polymers that included ionizable units showed a reversible temperature and pH sensitive phase transition, allowing for such polymers to exhibit a phase separation with both-or-either temperature increase and pH-decrease. The extended phase diagrams, collected from turbidity measurements and modulated differential scanning callorimetry (MDSC), showed that the phase diagram remained a genuine LCST binodal throughout the complete concentration range. In addition, 1H-NMR provided additional strong evidence that the phase transition proceeded without micelle formation. Finally, hydrogels were prepared from EOm-alt-EEn, which exhibited reversible swelling/deswelling during temperature cycling (albeit with strong kinetic signatures). These temperature responsive hydrogels may be used in biomedical applications such as a rate-controlled swelling device.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3665], "author_name_tesi": "Manokruang, Kiattikhun ", "last_name_ssi": "Manokruang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kiattikhun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Evangelos Manias", "Evangelos Manias", "Qing Wang", "Michael A Hicker", "Peter J Butler", "Gary Lynn Messing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Evangelos Manias, Dissertation Advisor", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Chair", "Qing Wang, Committee Member", "Michael A Hicker, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["alternating copolymers", "aqueous phase behavior", "phase diagram", "hydrogel", "stimuli responsive polymers", "polyurethane", "water soluble polymers", "Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST)", "microcapsules", "segmented block copolymers", "multicompartment micelles"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Fungi and mycotoxins in fresh and ensiled maize and the affects of agronomic practices, weather conditions and silage characteristics", "id": "6843", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3980", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Maize silage, which constitutes a significant portion of the cattle diet, can become contaminated by mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus, Alternaria, Fusarium and Penicillium and the presence of these toxins has been associated with serious herd health problems (226).

The majority of silage samples were contaminated by multiple mycotoxins simultaneously and only 4 of 120 samples appeared to be free of detectable levels of contamination.

Minerals and associated geochemical (isotopic and trace metal) signatures act as tools for geoscientists to decipher past processes that led to Earth\u2019s biogeochemical evolution. In this thesis, the geochemical signatures contained within calcite, gypsum and pyrite were characterized through a multidisciplinary approach involving genomics, field sampling, laboratory experiment and diagenetic modeling to understand the primary processes (abiotic and biotic) that led to specific geochemical signatures. These signatures are then interpreted as either biosignatures or as environmental indicators for the ancient Earth.\n\nChapter 2 focuses on the unusual calcite (CaCO3) inclusions precipitated intracellularly within giant bacteria called Achromatium, which have the potential to be used as biosignatures. Single-cell genomics were utilized to shed light on the bacteria\u2019s metabolisms and genetic machinery in forming intracellular calcite. Two potential functions were proposed for this unusual metabolism. First, calcite inclusions may have been deposited as ballasts to anchor the cells from being swept away by water flow. Second, intracellular calcite precipitation may be a novel way to generate free protons and ATP to sustain life. Limitations in current techniques hamper geochemical characterizations of the calcite inclusions; nonetheless, our progress in understanding Achromatium have paved the way for culture-based, omic or in silico modeling techniques that will be useful for interpreting specific signatures of microbial calcite.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we will travel deep into the subsurface to look for gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) minerals coated by slimes of sulfur-oxidizing microbes. The microbes consumed hydrogen sulfide to sulfate, imparting unique sulfur isotopic (\u03b434S) signatures in gypsum that are spatially recognizable at the cave room scale. Similar spatial isotopic patterns in subsurface systems may be utilized as biosignatures, subject to tighter constraints of physico-chemical diagenetic effects to gypsum deposits over million-year timescales.\n\nFrom Chapter 4 to 7, we will shift our attentions towards pyrite (FeS2) minerals. In Chapter 4, we will encounter submerged microbial \u201cropes\u201d containing abundant pyrite (and its mineral polymorph, marcasite) that are potentially analogous to microbial biofilms in the anoxic early Earth. Combined with morphological, trace metals and Fe isotopic (\u03b456Fe) analysis, we suggest that the FeS2 minerals were formed through both Fe-oxides in the bedrock as well as dissolved Fe from the water, with significant catalysis induced by microbial sulfur cycling. Biofilm-associated FeS2 minerals are clearly different from sedimentary FeS2 in terms of morphology, mineralogy, trace metal and Fe isotopic compositions, rendering them potentially useful as a biosignature. Additionally, their differences suggest that care must be taken to interpreting geochemical signatures from Precambrian pyrite, which has traditionally been based solely on sedimentary pyrite.\n\nIn Chapter 5 and 6, we will travel back to the laboratory and use defined experimental studies to constrain factors affecting the chemical signatures of pyrite. Chapter 5 is focused on molybdenum (Mo) content in pyrite as potential proxies for Mo content in ancient waters, with direct relevance towards testing the Mo scarcity hypothesis that impeded eukaryotic evolution during the Proterozoic. Experimental data show that the initial dissolved Mo concentrations are linearly correlated with Mo contents in pyrite. This relationship is validated for use in diagenetic pyrite under oxic to sub-oxic water column, but overestimates the Mo concentrations calculated from pyrite deposited under euxinic water columns. Correcting for these biases as much as possible, we determined that Proterozoic seawater had Mo concentrations between 1-50 nM and are typically higher than the 5 nM Mo limit for nitrogen fixation. Consequently, the Mo scarcity hypothesis cannot readily explain the lack of eukaryotic evolution in the middle Proterozoic.\n\nIn Chapter 6, Fe isotopic analysis of laboratory-formed pyrite showed that the apparent fractionation associated with pyrite precipitation are affected by the relative rates of pyrite precipitation to isotopic exchange rate between FeS mineral and aqueous FeS at low temperatures (< 40\u2070C) and between aqueous FeS and pyrite at high temperatures (> 80\u2070C). In euxinic sediments where diagenetic pyrite formed, pyrite \u03b456Fe may be used to constrain pyrite precipitation and burial rates, with implications to oxygen sinks particularly in the Precambrian.\n\nIn Chapter 7, a diagenetic model is developed in order to characterize the effects of multiple pyrite precipitation pathways to pyrite \u03b456Fe in marine sediments. Model outputs suggest that pyrite likely formed from at least two pathways: one mediated by aqueous Fe(II) and another mediated by surface-bound Fe(II).

Using this technology, a workpiece is adhered to grippers within the fixture using a photo-curable adhesive.  After processing, the workpiece is de-bonded from the grippers by either forcing it off with an external tool or by rotating the grippers within the fixture. \nIn either case, de-bonding leads to external stresses on the workpiece that are directly correlated to adhesive strength.   The adhesives used for PAAW applications are very strong and tough at room temperature.  As a consequence, de-bonding stresses can be an issue for applications in which the workpiece is compliant or comprised of a material that is either weak or brittle.  For these applications, the adhesive must be weakened substantially prior to de-bonding.\n\nOne method of doing this is to use adhesive that is impregnated with particles of carbon black.  Prior to de-bonding, the adhesive joint is exposed to pulsed, Nd:YAG laser radiation.  The heat transfer degrades the adhesive and results in permanent loss of strength.  The problem is that the physical mechanisms by which this occurs are not understood. \n\nThe goal of this thesis was to gain a scientific understanding of the physical mechanisms that enable the laser degradation process.  The specific objectives of this thesis were:\n\u2022\tTo develop models to quantify the laser radiation absorbed within an adhesive joint as a function of carbon black concentration, adhesive joint thickness, and incipient laser radiation irradiance\n\u2022\tTo characterize adhesive decomposition as a function of temperature\n\u2022\tTo characterize the release of heat during adhesive decomposition and to determine whether it is a significant factor during laser degradation\n\u2022\tTo determine if heat transfer from a carbon black particle is sufficient to cause a localized zone of adhesive degradation. \n\u2022\tTo characterize temperatures within the adhesive matrix and to determine whether they are sufficiently high to result in one or more modes of adhesive decomposition \n\nTo study the thermal degradation characteristics of the polymer adhesive, a simultaneous Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) was performed using TA instruments equipment. The behavior of the polymer adhesive was studied as it decomposes for a pure adhesive sample and a 0.1% carbon black impregnated polymer sample. The heats of reaction were calculated for both the samples. The results showed that the urethane oligomers started to decompose at around 220\u02daC. The polymer adhesive completely decomposed at 420\u02daC.\n\nFrom the experimental results, it was observed that the strength of the Light Activated Adhesive Gripper joint varies with respect to various parameters such as pulse width, frequency, amount of carbon black, etc. A heat absorption analysis was carried out and the presumed heat absorption of the carbon black particles and the polymer adhesive was calculated. The presumed heat absorption values were found out to be much higher than the heats of reaction as the polymer decomposed during the DSC-TGA analysis. It was also observed that the absorption coefficient increased substantially in the presence of carbon black. It was assumed that the increase in absorption in the presence of carbon black was used to generate heat in the joint. A closed form classical point source heat generation model was used to check for the possible rise in temperature in the LAAG joint in the presence of carbon black. It is well known that carbon black is a good absorber of energy. It was initially assumed that the carbon black alone was absorbing the radiation from the laser. The temperatures developed due to absorption of laser radiation by carbon black alone were well below the required temperature of 220\u02daC to cause any damage. Hence, it was concluded that in order to damage the joint, the entire matrix has to absorb the radiation from the laser. \n\nA Finite Element Analysis was performed to account for various shortcomings of the classical heat generation model. It was assumed that the entire LAAG joint was absorbing the energy from the laser. A transient heat study was performed for a specific set of laser parameters and joint composition as a function of varying levels of laser pulse frequency (75Hz, 100Hz, 120Hz, and 200Hz). The results showed that for high frequencies, the baseline temperature in the LAAG joint increased dramatically and was observed to be well beyond 220\u02daC. These results further validated that the entire matrix had to absorb energy for the joint to fail as a result of heat generation. \nLooking at the results from the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in Solidworks and the DSC-TGA results of the polymer adhesive, this report gives convincing evidence that the joint is being damaged due to the breakage of the polyurethane oligomers as the baseline temperature in the entire system increases due to the short pulses of the laser. It was concluded that the polymer adhesive begins to disintegrate due to decomposition of the major constituent as the baseline temperature in the system crosses the minimum threshold of about 220\u02daC.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8505], "author_name_tesi": "Mantena, Mahesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Mantena", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mahesh", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Demeter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Demeter, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["PAAW", "Photo Activated Adhesive Workholding", "Polymer Adhesive", "Polymer", "Fixturing", "Laser", "LAAG", "FEA", "Finite Element Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "From \u201cLumbee\u201d to \u201cTuscarora\u201d: Varieties of Citizenship Claims in Robeson County, North Carolina", "id": "25860", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11467", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Civil rights activism following the Voting Rights Act of 1965, labeled by scholars as the \u201cLong Civil Rights Movement,\u201d came from a wide variety of actors fighting for their rights and integrity as citizens of the United States. In this thesis, I examine indigenous civil rights activism from 1967 to 1973 in Robeson County, North Carolina. The struggle for indigenous equality in Robeson County was split between two competing movements, each of which I analyze in terms of their recurring appeals and visions of citizenship. First, I analyze the rhetoric of three non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that constructed a Lumbee social movement network in Robeson County. Federal \u201cself-determination\u201d policy, in particular, greatly informed the dominant appeals of the Lumbee activists. The three key themes of \u201cself-determination\u201d\u2014economic partnership, civic engagement, and cultural appreciation\u2014shaped the way the movement framed its activities and interpreted local political issues. Second, I examine the Tuscarora countermovement and its construction of a more militant vision of indigenous citizenship. The Tuscarora movement used a vernacular interpretation of Red Power rhetoric to challenge the Lumbee movement and its moderate citizenship framework. The Tuscarora\u2019s appeals to tribal authenticity, political autonomy, and militarism effectively caught the attention of outside actors, such as Russell Means and Dennis Banks of the American Indian Movement (AIM). Finally, I analyze the temporary collaboration between the competing movements during the \u201cSave Old Main\u201d campaign. Activists rallied together through appeals to the public memory of the Old Main building that stressed a shared indigenous history of oppression. Gubernatorial candidate James E. Holshouser reinforced Lumbee-Tuscarora collaboration by offering a common enemy in the Democratic Party. This case study of American Indian civil rights protest contributes to rhetorical scholarship at the intersections of resistance, class, and indigeneity. An analysis of Robeson County\u2019s competing networks of activism also invites critical rethinking of social movement rhetoric as it relates to public policy, rural-urban dynamics, and public memory.

Specifically, vacancy-mediated volume diffusion in pure elements and alloys with dilute concentration of impurities is studied. \nA novel procedure is discovered for predicting diffusion coefficients that overcomes the shortcomings of the well-known transition state theory, by Vineyard. The procedure that evolves from Eyring\u2019s reaction rate theory yields accurate diffusivity results that include anharmonic effects within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Alongside, the procedure is straightforward in its application within the conventional harmonic approximation, from the results of static first-principles calculations. \nTo prove the extensibility of the procedure, diffusivities have been computed for a variety of systems. Over a wide temperature range, the calculated self-diffusion and impurity diffusion coefficients using local density approximation (LDA) of density functional theory (DFT) are seen to be in excellent match with experimental data.  Self-diffusion coefficients have been calculated for: (i) fcc Al, Cu, Ni and Ag (ii) bcc W and Mo (v) hcp Mg, Ti and Zn. Impurity diffusion coefficients have been computed for: (i) Mg, Si, Cu, Li, Ag, Mo and 3d transition elements in fcc Al (ii) Mo, Ta in bcc W and Nb, Ta and W in bcc Mo (iii) Sn and Cd in hcp Mg and Al in hcp Ti. It is also an observation from this work, that LDA does not require surface correction for yielding energetics of vacancy-containing system in good comparison with experiments, unlike generalized gradient approximation (GGA).\nIt is known that first-principles\u2019 energy minimization procedures based on electronic interactions are suited for metallic systems wherein the valence electrons are freely moving. In this thesis, research has been extended to study suitability of first-principles calculations within LDA / GGA including the localization parameter U, for Al system with transition metal solutes, in which charges are known to localize around the transition metal element. U parameter is determined from matching the diffusivities of 3d transition metal impurity in aluminum with reliable experimental data. The effort yielded activation energies in systematic agreement with experiments and has proved useful in obtaining insights into the complex interactions in these systems. \nBesides the prediction of diffusion coefficients, this research has been helpful in understanding the physics underlying diffusion. Within the scope of observations from the systems studied, certain diffusion related aspects that have been clarified are: (i) cause for non-Arrnenius\u2019 nature of diffusion plots (ii) definitions of atom migration properties (iii) magnitude and sign of diffusion parameters enthalpy and entropy of formation and migration and characteristic vibrational frequency (iv) trends in diffusivities based on activation energy and diffusion prefactor (vi) cause for anomalous diffusion behavior of 3d transition metals in Al, and their magnetic nature (vii) contributions from electronic contributions to curvature at very high temperatures of bcc refractory elements (viii) temperature dependence of impurity diffusion correlation factors.\n Finally, the double-well potential of diffusion by vacancy mechanism has been calculated from first-principles. This aided calculation of entropy of migration and thus free energy of migration along with characteristic vibrational frequency. Also for the first time, temperature dependence of enthalpy of migration and thus atom jump frequency has been accurately predicted.\nFrom the broad perspective of predicting diffusion coefficients from computational methodologies, it can be stated as a result of this work that: static first-principles extend an irreplaceable contribution to the future of diffusion modeling. The procedure obviated the use of (i) redundant approximations that limit its accuracy and (ii) support from other computational techniques that restrict its extensibility due to insufficient input or computational resources. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4398], "author_name_tesi": "Mantina, Manjeera ", "last_name_ssi": "Mantina", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Manjeera", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu", "Long Qing Chen", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Chair", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["First-principles", "tracer diffusion coefficients", "metals", "dilute alloys", "fcc", "bcc", "hcp", "self-diffusion", "impurity diffusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Nanoscopic Analyses: Single Molecule Characterization In Molecular Electronics and Surface Science\n", "id": "6607", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "617", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Time-resolved scanning tunneling microscope (STM) measurements of single molecules are used to determine the behavior and interactions of adsorbed species.  This thesis describes the custom design of the scanning tunneling microscope hardware and software used to acquire molecular-resolution images.  Using this instrument, two systems are characterized: the conductance switching of oligo (phenylene-ethynylene) (OPE) molecules inserted in n-alkanethiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), and the motion of benzene adsorbed on Au{111} at 4 K.  For both systems, the use of digital image processing was applied to the analysis of time-resolved sequential images to determine changes in topographic features or overlayer structure.  From these analyses we can determine the mechanism for conductance switching and quantify the weak adsorbate-adsorbate substrate-mediated interactions present in benzene overlayers.  These types of analyses must be executed at the single molecule level, as no ensemble technique can observe the discrete, heterogenious behaviors observed by STM in these systems.\n\nOne of the ultimate miniaturizations in nanotechnology is molecular electronics, where electronic devices will potentially consist of individual molecules.  Some of the molecules being investigated for application in molecular electronics are a family of OPE molecules.  Ensemble measurements of these molecules have yielded hysteretic switching and negative differential resistance, both useful properties that enable memory and logic operations.  We investigate these systems by inserting the molecule of interest in an inert SAM to isolate single molecules, probing each molecule with the STM tip on a single-molecule basis.  We acquire time-resolved sequences of STM images over periods of up to several days or acquire real-time measurements at a rate of 10 kHz for 15 seconds, and observe that these molecules exhibit conductance switching such that their apparent height changes.  Due to properties of the materials used to acquire STM images, the field of view may drift.  A digital image tracking algorithm based on Fourier transform cross-correlation has been developed to correct for instrumental drift in STM images.  Analyzing the apparent height of different molecules in variable SAM matrices as a function of time has enabled us to propose that conductance switching is the result of hybridization and/or conformational changes at the metal-molecule interface.\n\nUsing similar analyses, we have applied scanning tunneling microscopy to probe and to quantify the weak substrate-mediated interactions in benzene overlayers on Au{111} at 4 K.  We observe that benzene molecules exhibit three types of motion, including 2D desorption, 2D adsorption, and simultaneous dislocations of many molecules (molecular cascades).  Correlating the probability of 2D desorption with the number of nearest neighbors of the desorbing molecules enables the calculation of the magnitude of the adsorbate-adsorbate substrate-mediated interactions.  We also observe chains of up to 12 molecules simultaneously moving in the same direction at the same time in an event we refer to as molecular cascades.  These cascades are the result of translation of the overlayer structure and are highly correlated with 2D desorption and 2D adsorption.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [613], "author_name_tesi": "Mantooth, Brent Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Mantooth", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Brent", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Vincent Henry Crespi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Scanning tunneling microscopy", "single molecule", "molecular electronics", "benzene", "digital image processing", "substrate-mediated interactions", "real-time measurements", "image analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Electrical Properties of Niobium Based Oxides-Ceramics and Single Crystal Fibers Grown by the Laser-Heated Pedestal Growth (LHPG) Technique", "id": "6075", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2326", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-04-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dielectric materials have been studied for decades due to both their application in important technologies and the fundamentally interesting relationships among their crystal chemistry, crystal structures, and physical properties. Recently, dramatic changes in microelectronics and in particular wireless communications technologies have made the importance of materials with the unusual combination of high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, and low temperature dependence of dielectric constant of great interest.\nTantalum oxide is one of the interesting dielectric materials from a crystal chemical point of view, as the complexity of its crystal structure allows it to accommodate many different dopant ions in significant concentrations with only minor changes in its crystal structure. The dielectric constant of bulk Ta2O5 can be enhanced significantly through small substitutions of selected oxides such as TiO2, or Al2O3. Some studies on the dielectric properties of the isostructural Nb2O5 have also been reported. It is desirable to investigate the dielectric behavior of both Ta2O5 and Nb2O5 compounds as those have potential as thin film dielectric in various devices.\n\nThis thesis is dedicated to gain understanding of the dielectric behavior of Niobium-based oxide ceramics and single crystals. The work presents the results on the Nb2O5 system in three specific areas:\n\n(i)\tUnusual enhancement of dielectric constant of Nb2O5 has been observed through the small substituents such as TiO2, SiO2, and Al2O3. The ceramics of these solid solutions are prepared by the conventional mixed oxide method. Single crystal fibers are grown by the Laser-Heated Pedestal Growth (LHPG) technique, which is considered to be a powerful tool for rapid growth of high-melting temperature oxides and incongruent melting compositions. Optimized growth parameters are established to obtain the best quality of single crystal fibers.\n\n(ii)\tThis work is the first report on the single crystal growth of the solid solution and the anisotropic dielectric behavior of the crystals. Interesting dielectric relaxation has been observed in these materials and analyzed by Arrhenius, Vogel-Fulcher, and Cole-Cole relationship. The direct-current (dc) electric field dependence of the dielectric constant has been studied. The results show the strong dielectric dispersion which exists in a large frequency range implies that the relaxation process involved is not of a simple Debye type. Nb2O5 system is known to have Magneli\u2019s phases of the polar group symmetry. The large dielectric constants, the anisotropic behavior and the field dependence of the dielectric properties could be associated with the presence of polar clusters or the similar groups of Magneli\u2019s phases in the solid solution compositions studied. The influence of the cluster size dispersion is one assumption. The data of dc bias field dependence of the dielectric constant has been analyzed by the modified Devonshire relation including a cluster term giving the fitted parameters: cluster sizes distribution and their polar cluster polarization.\n\n(iii)\tThe nanoscale distribution of Magneli\u2019s phases also influences the thermal expansion behavior of the samples. The measurements are made on the solid-solution Nb2O5- based oxide samples in the ceramics and single crystal in the temperature range of -200 to 500\u00b0C by using the dilatometer technique. Both single crystals and ceramics show negative thermal expansion in this temperature range. Nevertheless, the thermal expansion coefficient of these solid solutions can be designed to achieve a desired overall coefficient by either annealing or processing history. \n\nIn brief, the research is aimed to develop a good understanding of the dielectric behavior of ceramics and single crystals of these materials through the structure-property relationships. Various characteristics such as dielectric constant and losses, anisotropic dielectric properties of crystals, electric-field dependent dielectric properties, oxygen stoichiometry effect, analysis of relaxation behavior, negative thermal expansion coefficients, are investigated in both ceramic and single crystal fiber forms to judge the potential of these materials in electronic and fiber based applications. Studies also suggest that the presence of Magneli\u2019s phases or polar clusters in these compositions has a direct association with the unusual properties observed in these materials. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2311], "author_name_tesi": "Manuspiya, Hathaikarn ", "last_name_ssi": "Manuspiya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hathaikarn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amar S Bhalla", "Ruyan Guo", "Kenji Uchino", "Sridhar Komarneni", "Barbara Shaw"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Amar S Bhalla, Committee Chair", "Ruyan Guo, Committee Chair", "Kenji Uchino, Committee Member", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member", "Barbara Shaw, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dielectrics", "single crystal growth", "relaxation mechanism", "lasor heated pedestal growth", "niobium oxide"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "SELF-OSCILLATING POWER ELECTRONIC STABILITY ANALYSIS AND DESIGN\n\n\n", "id": "6424", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5991", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-11-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, a new approach based on time domain analysis is proposed to determine periodic solution and their stability in self-oscillating power electronic circuitry.

Molecular depth profiling is the foundation for the ultimate goal of a three dimensional (3-D) characterizations of organic and biological samples. However, it is a complicated process with many variations on outcomes including surface topography developments, erosion rate variations and depth resolution degradations. There are also many experimental factors affecting these depth profile results including sample temperature, impact angle, primary ion beam kinetic energy and sample rotation, etc. The process of depth profiling is far from being fully understood and all these fundamentals need to be investigated before achieving a successful 3-D image of complex samples like single cells.

The model features overlapping generations of individuals who self-select into education, employment, and occupations in an environment with competitive markets and exogenous demand and supply shifts. It departs from existing general equilibrium studies by adopting a rich characterization of heterogeneity in the form of continuous ability distributions. \n\nI estimate the model on the Current Population Survey (CPS) using simulated method of moments. The estimated model successfully matches trends in the U.S. labor market and reveals changes in the underlying ability composition of the workforce. In particular, my results contradict earlier findings that increase in college attainment has led to a large decline in the average ability of college graduates and suggest that female selection into the workforce has become more positive over the last four decades. \n\nUsing the estimated model as a basis for counterfactual experiments, I first examine the impact of exogenous demand and supply forces by allowing them to happen one at a time. I then assess composition effects and highlight the sensitivity of labor market outcomes to underlying ability heterogeneity by simulating economies with different ability distributions. The results show that composition effects have played a positive but minor role in the increase of the college premium and the narrowing of the gender wage gap, and suggest that the observed labor market changes are the results of a confluence of forces that have acted in concert or in balance with each other over the last four decades. Skill-biased technological change has increased the college premium and raised college attainment, but has also contributed to closing the gender wage and employment gaps. Gender-biased demand shifts and changing home sector values have increased female relative employment and wages, while depressing the growth in male college attainment and the college premium. I quantify the respective contributions of these exogenous forces and highlight their general equilibrium interactions. \n\nIn Chapter 2, I study the graduate school enrollment decision of U.S. college graduates. The key question is that although college enrollment has increased significantly in the U.S. over the last four decades, there has been limited growth in the enrollment rate of most graduate programs, despite the fact that the returns to graduate education have increased more than the returns to college education. To understand the graduate school enrollment behavior as well as to investigate possible barriers of entry, I develop and estimate a dynamic discrete choice model of post-college work and educational investment decisions. The model consists of two stages. In the first stage, individuals enter college and choose a major field of study based on expectations of grades, future earnings, and the probabilities of enrolling in different graduate programs in the future. In the second stage, individuals are graduated from college and in period choose whether to enroll in a graduate program, work, or engage in home production. In each case, the individual's choice is rationalized as the optimal solution to a dynamic discrete choice problem that maximizes her expected lifetime utility. \n\nOne of the key features of the study is that it jointly models college major and graduate school choices. This includes the recognition that the choice of college major is both an outcome of a student's talent and prior preparation and a determinant of her later options. The choice of a dynamic structural model captures the dynamics of post-college educational investment. While most people attend school continuously from grade school to college, years of employment or home production can separate graduate school enrollment from college graduation. In addition, post-college education is characterized by frequent entries and exits as people move between work and school. Such dynamics can only be captured by a dynamic model.\n\nI estimate the model using data from the 1992-1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/03), which follows a representative sample of U.S. college graduates who earned their bachelor's degrees in the 1992-93 academic year. My results find strong sorting of preferences toward undergraduate majors and graduate programs by mathematical ability. Individuals with high math ability favor non-education majors in college, are more likely to work rather than engage in home production, and have stronger preference toward enrolling in business, professional, and doctoral programs (as opposed to non-MBA master's programs) after college. I also find substantial transition costs associated with going back to school after college, which significantly deters individuals from pursuing graduate education in response to their increasing returns. \n\nIn Chapter 3, I explore the use of Bayesian methods in estimating dynamic games of imperfect competition. Structural estimations of dynamic models have been known for their computational demands. One of the major sources of computational burden lies in the necessity of solving the dynamic programming (DP) problems of forward-looking agents. In the context of maximum likelihood estimation, the likelihood functions are based on the explicit solution of these DP problems. Estimations therefore have to proceed by iterating on a set of Bellman equations until convergence for all values of model parameters considered by the estimator. Compared to single agent problems, dynamic games of imperfect competition are more complex, as each agent's choice of action depends on her belief about other agents' private information and choice probabilities. Solution of such models require both value functions and choice probability functions to converge in equilibrium. \n\nTo alleviate the computational burden of estimating dynamic games of imperfect competition, I develop a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure based an algorithm developed by Imai, Jain, and Ching (2009) for inference in single-agent problems. The key is to employ local nonparametric regression techniques to approximate value functions and choice probability functions and to combine the parameter search step with the model solution step. I propose three algorithms that extend the Imai-Jain-Ching procedure to the estimation of multi-agent games. The performance of each algorithm is tested using an entry and exit model, from which I determine the optimal procedure. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9193], "author_name_tesi": "Mao, Jiaming ", "last_name_ssi": "Mao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiaming", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Clifford Marshall", "James R.

Complete understanding\nand accurate prediction of HOx remains a big challenge to scientists according to the\ndiscrepancies between modeling and measurement of HOx. The OH reactivity, the\ninverse of the OH lifetime, provides a powerful tool to investigate the atmospheric\nphotochemistry. OH reactivity is defined as the sum of the products of the concentrations\nand their reaction rate coefficients for all gases that react with OH. Based on OH and\nHO2 cycling, OH reactivity can either validate the HOx measurement or validate the total\nOH sources and OH reactants measurements. It is also a good way to test and improve\nphotochemical modeling mechanisms.\nA new airborne OH reactivity instrument was designed and deployed for the first\ntime on a DC-8 airplane in the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment-B\n(INTEX-B) campaign. The OH reactivity was measured by adding OH, generated by\nphotolyzing water vapor with 185nm UV light in a moveable wand, to the flow of\nambient air in a flow tube and measuring the OH signal with laser induced fluorescence.\nAs the wand is pulled back away from the OH detector, the OH signal decay is recorded;\nthe slope of &#916;ln(signal)/&#916;time is the OH reactivity. The instrument was frequently\ncalibrated in flight by C3F6 addition. From the in-situ calibrations and lab calibrations, the\ninstrument shows good response at different pressure conditions. The measured OH\nreactivity (4 s-1) is higher than the calculated OH reactivity from cycling (3.3 s-1), and\neven higher than the calculated OH reactivity from the total measurements from all reactants (1.6 s-1). The analysis of OH budget indicates that the difference between three\nkinds of OH reactivity is correlated with HCHO, and that it is very likely that there are\nboth missing OH sources and OH sinks. The missing OH sinks are most likely related to\nsome highly reactive VOCs.\nThis instrument was later deployed in a ground campaign in Houston, the Texas\nAir Quality Study / Gulf of Mexico Atmospheric Composition and Climate Study\n(TexAQS / GoMACCS). This study was a totally different condition from INTEX-B\nbecause it was close to both vehicle emissions and industrial emissions. With significant\nNOx levels in Houston, the HO2 from the photolysis of water vapor in the wand and\nambient NO produce OH and reduce the measured OH decay rate. A NO correction\ntechnique is used and calibrated with the measurement of HO2 reactivity. The average\nmeasured OH reactivity was about 12.8\u00b13.4 s-1. The measured and calculated OH\nreactivity show a similar trend in the diurnal profile. Missing OH reactivity is about\n2.2\u00b10.9 s-1. Imbalance between OH production and loss indicates the possible OH\nsources and losses, but is within the statistical uncertainty of the measurement and model.\nFrom the intercomparison with other big cities, this small imbalance indicates that\npossible OH losses could be from highly reactive OVOCs, such as long chain aldehydes\n(more than two carbons).\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3269], "author_name_tesi": "Mao, Jingqiu ", "last_name_ssi": "Mao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jingqiu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Henry Brune", "Anne Mee Thompson", "James Freihaut", "Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Henry Brune, Committee Chair", "Anne Mee Thompson, Committee Member", "James Freihaut, Committee Member", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["OH reactivity flow tube kinetics HO2"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "MODELING COLD START OF POLYMER ELECTROLYTE FUEL CELLS\n", "id": "7070", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3898", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While substantial research efforts are presently directed toward performance and durability improvement of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC), PEFC cold start capability and survivability at subzero temperatures remains a challenge and has been scarcely researched. \nIn order to achieve a fundamental understanding of PEFC cold start, a mechanistic model is developed in this thesis to describe the complex physics involved, along with necessary experimental validation. First, a theoretical analysis focusing on the catalyst layer is performed to study the importance of coupled water and heat balance, as well as to elucidate the main effects of ice formation on fuel cell performance. Second, to fully describe the multi-scale physics involved in PEFC cold start and the coupled nature of water and heat transport, a comprehensive multi-dimensional, multi-component, multiphase, transient model is developed. The model accounts for ice/frost precipitation and growth in the cathode catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer and for water transport characteristics at very low temperatures. Governing equations of species, heat and charge transport are developed using a single-domain approach and solved with a finite-volume based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. Validated by extensive experimental data, this computational model is used to identify key parameters that define PEFC cold start capability.

It is morphologically highly variable, representing a continuum from annual to perennial types. In order to explain the wide distribution and variability in Poa annua, efforts have been made to discover its evolutionary origin ever since the 1930s; however, no definitive conclusions have been made. Our phylogenetic analysis using nuclear and chloroplast gene sequences is the first to confirm that Poa annua (2n=4x=28) is an allotetraploid between an annual grass species Poa infirma Kunth. (2n=2x=14) and a perennial grass species Poa supina Schrad. (2n=2x=14), with the former serving as the maternal parent. Our data also suggest a recent origin of Poa annua, and possibly multiple crosses between the parental species led to the present day Poa annua. Previous phylogenetic studies have suggested that the genomes of Poa infirma and Poa supina are very divergent, representing the largest genetic distance between species within the genus Poa. By analyzing meiotic chromosome pairing data in amphihaploid Poa annua published by Hovin, we were able to determine that the genomes of Poa infirma and Poa supina indeed are very distinct, and we designated them II and SS, making the genomic constitution of Poa annua IISS.\nPrior to the present study, the biggest controversy on the origin of Poa annua was that its karyotype did not match the combination of the two putative parents Poa infirma and Poa supina. With the two parental species confirmed with DNA sequencing data, it could now be concluded that chromosomal rearrangements must have occurred during the evolutionary origin of Poa annua. In order to explore the extent and patterns of chromosomal rearrangements in Poa annua, fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed to compare rDNA loci in Poa annua and its parents. Our data show variations of genomic rDNA loci between Poa annua and its parents, and among different Poa annua individuals, suggesting that not only did chromosomal rearrangements occur in Poa annua, but also genomic variation exists within this species.\nSmall RNAs play a wide range of regulatory roles in plant development and are associated with polyploid evolution. Four small RNA profiles were generated from young seedlings of Poa infirma, Poa supina, perennial-type Poa annua and annual-type Poa annua. Analyses showed that the four profiles are highly similar in terms of small RNA length distribution, miRNA families and expression levels, indicating that the morphological and life history variation observed 1) between the two types of Poa annua, and 2) among allotetraploid Poa annua and the two diploid parental species are not attributable to the small RNAs examined. However, the profiles generated from this study could serve as a baseline for future work. \nIn summary, the discoveries from this thesis work enhanced our understanding of the phenotypic variability and incredible adaptability of Poa annua, and provided insights into plant polyploid evolution. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9891], "author_name_tesi": "Mao, Qing ", "last_name_ssi": "Mao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Robert Huff", "David Robert Huff", "Majid R Foolad", "John Edward Kaminski Iii", "Dawn S Luthe", "Gabriele Brigitte Monshausen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Robert Huff, Dissertation Advisor", "David Robert Huff, Committee Chair", "Majid R Foolad, Committee Member", "John Edward Kaminski Iii, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member", "Gabriele Brigitte Monshausen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plant biology", "genetics", "small RNA"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DENSITY ESTIMATION AND MODAL BASED METHOD FOR HAPLOTYPING AND RECOMBINATION", "id": "11421", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6683", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Genetic problems such as haplotype inference and recombination analysis are rarely studied using nonparametric models.

However, it is possible to design a vehicle such that the front of it, the cavitator, can induce and maintain a single gaseous cavity, referred to as Supercavitation. The cavity can envelop most of the vehicle so that only the cavitator and the partial rear control fins are in contact with the water. And, such a design, can thereby dramatically reduce the skin friction drag acting on the vehicle. Vehicles with this feature are called High-Speed Supercavitating Vehicles (HSSVs) and can achieve high speeds of up to 300 m/s compared with 40 m/s of traditional vehicles in water.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for control designs comes from the nonlinearity in the modeling of the planing force, which forms during planing condition that occurs when the vehicle's tail penetrates the cavity. Though planing force can be used to counteract the force of gravity when there are no other actuators such as the cavitator and fins available, it could also cause limit cycle of the vehicle, that is, substantial oscillation of the vehicle can happen. In this dissertation, we consider the supercavitating vehicles that are equipped with cavitator and fins, and the objective of our control designs is to eliminate the undesirable planing force for the purpose of drag reduction, stabilize the vehicle and further achieve satisfactory tracking performance. \n\nBesides nonlinearity, another research challenge caused by the planing force comes from its strong memory effect because supercavitation involves complicated physics in the cavity-vehicle interaction. Yet, it is difficult to accurately model the hydrodynamic forces of the control surfaces (cavitator and fins) in supercavitation. Additionally, the planing force exhibits strong memory effect because the computation of the planing force depends on the cavity shape, which is a function of the vehicle\u2019s motion history. In the past few years, many important advances have been made in the modeling and control designs for supercavitating vehicles. However, very few studies have explicitly addressed how to handle the uncertainties in the system parameters, the hydrodynamic coefficients, and the size of the time-delay. In this dissertation, the author focuses on handling these uncertainties by exploring advanced robust control design methodologies.\n\nThis dissertation considers the pitch-plane motion control of a high-speed supercavitating vehicle. Control designs are based on two major nonlinear approaches: the sliding-model control and the Quasi-Linear-Parameter-Varying control (Quasi-LPV). The sliding-mode controller emphasizes robustness with respect to the uncertainties in the system parameters and the hydrodynamic coefficients. The proposed Quasi-LPV formulation of the nonlinear supercavitating vehicle and the resulting control provide performance optimization and also address the time delay due to the cavity-vehicle iteration. Simulations of different model-controller configurations provide insight into the robustness capabilities of the controllers.\n\nIn order to better understand the benefits that accrue from including the planing force memory effect into the control design, two delay-dependent Quasi-LPV controllers are compared with a Quasi-LPV controller based on a simplified non-time-delay model. Insight is thereby gained especially by comparing pitch-angle tracking performance using constrained control inputs.\n\nGiven that only a partial set of state variables are measurable, a high-gain observer is designed to estimate the state variable that is not directly available for feedback. The high-gain observer is selected because it is robust to uncertainties in modeling the nonlinear functions. In addition, each controller is also evaluated in terms of the impact of sensor measurement noise on closed-loop system performance.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6647], "author_name_tesi": "Mao, Xiaofeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Mao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaofeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qian Wang", "Qian Wang", "Joseph Francis Horn", "Christopher Rahn", "Alok Sinha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qian Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qian Wang, Committee Chair", "Joseph Francis Horn, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Alok Sinha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nonlinear system", "robust control", "supercavitating vehicle", "LPV"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPING ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR LAB-ON-A-CHIP APPLICATIONS BY EXPLOITING MICROSCALE FLUID PHENOMENA\n", "id": "10994", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6649", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the past decade, microfluidics - the manipulation of fluid flow in micrometer-sized channels has emerged as a distinctive new discipline. The development of microfluidics is primarily fueled by the growing field of Lab-on-a-Chip which focuses on implementation of entire biological and chemical laboratory assays on a single microchip for applications such as lab miniaturization/automation and point-of-care diagnosis. The immediate advantage of reducing the size of fluidic systems to microscale is the dramatic reduction of sample consumption and instrument size. However it has been realized that the greatest potential of microfluidics lies in the microscale fluid physics itself. By exploiting the unique microscale fluid phenomena, precise manipulation of fluid flow, suspended particles/cells, and even light can be achieved in an unprecedented manner to facilitate the development of novel Lab-on-a-Chip applications. In this study we mainly focused on leveraging microscale fluid phenomena to develop enabling technologies for a wide variety of Lab-on-a-Chip applications. We first discussed a novel three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic focusing technique which can be implemented in a single-layer planar structure by utilizing a Dean flow based fluid manipulation technique - \u201cmicrofluidic drifting.\u201d This simple yet extremely effective 3D hydrodynamic focusing technique has enabled us to develop a mass-producible, fully integrated, high-throughput, and multi-parametric flow cytometry chip for lab miniaturization and point-of-care diagnosis in resource-limited environment.

Lastly, we discussed the application of microbubbles induced chaotic advection in microscale fluid flow for ultrafast microfluidic mixing.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6646], "author_name_tesi": "Mao, Xiaole ", "last_name_ssi": "Mao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Huang", "Jun Huang", "Cheng Dong", "William O Hancock", "Siyang Zheng", "Chao Yang Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jun Huang, Committee Chair", "Cheng Dong, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Siyang Zheng, Committee Member", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Optofluidics", "Point of Care Diagnosis", "Flow Cytometry", "Lab on a Chip", "Microfluidics", "L-GRIN Lens"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "SUSPENSION PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE NUMERICAL MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND LOAD CASE SIMULATION", "id": "13491yxm152", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13491", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "During rainy seasons, rural communities around the world become isolated from health care, education and other essential facilities due to flooding. Under this circumstance, suspension pedestrian bridges are built to provide rural communities with access to their basic needs. However, due to low stiffness, mass and damping of these bridges, vibration problems may occur. Therefore, research needs to be conducted to improve bridge dynamic performance and serviceability to ensure that those intended to be served are not fearful of using the bridge.\n\nThe present study refined one available scaled physical model in order to obtain more accurate tested dynamic responses that were utilized to calibrate numerical suspension pedestrian bridge models. By achieving a better numerical modeling methodology, the present study refined currently employed numerical models, which enabled the completion of more reliable dynamic analysis simulations under more complex load cases than have previously been studied.\n\nThe present study set a reasonable serviceability limit, considering that people in those rural communities of developing countries may lower their expectations of bridge performance. A nonlinear, direct-integration, time-history analysis was conducted to determine the dynamic responses under each defined load combination. The analysis evaluated the responses on the basis of vertical velocity, vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration and compare the responses to the serviceability limits. Simulation in the present study includes twenty pedestrian load combinations, five animal load combinations and three handcart load combinations. At last, an investigation into the effect of a bystander on bridge response was conducted through modeling a human bystander as mass or a damped system.\n\nThe present study found that the peak response induced by a jogger reached the double response of a walker, while a cycler produced a 77 percent smaller response than the walker. The most critical case for two pedestrians is that they start from the same end of the bridge, from the same time, and keep the same pace. The existence of a bystander decreases the vertical response near the bystander\u2019s location while the lateral response is minimally affected.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13535], "author_name_tesi": "Mao, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Mao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["JEFFREY A.

Specifically, additional attention is paid to algebraic loops, a general problem that may occur in many other systems besides vehicles. First, a nonlinear battery model is developed and the algebraic loop is broken by several different methods. The simulation results are compared and analyzed. Then a PEM fuel cell model is developed and the results from the literature are reproduced. The fuel cell model contains a more complex algebraic problem when connected to a load other than current source. This problem has not been talked about in the literature and some different methods are developed and compared to deal with it.

A county-level hotspot of a particular industry would represent close together counties with positively correlated, high numbers of industry operations. Industry hotspots have been found be beneficial to the affected industries, as well as to the area in which they are located, with some research suggesting that policies that facilitate industry clustering can be effective economic and rural development tools. Research on the impact hotspots in the agricultural industry is prevalent; however, none of this research addresses this issue as it specifically pertains to the organic sector, although the benefits of organic clustering have been touted by organic supporters. The organic sector is important to address separately, as a special case of agriculture, as differences between it and the conventional agricultural industry may indicate that organic hotspots can affect the local economy differently than conventional agricultural hotspots.\n\nThe primary goal of this dissertation is to quantify the economic impact of hotspots of organic operations in order to assess their potential as an economic development tool. To achieve this broad goal, I first need to identify the hotspots, and then analyze factors that are associated with hotspot formation. I, therefore, break up this dissertation into three separate essays, which address organic hotspot identification, formation, and impact, respectively.\n\nThe objective of my first essay is to identify statistically significant, county-level hot and cold spots of certified organic operations, as well as to determine the type of spatial autocorrelation present in the distribution of certified organic operations at the county-level. I use the Local Moran\u2019s I test statistic for the cluster identification, and identify hotspots of organic operations along the West Coast, in the Midwest, and in the Northeast. I compare these clusters of conventional agricultural operations and general operations, and show that clusters of organic operations are not necessarily consistent with clusters of general agriculture or general establishments. Using a spatial autoregressive model, I confirm the presence of spatial spillovers in the distribution of organic operations.\n\nThe objective of my second essay is to investigate cluster formation. Using the clusters identified through my first objective, I use a logistic regression to analyze the impact of county-level factors related to policy, economics and demographics on the probability that a county is in a hotspot or coldspot, paying particular attention to the role of the organic certifying agent. I find that the presence of certifiers who provide outreach opportunities is associated with a higher probability of a county being in a hotspot.\n\nThe objective of my final essay is to analyze the impact that organic hotspots have on county-level economic activity, and compare it with the impact of hotspots of general agricultural operations. I consider organic hotspots to be a treatment, and use propensity score matching, as well as a treatment effects model, to quantify the impact of the treatment on county-level economic indicators. I use the hotspots identified in the first essay as my endogenous treatment, and I instrument for it using the characteristics identified in the second essay.\n\nThis research makes an interesting and important contribution to literature for several reasons. First, it differs from the already scarce research on the topic of clustering in the organic sector by using methods in spatial statistics to define and\ncompare clusters. It is also, to my knowledge, the first to address the role of the organic certifying agent in the presence of hotspots and coldspots of certified organic operations. Finally, it provides a simultaneous treatment of cluster formation and impact, and focuses on the impact of organic hotspots on the local economy as a whole.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10162], "author_name_tesi": "Marasteanu, Ioana Iulia", "last_name_ssi": "Marasteanu", "middle_name_ssi": "Iulia", "first_name_ssi": "Ioana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Jaenicke", "Edward C Jaenicke", "Stephan J Goetz", "Spiro E Stefanou", "N Edward Coulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Jaenicke, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Chair", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Member", "Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Member", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Agricultural Economics", "Spatial Econometrics", "Organic Farming", "Treatment Effects", "Local Economic Development"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE \u2018ME\u2019 REVOLUTION IN MEDIATED COMMUNICATION: INVESTIGATING THE PSYCHOLOGY OF COSMETIC AND FUNCTIONAL CUSTOMIZATION\n\n", "id": "11420", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5784", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Digital information and communication technologies offer myriad ways for users to engage with the interface and content.

Even fewer papers recognize that there are different types of customization and see the value in studying it.\nThis dissertation addressed this shortcoming by explicating the meaning of cosmetic and functional customization, and then delving into their theoretical underpinnings. It tested the role of cosmetic and functional customization in influencing user attitudes and behavioral intentions toward a Web portal by exploring sense of identity, sense of control, and intrinsic motivation as intervening factors. A between-subjects experiment (N=300) was designed where participants were randomly assigned to one of the four manipulated conditions. They were asked to perform either cosmetic customization of an interface, functional customization, both cosmetic and functional customization, or no customization whatsoever before engaging in a task with the interface. In addition to supporting the hypothesized role of customization in promoting positive attitudes via sense of identity, sense of control and intrinsic motivation, this dissertation uncovered the presence of inconsistent mediation, brought on by sense of identity and sense of control that acted as suppressor variables.

The second study tested the associations between reactivity of several hormones to mother-child conflict, parental negativity and internalizing and externalizing problems during adolescence, and suggests that parental conflict and negativity can moderate hormone-behavior associations. Finally, the third study tested the associations and interactions among select genetic, prenatal, endocrine, and postnatal environmental influences on the development of internalizing and externalizing problems across infancy to middle childhood, and demonstrates that prenatal and endocrine influences can mediate genetic and environmental influences on internalizing, but not externalizing problems during childhood.

This new technique is called Liquid Environment Electroactuation Force Microscopy (LEEFM). The operation of LEEFM is similar to Scanning Polarization Force Microscopy (SPFM) in air. An AC voltage at frequency &#969; is applied to the AFM tip/cantilever, generating an electrical potential difference between the tip and sample. The electrical double layer does not screen out the electrostatic interactions, even in water containing added ions, because the voltage is switching polarity too fast for double layer to fully form. The resulting capacitive coupling causes an attractive force between the cantilever and sample, so the cantilever vibrates at the applied frequency (1&#969;) and twice this frequency (2&#969;), with a distinct vibration amplitude at each frequency. Non-contact imaging of topography is accomplished by feedback controlling the amplitude of the 2&#969; vibration, which depends on the tip-sample separation in the range of 1~10 nm. The 1&#969; vibration amplitude and phase shift are simultaneously collected to form maps of the properties of the surface. The exact relationships between the surface properties (e.g. charge) and the cantilever vibration behavior are not yet fully understood. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1421], "author_name_tesi": "Marchand, David Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Marchand", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim", "Seong H Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim, Thesis Advisor", "Seong H Kim, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["scanning polarization force microscopy", "non-contact imaging", "atomic force microscope", "electrostatic actuation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Understanding the Physical and Chemical Properties of Carbon-based Granular Fuels\n", "id": "24946", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11086", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Coal and oil have been used as fuel sources for centuries, but the way they have been used has not fundamentally changed: coal is ground into pieces then burned, and oil is distilled into various liquid fractions that are then burned. This dissertation explores newer methods of utilizing those fuel sources. \nCoal gasification is the process where coal is heated in a low oxygen environment so that the solid carbon is converted into a mixture of gaseous products. But some aspects of gasification, such as the role of catalysts and the structural evolution of coal particles throughout the reaction, remain unclear.  These aspects were studied by analyzing, ex situ, the physical and chemical changes of coal feedstock samples extracted from a fluidized bed gasifier at various times throughout gasification. The changes in feed particle composition and size distribution composition showed that the gasification reaction rate was slower than the gas diffusion rates inside the coal particle at a typical catalytic gasification temperature of 800oC. Detailed composition analysis of samples with and without added catalyst showed that the catalyst increased the overall reaction rate by promoting the dissociative oxidation of the coal by gas phase oxidants, which provided more active sites for carbon-carbon bond breakage. The conclusions drawn from studying the feedstock can be combined with the data from in situ analysis of the gasification reactor to provide a fuller picture of the gasification process.\nPetroleum coke, or petcoke, is a carbonaceous solid produced during oil distillation. Though petcoke could be an important energy source, its use is hindered by practical and environmental concerns. Producing a slurry with petcoke and water has been studied as an alternative method for utilizing petcoke, but the effective use of petcoke slurries requires that they have low viscosity while remaining stable against settling of the particles due to gravity. These rheological properties of petcoke-water slurries were examined and modified using various additives. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was found to dramatically reduce the viscosity of the slurry by adsorbing to the petcoke particle surfaces and modifying the particle-particle interactions. PVA was as effective at reducing the viscosity as naphthalene sulfonate \u2013 the most widely used additive for reducing the viscosity of coal-water slurry fuels \u2013 without adding to the slurry the inorganic sulfur which is present in naphthalene sulfonate. The slurries with low viscosity exhibited poor stability against settling due to gravity. The addition of xanthan gum imparted shear-thinning behavior on the slurries, which allowed much improved stability. The combination of PVA and xanthan gum provides an inexpensive, effective, and environmentally-friendly method of modifying the rheological properties of petcoke-water slurries.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10658], "author_name_tesi": "Marchand, David Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Marchand", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim", "Darrell Velegol", "Kyle Jeffrey Magnuson Bishop", "Sarma V Pisupati"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim, Dissertation Advisor", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Kyle Jeffrey Magnuson Bishop, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["coal gasification", "petroleum coke", "slurry fuel"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Towards and Enterprise Level Measure of Security", "id": "19824", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9440", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vulnerabilities of Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure have grown at the similar pace (at least) as the sophistication and complexity of the technology that is the cornerstone of our IT enterprises.

That is, I consider not only the type of political representation offered by advocacy organizations, but also the factors that influence organizations\u2019 decisions to act on behalf of particular groups of citizens over others.  Given that previous research has shown that people facing socio-economic disadvantage have lower political participation rates than their more economically or socially-advantaged counterparts, the question of whether all people\u2019s voices are being heard in our democratic system remains unanswered.  Advocacy organizations play an important role in the political process, especially those organizations advocating on behalf of individuals who face some type of social or political disadvantage. \nHowever, one cannot be sure that all advocacy organizations faithfully represent the wishes of people facing disadvantage on multiple socio-political dimensions. For example, a low-income woman who is disadvantaged by both gender and class could theoretically receive representation from either a women\u2019s rights organization or a socio-economic justice group. What if neither organization advocates for issues affecting low-income women?  How, then, would this woman\u2019s interests be represented before government?  What factors compel groups to take on multifaceted issue agendas and what factors discourage them from doing so?  Who, exactly, is represented by advocacy organizations and why?\nI answer these questions using data I gathered through an original survey of over 200 advocacy organizations in 14 states across the U.S. I explore how state legislative and lobbying environments affect advocacy groups' policy agendas and also consider how factors internal to the organization (e.g. advocates' relationships with the people they represent) affect attention to the concerns of society's most disadvantaged individuals.  I ultimately find that conservatism within state legislatures negatively affects organizations\u2019 attention to the needs of marginalized people and that advocates\u2019 relationships with legislators also have a consistently negative effect on this type of advocacy. In addition, several variables that occur within the organizations themselves also affect advocates\u2019 propensity to engage in intersectional advocacy. These factors include advocates\u2019 communication with supporters, the demographic composition of group supporter networks, and the type of advocacy group in question. I also find that state lobbying context has no effect on intersectional advocacy across all model specifications. Overall, this study expands current understanding of the conditions under which groups act as true representatives for those traditionally marginalized in, and by, the political process.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8664], "author_name_tesi": "Marchetti, Kathleen Maeve", "last_name_ssi": "Marchetti", "middle_name_ssi": "Maeve", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marie Hojnacki", "Marie Hojnacki", "Lee Ann Banaszak", "David Lowery", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Forrest Scott Briscoe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marie Hojnacki, Dissertation Advisor", "Marie Hojnacki, Committee Chair", "Lee Ann Banaszak, Committee Chair", "David Lowery, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member", "Forrest Scott Briscoe, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Interest groups", "Representation", "Gender and Politics", "State Politics"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Abiotic and biotic factors affecting seed release and dispersal of the invasive thistles Carduus nutans and Carduus acanthoides\n", "id": "8993", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3330", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The effects of abiotic and biotic factors on seed release, seed dispersal, and population spread rates were examined for two invasive thistle species of economic concern, Carduus acanthoides L. and Carduus nutans L. (Asteraceae).  Damage to seed structures caused by storage time or shipping, resulting in increases in seed terminal velocities that would lead to underestimates of population spread, were quantified by treating one to five year old C. nutans capitula to non packaged, tightly packaged, or tightly packaged with crushing force treatments.  The validity of these treatments in mimicking shipment was verified with measurements of seed terminal velocities before and after shipping from New Zealand.  It was concluded that stored capitula up to five years old from demographic studies could be used to calculate unbiased population spread rates with new modeling techniques.  Biogeographic studies involving shipment of capitula should ensure proper packaging to avoid crushing forces that would increase measured seed terminal velocities.  \n\nA wind tunnel study measured seed release of C. acanthoides and C. nutans capitula collected under a range of field precipitation levels either immediately after collection or after one to two days of storage at temperatures of 10\u00b0C, 23\u00b0C, or 28\u00b0C with vapor pressure deficits of 3.4 mb, 9.5mb, and 17.0 mb respectively.  Capitula stored at higher temperatures and vapor pressure deficits released more seeds during wind tunnel trials, but the effect of field precipitation was not significant.  \n\nSeed release from C. acanthoides and C. nutans capitula with a range of natural florivory by a biological control agent, Rhinocyllus conicus, were also examined for seed release in a wind tunnel setting.  Terminal velocities of seeds, total seed production, and the number of seeds that remained stuck in capitulum receptacles after mechanical removal of loose seeds were quantified.  Empirical results showed significant reductions in seed production and seed release, with increases in seeds stuck in capitulum receptacles and terminal velocities for increasing R. conicus florivory, although estimates of seed terminal velocities for attacked C. acanthoides capitula could not be quantified due to heavy damage.  Population spread rates for C. nutans populations in the United States (US) and New Zealand (NZ) were generated using integrodifference models.  The results show a decrease in projected population spread rates with increasing R. conicus florivory, but different mechanisms were more important for each location.  Relative reductions in population growth rates and population spread rates were also different for the US and NZ.  \n\nA field study also addressed the effects of surrounding vegetation height, the number and density of conspecifics, and seed release height on wind speeds at focal plants for C. acanthoides and C. nutans.  Higher surrounding vegetation and lower capitulum heights lead to significant decreases in wind speeds.  Thistle patches with the most thistles and highest thistle density had lower wind speeds at the center of the patch than experienced by an isolated thistle, the more important of these factors being high thistle density.  Projected population spread rates for C. acanthoides and C. nutans were calculated for populations growing in extreme conditions of surrounding vegetation height and thistle density to understand how differences in wind speeds might affect population spread rates.  The same demographic population projection matrix was used for both species, so that only differences in dispersal capacities of the two species would be evaluated.  Population spread rates generated for both species were highest for populations in low surrounding vegetation with low thistle density, followed by low vegetation and high thistle density, high vegetation and low thistle density, and high vegetation and high thistle density.  Projected population spread rates for C. nutans were higher than those for C. acanthoides.  \n\nFinally, the fluid visualization technique, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), was explored for use in seed release studies.  PIV allows the visualization of velocity vectors from a 2D slice of an air flow.  Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n streets, vortices of air circulating at high speeds, were expected to be seen shedding from the wake of C. nutans capitula.  Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n streets are regions of high air circulation (vortices) that alternate in intensity over time and are shed downstream from the sides of an object under certain air flow conditions.  This vortex shedding is expected by theory and is expected to cause alternating lateral forces proportional to ambient wind speeds on capitula, which could affect seed release.  \n\nOverall this thesis demonstrates the strong impact that abiotic and biotic factors can have on seed release, and hence on seed dispersal and spread of these two wind-dispersed plants.  As both are non-native invaders, this thesis also highlights the need for explicitly stated management objectives, because management recommendations can vary depending on whether control of abundance or spread is most desired.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3316], "author_name_tesi": "Marchetto, Katherine Myers", "last_name_ssi": "Marchetto", "middle_name_ssi": "Myers", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katriona Shea", "Katriona Shea"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katriona Shea, Thesis Advisor", "Katriona Shea, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["population spread rates", "Rhinocyllus conicus", "wind dispersal", "seed release", "Carduus acanthoides", "Carduus nutans", "Particle Image Velocimetry"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Characterization of caffeoyl coenzyme A O-methyltransferase genes in maize   AND   The role of maysin in maize as a defense response to herbivory\n", "id": "12596", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2981", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "PART A:  Characterization of caffeoyl coenzyme A O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) genes in maize. CCoAOMT is an important enzyme in the lignin biosynthetic pathway that catalyzes the conversion of caffeoyl-CoA into feruloyl-CoA.  CCoAOMT activity has been linked to the production of guaiacyl lignin, one of the three types of monolignol subunits present in the cell wall.  Aspergillus flavus is a major pathogen of maize due to its production of aflatoxin B1, a potent mycotoxin linked to cancer incidence and developmental disorders in animals.  Previous studies involving two maize lines known for their resistance and susceptibility to A. flavus pathogenicity (Mp313E and Sc212M, respectfully) have shown CCoAOMT to be 66 times more abundant in the developing rachis tissue of Mp313E (r) than Sc212M (s).  Numerous studies suggest CCoAOMT is capable of altering both lignin composition and overall quantity within the cell wall, leading to the hypothesis that such differences affect cell wall digestibility and confer inherent resistance against A. flavus in Mp313E.  As of October 2011, 5 unique CCoAOMT genes are believed to exist within the maize genome, however only CCoAOMT 1 has been characterized.  Using template cDNA sequences from CCoAOMTs 2, 3, 4 and 5 retrieved on NCBI, CCoAOMTs 2, 3, 4 and 5 in Mp313E and Sc212M were amplified, cloned and sequenced from both gDNA and cDNA.  The final protein sequence for each CCoAOMT gene was deduced.  Nucleotide and amino acid alignments revealed few allelic differences across R and S genotypes.  An alignment among all four CCoAOMTs shows moderate amino acid variation while simultaneously demonstrating a high level of conservatism across each gene.  The most significant variation across CCoAOMT peptides occurs near the N-terminus.  The molecular weight and isoelectric point of each deduced protein was determined.  Further studies testing gene expression and enzyme activity are recommended to better characterize these four CCoAOMT genes and the subsequent enzymes they encode.\n\nPART B:  The role of maysin in maize as a defense response to herbivory. Lepidopteran pests are directly responsible for significant seed losses in maize annually.  Maysin is a C-glycosyl flavone produced primarily in silk tissue in a variety of maize lines.  First isolated and characterized in 1979, the accumulation of maysin in fresh silks has been reported to confer resistance against corn earworm.  Maysin\u2019s presumed conversion into \u201cmaysin-o-quinone\u201d in the presence of polyphenol oxidase results in its binding to key nucleophilic amino acids that subsequently become \u201cbiounavailable\u201d to the developing caterpillar, hence the caterpillar starves.  While numerous studies suggest that maysin is capable of hindering caterpillar growth at low concentrations (less than 1% by fresh weight composition), others refute this claim, presenting conflicting findings.  Using corn earworm (H. zea) and fall armyworm (S. frugiperda) as model organisms, artificial caterpillar diets supplemented with purified maysin at various concentrations were used to assess caterpillar growth in bioassays.  Potential interactive effects between maysin concentration, protein concentration, protein source (soy vs. casein) and caterpillar species were also examined.  Overall, maysin was found to significantly reduce caterpillar growth in both species at most tested concentrations (ranging from 0.1% to 0.5%).  No correlation between maysin concentration and mortality was established.  Interactive effects among any combinations of variables were not detected in any bioassay.  Corn earworm appeared better adapted to tolerate dietary maysin than fall armyworm, growing to about the same mass in the presence of 0.25% maysin as fall armyworm did in the presence of 0.1% maysin.  Collectively, this study suggests that maysin is capable of significantly hindering caterpillar growth, even at concentrations as little as 0.1% per fresh weight tissue.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2973], "author_name_tesi": "Marchinchin, Joseph Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Marchinchin", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dawn S Luthe", "Dawn S Luthe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dawn S Luthe, Thesis Advisor", "Dawn S Luthe, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["herbivory", "maysin", "predicted protein structure", "allelic differences", "S:G ratio", "lignin modification", "CCoAOMT", "antibiosis", "bioassays", "corn earworm", "fall armyworm", "maize"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Tourism in the Ecuadorian Amazon: Political Ecology, Cultural Commons, and Emic/Etic Understandings", "id": "14459awm5320", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14459", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tourism is among the largest global market forces driving social and environmental change in the Anthropocene.

The formation of these arrays is influenced by the biochemical and structural properties of microtubules; comprised mainly of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers, microtubules undergo stages of rapid shortening and slow elongation. This innate dynamic character, termed dynamic instability, allows microtubules to rapidly appear, disappear, and linger for various periods of time.\n    A group of auxiliary proteins, termed microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), regulate microtubule dynamicity and organization.  MAPs can be divided into two classes\u2013 structural MAPs and mechanochemical MAPs.  Structural MAPs play a role in microtubule morphology and assembly by affecting dynamic instability, while mechanochemical MAPs move along the microtubule and are required for intracellular transport and microtubule organization.\n    The work presented here has provided evidence that a MAP/microtubule interaction is necessary for stomatal opening. Stomata are found mainly on leaves and consist of a pair of guard cells that regulate gas exchange by opening and closing. Using different classes of microtubule inhibitors, we present data that is consistent with a model, whereby a MAP/microtubule interaction occurs in the early signaling events of stomatal opening. \n    I have also investigated the function of a putative mechanochemical MAP, ATK1, in mitosis and meiosis.

Here, I have confirmed this hypothesis by showing that ATK1 functions in spindle assembly during meiosis and mitosis. Furthermore, I have expressed the ATK1 protein and used it for in vitro assays.

The sieving coefficients well correlated with the product of the surface charge densities of the protein\nand membrane, consistent with a partitioning model accounting for electrostatic effects.\nThe apparent zeta potential of these zwitterionic membranes could be described using the\npKa values of an analog of the zwitterionic ligand accounting for the conversion of the\nprimary amine to a secondary amine through the chemical linkage. The zwitterionic\nmembranes showed minimal fouling even under conditions where the protein and\nmembrane had opposite charge, making them attractive in bioprocessing applications.\nThe effects of protein surface charge distribution were studied using model\nproteins with similar size but different amino acid composition and surface charge\ndistribution. The results demonstrated that the protein sieving coefficient is determined\nalmost entirely by the net surface charge density of the protein, irrespective of the\ndetailed distribution of charge groups over the protein surface. This behavior is very\ndifferent than that seen in ion-exchange chromatography where binding is determined by\nthe presence of localized charge patches.\nThe separation characteristics of the charge-modified membranes were also\nstudied using protein charge ladders, a set of covalently modified derivatives of a single\nprotein having different net charge. The selectivity increased with increasing membrane\nzeta potential, with a sharp decline in the sieving coefficient when the variant charge\nexceeded a critical value. These results have implications in the use of charge-modified\nmembranes for the separation of protein variants in large-scale downstream processing.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4494], "author_name_tesi": "Mardoukhi Rohani, Mahsa ", "last_name_ssi": "Mardoukhi Rohani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mahsa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Professor Andrew L Zydney", "Andrew Zydney", "Ali Borhan", "Themis Matsoukas", "Arnold Anthony Fontaine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Professor Andrew L Zydney, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Arnold Anthony Fontaine, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ultrafiltration", "Electrostatic Interactions", "Membrane Filtration", "Protein"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SOLANUM LYCOPERSICUM AS A MODEL SYSTEM TO STUDY PATHOGENICITY MECHANISMS OF MONILIOPHTHORA PERNICIOSA, THE CAUSAL AGENT OF WITCHES' BROOM DISEASE OF THEOBROMA CACAO\n\n", "id": "8797", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3087", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Theobroma cacao produces cocoa beans, an essential ingredient for the production of chocolate. This research focuses on enhancing disease resistance in Theobroma cacao via two approaches: The first approach targeted improved understanding of the pathogenicity mechanisms of Moniliophthora perniciosa, the causal agent of witches\u2019 broom disease because of its economical impact in South America and the potential threat to unaffected areas in other continents.  The second approach involved identifying tomato varieties that differentially interact with M. perniciosa to study mechanisms of pathogenesis and resistance toward the goal of making tomato as a surrogate model for cacao witches\u2019 broom. Certain strains of M. perniciosa can infect wild and cultivated solanaceous plants, including Solanum lycopersicum (tomato), which allowed the advantage and convenience of working with an annual plant and make use of the numerous genetic and genomic resources available from tomato plants. The primary goal in this thesis was to elucidate cellular and physiological mechanisms underlying the establishment of fungal biotrophy. The research strongly suggests that during the biotrophic stage, the fungus causes cell multiplication and cell enlargement leading to swelling of stem and petioles. Consistent with these cellular changes, using an auxin reporter system (DR5-GUS) transgenically introduced to a susceptible tomato plant, an overproduction of auxin was found at the sites of infection.  To discover new sources of resistance against M. perniciosa in tomato, S. habrochaites, a wild relative of S. lycopersicon, and near isogenic lines (NILs) derived from a cross between them were screened. Solanum habrochaites can block the establishment of biotrophy. One hundred tomato NILs containing different chromosomal sections of the genome of S. habrochaites in a S. lycopersicon background were the source for identifying genome regions of S. habrochaites that contribute to the observed resistance against M. perniciosa. A strong QTL for disease severity (P<0.05), shoot diameter (P<0.001), and shoot fresh and dry weight (P<0.0001) was detected on the short arm of chromosome one. This genomic region contains a cluster of genes for resistance against the fungal biotrophic pathogen Cladosporium fulvum.

Green-colored species, which make bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) c or d as their primary antenna BChl and chlorobactene as their main carotenoid, tend to be found in the upper layer of anaerobic photic zones. Brown-colored species, which make BChl e and the dicyclic carotenoid isorenieratene, are usually found deeper in the water column. These pigment pairs are invariant, which means that for a green species to become a brown one or vice versa, changes in two unrelated biosynthetic pathways must occur. In this work, comparative genomics has been used to identify the genes unique to pigment biosynthesis in green-colored and brown-colored green sulfur bacterial species. The gene encoding the C-20 methyltransferase, responsible for the difference between BChls c and d, has been identified and inactivated, and detailed analysis of BChl c- and d- producing strains has provided a molecular explanation for the observation that BChl c-containing species tend to live in darker environments. Additionally, a cluster of genes found exclusively in the genomes of brown-colored GSB species has been identified, and fragments of this cluster have been inserted into the chromosome of Chlorobium (Chl.) tepidum to investigate their role in BChl e biosynthesis. Using phylogenetic profiling, carotenoid cyclases specific to chlorobactene or isorenieratene biosynthesis were identified. These cyclases are responsible for the difference between mono- and dicyclic carotenoids, and their activity has been characterized both in GSB and in a heterologous expression system in Escherichia coli. Based on these analyses, the biosynthetic pathway for chlorobactene was established and a similar pathway for isorenieratene biosynthesis is demonstrated. Lastly, analysis of genome regions has identified chlorobactene-modifying enzymes which synthesize the membrane-associated OH-chlorobactene acyl glycosides in both green-colored and brown-colored GSB. These genes have been inactivated in Chl. tepidum and their roles in synthesizing glycosylated and acylated carotenoids have been confirmed. The investigations described in this work explain the genetic basis for stratification of green-colored species in the environment, complete the biosynthetic pathway for chlorobactene, identify the first known isorenieratene-specific carotenoid cyclase, and explain some of the natural variation in carotenoid end products seen in different species of green sulfur bacteria.  Four of these proteins, the carotenoid cyclases, the carotenoid glycosyltransferase, and the carotenoid acyltransferase, are the first-characterized members of what appear to be large families of carotenoid-modifying enzymes. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2512], "author_name_tesi": "Maresca, Julia A.", "last_name_ssi": "Maresca", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Julia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Ashley Bryant", "John H Golbeck", "Sarah Ellen Ades", "Squire J Booker", "Lee Kump"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Ashley Bryant, Committee Chair", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member", "Sarah Ellen Ades, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Lee Kump, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["green sulfur bacteria", "bacteriochlorophyll", "carotenoids", "genomic comparisons", "pigment biosynthesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Runoff and soil loss from laboratory plots covered with rolled erosion control products impregnated with polyacrylamides and gypsum", "id": "19402", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9160", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study evaluated the effectiveness of polyacrylamide (PAM) and PAM plus gypsum treatments on the effectiveness of coconut straw and coconut-wheat straw rolled erosion control products (RECPs) in reducing runoff, sediment, and turbidity losses from small soil plots.

Member commitment and member satisfaction are documented (Cotteril, 2002; Fullerton, 2005; Bhruynis, 2001) key factors critical to the success of organizations. These two factors influence and are in turn influenced by the structure of an organization. This study uses the Allen and Meyer (1996) measure of organizational commitment to examine how committed Murang\u2019a Nutri-business cooperative members are to their organization. For this study commitment was further operationally defined as including affective commitment (Cronbach\u2019s alpha reliability=0.9) and continuance commitment (Cronbach\u2019s alpha= 0.8). Participants responses to each of the items on the subscale were recorded using a 5-point Likert response scale ((1=Strongly Disagree, 2=Disagree, 3=Undecided, 4=Agree, 5=Strongly Agree). Thus the higher mean summated value represents greater commitment.  Previous research documented that affective commitment contributes positively to the success of an organization while continuance commitment acts negatively. Results of the study reveal that Murang\u2019a Nutri-business cooperative members overall affective commitment was 3.6 on a 5-point Likert response scale. Continuance commitment overall was 3.0 on a 5-point Likert response scale. Examining results by position, affective commitment of leaders (4.9) was much higher than that of members (3.2). Continuance commitment was relatively the same for leaders and members. \nPrimary factors that influence satisfaction are cooperative principle factors, organizational factors and operating management factors (Bhruynis, 2001; Rankin, 2007)). Variables found to significantly influence member satisfaction were identified and studied. Results of the study reveal relatively low satisfaction of members (2.2 on a 5-point Likert scale) compared to that of leaders (3.7on a 5-point Likert scale). \nThis study draws on institutional economics theories of transaction cost, property rights and agency theory (Schmid, 2004; Zeuli, 2004; Royer, 2004; Borland & Coltrand, 2001; Illiopoulos & Cook, 1999; Schmid, 2004) to identify the optimal structure for Murang\u2019a  Nutri-business cooperative. Additionally, New generation Cooperative alternative structure identified by Chaddad and Cook (2004) offers further insights into the choice of structure that the Murang\u2019a Nutri-business cooperative could adopt to ensure higher member commitment and member satisfaction.\nResults of the study indicate that the Murang\u2019a Nutribusiness Cooperative requires a structure with well defined property rights to increase member incentives and consequently member commitment. Member business volume and participation in the cooperative\u2019s activities is low. These results indicate that the cooperative needs capacity strengthening to address management, organizational and operational factors. The cooperative members require training in technical and non-technical training including developing business plans and marketing strategies. The cooperative members also require education on cooperative principles to enable them fulfill their roles responsibilities and obligations to the cooperative.\n A support network of government, non-governmental and private sector development practitioners and stakeholders is necessary to help the cooperative grow and become sustainable for the benefit of members and society.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4253], "author_name_tesi": "Marete, Mary-Alice Mukiri", "last_name_ssi": "Marete", "middle_name_ssi": "Mukiri", "first_name_ssi": "Mary-Alice", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan S Thomson", "Joan S Thomson", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Leland Luther Glenna", "Theodore Roberts Alter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan S Thomson, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan S Thomson, Committee Chair", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Leland Luther Glenna, Committee Member", "Theodore Roberts Alter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["satisfaction", "organization", "cooperative", "commitment", "success"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Modelling of electronic and vibrational properties of carbon nanostructures\n", "id": "7482", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1846", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The main goals of this dissertation work are the analysis and prediction of\nthe properties of nanoscale carbon materials which hold great potential for\nnanotechnological applications such as strong conductive composites,\nfield-effect transistors, diodes, rechargeable batteries, etc. Some of these\nexciting applications are already being actively developed, however their\ndesign via trial-and-error experimentation is often difficult and\nexpensive. State-of-the-art simulation methods can be used as a\npowerful tool to streamline the path to practical implementations. In\nthis thesis I use emph{ab initio} quantum-mechanical calculations to explore\nthe response of nanoscale carbon materials to doping. A brief overview of\nthe theoretical methods and of some basic concepts on carbon nanotubes\nare given in the first two chapters.\n\nIn Chapter 3 we study the effect of doping in double-walled carbon nanotubes.\nThese systems can be considered as nanoscale capacitors since they have two\nconducting (or semi-conducting) shells. The experimental work of our\ncollaborators demonstrated for the first time that such a capacitor can be\nrealized by the adsorption of bromine anions at the surface of the outer tube.\nOur theoretical analysis of the experimental results revealed that this quantum\nsystem, surprisingly, behaves exactly as the classical Faraday cage: the\nelectric charge always resides on the outside surface of the conductor, even\nwhen the pristine tubes are not metallic.\n\nIn Chapter 4 I present our findings on the phonon frequencies' response to\nelectron doping in single-walled carbon nanotubes. It is well established that\nwhen graphite is doped with electrons, carbon-carbon bonds lengthen and all\nvibrational frequencies soften. However, in semiconducting carbon nanotubes,\nthe frequency of one mode {it increases} at low levels of alkali doping.\nHaving carefully modelled the process with {it ab initio} methods we conclude\nthat the unusual behavior of the vibrational mode depends on which electronic\nstates are filled first in a given nanotube and therefore this is a direct\nmanifestation of the quantum confinement of electronic states in quasi-one\ndimensional nanotubes.\n\nIn Chapter 5 we analyze the behavior of the nearly free electron states in\ncarbon nanotubes.  We demonstrate that the rapid decrease in these states'\nenergy under electron doping occurs not because of their hybridization with\nvalence states of the alkali dopant as previously thought, but due to a\nuniversal electrostatic mechanism. We show that the nearly free state, being\nweakly bound to the tube wall, is extraordinarily labile and distorts\ndramatically to concentrate in the region of highest positive countercharge.\nTherefore, by taking advantage of the changes in the surrounding environment,\nthe nearly free states may become occupied at unexpectedly low doping levels\nand play an important role in the transport properties of electron-doped\ncarbon nanotubes.\n\nExperimental results have shown that elemental cesium induces graphitization\nof nanoporous carbon at very low temperatures. In Chapter 6\nwe propose a compact representative model of nanoporous carbon constructed\nfully from $sp^2$-connected atoms. Next, we investigate possible mechanisms of\nits transformation towards graphitization in the presence of dopants. Our\nresults suggest that in addition to the alkali atoms there must be another\nchemical agent involved in this intriguing low-temperature transformation.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1830], "author_name_tesi": "Margine, Elena Roxana", "last_name_ssi": "Margine", "middle_name_ssi": "Roxana", "first_name_ssi": "Elena", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter C Eklund", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Henry C Foley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter C Eklund, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Chair", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Henry C Foley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electronic structure", "nanoporous carbon", "carbon nanotube", "phonons", "doping"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "We Are Not in Sync, But We Think We Are: Actual versus Perceived Temporal Team Mental Models", "id": "15016jtm40", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15016", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Team mental model (TMM) research thus far has yet to consider the impact a team\u2019s perceived\nTMM similarity has on performance outcomes beyond the typically measured actual TMM\nsharedness.

This was studied for a variety of Zr:Ti ratios by analyzing the local piezoelectric response using band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy. Measurements were conducted on a variety of tilt and twist bicrystals with angles ranging from 10\u00b0 to 30\u00b0. For the >15\u00b0 tilt and \u226510\u00b0 twist grain boundaries, a local minimum in the nonlinear response was observed at the grain boundary. The 10\u00b0 tilt grain boundaries exhibited a maximum nonlinear response at the grain boundary.\nVariations in the nonlinear response at a 24\u00b0 tilt grain boundary was measured for three different Zr:Ti ratios. Films with a ratio of 20:80, far into the tetragonal regime, exhibited a complex distribution of nonlinear response alternating between low and high with distance from the grain boundary. Films with a ratio of 45:55 and 52:48, tetragonal and near morphotropic phase boundary rhombohedral, respectively, exhibited a minimum in nonlinear response at the grain boundary neighbored by a maximum in nonlinear response.\n\nThe nonlinear response was correlated to the domain structure. The domain structure was characterized before and after poling using piezoresponse force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the domain structure was controlled by the local strain and electric field for the largest angle grain boundaries. Domain walls were pinned at the grain boundary by the local strain and electric field. At 360-650 nm from the grain boundary, domain wall \u2013 domain wall interactions dominated the nonlinear response. A smaller width of reduced nonlinear response for the film with Zr:Ti ratio of 52:48 was attributed to enhanced relaxation of the local strain and electric field due to the small ~6 nm domain size.\n\nPhase field models were used to determine the primary factors involved in forming domains at large angle tilt grain boundaries. The models suggest that domains form to minimize the local change in strain across the grain boundary, explaining correlated domain organization in neighboring grains previously observed by piezoresponse force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. However, strain compatibility could not account for the observed formation of head to head domain structures observed at the grain boundary for Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3; it is believed that these are stabilized by built-in charge or additional stress compensation.\n\nIt was demonstrated that the pinning for 24\u00b0 tilt angle grain boundaries influences domain wall motion over a longer lateral distance (0.45 \u2013 0.80 \u03bcm) than 30\u00b0 twist angle grain boundaries (~0.35 \u03bcm). Additionally, the pinning energy reduced with the grain boundary angle. The maximum in nonlinear response observed for small angle tilt grain boundaries (\u2264 10\u00b0) was attributed to an increased concentration of low energy pinning sites reducing the reversible response and increasing the irreversible response. Similarly, minimal variation in the nonlinear response was observed at the grain boundary for intermediate grain boundary angles (15\u00b0 tilt) due to the grain boundary energy being similar to other defects present in the film.\n\nA furnace providing a controlled PbO atmosphere was developed so that the effect of PbO defects on the functional properties of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 could be determined. Minimal variation in the permittivity, Rayleigh parameters, and aging rates was observed for films with a range of PbO contents. A decreasing remanent polarization was observed with increasing PbO content in minor polarization \u2013 electric field hysteresis loops. An increase in the area of low nonlinear response regions with decreasing PbO content was measured by band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy. This suggests that PbO deficiencies act to reduce domain wall motion where it is already low.

Disciplined product development has been a hallmark of mature companies for decades, resulting in shorter development cycles, reduced costs, and higher quality products.  For early-stage firms, detailed investigation into their NPD processes is lacking.  This dissertation focuses on NPD of start-ups and early-stage companies and is divided into three parts.  The first is a comprehensive survey and analysis of 35 firms, which details the NPD methods actually used by start-ups, both successful and unsuccessful.  Independent variables include the use of cross-functional teams, market planning, industrial design, product platforms, cost accounting, and limited phase-gate management. What was found is that early-stage firms using the core development principles experienced positive results in firm performance.  The second part of the dissertation is a detailed case study of three start-ups.  The case studies include historical case information provided by the Innovation Factory, Accentra (PaperPro), and KCF Technologies (KCF).  The third and final part of the dissertation introduces a novel product development process for improving NPD within early-stage companies that is demonstrated with a case study from industry.

In the first experiment, Holstein heifers were used to examine the potential of 13C-VFA to quantify ruminal VFA metabolism in the rumen of dairy cattle under ruminal steady state conditions. Labeled VFA (Na-1-13C-acetate (Ac), -propionate (Pr), or \u2013butyrate (Bu) were infused at employing the single infusion technique (infusion at t0) into the rumen of four rumen cannulated Holstein heifers fed either a low (25%) or a high (70%) concentrate diet. To insure steady state conditions, heifers were gradually adjusted from two equal sized meals daily to 12 meals the day before and the day of the experiment. Tracer was administered by dispersing a bolus dose into the rumen over a 1-min period followed by thorough mixing of rumen contents by hand. Between 30 min and 8 h after tracer administration, 26 individual well mixed ruminal fluid samples were used to determine tracer/tracee+tracer ratios (TTR) by GLC-mass spectrometry. Natural log plots of 13C dilution and disappearance from the three acids were all linear showing that each individual acid acted as a single pool in the rumen. Neither Pr nor Bu showed significant transfer of C to each other. Kinetic curves for %TTR of Ac and Pr during the labeled Ac infusion showed a small trace of 13C transferred from Ac to Pr resulting in a contribution of Ac into Pr of 6.8% and 5.5% for the low and high concentrate diets, respectively. The transfer of 13C from Ac to Pr is likely the result of CO2 fixation. Incorporation of Ac into Bu occurred at the rate of 2.87 mol/d and 3.54 mol/d accounting for 28% and 38% of the total Bu production in the low and high concentrate diets, respectively. There was a negligible amount of Bu converted to Ac in the rumen regardless of the diet fed to the heifers. A portion of the valerate clearly came from 13C-Ac. The results of this study demonstrate that the production rates of Pr and either Ac or Bu can be measured simultaneously. These results show that 1) steady state production rates and interconversions of VFAs in the rumen can be accurately determined by using 13C - tracers and 2) two acids e.g. Ac and Pr or Bu and Pr can be determined concurrently.\nIn the second experiment, eight multiparous periparturient Holstein cows in a completely randomized design were used to evaluate the effects of monensin on ruminal VFA and plasma glucose metabolism. Cows received the same diet consisting of 58:42 or of 51:49 (forage:concentrate) prepartum or postpartum, respectively. Diets were supplemented with 300 mg/d of monensin or no monensin. VFA isotopic tracers (Na-1-13C-Ac, Na-1-13C-Pr, or Na-1-13C-Bu) were used as markers to describe VFA kinetics in the rumen. 45 mg of U-13C-Glucose was injected into the jugular vein for glucose kinetic determination. WinSAAM, the Windows version of ConSAAM, was used to develop a steady state VFA and blood glucose model. A 14-compartment model was adequate to comprehensively describe ruminal VFA and blood glucose metabolism. The main VFA compartments consisted of Ac, Pr, and Bu. Interconversions between Ac and Bu were estimated by assigning virtual compartments which accumulated C atoms from the donor compartment i.e. Ac, to deliver them to the recipient compartment i.e. Bu. Plasma glucose is comprised of two parallel comparments; the compartment into which U-13C-Glucose was infused (sampling site), and a compartment that obtained glucose synthesized from ruminal Pr. The model was capable of describing VFA and plasma glucose kinetics. However, glucose pools were not accurately estimated due to the concurrent application of Na-1-13C-Pr and U-13C-Glucose. The model estimated lower butyrate and Ac interconversions with monensin fed postpartum (Bu to Ac; 14% vs 12%; P=0.04, and Ac to Bu; 32% vs. 25%; P=0.11). Glucose input from other sources than Pr decreased with monensin fed postpartum (2.26 g/min vs. 1.09 g/min). Gluconeogenesis, expressed as Pr contribution to plasma glucose pool was higher in cows fed monensin (P=0.06; 22% vs. 31%), but the glucose disposal rate decreased for cows provided monensin (P=0.001; 1.67 g/min vs. 0.92 g/min). The proposed model adequately described and integrated ruminal VFA and blood glucose kinetics, resulting in accurate quantification of VFA and glucose metabolism. Results suggest that monensin 1) decreased Bu conversion to Ac, 2) increased Pr contribution to plasma glucose, and 3) reduced glucose disposal rate in transition cows.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6633], "author_name_tesi": "Markantonatos, Xenophon ", "last_name_ssi": "Markantonatos", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xenophon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gabriella Anne Varga", "Ronald Scott Kensinger", "Lawrence Dean Muller", "Michael Henry Green"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gabriella Anne Varga, Committee Chair", "Ronald Scott Kensinger, Committee Member", "Lawrence Dean Muller, Committee Member", "Michael Henry Green, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Monensin", "Volatile fatty acid metabolism", "Glucose metabolism", "Kinetics", "Gluconeogenesis", "Transition cows"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PHARMACOLOGICAL INHIBITION OF THE TGF-BETA TYPE I RECEPTOR REVEALS A DUAL ROLE OF TGF-BETA IN CARCINOGENESIS\n\n\n", "id": "11358", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3790", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a member of a large family of regulatory molecules that play both positive and negative roles in epithelial cancer. Pharmacological inhibitors of the Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) type I receptor (ALK5) have shown promise in blocking growth of xenotransplanted cancer cell lines but the effect on a multistage cancer model is not known. In the present studies, the role of the ALK5 inhibitor SB431542 (SB) was investigated in a two-stage skin chemical carcinogenesis assay in order to determine the effect on tumor formation and progression. In this model, nearly all tumors have activating mutations in codon 61 of the HRas gene. We show that topical SB significantly reduced the total number, incidence and size of papillomas compared to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) promotion alone, and this was linked to increased epidermal apoptosis, decreased proliferation and decreased cutaneous inflammation during promotion. In contrast, the frequency of conversion to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was two-fold higher in papillomas treated with SB. While there was no difference in tumor cell proliferation in early premalignant lesions, those that formed after SB treatment exhibited reduced squamous differentiation and an altered inflammatory microenvironment similar to SCC. In an inducible epidermal HRAS transgenic model, treatment with SB enhanced proliferation and cutaneous inflammation in skin, but decreased expression of keratin 1 and increased expression of simple epithelial keratin 18, markers of premalignant progression. In agreement with increased frequency of progression in the multistage model, SB treatment resulted in increased tumor formation with a more malignant phenotype following long-term HRAS induction. To further characterize the altered squamous differentiation associated with reduced tumor formation and increased malignant progression by ALK5 inhibition, an HRAS oncogene-induced model of preneoplastic keratinocytes was utilized. SB significantly enhanced HRAS-induced cornification which correlated with the increased expression of terminal differentiation genes transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) and 3 (TGM3) and small proline-rich protein 1A (SPR1A) and 2H (SPR2H) which cross-link structural proteins that make up the cornified envelope. There was a similar increase in cornified layers and TGM and SPR gene expression following SB treatment of mice expressing inducible epidermal HRAS. Alternatively, treatment of HRAS-expressing keratinocytes with TGF-beta 1 or overexpression of TGF-beta 1 and HRAS in an inducible epidermal transgenic model resulted in reduced expression of TGM1 and TGM3 and cornification in vitro. Papilloma (SP1) and squamous cell carcinoma (PAM2.12) cell lines were less responsive to TGF-beta 1 suppression of markers and marker induction by SB. Interestingly, a subpopulation of HRAS-expressing keratinocytes were resistant to induction of terminal differentiation by ALK5 inhibition. These cells were also resistant to senescence and rapidly immortalized, suggesting that they represent a progressed phenotype. However, these cells were unable to grow in elevated calcium or produce tumors after grafting nude mice indicating that they were not fully malignant. Thus, selective responsiveness to differentiation may represent a mechanism by which blocked TGF-beta signaling can inhibit the outgrowth of preneoplastic lesions but may cause a more progressed phenotype in a separate keratinocyte population. Collectively, these data support the concept that a large number of initiated keratinocytes are dependent on ALK5 signaling for enhanced tumor outgrowth. A second subset can form tumors in part through generation of an altered inflammatory microenvironment and through altered squamous differentiation induced by inhibition of ALK5. This latter group has a higher frequency of malignant conversion. In contrast to the current paradigm for TGF-beta 1 in carcinogenesis, these results demonstrate that cutaneous TGF-beta 1 signaling enables promotion of benign tumors but suppresses premalignant progression through context-dependent regulation of epidermal homeostasis and inflammation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3768], "author_name_tesi": "Markell, Lauren Mordasky", "last_name_ssi": "Markell", "middle_name_ssi": "Mordasky", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adam Bleier Glick", "Adam Bleier Glick", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Gary H Perdew", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adam Bleier Glick, Dissertation Advisor", "Adam Bleier Glick, Committee Chair", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["skin", "skin carcinogenesis", "TGF-beta", "chemically-induced carcinogenesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Development of a knowledge base of Ti-alloys from first-principles and thermodynamic modeling", "id": "14198cnk118", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14198", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An aging population with an active lifestyle requires the development of better load-bearing implants, which have high levels of biocompatibility and a low elastic modulus. Titanium alloys, in the body centered cubic phase, are great implant candidates, due to their mechanical properties and biocompatibility. The present work aims at investigating the thermodynamic and elastic properties of bcc Ti-alloys, using the integrated first-principles based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) method. The use of integrated first-principles calculations based on DFT and CALPHAD modeling has greatly reduced the need for trial and error metallurgy, which is ineffective and costly. The phase stability of Ti-alloys has been shown to greatly affect their elastic properties. Traditionally, CALPHAD modeling has been used to predict the equilibrium phase formation, but in the case of Ti-alloys, predicting the formation of two metastable phases $\\omega$ and $\\alpha\"$ is of great importance as these phases also drastically effect the elastic properties. To build a knowledge base of Ti-alloys, for biomedical load-bearing implants, the Ti-Mo-Nb-Sn-Ta-Zr system was studied because of the biocompatibility and the bcc stabilizing effects of some of the elements.\n\nWith the focus on bcc Ti-rich alloys, a database of thermodynamic descriptions of each phase for the pure elements, binary and Ti-rich ternary alloys was developed in the present work. Previous thermodynamic descriptions for the pure elements were adopted from the widely used SGTE database for global compatibility. The previous binary and ternary models from the literature were evaluated for accuracy and new thermodynamic descriptions were developed when necessary. The models were evaluated using available experimental data, as well as the enthalpy of formation of the bcc phase obtained from first-principles calculations based on DFT. The thermodynamic descriptions were combined into a database ensuring that the sublattice models are compatible with each other.\n\nFor subsystems, such as the Sn-Ta system, where no thermodynamic description had been evaluated and minimal experimental data was available, first-principles calculations based on DFT were used. The Sn-Ta system has two intermetallic phases, TaSn$_{2}$ and Ta$_{3}$Sn, with three solution phases: bcc, body centered tetragonal (bct) and diamond. First-principles calculations were completed on the intermetallic and solution phases. Special quasirandom structures (SQS) were used to obtain information about the solution phases across the entire composition range. The Debye-Gr\\\"uneisen approach, as well as the quasiharmonic phonon method, were used to obtain the finite-temperature data. Results from the first-principles calculations and experiments were used to complete the thermodynamic description. The resulting phase diagram reproduced the first-principles calculations and experimental data accurately.\n\nIn order to determine the effect of alloying on the elastic properties, first-principles calculations based on DFT were systematically done on the pure elements, five Ti-X binary systems and Ti-X-Y ternary systems (X $\\neq $ Y = Mo, Nb, Sn, Ta Zr) in the bcc phase. The first-principles calculations predicted the single crystal elastic stiffness constants $c_{ij}$'s. Correspondingly, the polycrystalline aggregate properties were also estimated from the $c_{ij}$'s, including bulk modulus $B$, shear modulus $G$ and Young's modulus $E$. The calculated results showed good agreement with experimental results. The CALPHAD method was then adapted to assist in the database development of the elastic properties as a function of composition. On average, the database predicted the elastic properties of higher order Ti-alloys within 5 GPa of the experimental results.\n\nFinally, the formation of the metastable phases, $\\omega$ and $\\alpha\"$ was studied in the Ti-Ta and Ti-Nb systems. The formation energy of these phases, calculated from first-principles at 0 K, showed that the phases have similar formation energies to the bcc and hcp phases. Inelastic neutron scattering was completed on four different Ti-Nb compositions to study the entropy of the phases as well as the transformations occurring when the phases form and the phase fractions. Ongoing work is being done to use the experimental information to introduce thermodynamic descriptions for these two phases in the Ti-Nb system in order to be able to predict the formation and phase fractions. DFT based first-principles were used to predict the effect these phases have on the elastic properties and a rule of mixtures was used to determine the elastic properties of multi-phase alloys. The results were compared with experiments and showed that if the ongoing modeling can predict the phase fraction, the elastic database can accurately predict the elastic properties of the $\\omega$ and $\\alpha\"$ phases.\n\nThis thesis provides a knowledge base of the thermodynamic and elastic properties of Ti-alloys from computational thermodynamics. The databases created will impact research activities on Ti-alloys and specifically efforts focused on Ti-alloys for biomedical applications.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14821], "author_name_tesi": "Marker, Cassie Lou", "last_name_ssi": "Marker", "middle_name_ssi": "Lou", "first_name_ssi": "Cassie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi-Kui Liu", "Zi-Kui Liu", "Allison Michelle Beese", "Susan B Sinnott", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "Michael Manley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi-Kui Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Zi-Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Allison Michelle Beese, Committee Member", "Susan B Sinnott, Committee Member", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Outside Member", "Michael Manley, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Titanium", "CALPHAD", "DFT", "Biomaterials", "first-principles", "thermodynamics", "mechanical properties"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Potatoes for Human Health: Effects of Cultivar and Processing on Nutritional Composition of White- and Color-fleshed Potatoes", "id": "26305", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11252", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Potatoes are one of the most important sources of nutrition worldwide, providing energy, essential vitamins and minerals, as well as important dietary phytochemicals. Rising incidence of chronic disease has been associated with the Western diet and lifestyle, and improving the health-benefitting potential of our food supply is one way to address this epidemic. Given the popularity and availability of potatoes and potato products, improving their nutritional profiles with the aim of chronic disease prevention has great potential to improve human health. In pursuit of this effort, it is important to understand how factors from farm to fork affect potato nutritional composition. We investigated effects of two main factors, cultivar and processing, on several health-related constituents of potatoes including starch (macronutrient), vitamin C (micronutrient), metabolite profiles and select phytochemicals, glycoalkaloids (endogenous toxins) and acrylamide (processing-induced toxin). Because colored-fleshed potatoes have demonstrated greater health benefits and are becoming more popular, we used two white-, two red-, and two purple-fleshed varieties to look at cultivar differences. Potatoes are almost always cooked before consumption, so we compared effects of six common processing techniques: raw, steamed, microwaved, baked, French-fried, and potato chips. Overall, processing had the greatest effect on the potato nutritional components investigated, though cultivar and interaction effects were also significant. Moist heat processing methods generally resulted in greater in vitro starch digestibility compared to dry heat processing methods; however, chips and French fries contribute more dietary glucose per unit weight due to greater total starch (TS) content. Colored-fleshed potatoes showed similar in vitro starch digestibility to white-fleshed potatoes across processing methods indicating polyphenol content did not significantly affect starch digestibility. Vitamin C was significantly reduced after processing; steamed, microwaved, and baked samples had similar vitamin C contents, while chips and French fries had the lowest vitamin C contents. Our use of metabolomics was a powerful compliment to the targeted analyses of single compounds; we were able to see overall changes in global metabolite profiles, which included over 15,000 compounds. Overall metabolite profiles were affected similarly to vitamin C; steamed, microwaved, and baked metabolite profiles were more similar to each other, while chips and French fries demonstrated greater differences. Glycoalkaloid levels were lowest in French fries, chips, and steamed potatoes, likely due to leaching in water and oil, and acrylamide was only formed by the dry heat processing methods; both toxins were within acceptable ranges. Colored-fleshed potatoes had overall greater health rankings than white-fleshed potatoes. Significant cultivar and interaction effects suggest some cultivar processing method combinations may be better suited for specific desired outcomes. Together, these findings contribute to our understanding of farm-to-fork factors affecting the health- benefitting potential of potatoes. This type of holistic perspective can inform individuals at every level of the food system, from breeders and producers to consumers, enabling more effective improvements in the healthfulness of potatoes and potato products.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10793], "author_name_tesi": "Markham, Laura Elise", "last_name_ssi": "Markham", "middle_name_ssi": "Elise", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jairam Kp Vanamala", "Gregory Ray Ziegler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jairam Kp Vanamala, Thesis Advisor", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["potato", "nutrition", "phytochemical", "metabolomics", "farm to fork"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "MACROPHAGE SELENOPROTEINS RESTRICT INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION OF FRANCISELLA TULARENSIS ", "id": "13829rlm327", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13829", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The micronutrient selenium (Se) has been suggested as a promising adjuvant for pharmaconutrient intervention in clinical applications.  Use of Se in cancer research and for viral infections has been well documented.  It has been less well defined in bacterial infections.  The application of the micronutrient as a novel therapeutic is rooted in the fact that adequate and supplemental levels of Se are required to maintain optimal expression of selenoproteins.  Selenoproteins are a particular class of proteins which contain Se in the form of the amino acid, selenocysteine. It has been well established that deficiency of Se is deleterious to human health, and in the last two decades a large body of work has been published correlating deficiency with individuals suffering from chronic and in a small number of cases acute bacterial infections. Moreover, the increased interest of pharmaconutrient intervention using Se supplementation to improve patient outcome has been supported by evidence that selenoproteins are important mediators of inflammation. Of the 25 selenoproteins expressed in humans and 24 expressed in mice over half perform antioxidant or redox function.  In addition to maintaining redox homeostasis, selenoproteins have also been attributed to a wide array of other bimolecular functions vital to immune response.  Some that have been more clearly defined then others. \nI was particularly interested in addressing the role of selenoproteins during acute infection, specifically understanding how these proteins influenced macrophages a subset cells that are part of the innate immune response.  Macrophages are important mediators of immune defenses against bacteria and have the capacity for bactericidal activity.  Therefore, I investigated the effect of Se and selenoproteins on macrophages function during an acute intracellular bacterial infection. Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, is an intracellular bacterium that preferentially infects phagocytes. I have determined that F. tularensis lacks the metabolic machinery to specifically incorporate Se into its proteome and the inability to accumulate elemental selenium in its biomass, which indicates the bacteria, is unable to utilize Se.  Furthermore, empirical data I have collected shows that Se supplementation does not affect the physiology of the bacteria.  For these reasons, F. tularensis is ideally suited to investigate the effects of Se on macrophages during acute bacterial infection. Upon entry into a host cell, F. tularensis is able to escape the phagosomal compartment, and initiate replication, multiplying approximately 50 to 100 fold within 24 hours. \nTo determine the effect of Se on F. tularensis infection, groups of mice were maintained on Se-deficient (<0.01 ppm of Na2SO3) or Se-supplemented (0.4 ppm Na2SO3) defined diets. While 50% of Se-supplemented mice died following infection with F. tularensis, 100% of Se-deficient mice succumbed suggesting that Se plays a significant role in protection from infection. Since, F. tularensis infects and replicates primarily in macrophages, I investigated the bacterial replication in Se-deficient (treated with 0 nM of Na2SO3) and Se-supplemented (200 nM of Na2SO3) macrophages. Interestingly, Se-supplemented macrophages restricted bacterial growth by about 20 fold compared to Se-deficient cells. Next, the role of selenoproteins in restricting bacterial growth was tested by using the macrophages derived from TrspM mice, which are unable to synthesize selenoproteins in macrophages. TrspM macrophages were unable to control the replication of F. tularensis compared to wild-type (WT) macrophages. Consistent with these results, TrspM mice were significantly more susceptible to F. tularensis infection than WT mice. Furthermore, bacterial burden in the livers and spleens of TrspM mice were significantly higher than WT mice indicating that macrophage selenoproteins are essential for restricting bacterial replication and promoting host survival.  \nGiven that F. tularensis temporally activates the host\u2019s autophagy pathway to meet its nutrients and energy requirements during the proliferative phase, and aid in host immune evasion. I examined the expression of autophagy markers in the Se-deficient and Se-supplemented macrophages. The data indicated that Se supplementation suppressed autophagy in a selenoprotein dependent manner.  I hypothesize that Se via specific selenoprotein(s) suppresses autophagy limiting available nutrients thereby restricting bacterial replication.  This restriction in bacterial replication may lead to a less sever systemic infection and reduces Ft. pathogenesis.

A difficult problem, of special interest for clustering, is estimating the model order, i.e. the number of mixture components. Use of full covariance matrices, with number of parameters quadratic in the feature dimension, entails high\nmodel complexity, and thus may underestimate order, while naive Bayes mixtures may introduce model bias and lead to order overestimates. We develop a parsimonious modeling and model order selection method for multivariate Gaussian mixtures which allows for and optimizes over parameter tying configurations across mixture components applied to each individual parameter, including the covariates. We derive a generalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm for (BIC-based) penalized likelihood minimization. This algorithm, coupled with sequential model order reduction, forms our joint learning and model selection method. Our method searches over a rich space of models with different (data representation, model complexity) tradeoffs and, consistent with minimizing BIC, achieves fine-grained matching of model complexity to the amount of available data. We have found our method to be effective and largely robust in learning accurate model orders and parameter-tying structures for simulated ground-truth mixtures. We\nalso compared against naive Bayes and standard full-covariance Gaussian mixtures for several different criteria: i) accuracy in estimating the number of (ground-truth) components; ii) test set log-likelihood; iii) unsupervised (and semisupervised) classification accuracy; and iv) accuracy when class-conditional mixtures are used in a plug-in Bayes classifier. The results bear out that our parsimonious mixtures and coupled learning give improved accuracy with respect to each of these performance measures.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5528], "author_name_tesi": "Markley, Scott Conrad", "last_name_ssi": "Markley", "middle_name_ssi": "Conrad", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Jonathan Miller", "David Jonathan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Jonathan Miller, Thesis Advisor", "David Jonathan Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Expectation Maximization", "Model Order Selection", "Bayesian Information Criterion", "Multivariate Gaussian"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INTERGROUP CONTACT EXPERIENCE IN DIALOGUES ON RACE GROUPS:  DOES EMPATHY AND AN INFORMATIONAL IDENTITY STYLE HELP EXPLAIN PREJUDICE REDUCTION?\n", "id": "10000", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2560", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study sought to examine whether color-blind racism would decrease due to intergroup contact experience in Dialogue on Race (DOR) groups and to determine the factors related to reduction.

The participants for this study were 74 culturally diverse undergraduate students.   \n\tThe study was a pre- and post-test design with an intervention and control condition.  During the pre-test administration all participants completed a survey (made of several instruments) via PsychData, an online research website.  In addition, intervention condition participants also completed, within their respective Dialogue on Race (DOR) course groups, a measure of group cohesion and group leader characteristics during the pre-test administration.  All participants completed a post-test survey within their respective Dialogue on Race course (DOR) groups.   Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control condition.  After random assignment to condition, stratified sampling was used to assign participants to respective groups within each condition.  \nGroup cohesion was assessed by the group cohesion subscale of the Group Environment Scale (GES; Moos, 1994).  Group leader characteristics were assessed by the Counselor Rating Form-Short (CRF-S; Corrigan & Schmidt, 1983).  Color-blind racism was assessed by the Color-blind Racial Attitudes Scale (CoBRAS; Neville, Lilly, Lee, Duran, & Browne, 2000).  Empathy was assessed by two measures:  Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1983) and Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale (BEES; Mehrabian, 1996).  Informational identity style was assessed by the Identity Style Inventory-Third Revision (ISI3; Berzonsky, 1997).  \n\tRepeated measures univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) and repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance were used to assess the first research question:  Does intergroup contact significantly increase empathy and informational identity style, and decrease color-blind racism?  The first analyses employed examined change in group cohesion and group leader characteristics (trustworthiness, attractiveness, and expertness).  There was a significant increase in group cohesion within each intervention condition group.  There were no significant differences in leader trustworthiness, attractiveness, and expertness within and across groups. These findings suggest that the groups were operating as expected and members\u2019 experiences were not significantly different based on group leader quality.   \nThe second analyses directly examined the study research questions.  Contrary to the hypothesis, there was no significant decrease in color-blind racism.  Second, there was no significant increase in empathy.  Third, there was no significant increase in informational identity style.  Although significant changes were not present, trends suggest that perhaps with greater statistical power the trends observed might be significant.\nSince a significant change in color-blind racism was not found exploratory analyses were conducted to examine the second research question:  What explains change in color-blind racism? Three separate sequential multiple regressions were used to examine each of the three subscales of the CoBRAS (i.e., unawareness of racial privilege, unawareness of institutional discrimination, and unawareness of blatant racial issues).  Group cohesion was entered into the first block of each regression, empathic concern was entered into the second block, and informational identity style was entered into the third block.  Contrary to the hypothesis group cohesion, empathic concern, and informational identity style did not account for a significant amount of the variance in unawareness of racial privilege and unawareness of blatant racial issues.  However, group cohesion, empathic concern, and informational identity did contribute a significant amount of variance in unawareness of institutional discrimination.  In particular, informational identity style accounted for the most variance in unawareness of institutional discrimination.  \n\tThe results of this study were inconsistent with past research that suggested that intergroup contact experience reduced prejudice.  Results of the study did however provide some support that an informational identity style may help explain reduction in prejudice (unawareness of institutional discrimination) as a result of intergroup contact experience.  Understanding factors that explain prejudice reduction due to intergroup contact experience may improve intergroup dialogue programming in various organizations and universities nationwide.  In a post-2008 presidential election era it becomes increasing important to have meaningful and successful intergroup contact.

These choices affect individual and societal welfare.  Work matters to individual cancer survivors because it is a source of personal fulfillment, a measure of health and vitality, income, and employer-sponsored health insurance benefits.  Work matters to society. The National Cancer Institute has estimated that cancer costs over $20 billion annually in work-loss days.  Efforts to support and accommodate work by cancer survivors would reduce the indirect economic costs of cancer to society and would potentially improve the well-being of cancer survivors and their families.\n\nAlthough sixty percent of newly diagnosed cancer survivors decide to continue to work during treatment, little is known about the factors that are associated with that decision. Furthermore, spouses share in the cancer survivorship journey, yet the labor supply effect of cancer on spouses in working couples is unknown.  With the incidence of cancer increasing with age, the labor supply decision of older cancer survivors increasingly becomes a decision about retirement.\n\nThe studies use data from the Penn State Cancer Survivor Study (PSCSS) funded by the National Cancer Institute, and supplemented with data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), to produce estimates of the effects of cancer on work status and the usual hours of work per week for cancer survivors and spouses at difference stages of survivorship.  Logistic regression methods were used to produce estimates of the effects of cancer on working or on complete retirement.  Tobit models were used to estimate the effect of cancer on hours of work.\n\nThe first study finds that the decision to work during treatment is mainly determined by clinical considerations, such as cancer type and stage, although job-related health insurance of survivors and spouses is associated with a greater likelihood of working through treatment.  The second study finds that cancer has little long-term effect on the labor supply of the spouses of survivors, at least in older couples or where both partners were working at diagnosis, the situations that were the focus of this research.  The third study finds that survivors of both genders who remain cancer-free postpone retirement compared to other adults with no cancer history, but female survivors with recurrences or new cancers retire sooner.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4293], "author_name_tesi": "Markowski, Michael ", "last_name_ssi": "Markowski", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pamela Farley Short", "Pamela Farley Short", "John Raymond Moran Jr.", "Christopher Hollenbeak", "Janice Lee Penrod"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pamela Farley Short, Dissertation Advisor", "Pamela Farley Short, Committee Chair", "John Raymond Moran Jr., Committee Member", "Christopher Hollenbeak, Committee Member", "Janice Lee Penrod, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cancer survivor", "labor supply", "health insurance"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Factors that help and hinder scientific training in counseling and clinical psychology students. \n", "id": "12313", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4279", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this dissertation is to better understand scientific training within clinical and counseling psychology doctoral programs. A primary goal is to extend previous research by expanding the scientific training outcome variables from research interest and productivity to include additional characteristics of scientific mindedness such as attitudes towards research and evidence based practice. A structural equation model, grounded in research training environment (RTE) theory and social cognitive career theory (SCCT), is used to predict the new construct variable of scientific mindedness. Two additional factors, the advisory working alliance and career goals, were included within the model as predictors of scientific training outcomes.  Four structural equation models are designed in the current study: (1) a primary hypothesized model, (2) a specified hypothesized model, (3) a model based on Kahn\u2019s (2001) scholarly activity predictor model, and (4) a model based on the primary model where the scientific mindedness outcome does not include scholarly activity. In the primary model, it is hypothesized that scientific mindedness would be explained directly by year in program, research training environment, advisory working alliance, research self-efficacy, and career goals. It is hypothesized that research outcome expectations and interest in research would indirectly predict scientific mindedness.  Data from 215 clinical and counseling psychology doctoral students is used to test the four models. Model 1 is a \u201cpoor fit\u201d to the data. Model 2 is created from modifying Model 1. Model 2 is an adequate fit to the data and explains 44% of the variance in scientific mindedness. Model 3, which includes scholarly activity only as the outcome variable, is a good fit to the data and explains 43% of the variance of scholarly activity. Model 4 is a good fit for the data and explains 39% of the scientific mindedness outcome variable. Models 3 and 4 have comparable fits to the data. Differences in training model and degree type were found regarding research production such that scientist-practitioner model programs and Ph.D. programs tended to have greater perceptions of the research training environment, research self-efficacy, research outcome expectations, interest in research, and scholarly activity. Differences between clinical and counseling psychology were only found in attitudes towards research and evidence based practice. Implications are discussed within the context of future research and scientific training. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4252], "author_name_tesi": "Marks, Margaret ", "last_name_ssi": "Marks", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Margaret", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counseling Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Bieschke", "Kathleen Bieschke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Bieschke, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathleen Bieschke, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["scholarly activity", "scientific mindedness", "social cognitive career theory", "research training enviornment", "research production", "structural equation model"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Dream Deferred?  Residential Attainment among Minority and Immigrant Groups in the United States\n\n", "id": "8872", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4025", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The American Dream is handy shorthand for having \u201cmade it\u201d in the United States.  Yet what does \u201cthe American Dream\u201d mean, exactly?  We use the phrase cavalierly, but its precise definition remains elusive.  For most people, though, the American Dream entails owning one\u2019s own home, preferably in the suburbs.  Operationalizing this amorphous concept, sociologists have developed the residential attainment framework to assess the degree to which minorities and immigrants have progressed in attaining residential equality with whites.\nThis model has traditionally relied on two outcomes: homeownership and suburbanization; if the ownership rate and suburban proportion of minorities is approximately equal to that of whites, then the minority group has attained residential equality.  In this work, I examine the residential outcomes of minorities and immigrants in U.S. metropolitan areas while broadening the residential attainment framework in several key ways.  First, I include attitudes.  The usual assumption is that everyone aspires to the same housing outcomes, an assumption that has remained mostly untested.  Using data from Fannie Mae, I examine attitudes of members of different minority groups to ascertain what each desires from its housing.\nNext, I go beyond the traditional outcomes of homeownership and suburbanization.  Since these outcomes are important markers of attainment, I do include them in my analysis, but immediately thereafter, they become predictors of more nuanced measures of residential attainment, including unit size, quality, and amenities, as well as neighborhood measures such as land use.\n Third, I include broader context, including housing market segment, regional location, and metropolitan area.  Since conditions at each of these levels can influence the effect of race and nativity on the outcomes of individual households, adding these contexts helps determine the extent to which they affect individual residential outcomes of members of different racial and ethnic groups.\nFinally, I examine residential mobility to determine how (and whether) households are able to improve their living situations through a move.  I examine shifts in tenure and housing type, as well as measures of relative satisfaction, to see how a move has shaped minorities\u2019 residential attainment and, therefore, their attainment of the American Dream.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3998], "author_name_tesi": "Marlay, Matthew C.", "last_name_ssi": "Marlay", "middle_name_ssi": "C.", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barrett Alan Lee", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa", "Susan Welch", "Stephen Matthews"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barrett Alan Lee, Committee Chair", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa, Committee Member", "Susan Welch, Committee Member", "Stephen Matthews, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Homeownership", "suburbs", "suburbanization", "American Dream", "Residential inequality", "Residential preferences", "Residential mobility"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Local Terrain Mapping for Obstacle Avoidance using Monocular Vision\n\n\n", "id": "9669", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5751", "abstract_tesi": "The motivation behind the research described in this thesis is to be able to navigate a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) through complex environments.  Missions envisioned for small UAVs now require low altitude flights among many obstacles.  These obstacles can be simple shapes (telephone poles) or more complex shapes (corners and protrusions of an urban canyon).\n\nThis thesis focused on the problem of estimating obstacle locations and safe navigation to a known goal location.  The close proximity and complex nature of these environments requires a system of navigation and obstacle avoidance using onboard sensors.  However, payload limitations of small UAVs place significant restrictions on sensor size, weight, and power consumption.  This thesis describes the development and simulation of an algorithm that enables safe navigation using only a monocular camera and GPS corrected inertial navigation system (GPS/INS).\n\nThe obstacle estimation problem poses many challenges.  First, the camera measurements (bearings to obstacles and bearing rates of the obstacles due to motion of the vehicle) are heavily corrupted with noise.  This greatly reduces the certainty of information obtained from the camera.  Second, the equations governing the vehicle motion and vision measurements are highly non-linear.  The combination of noisy measurements with non-linear equations leads to significant uncertainties in the estimation problem.\n\nTraditional feature-based mapping techniques (like the Kalman Filter) become intractable in this environment as too many features must be mapped to resolve the complex shaped obstacles.  A local occupancy grid is instead used to store estimates of occupied space.  The local occupancy grid has a limited size that can be specified depending on the sensor field of view and computational condiserations.  The origin of the grid is fixed to the vehicle and in this application the orientation is fixed to an inertial frame.  By keeping the grid centered on the vehicle, vehicle motion must be accounted for in the grid with a motion update step.  A potential field trajectory generator provides the means for vehicle navigation and obstacle avoidance.  The algorithm performance is examined through simulations in an environment modeled after the McKenna Military Operations in Urban Terrain site at Ft.

The LGMAP method models landing gear with separate acoustic elements.  These acoustic elements are assembled into groups that model specific assemblies of the landing gear such as the strut, wheel, and trailing edges.  The upgrades to the program include corrections involving the cylinder acoustic element\u2019s scaling, non-dimensional lift and drag spectrums, and incident velocity vector.  A new wheel model based on the Fink method was created in order to improve the directivity of the original LGMAP wheel model.  This model differs from the Fink method, which models the landing gear\u2019s wheels as one bogey, because each individual wheel\u2019s location and size is specified by the user.  A parameter has been created to model the flow effects the wheels induce on each other.  The cylinder coefficients were recalibrated because of the changes made to the cylinder acoustic element.  The calibration case was the QFF 6.3% scaled Boeing 777 main landing gear.  For validation, landing gear models built by different users were compared and the importance of an appropriate and accurate model was discovered.  Hoses and cables extremely close to large structures such as the oleo should not be represented in the LGMAP landing gear geometry in order to prevent an overprediction in high frequency noise.  A blind test of LGMAP\u2019s capabilities was completed using an experimental case of a full scale Boeing 737 main landing gear.  The Guo and Fink landing gear prediction methods, both included in NASA\u2019s ANOPP program, were compared against LGMAP\u2019s prediction method.  The results from LGMAP produced underpredictions in high frequency noise and the directivity did match that from experimental data.  The discrepancies between the experimental data and the LGMAP prediction could be the lack of resources that were used to build the landing gear geometry.  The Guo method produces a more accurate prediction than LGMAP, but it still requires experimental data to complete its prediction.  LGMAP fared better against the Fink method because of LGMAP\u2019s strut prediction model.  The capabilities of LGMAP as a noise source locator compared with experimental phased array measurements.  The high fidelity features of the landing gear such as hoses and wires were dominant in both predicted and measured results.  LGMAP\u2019s wheel model over predicts for all sideline observer cases.  Based on the phased array measurements, an update of the wheel directivity model is advised.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6271], "author_name_tesi": "Marotta, Taylor Ries", "last_name_ssi": "Marotta", "middle_name_ssi": "Ries", "first_name_ssi": "Taylor", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Philip John Morris", "Kenneth Steven Brentner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Steven Brentner, Thesis Advisor", "Philip John Morris, Thesis Advisor", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Boeing", "airframe noise", "LGMAP", "landing gear", "acoustics", "aerospace", "trailing edge", "aeroacoustics", "aircraft", "airframe noise", "noise", "nosie prediction", "prediction", "Gulfstream"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Understanding Lithium Plating in Lithium-Ion Batteries and Exploring Mitigation Strategies by Self-Heating", "id": "14866drm5066", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14866", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The integration of lithium ion batteries into the electric vehicle market is dependent on a few key issues.  Two of these issues include cycle life and performance at low temperatures.  Industrial lithium-ion batteries need to be able to withstand several thousand cycles and operate over a large temperature range so as not to induce range anxiety in drivers in colder climates.  One of the major degradation mechanisms that can occur within a battery, especially in cold temperatures, is lithium plating on the graphite anode.  Experiments in this dissertation show that the degradation mechanism of LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2/graphite high energy cells that causes a premature death is lithium plating.\nExperiments utilizing specially fabricated research-type cells with forced lithium plating are used to better understand the important variables that drive lithium plating in graphite anodes.  Results show that temperature plays a dominant role in the onset of lithium plating, which can even occur at temperatures above 0 oC.  In order to mitigate lithium plating in Li-ion batteries, the internal temperature of the battery must be monitored and controlled.  This can be obtained through self-heating quickly and efficiently while using a minimal amount of energy.  Pulse heating of batteries from 0 oC is examined in order to decrease spatial temperature gradients, lower average activation current and minimize wasted energy due to temperature overshoot when compared to the current continuous heating protocol.  The optimal pulse heating protocol is a 2 second on-pulse followed by a 2 second off-pulse.  Mitigation of lithium plating in industrial electric vehicle batteries is attempted utilizing the self-heating technology.  External heating is unable to heat the battery from sub-zero temperatures while inducing a safety shut-off and large spatial temperature gradients.

The multi-layered beam consists of a base layer of a two-ply composite laminate with polymer layers on the upper and lower surfaces sandwiched between two composite cover layers. The stiffness variation is based on the concept that when the polymer layer is stiff, the cover composite layers are strongly coupled to the base layers and the beam behaves as an integral unit on application of a bending or extensional load. However, if the shear modulus of the polymer layer is reduced, the cover layers are largely decoupled from the base layers and the stiffness is dominated by the base layers. The shear modulus of the polymer layer is reduced by increasing its temperature through glass transition. The analysis includes development of stiffness metrics to characterize the beam stiffness in the coupled and decoupled states on the application of  a bending and extensional load respectively. Various ply orientations were analyzed to determine the laminate configuration that would produce maximum value in the stiffness metrics. The effects of the polymer layer on the coupling of the system were analyzed through ANSYS and the trend in the results was in good agreement with the theory. The metrics determined the choice of laminate ply angle layup to ensure that the extensional and torsional stiffness of the system were not adversely affected due to the coupling of the plies.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [420], "author_name_tesi": "Marques, Alvord ", "last_name_ssi": "Marques", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alvord", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["controllable stiffness", "extension-twist", "bending-twist couplings", "polymer glass transition"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The maintenance of tornadoes observed with high-resolution mobile Doppler radars\n", "id": "10525", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2912", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-01-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High-resolution dual-Doppler wind syntheses and ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation experiments performed using Doppler on Wheels velocity data collected in four tornadic supercells are examined in order to determine how the evolution of storm structure affects the maintenance of tornadoes. Tornado maintenance can occur as long as the tornado remains connected to the horizontal convergence located along the rear-flank gust front. The tornadoes dissipate when this connection is severed. The strongest and longest-lived tornado examined in this study maintains a connection to the primary rear-flank gust front for a considerable time. The weakest and shortest-lived tornado maintains only brief contact with the gust front. Rather than perishing while completely surrounded by outflow air (as is shown in past conceptual models of tornadic supercell storms), the two tornadoes with a moderate intensity and duration are sustained by convergence and vertical vorticity provided by secondary rear-flank gust fronts. It is speculated that these tornadoes do not achieve a greater intensity or a longer duration because of the transient nature of the secondary gust fronts to which they are connected.  \n\nThe strongest and longest-lived tornado dissipates when it becomes far removed from the mid-level updraft. At this time, the mid-level updraft is fueled by near-surface inflow that rises straight upward. However, the weakest and shortest-lived tornado dissipates beneath the mid-level updraft that primarily ingests near-surface inflow located several kilometers to its east. This observation suggests that having a tornado located beneath the primary updraft is not always a sufficient condition for maintenance, particularly in the presence of strongly surging outflow winds.  \n\nThe three-dimensional structure of vortex lines along the rear-flank gust fronts is consistent with the tilting of baroclinically-generated horizontal vortex rings surrounding a negatively buoyant downdraft. When the tornadoes are completely surrounded by outflow air, tilting along the primary rear-flank gust front does not generate cyclonic vertical vorticity at the tornado. Instead, tilting of the horizontal vortex lines by the secondary gust fronts more directly supplies the mature tornadoes with low-level rotation. This observation suggests that relatively cold secondary surges of outflow may assist with tornado maintenance despite a greater negative buoyancy. Thermodynamic data retrieved in the two data assimilation cases suggest that a warming of the outflow appears to be symptomatic of changes in the rear-flank downdraft that adversely affect tornado maintenance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2906], "author_name_tesi": "Marquis, James Nicholas", "last_name_ssi": "Marquis", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yvette Pamela Richardson", "Yvette Pamela Richardson", "Paul Markowski", "Hans Verlinde", "Diane Marie Henderson", "Joshua Wurman", "David Dowell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yvette Pamela Richardson, Dissertation Advisor", "Yvette Pamela Richardson, Committee Chair", "Paul Markowski, Committee Member", "Hans Verlinde, Committee Member", "Diane Marie Henderson, Committee Member", "Joshua Wurman, Committee Member", "David Dowell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["maintenance", "tornadoes", "radar"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Conceptualization, Modeling, and Characterization of a Cf Driven Multi-State Lead-lag Bypass Damper", "id": "14561", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7144", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conventional lead-lag dampers are necessary to prevent ground and air resonance in most helicopter designs.  Though high damping is needed to eliminate these instabilities only over a small region of the helicopter\u2019s operating conditions, the conventional damper continues to produce high damping in all conditions, leading to high root end loads and reducing component life.  A simple passive or semi-passive multi-state bypass damper, with predictable behavior validated by experimental data, could help to solve the problem of high root loads associated with the use of conventional lead-lag dampers.\n\nTo meet this need, a passive multi-state lead-lag damper was designed to reduce damper forces by approximately 50% when high damping is not required.  This variable damping was achieved via a set of bypass channels that are opened or closed via the changing centrifugal force associated with the rotor speed.   A first generation prototype was fabricated with an internal sliding spring/mass system to open or close the bypass channels with varying rotor speed. \n\nA semi-empirical analytical model was created to predict the damper behavior.  To get a more accurate prediction of the damper behavior, a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed using the commercial program FLUENT\u00ae.  This model was made to capture the dynamic, time varying flow through the piston orifices, around the piston head, and through the bypass channels.\n\nThe prototype damper was bench tested with the bypass channels open and closed to validate the multi-state behavior of the design over a range of frequencies and dynamic displacements.  The damper was then tested in the rotating environment on a spinning test stand to demonstrate the centrifugally activated multi-state behavior.  The spin tests proved that the bypass channels could be successfully opened via increasing centrifugal force.  At low rotor speeds, corresponding to the regions in which ground resonance could occur, the damper produced high damping.  As the rotor speed increased beyond 140 RPM, damper forces decreased, providing lower damping as the rotor speed approached nominal RPM.\n\nComparison with the experimental bench top test data revealed the semi-empirical analytical model to be very inaccurate, with average errors in peak force prediction around 60%. Conversely, the CFD model accurately predicts damper forces in the closed configuration with an average error in peak force prediction of approximately 7% and an average error in loss stiffness prediction of less than 4.4%.  The CFD model over predicts damper forces in the open configuration, with an average peak force error approaching 100%.  Prediction errors of the loss stiffness for the open case are close to 150%.\n \nThe final stage of the research involved utilizing the knowledge gained from the other models and experimental data to create a CFD augmented analytical model.  This model combined the accuracy of the CFD model, while retaining the low computational requirements of the semi-empirical analytical model, making this new model ideal for incorporation into rotorcraft prediction codes.  Comparison of the revised analytical model with the CFD model and experimental data show errors in peak force prediction under 13% for most cases and errors in the loss stiffness of fewer than 13% for most cases.  Prediction of the open bypass channel configuration is less accurate, with an average error in peak force of 24% and an average error in loss stiffness of 37%.  All of these predictions show a marked improvement over the pure semi-empirical analytical model.\n\nThe centrifugal force driven bypass multi-state lead-lag damper concept was proven effective through a series of experimental tests and modeling efforts.  The first generation prototype demonstrated high damping at low rotor speeds followed by reductions in damping up to 50% once the rotor speed reached 250 RPM.  The effectiveness of the CFD augmented analytical model was also demonstrated.

SSB tax laws have been implemented by municipal legislatures and by voter referenda, with voter referenda proving the more successful method in early years. SSB tax referenda have faced stiff resistance from industry-funded anti-tax messaging and advertising campaigns. Pro-tax forces have responded with dueling persuasive campaigns of their own. To this point, the public-facing messaging efforts of pro- and anti-SSB tax referendum groups have not been closely catalogued.\nThis study gathered and analyzed pro and antitax messaging from all US SSB tax referenda to date.

This study identifies the changing tactics that both pro and anti-tax campaigns used during this period and identifies three factors in messaging approaches that influenced referendum outcomes.

The objective of this study was to use a novel mouse line (A112G) that is representative of the human A118G SNP to evaluate the impact of the A112G SNP on HPA axis activation in adult male and female mice in response to acute and chronic restraint stress.  \nUsing radioimmunoassay (RIA), it was determined that this A112G SNP alters the HPA axis response, and thus corticosterone (CORT) production, to both acute and chronic psychological stress.  These results indicate that although the A112G SNP contributes to stress reactivity by altering the functionality of the HPA axis, it does not disrupt the circadian rhythm as measured by serum-derived CORT.  A112G heterozygous (AG) and homozygous (GG) mice exhibit higher CORT levels in response to stress than do wild-type (AA) mice.  This SNP also has a dimorphic component, as CORT levels in response to chronic stress are significantly higher in females, especially in AG mice.  \nIt was also determined that stress-induced hypothalamic expression of the \u03bc-opioid receptor protein (MOPR), as measured by immunohistochemistry and mRNA quantification, is higher in GG mice as compared to both AA and AG mice.  Additionally, pathology analysis revealed that chronic stress-induced physiological damages are less severe in GG mice, indicating a protective effect of the A112G SNP in response to stress.  Together these findings suggest that although the A112G SNP increases the CORT response to psychological stress, it also initiates a compensatory protective mechanism by increasing \u03bc-opioid receptor expression in mice harboring the SNP.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10210], "author_name_tesi": "Marsan, Lynnsay A", "last_name_ssi": "Marsan", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Lynnsay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Harold Bonneau", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy", "Andras Hajnal", "Jianxun Song", "Sarah Rebstock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Harold Bonneau, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Chair", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy, Committee Member", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member", "Jianxun Song, Committee Member", "Sarah Rebstock, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neuroendocrinology", "HPA axis", "mu-opioid receptor", "stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "New Teacher Induction and Mentoring Program for a Virtual Setting.", "id": "16032", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8166", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Schools have gone through educational reforms having various focuses on curriculum changes, consolidation, open classrooms, mastery learning, decentralization, shared decision-making, legislative mandates and controls, high expectations, integrated thematic instruction, professional development, technology integration, and standards with high-stakes accountability.

In just a decade, such virtual education has grown from a novelty to a movement that is burgeoning to meet the growing demands.  In response to these changes and increasing enrollment demands, many organizations are working on strategic plans to implement virtual courses to meet the needs of their students or potential students.  At the same time, there are misconceptions and myths related to the skills, resources, environment, tools, and support needed to prepare a teacher to teach in a virtual school.

This study is based on reading some 3,000 works, in all genres and all years, from one-page squibs to novels.    \n    Chapter 1 offers a quantitative and conceptual analysis of the canon as presented in the books of twelve major predecessors.  It also analyzes the prices charged for some 250 satires, considers the problem of definition of \u201csatire,\u201d and offers a rationale for a taxonomic approach.  Chapter 2 is devoted to a survey of contemporary commentary\u2014what eighteenth-century critics and practitioners of satire had to say about it.  Contrary to the conclusions drawn by P. K. Elkin in The Augustan Defence of Satire (1973), I demonstrate that eighteenth-century attitudes toward satire are not neat and consistent.

The design of the injector allowed for variation in placement of individual injector elements.\n\nAn analysis of initial experiments in the chamber indicated that injector placement influences stability characteristics. Placement of injector elements at anti-node locations of the chamber 1W mode showed larger pressure oscillation amplitudes than injector placement at 1W node positions. Despite the influence of injector placement, no self-induced combustion instabilities of significant amplitude (> 10% P'p-p/Pc) were observed, although short duration bursts of pressure oscillations with significant amplitude were observed. This phenomenon showed large amplitude oscillations (> 10% P'p-p/Pc) occurring through the steady state combustion cycle. These bursts occurred at random times and for short durations.\n\nThe most important observations in the current study were the identification of two key parameters which influence stability levels.

DQMOM was found to \nbe very fast, but was unreliable when analyzing kernels with signi\ufb01cant compo- \nsitional dependence. Constant-number Monte Carlo was determined to be the \nbest choice when analyzing multi-dimensional, composition-dependent population \nbalance equations. \n\nAny model that is developed, though complex, is of no practical good if it \ncannot faithfully recreate experimental results. As such, simulation results were \ncompared with experimental results at nearly every step along the way in this \nresearch. It was found that the constant-number Monte Carlo model continually \nmatches the experimental data for three granulation cases of increasing di\ufb03culty: \na two-component case that considers the continuous addition of binder to a granu- \nlator, a three-component case that evaluates the impact of evaporation and mois- \nture content on the granule growth pro\ufb01le, and ultimately the four-component case \nmentioned above where granule growth, moisture content, binder distribution, and \ncomposition distribution are evaluated.\n\nAn e\ufb00ective pharmaceutical wet granulation model should include at least three \ncomponents: (i) a population balance methodology that tracks the distribution \nand composition of al l species of interest, (ii) a physically based description of \nagglomeration and breakage, and (iii) hydrodynamic modeling. While the third \npiece of the puzzle was beyond the current scope of work, signi\ufb01cant strides were \nmade in regards to the other two. It was shown that the constant-number Monte \nCarlo methodology can utilize a complex morphologically-based compositional- \ndependent coagulation kernel (criteria ii) and track the size evolution of two dif- \nferent powders while also considering the impact of moisture loss on the system \n(criteria i). Thus, the development of the constant-number Monte Carlo model con- \ntained within this dissertation helps to \ufb01ll a critical need within the granulation \ncommunity for a model that can provide a thorough analysis of multi-component \ngranulation problems.

A variable frequency infrasonic pistonphone is one option for calibration; however, thermo-viscous effects can decrease the accuracy of calibrations made using an infrasonic pistonphone. An infrasonic pistonphone is developed that produces calibration signals between 0.001 and 30 Hz. To decrease calibration uncertainty due to thermo-viscous effects, the pressure inside the constructed pistonphone chamber is calculated using Rott\u2019s continuity and momentum equations, readily accepted equations that model thermo-viscous effects in enclosures. The pressure response of the pistonphone chamber is measured, and compared with the pressure predicted by a model incorporating Rott\u2019s equations. Example calibrations and thermo-viscous effect corrections are conducted. Results show an increase in calibration accuracy, and demonstrate the potential usefulness of the pistonphone design for the calibration of acoustic transducers at infrasonic frequencies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6246], "author_name_tesi": "Marston, Timothy Merrill", "last_name_ssi": "Marston", "middle_name_ssi": "Merrill", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas B Gabrielson", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "Martin Wesley Trethewey", "Steven Lurie Garrett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas B Gabrielson, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Chair", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member", "Martin Wesley Trethewey, Committee Member", "Steven Lurie Garrett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microphone", "Calibration", "Transducer", "Acoustics", "Infrasound", "Pistonphone"]}]
