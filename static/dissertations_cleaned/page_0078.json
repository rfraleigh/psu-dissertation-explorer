Based on a sample of 106, a mixed methods approach was used to analyze responses from participants who responded to a 27 item Likert-type scale (1-5) College Resilience Questionnaire (CRQ) that had been posted online (Survey Monkey). The results of the CRQ instrument reveal that academic resilience and academic and social engagement scores for females are higher than for males. Results further support findings from t-test scores (t (106) = 2.21, p = .029), which also show differences in academic resilience between females and males enrolled in TRIO programs. Next, further analysis used in-depth interviews to expand the analysis of the lived experiences from six participants\u2018 interviews. Seven themes emerged from the data, which indicated that familial, institutional, individual, and socio-environmental protective factors play important roles for success in college of low-income/first-generation students. In general, the data seem to show that TRIO programs nurture students\u2018 academic resilience. Additional analysis compared these results with South African resilience studies. The comparison shows similarities in sources for the resilience nurturing. The dissertation appendices contain details of the quantitative CRQ Questionnaire and the qualitative interview questions.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4274], "author_name_tesi": "Mbindyo, Margaret Ngina", "last_name_ssi": "Mbindyo", "middle_name_ssi": "Ngina", "first_name_ssi": "Margaret", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ladislaus M Semali", "Ladislaus M Semali", "Jamie Myers", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Susan Faircloth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ladislaus M Semali, Dissertation Advisor", "Ladislaus M Semali, Committee Chair", "Jamie Myers, Committee Chair", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Susan Faircloth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Protective Factors", "Upward Bound Program", "TRIO programs", "First Generation", "Low income", "Academic Resilience", "Risk Factors", "Academic Engagement", "Social Engagement"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Exploring \"Otherness\" Through Holocaust Literature in the Undergraduate German Curriculum", "id": "23543", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10663", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study is based on the assumption that because the Holocaust is a significant part of Germany\u2019s history, culture, and national memory, it should be taught openly and honestly within German curricula.

By reading and exploring the literature of the Holocaust, students can be brought into another realm of understanding, for the victims are no longer just numbers, but real human beings with unimaginable experiences.  The reading and studying of such literature not only creates an opportunity for introspection, self-evaluation, and critical thinking, but also one for the experience and exploration of \u201cotherness\u201d\u2014Michael Byram\u2019s concept of intercultural communicative competence. \n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the use of Holocaust literature in a US post-secondary institutional setting as a venue for the development of certain aspects of intercultural communicative competence. Qualitative data, collected through observation, audio tape, and field notes, were gathered from three different levels of German instruction at a US post-secondary institution over the period of approximately one month.

Specifically, the relative value of dietary antioxidants to predict each disease is not consistent. Many analyses consider the predictive value of only a few antioxidant markers, limiting conclusions about which is the most predictive.  Further, the traditional method of considering each antioxidant in isolation may not reflect overall antioxidant status. In a nationally representative sample of 7153 (weighted N = 58,875,272)  adults aged 50+ years enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994), we considered the value of 10 serum antioxidant concentrations (\u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, lutein, lycopene, vitamins A, C, E, retinyl esters and selenium) to predict risk of all-cause, cancer and CVD mortality at 12-18 year follow-up. We also developed an antioxidant score and tested the hypothesis that it would be a more robust predictor of CVD death than concentrations of single antioxidants.  Time-to-death analysis was performed using Cox regression modeling. Forty-two percent (N=3727) of the sample was deceased at 12-18 year follow-up, with 1362 deceased due to CVD.  In models adjusted for known demographic, behavioral and biological risk factors, concentration quintiles of 9 of the 10 antioxidants measured were significantly associated with all cause mortality (exception Vitamin A). Only selenium, and vitamins A and E were not associated with cancer death, while only \u03b1-carotene and \u03b2-cryptoxanthin predicted CVD death. Quintiles of the antioxidant score were also significantly associated with overall death, cancer and CVD death. After controlling for traditional risk factors, an antioxidant score was more strongly associated with rates of cancer and CVD death than individual antioxidants in a large nationally representative sample of aging adults. An antioxidant score may more closely reflect oxidative status than measures of single dietary antioxidants, and therefore be more useful when assessing risk of death.

Specifically, exaggerated increases in postprandial triglycerides and glucose are believed to promote atherogenesis via increases in inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and the production of small dense LDL cholesterol [2-4]. For this reason, dietary interventions which reduce post meal spikes in triglycerides and glucose or the subsequent rise in oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction may be particularly important for managing CVD risk. \nFirst, this dissertation explores the effects of acute stress and a high antioxidant herb and spice blend on postprandial oxidative stress, inflammation and vascular function. Methods: Archived samples from a randomized, crossover clinical trial [5] were used to test the effects of mental stress (Trier Social Stress Test) and rest on postprandial oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial function following the consumption of a high fat meal with or without 14.5 grams of polyphenol-rich spices (black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, garlic, ginger, oregano, paprika, rosemary, and turmeric). Twenty participants completed 4 visits in this 2x2 factorial design. At each visit, fasted baseline blood samples were collected, participants consumed the test meal and then underwent either the mental stress protocol or rest condition. Additional blood samples were collected at 105, 140, 180, and 210 minutes post meal (corresponding to 10, 45, 90 and 120 minutes post stress). Endpoints included plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL), the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Vascular function was assessed via peripheral arterial tonometry at 240 minutes post meal. Results: Compared to the fasting baseline, the meal increased oxidative stress regardless of the presence or absence of spices (p = 0.003 for MDA and p = 0.02 for oxLDL). Similarly, the meal resulted in increased plasma IL-6 (p <0.001). A stress by time interaction was also present for plasma IL-6 (p = 0.05), such that when stressed, the average change was elevated at time 2 compared to time 3 (1.05 \u00b1 0.25 vs 0.44 \u00b1 0.16, Tukey p = 0.03). However, the direct comparison of IL-6 at time 2 following stress versus rest revealed no difference. There was no effect of spices on oxidative stress, inflammation or vascular function. \nSecond, this dissertation describes a clinical study which examines the effects of an polyphenol-rich spiced meal on postprandial plasma triglyceride concentrations and rates of fecal fat excretion and gut motility. Building on previous studies in which we observed significant reductions in postprandial triglycerides following a meal rich in spices, the purpose of this study is to identify mechanisms by which this effect occurred. Methods: Twelve healthy but overweight men participated in a randomized 2 period cross over study. At each of 2 visits, a fasting blood sample was followed by the consumption of a high fat meal (~1100 kcals, 57g fat) containing blue dye, 2.5g non absorbable fat and with or without the 14.5 g polyphenol-rich herb and spice blend. Within 15 minutes of finishing the meal, participants swallowed a single-use SmartPill wireless motility capsule. Blood was sampled every 60 minutes after the meal for 8 hrs for the analysis of plasma triglycerides and glucose. Fecal deposits were collected until the dyed sample was captured. The sucrose polybehenate test of fecal fat absorption was used to evaluate fat excretion in the dyed samples. Endothelial function (measured via flow-mediated dilation, FMD) was assessed at fasting and 210minutes post meal. Results: Serum triglycerides, glucose and insulin were increased postprandially, as expected. There was no effect of spices on these three endpoints (ps > 0.05). Gastric emptying time was lower after the spice meal compared to control (658 \u00b1 98.2 vs. 884.5 \u00b1 98.2 minutes; p = 0.046), but small bowel and colonic transit time were unaffected by treatment.  There was no effect of either meal on brachial artery diameter or FMD (ps > 0.05). The spiced meal increased blood flow compared to the fasting scan (ps = 0.06 and 0.05). Both blood flow volume at the start of the FMD scan (average increase of 57.78 \u00b1 25.34mL/min, post hoc p = 0.037) and following shear stress were increased (average increase of 188.867 \u00b1 66.6 mL/minute post hoc p = 0.012). These findings suggest that spices may influence sympathetic activity.\nFinally, this dissertation reports the test-retest reliability of pulse amplitude tonometry (PAT). PAT is an alternative to the noninvasive standard procedure of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) for assessing endothelial function. PAT uses automated methods to measures the change in pulse wave amplitude before and during reactive hyperemia (Itamar Medical Ltd, Caesarea, Israel). However, little is known about its ability to reliably assess vascular function in healthy adults across time periods of more than a few hours. Methods: Twenty healthy adults completed two PAT tests separated by a mean of 19.5 days.  Standardized conditions included time of day, location, time since and contents of last meal, body position and menstrual phase for premenopausal females.  Results: PAT-derived measures of endothelial function (reactive hyperemia index, RHI) and arterial stiffness (augmentation index, AI) showed strong repeatability (intra-class correlations = 0.74 and 0.83, respectively). To guide future research, we also analyzed sample size requirements for a range of effect sizes. A crossover design powered at 0.90 requires 28 participants to detect a 15% change in RHI. Our study is the first to show that PAT measurements are repeatable in adults over an interval greater than 1 week and thus appropriate for gauging change over longer term intervention trials.  \nIn conclusion, this dissertation provides evidence that common culinary spices have little impact on metabolic, oxidative and inflammatory processes during the postprandial period. Evidence is also provided for the reliability of an inexpensive and operator-independent method of measuring endothelial dysfunction.  The results of this dissertation may be useful in designing interventions to prevent and treat obesity, metabolic syndrome, and CVD.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11122], "author_name_tesi": "Mc Crea, Cindy Eileen", "last_name_ssi": "Mc Crea", "middle_name_ssi": "Eileen", "first_name_ssi": "Cindy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sheila Grace West", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Laura Klien", "Ryan John Elias"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sheila Grace West, Dissertation Advisor", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "Laura Klien, Committee Member", "Ryan John Elias, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["spice", "herb", "vascular function", "postprandial", "lipemia", "triglycerides", "stress", "oxidative stress", "EndoPAT"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Transformational Journey of Educators in Technology: A Mixed Methods Study of Tenured Business Faculty", "id": "13744mgm221", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13744", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The existence of the internet has changed the world and has resulted in many impactful changes for higher education. More specifically, online education is seen as a means to meet the demands of students including non-traditional adult students (who work full-time, go to school part-time and are financially independent) for flexible course scheduling in higher education. Delivery of online educational programs at institutions of higher learning can mean significant change for the institution, faculty, and students. Careful consideration is paramount to a successful entry of not only how but why the institution is initiating such an educational format.  Recent statistics show faculty in higher education are generally less accepting of the value and legitimacy of online education as a viable educational format and less accepting ultimately of online degrees. Faculty falling into this group do not view online education quality as comparable to that of traditional face-to-face coursework and therefore not as legitimate as an educational format to traditional coursework. This study, through the theoretical framework of transformative learning, focused on business faculty and online education. Specifically, tenured faculty members who were initially resistant to teaching online, changed their perspective, and came to value and teach online in business curriculum on a world-wide basis. Additionally considered was how teaching online impacted tenured business faculty\u2019s approach to teaching in a face-to-face classroom environment. To address this purpose, an exploratory sequential mixed methods research design was utilized.  Interviews were conducted with 14 tenured business faculty across the country. Based upon the results of these interviews a survey was created and distributed to business faculty on a world-wide basis. Qualified responses were received from 206 survey participants. The findings suggest that while business faculty, including tenured, are resistant to teaching online and prefer to teach in a face-to-face environment, they are willing to reconsider to learn to teach online if requested by high ranking colleagues and are provided the necessary institutional support and training. The impact of having taught online altered business faculty\u2019s face-to-face teaching practices through more active learning methods for students. A perspective change to teach online resulted after spending time reflecting on various factors business faculty considered key to a successful entry to teach in an online environment. The importance of resistance as a construct of transformative learning was also identified as contributing to a change in mindset. This study is important to adult education because it is intended to shed light on how the most experienced faculty group, tenured business faculty, overcame their initial resistance to online education including teaching online. This will afford institutions of higher learning the knowledge of how to construct online course design, train and reduce the impact these resistance factors have on individual tenured business faculty. It will afford students an opportunity to learn from those individuals who have gained the highest level of success within their profession.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13862], "author_name_tesi": "Mc Vey, Michael George", "last_name_ssi": "Mc Vey", "middle_name_ssi": "George", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward W.

In this study, clients and therapists completed questionnaires following 452 sessions of psychotherapy focused on rating the extent of insight achieved by clients and the types of techniques used by therapists in those sessions. Multilevel linear modeling was used to test the hypothesis that techniques from exploratory psychotherapies would be more frequent in high-insight sessions. Counter to the hypothesis, higher exploratory techniques were associated with lower client-rated insight at both the client and session level. In addition, interaction effects (including a four-way cross-level interaction) revealed that a complex interpretation of the data was necessary. Though it was the case that therapists reported using more exploratory techniques when insight was low, the typicality of different interventions appeared to play a substantial role in determining both the strength and direction of effect between different types of techniques and insight. These findings show that while significant relationships between techniques and insight exist across clients and therapists, what specific techniques facilitate insight may vary substantially across treatments.

In part, these problems are due to the use of a single timepoint of assessment for individuals rather than multiple observations. Under circumstances of limited but multiple observations per person, it is proposed that multilevel factor analysis (MLFA) may provide a viable alternative to traditional FA, capable of more reliably distinguishing states and traits, and informing the general vs. specific factor question. In addition, an extension of the MLFA model incorporating randomly-varying measurement parameters may provide an acceptable estimate of idiographic and nomothetic factor structures in large samples, with a relatively small number of observations per person. In two studies, these models are investigated and found to be potentially useful, though also with clear weaknesses in their complexity and computational requirements. In particular, it is suggested that the benefits of such models may most outweigh the costs in routine treatment outcome assessment in applied clinical settings, in which each subject presents with different concerns, theoretical factors of interest are thought to be time-varying, and regular but not intensively repeated observations are made within persons (with as few as 3-10 observations per person being common). Though the studies here remain preliminary, the findings suggest that accounting for multiple observations within persons in psychological measurement may be an important direction for future analyses.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11144], "author_name_tesi": "McAleavey, Andrew Athan", "last_name_ssi": "McAleavey", "middle_name_ssi": "Athan", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Louis Georges Castonguay", "Louis Georges Castonguay", "Stephen Jeffrey Wilson", "Jeffrey Hayes", "Benjamin D Locke", "Peter Cm Molenaar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Louis Georges Castonguay, Dissertation Advisor", "Louis Georges Castonguay, Committee Chair", "Stephen Jeffrey Wilson, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Hayes, Committee Member", "Benjamin D Locke, Committee Member", "Peter Cm Molenaar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling", "Psychotherapy outcome monitoring"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "GENDER AND JUSTICE IN NATURALIST NARRATIVES:                            ESPACES, MOMENTS, VIOLENCES\n", "id": "11738", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1496", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Critics have previously examined the inverse correlation between incidences of violent crime and their representation in nineteenth-century France (Vigarello, Muchembled). The relationship between the portrayal of sexual violence in nineteenth-century French literature and its occurrence in real life has received less attention. Likewise, the link between the representation of sexual violence and critical narrative elements, such as space and time, remains unexplored. \u00c9mile Zola, Guy de Maupassant, and Octave Mirbeau represent the rape-murder of a young peasant girl in three representative texts, La B\u00eate humaine (1890), \u201cLa Petite Roque\u201d (1885), and Le Journal d\u2019une femme de chambre (1900). These texts contain a strikingly similar criminal act (rape-murder), an almost identical victim (young peasant girl), and a suspected perpetrator who is much the same, a middle-aged man who is esteemed in his community, and often a highly placed provincial bureaucrat. As for the scene of the crime, each of the three texts relies on a dialectic between an undomesticated landscape (forest) and the victim\u2019s corpse. Beyond their dramatic import, these scenes of brutality are referred to throughout the entire narratives, suggesting a greater structural role than current criticism suggests.\nThis dissertation examines the functions, both narrative and social, of the representations of sexual violence in these three texts. Drawing on an interdisciplinary approach pairing close reading with cultural studies, I examine how these scenes of sexual violence are discussed after their occurrence. I analyze the description of each crime scene as well as how the narrative refers back to the crime, the alleged criminals, and their victims, through court proceedings or amateur investigations on the part of characters. A consideration of the social function of such violence includes an overview of the historical context of sexual crimes and the role of gender. What emerges from the examination of these three texts is a new narrative system that, through the representation of crime, is able to indirectly present a criticism of the French state as corrupt. Moreover, I consider how these representations relate to the larger goals of each author and how these texts point to a new definition of naturalism based on narrative experimentation. Such a definition allows for new intertextual links in the representation of crime and spatio-temporal constructions, in particular for naturalism the unprecedented narrative ties to Victor Hugo\u2019s Le Dernier Jour d\u2019un condamn\u00e9 (1829). \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1481], "author_name_tesi": "McAnally, Deirdre Mary", "last_name_ssi": "McAnally", "middle_name_ssi": "Mary", "first_name_ssi": "Deirdre", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathryn Marie Grossman", "Kathryn Marie Grossman", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "Norris Joiner Lacy", "Willa Zahava Silverman", "Jonathan Paul Eburne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathryn Marie Grossman, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathryn Marie Grossman, Committee Chair", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Committee Member", "Norris Joiner Lacy, Committee Member", "Willa Zahava Silverman, Committee Member", "Jonathan Paul Eburne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["naturalism", "time", "space", "rape", "gender", "violence"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Effects of Data Complexity and Map Abstraction on the Perception of Patterns in Infectious Disease Animations\n", "id": "9949", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "924", "abstract_tesi": "Geographic map animations have become an increasingly popular method for exploring spatio-temporal datasets. While some have questioned the effectiveness of animations compared to the static alternatives, little research has been done on our ability to retain and recall data presented in animated maps. This study uses a dataset of weekly measles infections in Niger from 1995-2004 in a controlled experiment to test the ability of participants to complete a series of map-reading tasks using choropleth and schematic map representations. Infectious disease data is often imperfectly sampled and inherently noisy. As a result, an important question for map animation designers is whether to represent the raw data directly or to transform the data to dampen the impact of noise. To address this question, the experiment compares animations using the raw weekly data to transformed data sets using temporal averaging and aggregation. These approaches were used to determine what effects data complexity and spatial abstraction have on our ability to perceive spatio-temporal patterns in map animations. Experiment participants (N = 96) were recruited from undergraduate geography classes at Penn State University, then divided into groups according to three data smoothing approaches: raw (weekly) data, 5-week moving-window average, and 2-week aggregation. Participants viewed a series of animations of yearly measles epidemics using three different map representations, then provided quantitative and qualitative assessments of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the infection patterns. The results showed that overall, map representation had a larger impact on task performance than data complexity, due primarily to the perceptual salience of large, but low-population districts in Niger. It was also found that temporal aggregation, an approach used by infectious disease researchers, did not result in any significant interpretation errors overall, despite expectations to the contrary. In some tasks, such as determining when the peak of a yearly epidemic occurred, aggregation proved to be most effective, enabling participants to identify the correct peak week 50% more often, compared to those who used raw data. The results also support the idea that animated maps are best used for simple map-reading tasks or gaining a broad overview of a dataset, and less effective for making quantitative comparisons.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [916], "author_name_tesi": "McCabe, Craig Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "McCabe", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "Craig", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Alan M Mac Eachren", "Alan Maceachren"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Alan M Mac Eachren, Thesis Advisor", "Alan Maceachren, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cartogram", "choropleth", "averaging", "aggregation", "time-series", "cartography", "animated maps", "spatial epidemiology", "infectious disease", "Niger"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "STATISTICAL GUIDANCE METHODS FOR PREDICTING SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION IN THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES\n", "id": "10678", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6143", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Accurate forecasting of snowfall accumulation has widespread economic and safety consequences.

Solar power can provide substantial power supply to the grid; however, it is also a highly variable energy source. Changes in weather conditions, i.e. clouds, can cause rapid changes in solar power output, thus creating a challenge for utility companies to effectively use these renewable energy resources. The energy grid, which manages and distributes the energy, requires energy generation to meet the energy demand for an efficient system. Independent systems operators (ISOs) and regional transmission organizations (RTOs) monitor the energy load, direct power generation from utilities, define operating limits and create contingency plans. ISOs, RTOs and utilities will require solar irradiance forecasts to effectively and efficiently balance the energy grid as the penetration of solar power increases. This study presents multiple nonlinear forecasting techniques to predict both the magnitude of the solar irradiance and its expected variability.\nThe temporal irradiance variability is forecast for the temporal standard deviation of the Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) at eight sites in the Sacramento Valley of California and the spatial irradiance variability is forecast for the standard deviation across those same sites. A model tree with a nearest neighbor option was trained to predict the irradiance variability. The resulting artificial intelligence model reduces the mean absolute error between 10% and 55% compared to using climatological average values of the temporal and spatial GHI standard deviation. A data denial experiment shows including surface weather observations improves forecasting skill by approximately 10%. These results indicate the model tree technique can be applied in real time to produce solar variability forecasts.\niii\niv Next, a cloud regime-dependent short-range solar irradiance forecasting system is\ndeveloped to provide 15-min average clearness index forecasts for 15-min, 60-min, 120-min and 180-min lead-times. A k-means algorithm identifies the cloud regime based on surface weather observations and irradiance observations. Then, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are trained to predict the clearness index. This regime-dependent system makes a more accurate deterministic forecast than a global ANN or clearness index persistence and produces more accurate predictions of expected irradiance variability than assuming climatological average variability.\nLastly, regime-identification methods that also incorporate GOES-East satellite data both as inputs to the k-means regime algorithm and as predictors to the ANNs are explored. Several cloud-regime dependent short-range solar irradiance forecasting systems (RD-ANN) are tested to make 15-min average clearness index predictions for 15-min, 60-min, 120-min and 180-min forecast lead-times. The RD-ANN system that shows the lowest forecast error on independent test data classifies cloud regimes with a k-means algorithm based on a combination of surface weather observations, irradiance observations and GOES-East satellite data. The ANNs are then trained on each cloud regime to predict the clearness index. This RD-ANN system improves over the mean absolute error of the baseline clearness index persistence predictions by 1.0%, 21.0%, 26.4% and 27.4% at the 15-min, 60-min, 120-min and 180-min forecast lead-times. Additionally, a version of this method configured to predict the irradiance variability predicts irradiance variability more accurately than a smart persistence technique.\nUsing statistical techniques allows for improved deterministic solar irradiance predictions as well as improved spatial and temporal solar irradiance variability predictions.

On second look, however, many of these bodies are still alive, or exist in an ambiguous state between life and death.  Similarly prints of P\u00e8re Lachaise in travel guidebooks and vues pittoresques juxtapose living and dead figures in such a way as to suggest that the cemetery is a borderland space where life meets death.  This project examines the ways in which these representations of death illustrate what is referred to as a status viatoris\u2014the ambiguous stage separating life from death\u2014that is reflective of contemporary medical studies on the dying body as well as influenced by the presence of death in society, and feelings of uncertainty associated with  the defeat of Napoleon, the return of the Bourbon monarchy, and the sense of dismay and disillusionment related to the disease known as the mal du si\u00e8cle.  \nThe philosophical concept of status viatoris is borrowed from its original theo-philosophical meaning which defined the progression of life on its way to death.  This study relocates its meaning to a medico-scientific understanding associated with late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century studies on death.  These investigations\u2014inspired by numerous cases of people being buried alive, health concerns from the effects of overpopulated graveyards and decomposing corpses, and studies of decapitated heads\u2014encouraged doctors and scientists to pursue a greater understanding of the human body through the practice of dissections and close observation of corpses.  They determined that a stage exists after life but before real death, and suggested that a body dies progressively, in stages.  It is this ambiguous period, or a status viatoris, that appears in paintings by G\u00e9ricault and Delacroix and in prints of P\u00e8re Lachaise.  A fresh examination of these images and this discourse on death in light of the political, social, and intellectual culture of France as well as the medico-scientific literature, will provide a new understanding of art focused on the morbidly fascinating subject of death during the Romantic period. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1037], "author_name_tesi": "McCann, Carmen Lorraine", "last_name_ssi": "McCann", "middle_name_ssi": "Lorraine", "first_name_ssi": "Carmen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy Elizabeth Locke", "Nancy Elizabeth Locke", "Sarah K Rich", "Charlotte Marie Houghton", "Kathryn Marie Grossman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy Elizabeth Locke, Dissertation Advisor", "Nancy Elizabeth Locke, Committee Chair", "Sarah K Rich, Committee Member", "Charlotte Marie Houghton, Committee Member", "Kathryn Marie Grossman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pere Lachaise", "Theodore Gericault", "Eugene Delacroix", "death", "status viatoris", "French Romanticism", "Paris", "Medical history"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Role for TRPV6 Ion Channels in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases ", "id": "13790", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5507", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There are currently no effective therapeutic treatments to prevent prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastases. Identifying mechanisms that facilitate favorable PCa cell to bone interactions will aid in the development of therapies to prevent bone metastases. The objective of this study was to identify a role for calcium and Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 6 (TRPV6) ion channels in the metastatic potential and early colonization of osteoblastic PCa cells to murine bone. We proposed that transient increases in serum calcium, following parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1-34 administration, confers a metastatic advantage to PCa cells in circulation, signaled partially via TRPV6 ion channels. To identify the effect of transient elevations in calcium on osteoblastic PCa cell metastatic potential, we employed heterotypic cell adhesion, transwell migration, and invasion assays. Observations from cell adhesion assays suggested that osteoblastic PCa cells increased adhesion to human bone marrow endothelial (hbmE) cells pre-treated with extracellular calcium. Studies suggested that increased extracellular calcium enhanced E-Selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 cell surface abundance on hbmE cells and that these molecules were partially responsible for increased heterotypic cell adhesion. Increased extracellular calcium also enhanced migration of osteoblastic PCa cell lines, in vitro. To identify the requirement for TRPV6 expression in osteoblastic PCa cell metastatic potential, we reduced TRPV6 expression in osteoblastic PCa cell lines. PCa cells with reduced levels of TRPV6 expression demonstrated slower proliferation rates and an impaired ability to adhere to and invade hbmE cells. Lastly, to identify a role for TRPV6 expression in early PCa cell colonization of murine bone, SCID/Beige mice were administered PTH 1-34 or vehicle, intermittently, then inoculated with PCa cells engineered to express reduced levels of TRPV6. Eight weeks post PCa cell inoculation, PCa cells were identified in long bones of 100% of animals administered PTH 1-34, relative to 20% of animals treated with vehicle. In contrast, PCa cells were identified in only 20% of the long bones of animals administered PTH 1-34, and then inoculated with PCa cells with reduced TRPV6 expression. Our observations support our hypothesis and suggest that calcium and TRPV6 may have a role in facilitating favorable PCa cell to bone interactions.

However, catalysis using main group compounds has recently become an area of growing interest, due to concerns about the cost and negative environmental impact of precious metal use. In this vein, we have investigated the use of phosphorus-based catalysts as transition metal surrogates for bond activation. By enforcing bond angle strain in phosphorus (III) species, one can manipulate the frontier orbitals associated with the phosphorus center to access previously unknown reactive modes. Using this strategy, we have developed two platforms for the largely unprecedented intermolecular activations of O-H and N-H bonds at phosphorus and investigated their mechanisms in depth.

For plants, cell walls are necessary, among other things, for structure and support, for morphogenesis, for water and mineral management, and for protection. For humans they are sources of building materials, textiles, paper, fuel, and food. Improving our understanding of the plant cell wall is a precursor to being able to intelligently manipulate its properties for our own purposes.\nThe evolutionary history of the plant cell wall is of interest both academically and because of its relevance to the makeup of cell walls of modern economically important plants. Although the predecessor to land plants is widely agreed to have been a Charophycean green alga, the phylogeny of extant Charophycean green algae is not resolved, so they are of only limited use in researching plant terrestrialization. Bryophytes appear to be the earliest divergent group from the rest of the land plants, so comparisons between mosses and tracheophytic plants are currently our best option for learning about the embryophyte common ancestor. \nIn this work, phylogenetic analysis of 16 pectin-related gene families led to new insights about the history of plant cell walls. In contrast to the CESA family, which radiated in land plants after the divergence of bryophytes and tracheophytes, several of the pectin-related families showed clear evidence of having had multiple members in the land plant common ancestor. Additionally, two very large families, the polygalacturonases and the pectin methylesterases, contained small monophyletic clades that suggest deeply conserved functions.\nSix Arabidopsis genes from three deeply conserved clades in the polygalacturonase tree were chosen as targets for characterization. Attempts to isolate transcriptional knockouts using T-DNA insertional mutants were unsuccessful. One putative mutation in AT1G10640 was investigated heavily before being revealed to be an unusual T-DNA mutant but not a true knockout.\nAfter exhausting the option of T-DNA mutants to produce knockouts of the genes of interest, the more recent molecular tools of artificial microRNAs and the CRISPR-Cas9 system were used to target the genes. The CRISPR-Cas9 system produced multiple mutant lines predicted to have early stop codons for five out of the six genes. These are expected to be a valuable resource for learning about the functions of polygalacturonases in eudicot cell walls, and gaining insight into their potential role in the embryophyte common ancestor.\nFinally, I report on several experiments relating to the cell walls of Physcomitrella patens (Physcomitrella), a model moss with cell walls similar in composition to eudicot primary walls. A preliminary time course experiment suggests that protoplasts of Physcomitrella that have been released from their walls quickly generate a callose coating that is gradually strengthened by cellulose within 48 hours. Fluorescent Protein-labelled Cellulose Synthase (CESA) proteins in Physcomitrella move at similar speeds as those in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), but are much less densely spaced. Chemicals known to be cellulose synthesis inhibitors in eudicots also appeared to slow Physcomitrella CESAs, but it is not clear that their mode of action is the same. A comparison of CESA protein sequences involved in secondary cell formation in Arabidopsis to chimeric proteins and heterologous CESAs from Physcomitrella suggested several amino acids as being important for proper assembly of the Cellulose Synthase Complex.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12979, 12980, 12981, 12982, 12983, 12984, 12985, 12986, 12987, 12988, 12989, 12990, 12991, 12992, 12993, 12994, 12995, 12996, 12997, 12998, 12999, 13000, 13001, 13002, 13003, 13004, 13005, 13006, 13007, 13008, 13009, 13010, 13011, 13012, 13013, 13014, 13015, 13016, 13017, 13018, 13019, 13020, 13021, 13022, 13023, 13024, 13025, 13026, 13027, 13028, 13029, 13030, 13031, 13032, 13033], "author_name_tesi": "McCarthy, Thomas Wayne", "last_name_ssi": "McCarthy", "middle_name_ssi": "Wayne", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles T Anderson", "Charles T Anderson", "Mark Guiltinan", "Michael Axtell", "James Harold Marden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles T Anderson, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles T Anderson, Committee Chair", "Mark Guiltinan, Committee Member", "Michael Axtell, Committee Member", "James Harold Marden, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pectin", "cellulose", "polygalacturonase", "evolution", "plant cell wall", "Arabidopsis", "Physcomitrella patens"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A Digital Library Initiative for Scholarly  Monographs: An Activity Theory Analysis\n\n", "id": "8231", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2603", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Scholarly communications are changing with the application of technology.

The primary question in this line of research is whether words that are not intended for production (\u201cunintended words\u201d) become activated and compete for selection with the target word to be spoken. A number of studies have shown the phonology of the distractor is available, suggesting that unintended words compete with intended words for production. However, there are fewer studies demonstrating that the semantic properties of the distractors are available. As it stands, the evidence on the effects of semantic and phonological distractors on speech production presents an empirical paradox. According to most models of speech production, it is impossible to activate the phonology of alternative words without activating their semantics first. The primary goal of the present study was to determine whether phonology and semantics of unintended words are available in the language not to be spoken when bilinguals plan to speak a single word. The results of this work have important implications for understanding the scope of language selectivity and for explaining the mechanisms of control in bilingual speech production. A secondary goal of the present study was to use the distractor paradigm to test the assumptions of the Revised Hierarchical Model. The experiments were designed to examine hypothesized asymmetries in the degree to which conceptual information supports translation. To address these questions, six experiments were conducted using picture-word translation and naming tasks. The results showed that, under different conditions, both the phonology and semantics of distractor stimuli were activated. A critical finding in the translation experiments (Experiment 1, Experiment 2, and Experiment 3) was that the phonology of distractors became available even when the name was related only to the language of production. Another important finding in the translation experiments was that there was only evidence that the semantics of distractors was available when bilinguals translated from L1 to L2, supporting the Revised Hierarchical Model\u2019s assumption that the L1 has privileged access to meaning.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5398], "author_name_tesi": "McClain, Rhonda ", "last_name_ssi": "McClain", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rhonda", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith Fran Kroll", "Judith Fran Kroll"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith Fran Kroll, Thesis Advisor", "Judith Fran Kroll, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["translation", "speech production", "bilingualism", "Revised Hierarchical Model"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Using event-related potentials to track the scope and time course of inhibition during bilingual speech", "id": "25899", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11531", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parallel activation of words in both the bilingual\u2019s two languages has been observed even when bilinguals plan to speak a single word. This observation has sparked intense research on the issue of how bilinguals prevent the irrelevant language from intruding during speech production. The general consensus is that bilinguals exploit cognitive control to regulate the two languages during speech planning. Research demonstrates that, primarily, it is the dominant language (L1) that is regulated during speech planning to enable the less proficient language (L2) to be spoken. Recent research also suggests that regulation of the L1 can be performed via several mechanisms that vary in scope and time course. Evidence suggests that some mechanisms are short-lived, whereas others are long-lasting in time course. In addition, there appear to be mechanisms that restrict the access of specific words in the lexicon and some that affect the whole language itself, potentially producing extended consequences for the production system and for cognition more generally, that distinguish bilinguals from monolinguals. It is not yet known how mechanisms that exist for planning speech in the L2 manifest for L2 learners, for whom regulation of the L1 is anticipated to be even more crucial for enabling the L2 to be spoken. In addition, the issue of whether regulation during speech has consequences for L2 learners\u2019 cognition is even less well understood. This dissertation aims to better understand the impact of L1 regulation for L2 learners\u2019 speech planning as well as their cognitive functions. The innovation of this dissertation is to observe the processes that enable L2 production for learners who are limited in speaking the L2, by examining consequences of attempting to speak the L2 on the L1.

Whereas many studies have sought to understand differences in community involvement and prosocial behavior between religious people and non-religious people, this dissertation focuses on attenders of religious congregations. This focus contributes to the literature on religion, community involvement, and prosocial behavior in a number of ways. First, it helps to explain why some attenders become involved in the community and engage in prosocial behavior, while other attenders do not. Additionally, it investigates how congregational context and activities relate with community involvement and prosocial behavior. This dissertation examines involvement in congregationally sponsored community service activities. Using a sample of attenders and congregations from the 2008/2009 U.S. Congregational Life Survey (USCLS), this dissertation seeks to understand how congregations can encourage their attenders to become involved in these community service activities and whether they can use these activities to encourage attenders to engage in private prosocial behavior, that is, in prosocial behavior that is not through organizations or activities.\n\nI begin this dissertation by introducing its main concepts and by providing an outline of its contributions to the literature (Chapter 1). Next, I discuss the 2008/2009 USCLS and the statistical methods used in this dissertation, including multilevel modeling and multiple imputation (Chapter 2). Following these introductory chapters, I present three empirical chapters. Since congregationally sponsored community service activities are rarely examined in other studies, in the first empirical chapter (Chapter 3), I explore involvement in these activities and describe how involvement in these activities varies among religious traditions. Results from this chapter indicate that Mainline Protestants and Black Protestants are the most likely to be involved in these activities. After exploring involvement in congregationally sponsored community service activities, I turn to understanding why some attenders are involved in these activities while other attenders are not (Chapter 4). The findings suggest that congregational friendships, values/emphases, and context matter for understanding whether attenders are involved in these activities. In the last empirical chapter (Chapter 5), I consider how involvement in congregationally sponsored community service activities relates with private prosocial behavior. Attenders who are involved in these activities are more likely to provide social support, to give charitably, and to be civically engaged. Finally, a concluding chapter (Chapter 6) discusses how congregations can promote community involvement through these activities and use these activities to stimulate private prosocial behavior among attenders.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10455], "author_name_tesi": "McClure, Jennifer Marie", "last_name_ssi": "McClure", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Kent Finke", "Diane Helen Felmlee", "David R Johnson", "Eric Plutzer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Kent Finke, Dissertation Advisor", "Diane Helen Felmlee, Committee Member", "David R Johnson, Committee Member", "Eric Plutzer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Religion", "congregations", "community", "prosocial behavior", "social networks", "values", "theology", "organizations", "activities", "context"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "BUILDING THEORIES: PLAY, MAKING, AND PEDAGOGICAL DOCUMENTATION IN EARLY CHILDHOOD ART EDUCATION\n", "id": "8254", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3973", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The study is theoretical and narrative\u2014anchored in my own subjectivity and in my experiences as a teacher working with young children in an urban elementary school and in a new early childhood program. My participation in a year-long researcher-teacher collaboration in the studio of a Reggio-inspired school for young children and my observations in Reggio Emilia inform the processes through which I have generated data through pedagogical documentation in each of these contexts. In Chapter One, I interrogate images of children to illustrate how constructions of who children are (and who they could become) produce and sustain educational institutions and relationships. It is my intent to place the image of the rich, historical child in a relationship of positive tension with the eternal child. In Chapter Two, I present pedagogical documentation as a form of ethnographic research through which educators generate, test, and refine theories as they co-construct knowledge with young children. Here, I trace how the small theories that teachers develop through practice can contribute richness and complexity to the larger body of theory in educational research.  In Chapter Three, I situate children\u2019s visual productions as cognitive and socio-cultural processes that are socially distributed to investigate how children make meanings through making as individual and group learners. I consider children\u2019s making in various media and use theory from contemporary literacy educators to support a construction of children\u2019s visual productions as making in visual languages. I assert that in their making, children strive for communicative fluency. In Chapter Four, I contribute to current theories of child art in early childhood education by positioning children\u2019s visual productions as making\u2014a social practice that performs social work in multiple social worlds\u2014and by extending the theoretical assumptions about children\u2019s making to include ways in which children make with new media. In the Epilogue, I review the theoretical contributions that I make in the study. Those include the idea of unacceptable children, the portability of the Reggio Emilia approach and site-specific pedagogy, the idea of making, and the process of finding voice in research and writing.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3945], "author_name_tesi": "McClure, Marissa Ann ", "last_name_ssi": "McClure", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann ", "first_name_ssi": "Marissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Marme Thompson", "Brent Guy Wilson", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius", "Sarah K Rich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine Marme Thompson, Committee Chair", "Brent Guy Wilson, Committee Member", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Committee Member", "Sarah K Rich, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["art education", "early childhood education", "pedagogical documentation", "art making", "play art"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Think, Record, Reveal: Studio Process Assessment and the Artistic Thinking It Reveals\n\n", "id": "11264", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1046", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation chronicles a year long, four-phase investigation into sixth grade students\u2019 artistic thinking. The principal investigator, working as artist/researcher/ teacher, sought to better understand her own art students and the artistic thinking that would emerge through intentional pedagogical assessment practices. Research on art making, art teachers\u2019 practices, and the pre-adolescent learner merged with theory in assessment, multimodal literacy, and self-regulated learning to shape the research methodology. \nBy combining use of a formative studio-process checklist with the creation of a summative multimodal digital journal (MDJ), sixth grade students created a visual model of their use of the eight Studio Habits of Mind (SHoM). Documentation of the SHoM provided a rich and varied glimpse into the artistic thinking strategies students utilized when making narrative paintings. Analysis of the student-created MDJs proved beneficial in revealing both the nature of students\u2019 artistic thinking, and in revealing the effectiveness of curricular design. The research data was analyzed for emergent categories within each SHoM, adding to what is known about the artistic thinking of pre-adolescent learners. Students\u2019 tendency to display the SHoM was also analyzed through art making. The principal investigator merged her roles of artist/researcher/teacher creating Data Quilts based upon students\u2019 use of the formative studio-process checklist and summative evidence found in the MDJs. The quilts served to literally make the data visible both to her and to her students. \nEvidence from the study suggests three conclusions regarding artistic thinking; (1) the SHoM facilitate artistic discussion; (2) students value different aspects of the studio process; and (3) students can identify and express their artistic needs. More over, the MDJ proved an effective tool in assessing both student learning and classroom pedagogy. The MDJ enabled teachers\u2019 photographic documentation of classroom art making to be combined with student reflection, creating a shared assessment of student learning. \n\tImplications of this study suggest that wide-spread adoption of artistic thinking dispositions into pedagogical practice would help to create a broader understanding of students\u2019 artistic thinking, and could facilitate conversations amongst educator\u2019s intent on helping students to express themselves through meaningful artistic practices. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1036], "author_name_tesi": "McComb, Camilla ", "last_name_ssi": "McComb", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Camilla", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius", "Christine M Thompson", "Kimberly Anne Powell", "Mary Catherine Scheeler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Dissertation Advisor", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Committee Chair", "Christine M Thompson, Committee Member", "Kimberly Anne Powell, Committee Member", "Mary Catherine Scheeler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["formative assessment", "pre-adolescent", "artistic thinking", "assessment", "multimodal literacy", "artistic pedagogy", "studio habits of mind", "artist/researcher/teacher", "naturalistic inquiry", "qualitative research", "volitional strategies", "multimodal digital journal", "studio-process"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "PARENTS USING EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION TO TEACH READING TO THEIR CHILDREN AT-RISK FOR READING DIFFICULTIES", "id": "12114", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "742", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Kindergarten students at-risk for reading difficulties were selected for participation in a reading program.

Encouraging women to enter the potential pool of political aspirants requires society to acknowledge and value the unique roles and relationships that many women hold as participants in both the public and private domain. As a result, in its\u00a1\u00a6 gendered state, this gendered social capital is often undervalued and ignored as viable currency as women decide whether or not to venture onto the varied pathways leading to the legislature.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3157], "author_name_tesi": "McCormick Higgins, Judith Ann", "last_name_ssi": "McCormick Higgins", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Judith", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ian E Baptiste", "Fred Michael Schied", "Alison Alene Carr Chellman", "Carol Ruth Nechemias"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ian E Baptiste, Committee Chair", "Fred Michael Schied, Committee Member", "Alison Alene Carr Chellman, Committee Member", "Carol Ruth Nechemias, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Women legislators", "Pennsylvania", "Maryland", "women politicians"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Characterizing Properties of Optical Fibers and Fiber Couplings to Near-Infrared High-Resolution Spectrographs Critical to Precision Radial-Velocity Studies", "id": "13940", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7283", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     The search for exoplanets, planets orbiting stars beyond our own Solar System, is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting areas of astronomical research.

We tested a structural model of infant and parent night waking and sleep quality as predictors of parent distress and coparenting using maximum likelihood estimation. The frequency of infant night waking predicted father and mother night waking, which in turn predicted self-reports of parent sleep quality. Poor parent sleep quality predicted elevated depressive symptoms, and finally depressive symptoms were negatively related to perceptions of coparenting and marital quality.

The ability of parents to cooperate, support one another, and avoid undermining or criticizing each other influences the quality of their couple relationship across time as well as can spill over into their children\u2019s behavior and well-being. Coparenting quality can influence children directly through compromising the emotional security that children feel in regards to their parents and indirectly as the quality of coparenting spills over into the quality of parenting children receive from each individual parent.  Coparenting can also be a source of strain or support for parents, as they provide assistance to one another in parenting. Therefore, examining the development of coparenting contributes in important ways to efforts to enhance family and child well-being.\n\nSome studies have reported a moderate degree of stability in the quality of coparenting during the early years after birth\u2014with those parents who start off working well together continuing to work well together later\u2014yet researchers have often left relatively large gaps in between assessments of coparenting quality. For example, many longitudinal studies of coparenting tend to assess coparenting every 6 months to 1 year. These large gaps in between assessments leave us with an inadequate understanding of the complex family processes that are experienced by parents and children on a daily basis. Furthermore, the so-called \u201cstability\u201d that is observed in these studies tells nothing of what happens in between these various snapshots of family life. Indeed, coparenting quality likely fluctuates within families over shorter periods of time, as parents and families deal with the stresses of everyday life and seek for equilibrium. Moreover, these fluctuations likely hold meaning for relationships, parents, and children. Therefore, the current dissertation fills this gap in the research by examining coparenting quality on a daily basis. \n\nData for this dissertation were drawn from the Daily Family Life Project (DFLP), a longitudinal and daily diary study of parenting and family relationships in 183 couples with a young child under age 5. In Study I, I developed and validated the Daily Coparenting Scale (D-Cop), a 10 item measure of parents\u2019 perceptions of daily coparenting quality. Utilizing multilevel factor analysis, I identified two daily coparenting factors at both the between- and within-person level: positive and negative daily coparenting. The reliabilities for assessing within-person change of the overall D-Cop and individual positive and negative subscales were good, and I confirmed that parents' reports of coparenting quality fluctuated on a daily basis. Also, I established the initial validity of the D-Cop, as scores related as expected to (a) an established measure of coparenting in the field and to (b) couple relationship quality, parent depressive symptoms, and child behavior problems. Further, fluctuations in daily couple relationship feelings related to fluctuations in daily coparenting quality.\n\nIn Study II, I utilized multilevel modeling to examine predictors of within-person fluctuations in daily coparenting quality. Specifically and in line with frameworks on parenting and coparenting, I examined contextual (daily relationship quality, daily stressors, daily childcare burden), parent (daily negative emotions, gender), and child factors (daily child negative emotion, daily child-induced parenting stress) as predictors of mothers' and fathers' perceptions of daily coparenting quality.  I found significant effects for daily relationship feelings, stressors, burden in childcare, parent negative mood, and parenting stress, although not child negative mood. These results indicate that on days when parents experience worse relationship satisfaction, more stressors, greater childcare burden, more negative emotions, and greater parenting stress\u2014as compared with their usual level\u2014they feel that coparenting functions more poorly than normal. No gender differences emerged in the effects of the predictors on daily coparenting. \n\nAs coparenting that is highly variable from day-to-day could potentially be a source of stress and insecurity for parents and children, Study III examined the overall extent of within-person variability in daily coparenting across 14 days as a predictor of change in relationship (couple relationship quality, coparenting quality), individual (parent depressive symptoms), and child outcomes (internalizing and externalizing behavior) across 6 months.  Overall, I confirmed that daily variability was unhealthy for some parent and child outcomes. Specifically, parents who showed higher variability were at risk of increasing depression, deteriorating coparenting quality, and increases in their child\u2019s behavior problems. This was especially true for parents who already showed high levels of negative daily coparenting behavior on average, and variability in negative coparenting (e.g., undermining, hostility) held more meaning for outcomes than variability in positive coparenting (e.g., support, cooperation). \n\nThis dissertation contributes in many ways to the prior coparenting literature, as no work has examined coparenting at more micro time scales than months or years. The largest contributions of this dissertation to the literature include the first daily diary measure of coparenting quality (Daily Coparenting Scale), confirmation of fluctuations in coparenting quality on a daily basis, the potential meanings of daily variability in coparenting quality for parent and child outcomes, and potential avenues for targeted interventions to further stabilize and improve coparenting on a daily basis. The findings support and expand prior research and conceptualizations of coparenting as a dynamic construct that is multiply determined and that holds meaning for family, parent, and child well-being. This dissertation also suggests that studying family relationships at more micro-process levels (such as days) is useful and can assist researchers in uncovering processes of change for improving the quality of family relationships.

While soil responses to harvesting have been extensively studied over several decades, a major gap in our knowledge is predicting how forest harvesting will interact with a changing climate. Climate models predict increases in temperature, as well as changes in precipitation in the northeastern United States. Increases in soil temperature and moisture alone, separate from harvesting effects, have been shown to increase C and N mineralization. Therefore, predicted regional climate change may exacerbate post-harvest C and N losses in some areas such as northeastern forests. The major goal of this dissertation was to test whether or not simulated climate change may indeed increase soil C and N fluxes and losses from mineral soil and examine the mechanisms driving this.  \nA post-harvest climate manipulation experiment was established in the ridge and valley region of central Pennsylvania. The experimental design was a 2 x 2 factorial which included four treatments: warmed, wetted, warmed+wetted, and ambient. Warmed treatments had a targeted increase in surface temperatures of ~2 \u00b0C. Wetted plots received a target of +20% of long-term average precipitation. Soil biogeochemical responses to the climate manipulations were measured for 2.5 years as the forest regenerates from a whole-tree harvest.  My overarching objectives were to 1) quantify changes in soil C and N pools and fluxes due to increased temperature and precipitation treatments in a post-harvest forest and 2) understand how changes in C and N cycling are linked to changes in soil microbial community composition and enzyme activity.   \nRelative to controls, warmed treatments increased mean daily temperature of surfaces and soil (5 cm depth) by 1.8 and 2.5 \u00b0C, respectively, over the duration of the experiment.  Warming also decreased the number of soil freeze-thaw events, and increased growing degree days, frost-free days, and the amount of time leaf surface temperatures were in optimal photosynthetic range.  Wetted treatments increased mean monthly precipitation by 23%, but did not change the amount of time the soil water potential at 5 cm depth was below the permanent wilting point (-1.5 MPa). There was a significant interaction of warming and wetting on surface and soil temperature, emphasizing the importance of multivariate climate change experiments.\nSoil C and N fluxes, labile pools, and treatment effects on those pools and fluxes were all greatest the first year immediately after harvest compared to subsequent years, which is consistent with results from prior harvesting studies.   The warmed and warmed+wetted treatments significantly increased NH4-N (p = 0.0275) and NO3-N (p = 0.0016) accumulating on ion exchange membranes in soil during the first year compared to the non-warmed treatments.  The warmed treatment increased soil-atmosphere CO2 efflux (p = 0.026) over 2.5 years relative to ambient.  The wetted treatment significantly increased cumulative soil N2O efflux over 2.5 years (p = 0.0270).  Soil temperature and moisture were strong predictors of soil respiration (R2 = 0.75, p = 0.0001), but treatments significantly affected this relationship.  The two-factor treatment (warmed+wetted) had a negative interaction decreasing CO2 effluxes compared to ambient during the growing season, but showing no overall effect on cumulative soil CO\u00ac2 efflux.  Despite significant treatment differences in C and N fluxes, there were no treatment effects on labile or bulk soil C and N contents.  Total N in all treatments declined on average 34% from immediately after harvest to the end of the experiment.  Post-harvest soils under climate change showed significantly different trace gas emissions and N availability, meaning disturbances under future climates may have a greater positive feedback with climate change (through increased CO2 and N2O fluxes) and release more N to eutrophication-sensitive bodies of water.\nI used ecologically meaningful extracellular enzyme (EE) ratios to explain treatment effects observed in soil C and N fluxes and, in an exploratory study, determine what soil C and N metrics may best be predicted by soil EEs and their ratios. Post-harvest soils were measured for &#946;-1,4-glucosidase (BG), cellobiohydrolase (CBH), leucine aminopeptidase (LA),  N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG), peroxidase (PER), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities over 2.5 years.  Soil hydrolase enzymes (BG, CBH, LA, and NAG) all showed greater mean activities than those reported from other studies including study sites with similar climatic and edaphic characteristics.  This suggested high overall soil microbial activity after forest harvest which is supported by the high soil C and N fluxes that year. Only BG and NAG showed significant treatment effects from ambient with a two-factor interaction with BG (p = 0.029) and warmed effect on NAG (p = 0.007).  Warming decreased BG relative to ambient and NAG relative to wetted plots.  There was substantial variability in the season and time since harvest, but water-extractable organic C (WEOC), C:N, and total N best explained the variability of EEAs over the experiment (p\u2019s < 0.05).  Two exoenzyme ratios, BG:(LA+NAG) and BG:PPO, did not vary among treatments.  However, the ratio of nitrogen acquiring enzymes (LA+NAG) to that of the other enzyme activity did show a significant warmed by wetted effect and increased over the time of the experiment indicating possible N limitation in N-acquiring enzymes over time and greater within warmed only treatments.  Extracellular enzyme activity in a post-harvest forest soil was affected more by increased temperature but not by increased precipitation, and surprisingly the warming treatment had the opposite effect on soil C and N mineralization (i.e. warming increased the soil C and N fluxes, but decreased the BG and NAG).\nSoil microbial biomass, fungal to bacterial biomass (F:B), community-level physiological profiles (CLPP), and a reciprocal transplant incubation (RTI) experiment were used on soils after receiving the simulated climate treatments for 2.5 years.  This suite of experiments was used to determine if there were changes in the soil microbial community due to the climate manipulations.  There was no noticeable treatment effects on soil microbial biomass or F:B.  All three climate change treatments altered CLPPs as measured with 15 substrates, with 2.5 years of warming having the strongest effect on substrate usage.  Warmed and warmed+wetted soils responded more to low C:N substrates.  The RTI experiment showed that there was a significant soil x inoculum effect (p = 0.0005), but that inoculum was the only significant simple effect (p = 0.001).  This suggests that the soil microbial communities were not limited by the substrates available in their soil, but that they were structurally or physiologically different from one another.   Furthermore, it was shown that the two-factor treatment had a significant home-field disadvantage effect, reflecting a soil microbial community that is maladapted to utilizing the substrates in their own soil.  This I hypothesized was due to combined increase in stress events from wetting-drying events and the infrared lamps decreasing soil moisture.\nTo summarize, the climate treatments showed significantly different fluxes in soil C and N but no observable treatment effects on soil pools.  This could be due to either inputs balancing losses or a lack of precision and accuracy in the methods used in this study to measure soil C and N pools.  Soil microbial physiology, community structure, or both were altered due to the simulated climate scenarios.  Warming had a greater effect on the soil microbial EEA and CLPPs and indicated possible increase in simple N substrate limitation. \nI show evidence that whole-tree forest harvest in a future warmer and wetter northeastern US could cause even greater positive feedback to climate change relative to forest harvested in recent decades.  Furthermore, it is possible that harvesting could increase N leaching rates to aquatic ecosystems.  However, an interesting finding which contradicts many climate manipulation experiments in mature ecosystems was that when post-harvest soils were warmed and wetted there was a negative interaction on soil C and N fluxes, and that this was brought about mostly through a shift in microbial community physiology or composition. This research provides evidence that soil C and N biogeochemistry and the microbial communities that drive the cycles in post-harvest soils will be altered under different climate change scenarios.  This alteration could also lead to distinct trajectories in ecosystem succession due to C and N loss. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4030], "author_name_tesi": "McDaniel, Marshall Douglas", "last_name_ssi": "McDaniel", "middle_name_ssi": "Douglas", "first_name_ssi": "Marshall", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye", "Roger Tai Koide", "Hangsheng Lin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye, Dissertation Advisor", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Chair", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye, Committee Member", "Roger Tai Koide, Committee Member", "Hangsheng Lin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["soil microbial communities", "gas flux", "nitrogen", "carbon", "forest", "soil", "clear cutting", "climate change", "forest harvest"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Utilizing Sedum Seeds as an Installation Method for Green Roofs Through Seed Enhancement Techniques", "id": "13750", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7102", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There are many benefits to installing green roofs including reducing storm water runoff and the associated problems with overloaded sewage systems, especially in high density urban areas.  Green roofs also improve rain water and air quality and reduce the effect from urban heat islands by acting as thermal damper/evaporative coolers, which decrease heating and cooling costs and the subsequent pollution.  Additionally, green roofs can extend the life of a roof and create natural habitats for birds and insects.  They are also aesthetically pleasing which can improve people\u2019s psychological state and productivity levels.\n\nOne of the primary limitations to increased green roof installations in the United States is the cost, specifically, the high costs of labor to install the plants on the roof.  The majority of green roofs today are installed using cuttings and/or plugs, nursery containers, vegetative mats, or modules.  Each of these installation methods has advantages and disadvantages, but each requires a significant labor investment in growing and planting the roof.  Due to the lack of their success on large scale green roofs, seeds are rarely used as an installation method, especially during the summer months; however, seed installations could potentially cost far less than other installation methods.  \n\nPlant options for a green roof include various types of annuals, perennials, herbs, and succulents.  Many factors influence plant selection for green roofs.  Chief among them is a plant\u2019s ability to withstand the harsh conditions found on a roof such as high temperatures and a coarse, quick-draining medium.  Currently, Sedum species are the most commonly used plant for green roofs in the Eastern United States because they can tolerate and thrive in the aforementioned conditions.  \n\nSeed germination requires optimal conditions that are seldom available on a green roof.  In this dissertation, five Sedum species (Sedum acre, Sedum forsterianum, Sedum reflexum, Sedum selskianum, and Sedum spurium) were selected to test with seed enhancement techniques and hydroseeding.  Without any previously published research available describing a successful seed enhancement technique, this study sought to create a seed priming technique using a water prime and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) prime.  In addition, hydromulch was used in two of the studies conducted in 2011 to determine whether it held potential as a successful seed installation method.  The five species were also tested for their viability over a period of time after being stored in cool, dry storage.  \n\nThe use of seed priming treatments in laboratory, greenhouse, and outdoor trials did not result in improved seed germination for most of the species.  Although there was slightly higher germination in some of the primed seed species when compared to the control, the cost of the priming treatments would not be worth the small additional percentages gained in germination.  Moreover, this research demonstrated that successful seed germination on a green roof is unlikely to occur without a treatment, such as hydromulch, which holds the seeds in place near the surface of the medium.  \n\nThe hydroseeded trials showed success in holding the seeds near the surface of the medium.  In order to create a dense mat of Sedum species on a green roof, an ideal situation would be about 72 seedlings per square foot.  Using the average germination rates from the control treatments (since they germinated as well or better than the treated seeds) of each seed species, numerical recommendations were made per square foot for hydroseeding a roof with each species.  \n\nWhen the five Sedum species were tested for their viability over a specified period of time, it was determined that for Sedum acre, Sedum reflexum, and Sedum spurium species, the younger seeds germinated faster and had higher germination rates in a range of temperatures.  Sedum forsterianum germination was very sensitive to increases in temperatures at any age of seed and would not, therefore, be recommended for use on a green roof.  Sedum selskianum, on the other hand, was the only one of the five species tested whose germination appeared to be unaffected by seed age.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7093], "author_name_tesi": "McDavid, Kathryn Lyn", "last_name_ssi": "McDavid", "middle_name_ssi": "Lyn", "first_name_ssi": "Kathryn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Berghage Jr.", "Ricky M Bates", "Edmund Jay Holcomb", "Robert David Shannon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Berghage Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Ricky M Bates, Committee Member", "Edmund Jay Holcomb, Committee Member", "Robert David Shannon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Germination", "priming", "seed maturation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "FABRICATION AND PURIFICATION OF SELF-MOTILE NOBLE METAL-SEMICONDUCTOR ACTIVE COLLOIDAL DEVICES\n", "id": "12414", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2742", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Colloidal assembly is a field of scientific research that can be found at the intersection of many fields and disciplines.  As a result, chemists, physicists, materials scientists, and chemical engineers are all active in assembly research.  However, most assemblies currently being fabricated are of model systems (such as assemblies of inert polymer microparticles) and are assembled using material-specific techniques that produce only lab scale quantities of product.\nIn this work, the chemical engineering aspects of colloidal assembly are explored.  The primary question being: how can we design, build, and purify a functional colloidal assembly, using techniques that are generalized and scalable, envisioning the entire colloidal assembly process as one might picture a chemical plant.  The two most important steps in this process, both the assembly of the product from component particles and the separation and purification of the product, are considered.\nThe functional colloidal assembly produced here is a three-component colloidal \u2018trimer\u2019 consisting of three micron-sized particles attached in a specific order, i.e., gold \u2013 cadmium sulfide \u2013 silver, but without a specific orientation.  The assembly process used to form these trimers is developed and characterized in this work.  It is a diffusion-limited, selective, controlled aggregation process called \u2018Quenched Electrostatic Assembly\u2019.  \nWhen placed into a solution of hydrogen peroxide, these trimers act as photoresponsive catalytic motors.  Through selective decomposition of the peroxide and other photoelectrochemical reactions, the motor induces a localized ionic concentration gradient which moves the motor and other particles around it through electro- or diffusiophoresis.  Other systems explored using similar principles are gold-silver heterodoublet motors, calcium carbonate diffusion-induced micropumps and motors, and flows in microchannels due to dissolution and passivation of disturbed geologic samples.\nBecause colloidal assembly is such a broad field, this work encompasses many different fields: interparticle forces, diffusion and aggregation kinetics, catalysis, photoelectrochemistry, geology, and solution electrodynamics, along with many types of colloidal functionalization and analysis.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2737], "author_name_tesi": "McDermott, Joseph James", "last_name_ssi": "McDermott", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell Velegol", "Darrell Velegol", "Michael John Janik", "Themis Matsoukas", "Ayusman Sen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell Velegol, Dissertation Advisor", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Chair", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrophoresis", "colloidal assembly", "micromotors"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "WELLNESS OF TRANSCULTURAL INDIVIDUALS\n\n\n", "id": "10137", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3399", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study presents a general demographic profile and insight into the wellness of a large sample of transculturals (n=289), a first in the field of counseling.

Bitter taste perception has been measured quantitatively through numerous psychophysical methods, making comparisons between studies difficult. Such studies often use a limited set of compounds perceived as bitter to humans. Thought to be an evolutionary mechanism for toxin detection, bitterness is unpleasant, and other reports have mistaken compounds with unpleasant, non-bitter sensations as bitter, possibly due to lack of semantic descriptors available to describe such sensations. Still, however, reports from human and animal studies have suggested that, even for prototypical bitter stimuli, there may be perceivable differences between bitter compounds. Here, seventeen bitter compounds from a range of chemical classes were measured quantitatively for their taste quality and intensity using modern psychophysical scaling with the generalized labeled magnitude scale. Characterizing such a large number of compounds using a modern method helps to establish better concentration-intensity relationships than could previously be determined from prior literature. Intensity-matched concentrations of eleven food-derived bitter compounds were then evaluated qualitatively using directed free sorting in order to remove the use of language from the perceptual experience. Subsets of these eleven compounds were then compared for their similarity to six oral pharmaceutical compounds of identical intensity using a different semantic-free task called Polarized Sensory Positioning. Multidimensional scaling, multiple factor analysis, DISTATIS, and cluster analysis techniques were used to elucidate the perceptual relationships revealed through the qualitative tasks employed. Three unique clusters of predominantly bitter food-derived stimuli were found in free sorting. The first group contained quinine hydrochloride, quinine sulfate and naringin; the second contained caffeine, theobromine, and sucrose octaacetate; the third group contained a high and low concentration of L-tryptophan in addition to L-phenylalanine, tetralone, and urea. Four clusters were revealed using Polarized Sensory Positioning, where both food-derived and pharmaceutical products were compared for their taste qualities to reference stimuli. Reference stimuli, coined poles, were selected from the results of the free sorting experiment, each representing one of the three clusters. These four clusters found in Polarized Sensory Positioning were as follows: a) caffeine and L-phenylalanine, b) quinine hydrochloride, naringin, denatonium, c) sucrose octaacetate, tetralone, L-tryptophan, urea, d) acetaminophen, ranitidine, famotidine, and dextromethorphan. Notably, the pharmaceutical compounds were isolated from the other bitter stimuli in their own cluster, even though all concentrations were shown to be roughly intensity-matched. Overall, these data show that within a set of prototypical bitter exemplars, perceptual differences exist. While the methods employed do not make efforts to define the basis of these differences, these data suggest, from multiple experiments, that bitter taste may consist of distinguishable taste qualities. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14489], "author_name_tesi": "McDowell, Elliott Hunter", "last_name_ssi": "McDowell", "middle_name_ssi": "Hunter", "first_name_ssi": "Elliott", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John E.

Remediation of contaminated sites typically falls into two categories: the traditional pump and treat, which is costly and generally inefficient at removing dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) like TCE; and bioremediation with native or bioaugmented halorespiring organisms.  Hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) of substrates and proppants into TCE contaminanted soils is a developing, but understudied, practice of stimulating in situ bioremediation.  Laboratory studies combining chemical and molecular analyses to evaluate reductive dechlorination stimulated through the addition of a crab shell and sand mixture (substrate used in fracking processes) may lend insight into the assessment and monitoring of contaminated field locations.  \nThis study evaluates the spatial and temporal distribution of dechlorinating populations during crab shell enhanced bioremediation.  Laboratory tests were conducted using a commercially available mixed dechlorinating culture (Bio-Dechlor INOCULUM) containing Dehalococcoides species, capable of complete dechlorination of TCE to ethene, and crab shell (SC-20, SC-40, or SC-80) as a slowly fermentable substrate. Semi-continuous flow columns tests were conducted to evaluate the ability of different grades of commercially available crab shell to enhance degradation of chlorinated solvents at various concentrations.  Continuous flow column tests were conducted to further assess the distribution of dechlorinating populations throughout the course of anaerobic reductive dechlorination.\nIn the semi-continuous flow column study, the SC-20 grade of crab shell provided the greatest variety of fermentation products, supported the greatest ethene production, and maintained a more stable pH than the other grades of crab shell for all test parameters.  The less processed, less costly SC-20 has a higher proportion of protein which contributed to the increased variety of fermentation products, supplying an increased source of reducing equivalents and supporting greater conversion of TCE to ethene.  A circum-neutral pH is also important for the efficient conversion of TCE to ethene, and the natural buffering capacity of the CaCO3 in the SC-20  maintained pH in the columns within the optimal range for dechlorination.  Due to the findings of this study, all subsequent tests were conducted using the SC-20 grade of crab shell.\nIn the continuous flow column tests, Dehalococcoides cell numbers were observed to increase from <1% of the total bacterial population in the influent end of the columns to 9-40% in the second half of the columns.  The individual reductive dehalogenase (RDase) genes only accounted for a portion of the total Dehalococcoides 16S rRNA gene copies suggesting that there may be unidentified RDases in the BDI inoculum.  T-RFLP fingerprinting analysis showed the greatest richness and diversity in communities associated with the solid-phase column materials in the beginning of the experiment (<~10 pore volumes) and in communities associated with pore water at the end of the experiment, suggesting Statistical analysis of the T-RFLP data indicated that neither the solid-phase nor the pore water sampling effectively captured all the dominant populations in the continuous flow columns.  This has implications for field assessments of subsurface microbiology which are traditionally conducted through groundwater sampling.\nFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) processing of intact biofilm extracted from the columns showed archaeal cells in close proximity to Dehalococcoides cells, indicating that competition, if it exists, is not creating spatial stratification, and suggests the possibility of a synergistic relationship.  The close proximity of potentially competing hydrogenotrophs also indicates that the crab shell substrate is capable of supporting multiple hydrogen utilizing microbes. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2514], "author_name_tesi": "McElhoe, Jennifer A", "last_name_ssi": "McElhoe", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rachel Alice Brennan", "Rachel Alice Brennan", "William D Burgos", "John Michael Regan", "Maryann Victoria Bruns"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rachel Alice Brennan, Dissertation Advisor", "Rachel Alice Brennan, Committee Chair", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Crab Shell", "Bioremediation", "Trichloroethene", "Chitin", "qPCR", "FISH"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "SCALABILITY OF THE FORCE OF A NORMALLY IMPACTING VORTEX RING ON A PLANAR SURFACE\n", "id": "10378", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4337", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis addresses one of the issues in developing a non-lethal vortex ring weapon.  Such a weapon would take advantage of the transfer of momentum from a vortex ring to a target and the encapsulation of fluid within the vorticity core.  By transfering its momentum, a vortex ring can knock over or capsize a target in air and water while carrying a chemical agent such as tear gas or marker dye to the target.  Vortex rings of sufficient strength to accomplish these goals have been generated previously, but the relation between the initial strength of the vortex ring and the force that would be imparted to a target is unkown.\n\nThis study hopes to provide the means for enabling a large scale, effective vortex ring weapon by derving a scaling relation for the vortex strength and measuring the impact in a smaller, laboratory setting.  The analytical expression for the impact force of a vortex ring in a normal impact on a planar surface is derived using dimensional analyis of the ring properties.  The relation is experimentally verified by measuring the impact force for vortex rings for a range of initial vortex ring strengths.  The normal impact of a vortex ring with a planar wall has been examined for the motion of the vortex on the wall and the vorticity generated.  However, the force generated by a vortex ring on a wall has never been measured experimentally.\n\t\nExperiments measuring the impact force, pressure on the surface, and motion of the vortex rings were conducted in a large glass tank full of quiescent water with the vortex rings generated by a piston-cylinder assembly.  A planar wall was placed in the path of the vortex rings between 0.45 to 1 m from the nozzle.  The planar surface was on a pivoting assembly with the force transducer anchoring the assembly above the water line.  A pressure transducer was mounted flush with the wall.  An \textit{in situ} calibration was peformed on the measurement system using an impact hammer to ensure an accurate measure of the vortex ring impact force.  The time evolution of the force and pressure on the wall was measured for four different ring strengths and at three distances from the nozzle.  \n\nConcurrent to the force and pressure measurements, the motion of the vortex rings before and during impact was recorded with high-speed digital video camera (HSV).  The high-speed images were analyzed to determine the speed and size of the rings and determine their changes during an impact.  The flowfield of the vortex rings during an impact was measured with digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) to determine the ring's size, speed, and strength.  The measurements of the vortex rings obtained using HSV and DPIV combined with the force and pressure measurements were used to confirm the underlying assumptions made in deriving the analytical expression for force scaling before being applied to the relation itself.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4309], "author_name_tesi": "McErlean, Michael Raymond", "last_name_ssi": "McErlean", "middle_name_ssi": "Raymond", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael H Krane", "Michael H Krane", "Arnold Anthony Fontaine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael H Krane, Thesis Advisor", "Michael H Krane, Thesis Advisor", "Arnold Anthony Fontaine, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["impact force", "high-speed video", "DPIV", "vortex rings", "surface pressure"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Student Behaviors as Predictors of Later Academic Achievement: School Entry Through Fifth Grade\n", "id": "9852", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "285", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between student behaviors and academic achievement at various academic time periods, ranging from kindergarten entry through fifth grade.

As a result, the complex array of protein-RNA interactions is the driving force behind many cellular activities. In Bacillus subtilis, the trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP) regulates expression of the seven tryptophan biosynthesis genes by interacting with the corresponding transcripts. Six of these genes lie in the trpEDCFBA operon, which is regulated by a transcription attenuation mechanism in which tryptophan-activated TRAP binds to 11 (G/U)AG repeats in the nascent trp leader transcript. Binding of TRAP blocks formation of an antiterminator structure and favors formation of an overlapping intrinsic terminator hairpin that prematurely halts transcription, thereby reducing expression of the downstream trp genes.  \nThe work presented here shows that a 5\u2019 stem-loop (5\u2019SL) structure that forms just upstream of the triplet repeat region contributes to TRAP-trp RNA interaction by preferentially increasing the affinity of TRAP for the nascent trp leader transcript during the early stages of transcription, when only a few triplet repeats have been synthesized. This increased affinity allows TRAP to bind shorter transcripts, thereby increasing the efficiency of the transcription attenuation mechanism. Since there is only a short window of time in which binding of TRAP can promote termination, the contribution of the 5\u2019SL to TRAP binding is critical for proper attenuation control. A combination of footprinting assays, affinity assays, phylogenetic comparisons, and mutational studies examining various 5\u2019SL mutants indicate that the 5\u2019SL contacts TRAP through as many as five single-stranded nucleotides that lie within two discrete groups of the RNA structure, the internal loop and the hairpin loop. The intramolecular distance between these two loops is critical to preserving TRAP-5\u2019SL interaction. Results from photochemical crosslinking experiments also show that during TRAP-5\u2019SL interaction, the hairpin loop is in close proximity to the flexible loop region of the protein. These data, combined with molecular modeling of B. subtilis TRAP and of a 3-dimensional model of the 5\u2019SL generated using the MC-Sym and MC-Fold pipeline, have afforded the first molecular-level model of TRAP-5\u2019SL interaction. \nIn addition to participating in TRAP binding, the trp leader 5\u2019SL also participates in turnover of trp mRNA by destabilizing the downstream mRNA sequence, an effect that is opposite to that of most all other bacterial 5\u2019-terminal RNA secondary structures. Mutations altering the 5\u2019SL structure or sequence also led to an increase in mRNA half-life, indicating that the mechanism of 5\u2019SL-mediated destabilization is highly specific. Similarly, chimeric transcripts containing the trp leader 5\u2019SL fused to an unrelated downstream gene showed that the 5\u2019SL alone is insufficient to induce destabilization, suggesting that other components of the trp leader may be necessary to produce this effect. Even though it is involved in the initial stages of the trp transcript decay pathway, it is likely that RNase J1 is not responsible for 5\u2019SL-mediated destabilization of the trp transcript, and further experimentation will be required to identify the associated decay factor. Since some of the 5\u2019SL nucleotides involved in mRNA destabilization also function in TRAP recognition, it appears that two independent regulatory mechanisms have evolved to recognize the same features of an RNA structure, providing an interesting example of the complexity of gene regulation. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [325], "author_name_tesi": "McGraw, Adam Philip", "last_name_ssi": "McGraw", "middle_name_ssi": "Philip", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Lee Babitzke", "Philip C.

Nine intact classes taught by seven different faculty instructors were assigned to one control and two treatment groups, based largely on requirements expressed by the instructors. In each of the courses, the course instructor using two unpublished instruments collected data: self-efficacy for writing a lesson plan (pretask and posttask) and a posttask survey of participant perception. The lesson plan assignments were collected and scored by two independent raters in a blind-review process using the rubric that had been provided to students.\n\nResults\nThe findings indicate participants had an overall high level of self-efficacy for writing a lesson plan, even before the introduction of the rubric. Using a reliability-corrected ANCOVA model significant differences were found for posttask self-efficacy, favoring the control group. No significant differences were found on achievement for writing a lesson plan. Participants\u2019 perceptions of rubric use, as reported on the posttask survey, indicated agreement with the perception that the rubric provided explanations for how to do the lesson plan, helped understanding of the requirements, helped establish goals, and helped with self-evaluation.\n\nLimitations. The reading of this study should be done with an understanding of the study's limitations with respect to recruitment of participants, assignment of treatments, adherence to procedures, equivalence of raters, instrumentation, characteristics of participants, and the nature of the task.  This study was conducted in a naturalistic educational context in which the participants and their instructors interacted with one another and the study materials in a manner that was influenced significantly by instructors' philosophies of education, views on the design and use of rubrics, and beliefs concerning the characteristics of a high-quality lesson plan.

The effective implementation of a rubric use strategy in this study was hindered by the limitations of the study and as a result, seems to have exposed a set of conditions under which rubric use may interfere with learner self-efficacy. As a result, it is recommended that instructors ensure congruence of the course grading policy with the use of the rubric.

These have shown that apart from increased emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), biodiesel fueled engine emissions are equivalent or lower than for petroleum diesel fuel.  An important property to consider for the future conversion to petroleum/bio diesel fuel blends is oxidative stability.  Biodiesel has low oxidative stability leading to the formation of undesirable compounds and property changes many times faster than petroleum-based fuel when exposed to air.  As a result it is necessary to investigate possible implications of having aged, or partially oxidized, biodiesel in future diesel fuel blends.  \n\n\tAn air-cooled direct-injected naturally aspirated Yanmar diesel engine with a custom designed exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) loop was chosen as the platform for the follow-up study due to its flexibility and low fuel consumption.

These four fuels along with a baseline PC-10 pure petro-diesel were all run at 3600 RPM and 75% load at both 0% and 10% EGR settings.  B20 is the most widely promoted biodiesel blend and is specifically called for in the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005.

There was however an overall penalty to NOx emissions seen as an increase with all B20 blends, commonly called the biodiesel NOx effect.   As expected when EGR was added, all the fuels show a significant decrease in NOx emissions while holding constant or increasing total particulate emissions.  However when B20 based on partially oxidized biodiesel and 10% EGR are used together, very low total particulate and low NOx are observed with both SME and CME.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6259], "author_name_tesi": "McGuire, Thomas Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "McGuire", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Yaw D Yeboah", "Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor", "Yaw D Yeboah, Thesis Advisor", "Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["diesel", "biodiesel", "renewable fuels", "alternative fuels"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Permeability Evolution of Stressed Fractures Permeated by Reactive Fluids", "id": "15033", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7591", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the dynamic response of stressed fractures during the flow of reactive fluids is an important contemporary research topic. Specifically, understanding the response of stressed fractures in carbonate is important for both energy (petroleum) production and sequestration of the products of energy use (carbon dioxide). We conduct tightly constrained experiments on artificial fractures with repeatable initial roughness and permeability to measure permeability response and rates of mineral dissolution during the flow of reactive fluids. These experiments are supplemented by detailed numerical modeling to better understand relevant mechanisms; namely pressure solution, stress corrosion cracking enhanced diffusion, precipitation, and free-face dissolution, that lead to permeability evolution of these fractures and to accurately quantify their relative rates.\n\nExperimental measurements are conducted on various lengths of 2.5 cm diameter cylindrical samples of tight, vuggy, Capitan Massive limestone. A single rough artificial fracture with repeatable initial permeability is created in the samples by making a single longitudinal saw cut prior to roughening the surface with either 60 grit (rough) or 150 grit (smooth) ceramic abrasive. The effective permeability-inferred hydraulic aperture of these fractures is monitored throughout each experiment by the mass balance of the percolating reactive fluid maintained at a fixed hydraulic gradient. Relative rates of pressure solution, stress corrosion cracking enhanced diffusion, precipitation, and free-face dissolution lead to either net fracture gaping or compaction. Dissolved mineral mass balance in the pore fluid provides an independent means of quantifying fracture closure or gaping, depending on the relative strength of each mechanism.\n\nTo decipher these mixed effects numerical models are developed. Lumped parameter models of stress corrosion cracking enhanced diffusion and free-face dissolution provide adequate representation of short, low stress fracture aperture strain when coupled with experimentally measured fracture profiles and effluent concentrations of dissolved mineral. Finite element analysis of pressure solution, stress corrosion cracking enhanced diffusion, precipitation, and free-face dissolution also provide adequate agreement with both effluent concentrations of dissolved minerals and average rates of fracture aperture strain. These finite element models are based on previously quantified relative fracture flow areas, chemical kinetics, and other controling parameters.\n\nResults of these studies include development of a mass flux ratio to accurately determine the likely long-term evolution of fracture permeability in fractures under low ambient stress. In addition we show that pressure solution is a significant transient mechanism leading to permeability evolution, even in fractures subjected to low stress. We use the same experimental data and finite element model to present a method to quantify the probability of stable (compaction) and unstable (gaping) permeability evolution in fractures. Finally, agreement between experimental and simulation data allows strong assertions to be made regarding contrasting carbonate dissolution rates for free-face dissolution and pressure solution during flow of extremely under-saturated aqueous solutions of carbon dioxide. We measure a free-face dissolution rate that approaches theoretical pH-indicated limits during extremely short fracture residence times of extremely under-saturated fluids.

However, the full mini-routes proved to be much better indicators of avian response with both the landscape metrics and the annual rates of change.  \n     Regression analysis indicated that there were not any significant relationships between the avian guilds and oil and gas development.  However, some of the other landscape metrics did suggest connections between fragmentation and avian response. Forest generalist appeared to be the guild most affected by current measures of fragmentation, and edge forest appeared to be the guild most affected by annual rates of change.  Overall, the guilds seemed to be more affected by annual rates of fragmentation than by current measures of fragmentation, but more testing is needed with a larger sample size of the full mini-routes.  \n     The Allegheny National Forest offered a unique opportunity to study the effects of oil and gas development on fragmentation and breeding birds.  Understanding the long term effects of fragmentation will help to inform wildlife management practices and contribute to the development of environmentally sensitive policies for natural resource extraction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4221], "author_name_tesi": "McGunegle, Margaret Lauren", "last_name_ssi": "McGunegle", "middle_name_ssi": "Lauren", "first_name_ssi": "Margaret", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Alan Miller", "Douglas Alan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Alan Miller, Thesis Advisor", "Douglas Alan Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["forest fragmentation", "oil and gas development", "avian habitat guilds", "Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas", "Allegheny National Forest"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ANALYZING INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION:  A REVIEW OF THE POTENTIAL FOR SUSTAINED ETHANOL PRODUCTION IN PENNSYLVANIA", "id": "9693", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5524", "abstract_tesi": "Rapid expansion of ethanol production in the United States is reshaping the industry.  From 1999\u20132006, production increased an average of 29% annually.  According to the Renewable Fuels Association, ethanol production will double again in the next five years.  Corn is the primary feedstock for ethanol production in the United States.  In the past, the Midwestern location of corn production dictated the co-location of ethanol plants.  The effort by different states to meet the federal renewable fuels standard (RFS) is changing the regional distribution of ethanol plants.  Expansion of ethanol production is now occurring in corn-deficient regions, like Pennsylvania.  The beginnings of an ethanol industry in Pennsylvania emerged in 2008 as BioEnergy LLC began to construct the first plant, which was located in Clearfield, PA.  Understanding this expansion and evaluating the location decision requires answers to two basic questions (1) \u201cwhy here\u201d; and (2) \u201dcan this location be competitive?\u201d  In this thesis, I conducted a critical case study and applied industrial location theory to answer these questions.  This involved a direct price comparison of the most important input factors to show which locations have a cost advantage.  Analysis of the feedstock, energy and utility costs demonstrated that on a like-fuel basis, a plant in Pennsylvania is not competitive with an identical plant in Iowa, for example.  However, if a plant in Pennsylvania uses coal or waste coal as a fuel, then it can compete with a natural gas-fueled plant in Iowa.  Ethanol production in Pennsylvania, to be competitive with production in Iowa, must rely on the use of coal.

Yet these texts also rely on performance-based energies in conflict with the historiographical allegiances of realism. Realist narrative has been viewed as a product of \u201cinterplay\u201d at the \u201cintersection of contrasting codes\u201d by Marshall Brown (231, 233), and similarly George Levine asserts that realism posits mixed conditions, offering more nuanced conceptions of realism (4). Brown\u2019s theory of contrasting codes frames my placing of two different entities, cultural entertainment and American realism, into conversation to exemplify realism\u2019s generic struggles and dependence on the seemingly oppositional space of a live production. I also expand on Levine\u2019s identification of \u201cmixed conditions\u201d as I see performance sites playing into the mixed outcome of the realist novel, altering any type of monological realism that might otherwise have been attainable. \n     These conflicts give way to \u201cmisdirected realism\u201d to account for the anomalies present as a result of the performance site\u2019s influence. Misdirected realism, which will be an umbrella term for the sub-genre of realism I see stemming from the novels\u2019 translation of a performance site, deviates from traditional realism in its pedagogical effects on rethinking race, class, gender and other issues and concerns. Misdirected realism challenges preconceptions of realist texts, repositions a performance site that adds to the misdirection present in the novel, and establishes openings for further work on the relationship between cultural entertainment and American realist novels. Although \u201cmisdirect\u201d might imply a negative implication\u2014\u201cto direct wrongly\u201d\u2014the term is also rich with subversive potential, as in \u201cto direct one\u2019s efforts [or] attention away from the proper or intended target.\u201d I consider the \u201cintended target\u201d to be realism as Howells typically classified the genre. More precisely, misdirected realism plays with realist tenets to redirect readers\u2019 attentions to new perspectives regarding the agency of female salon hostesses or the authority of African American narrative voices. Misdirection also stems from the popular entertainments that Howells condemned for their artificiality, as each of my performance sites engages in misdirection. Misdirection affords realist authors flexibility in their techniques and strategies for exploring issues of authorship and privileging a previously marginalized perspective. The misdirections multiply further as I chart authors\u2019 crisscrossing of genres in unexpected ways as well as characters\u2019 crossings of gender, race, class and cultural boundaries. \n     To explore all the misdirections at work, my methodology consists of treating a select but varied set of examples so as to afford a deeper analysis into the interdymamics at play. To that end, I have carefully paired a single author and his/her/their text with an historically grounded account of a specific performance site influencing the novel\u2019s formal and thematic properties to offer a new perspective that takes into account the effects of merging the two modes. The cultural entertainments that underlie my literary discussions, the British abolition lecture circuit, the Howellsian farce, the American salon, and the black abolitionist panorama, produce generic hybridity within all of the texts and amount, part and parcel, to my categorization of these novels as a subgenre of realism as well as realist(esque) according the greater and lesser ways in which they challenge foundational tenets of realism. This subgenre of misdirected realism, to be expounded on in the dissertation that follows, reflects the intricate and interdynamic ways in which various performance sites shape the content, writing style, and/or the form of the American realist novel.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14400], "author_name_tesi": "McGunigal, Lisa ", "last_name_ssi": "McGunigal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lisa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean X.

Using Mountainville as a revelatory case, this grounded theory study explores the origins of school-community conflict, the processes through which it is exacerbated and resolved, and the effects of conflict on school-community relations. \n\nThe grounded theory resulting from this study explains how macro and micro social and economic contexts contribute to community fragmentation and competing values and interests regarding education at the local level.

In the informal arena, coalitions consolidate political power around competing hegemonic narratives of the rural community. \n\nThe centrality of competing narratives in this grounded theory is more appropriate for the study of rural school-community engagement than traditional notions of micropolitics because in rural communities, community identity is tied to the local school. Furthermore, because of the importance of community identity to rural populations, the politicization of this identity through the propagation of competing hegemonic narratives can result in social exclusion of community members and have lasting negative effects on rural communities and schools.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1716], "author_name_tesi": "McHenry-Sorber, Erin C.", "last_name_ssi": "McHenry-Sorber", "middle_name_ssi": "C.", "first_name_ssi": "Erin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kai Arthur Schafft", "Kai Arthur Schafft", "Nona Ann Prestine", "Dana Lynn Mitra", "Jacqueline Edmondson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kai Arthur Schafft, Dissertation Advisor", "Kai Arthur Schafft, Committee Chair", "Nona Ann Prestine, Committee Member", "Dana Lynn Mitra, Committee Member", "Jacqueline Edmondson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rural education", "local education politics", "micropolitics", "teacher strike", "collective bargaining", "unions", "educational leadership"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF OPIOID GROWTH FACTOR (OGF) AND LOW-DOSE NALTREXONE (LDN) ON THE CD4+ T CELL-BASED IMMUNE RESPONSE TO MOG35-55 PEPTIDE ", "id": "11909", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1529", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS).  This disorder is classified as autoimmune in nature due to the elevated levels of CD4+ T cells that are specific for major myelin proteins.  Though the cause of MS is unknown, it has been suggested that genetically susceptible individuals have a predisposition to develop MS after exposure to certain environmental factors.  The four types of MS are relapsing-remitting (RR)-MS, primary progressive (PP)-MS, secondary progressive (SP)-MS, and primary relapsing (PR)-MS.  (RR)-MS patients generally recover in between relapses and symptoms subside.  However, over half of the (RR)-MS patients that do not receive treatments early in their disease course gradually develop secondary progressive (SP)-MS. Primary relapsing MS is an extremely rare form of MS that is characterized by neurological decline with exacerbations that occur later in life.  \nExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a frequently studied model of MS.  EAE can be induced in many ways but a common method is to prime mice with specific myelin peptide epitopes in adjuvant.  The specific myelin peptide used in this study was the myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35-55).  EAE produces a T cell-mediated autoimmune response that closely mimics MS.  Due to the similarities between EAE and MS, EAE has become a favored model for evaluating the pathogenesis of and therapies for MS.  \nOpioid growth factor (OGF) has the ability to suppress lymphocyte proliferation in cell cultures that are stimulated with PHA and in the secondary lymphoid organs of mice injected with MOG35-55 peptide.  The action of OGF is mediated by OGFr, which is responsible for causing signaling events that upregulate the expression of the cyclin-dependent inhibitory kinases p16 and p21.  By inhibiting the downstream signaling events that occur in a stimulated and actively proliferating lymphocyte, OGF is able to suppress lymphocyte proliferation in the lymphoid organs of mice injected with MOG35-55 peptide.  OGF not only suppresses proliferation of stimulated lymphocytes but also represses the incidence and progression of disease symptoms in EAE mice.  \nRecently, OGF has been shown to act as an immunomodulatory agent on T lymphocytes in culture that were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA).  OGF was able to suppress T lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner but OGF required the lymphocytes to be stimulated and proliferating.  These data demonstrated that the OGF-OGFr axis is capable of suppressing T lymphocyte proliferation in vitro.  In order to determine if OGF could act as an immunosuppressive agent in the spleens and inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs) of MOG-induced EAE mice, the following animal study was performed.\nMice were injected with MOG35-55 peptide that was emulsified in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant in the right and left flanks on days 0 and 7, respectively. Mice were treated with OGF or LDN beginning on the day of disease induction (day 0) and were isolated from mice on days 5, 12, and 20.  OGF and LDN were most effective at suppressing lymphocyte proliferation in the spleens of EAE mice 5 and 12 days post-initial injection with MOG35-55 peptide.  On day 5, OGF and LDN caused a 40% and 26% decrease in the number of cells in the spleens of EAE mice, respectively.  OGF suppressed CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation more effectively than B cells.  OGF and LDN were most effective at suppressing B and T cell proliferation in the ILNs of EAE mice 5 days post-initial injection with MOG35-55 peptide.  On day 5, OGF and LDN treatment resulted in a 49% and 35% decrease in the number of cells in the draining ILNs of EAE mice, respectively.  However, OGF treatment did not suppress B and T lymphocyte proliferation in the draining ILNs of EAE mice on days 12 and 20.  \nMoreover, OGF suppressed B and T lymphocyte proliferation in the spleens and ILNs of mice injected with CFA and pertussis toxin, without MOG35-55 peptide, but not the extent of suppression seen in EAE mice treated with OGF.  In summary, these data demonstrate that OGF is effective at suppressing lymphocyte proliferation and repressing EAE symptoms early in the disease course.  Thus, exogenous application of OGF is able to act as an immunosuppressive agent on cells that are stimulated in culture as well as in mice that are induced to have EAE through MOG35-55 peptide injection.\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1514], "author_name_tesi": "McHugh, Daniel Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "McHugh", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin", "Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["EAE", "OGF", "LDN", "Immunosuppressive agent"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Writing the Edge of Empire: Joseph Roth's Galicia", "id": "13539nlm191", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13539", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In 1924, Joseph Roth traveled to his birthplace of Galicia on assignment as a feuilletonist for the Frankfurter Zeitung. While traveling in the city of Lemberg, Roth claimed that the city had kosmopolitische Neigungen. This dissertation connects theories of cosmopolitanism to Roth\u2019s writing, specifically his feuilletons that he wrote in France and Galicia, as well as his literary masterpiece Radetzskymarsch. Moreover, this work argues that Roth\u2019s cosmopolitanism can be connected with his Galician roots. Joseph Roth, along with Galician authors Leopold von Sacher-Masoch and Karl Emil Franzos, constructed a literary space for Galicia that established a tradition of writing from the periphery. This project focuses on the region of Galicia \u2013 part of modern day Ukraine \u2013 and on the authors who most ambitiously monumentalized it as an essential part of Austria. \nAdditionally, this dissertation contextualizes the space of Galicia by reading the Galician volume of the Die \u00f6sterreichisch-ungarische Monarchie in Wort und Bild. Commissioned in 1884 by the Crown Prince Rudolf, thus often called the Kronprinzenwerk, the project was intended to foster a sense of collective patriotism by celebrating the diversity of the Crown Lands. The relationship between the center and periphery is an essential theme for this work, and Die \u00f6sterreichisch-ungarische Monarchie in Wort und Bild is an excellent example of these tensions at play. \nThis dissertation demonstrates simultaneously how complicated and how much potential a multinational project can be. Nationalist causes that worked against the multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire are most often cited as the primary cause of its downfall, but this dissertation complicates this narrative by pointing to Galicia, where multiculturalism \u2013 to a degree \u2013 existed and thrived for decades. Roth sees this multiculturalism as cosmopolitanism in Lemberg, which has its roots in the other works examined here: Leopold von Sacher-Masoch\u2019s Der Iluj demonstrates the potentiality of Galicia\u2019s cosmopolitanism; Franzos\u2019s Von Wien nach Czernowitz wittily examines topics like boundaries, stereotypes, and national identity; and the Kronprinzenwerk demonstrates how cosmopolitanism was a construction by the center for the periphery of Galicia. All of these sources provide a rich context for understanding how Joseph Roth envisioned Galicia in his fiction and reportage. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13292], "author_name_tesi": "McInteer, Nicole Lea", "last_name_ssi": "McInteer", "middle_name_ssi": "Lea", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Daniel Purdy", "Dr. Daniel Purdy", "Dr. Thomas Beebee", "Dr. Richard Page", "Dr. Sophie De Schaepdrijver", "Dr. Bettina Brandt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Daniel Purdy, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Daniel Purdy, Committee Chair", "Dr. Thomas Beebee, Committee Member", "Dr. Richard Page, Committee Member", "Dr. Sophie De Schaepdrijver, Outside Member", "Dr. Bettina Brandt, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Joseph Roth", "Austro-Hungarian Empire", "Galicia", "cosmopolitanism", "Austrian literature"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PBS SINGS THE BLUES: A HIGH-PROFILE DOCUMENTARY SERIES,\nCOMMERCIAL MEDIA PRACTICES, AND MODERN PUBLIC BROADCASTING\n", "id": "10163", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2231", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With its federal funding never guaranteed, U.S. public broadcasting has struggled from its\nformal inception in 1967 to achieve its mission and ideals.

The physical processes at play in these systems include multiphase compressible flow of the air and lubricant within the gearbox, meshing kinematics and tribology, as well as heat transfer by conduction, and free and forced convection. These physics are coupled across their representative space and time scales in the computational framework developed in this dissertation. These scales span eight orders of magnitude, from the thermal response of the full gearbox O(10^0 m, 10^2 s), through effects at the tooth passage time scale O(10^-2 m, 10^-4 s), down to tribological effects on the meshing gear teeth O(10^-6 m, 10^-6 s).\n\nDirect numerical simulation of these coupled physics and scales is intractable. Accordingly, a scale-segregated simulation strategy was developed by partitioning and treating the contributing physical mechanisms as sub-problems, each with associated space and time scales, and appropriate coupling mechanisms. These are:\n\n1. the long time scale thermal response of the system,\n2. the multiphase (air, droplets, and film) aerodynamic flow and convective heat transfer within the gearbox,\n3. the high-frequency, time-periodic thermal effects of gear tooth heating while in mesh and its subsequent cooling through the rest of rotation,\n4. meshing effects including tribology and contact mechanics.\n\nThe overarching goal of this dissertation was to develop software and analysis procedures for gearbox loss-of-lubrication performance. To accommodate these four physical effects and their coupling, each is treated in the CFD code as a sub problem. These physics modules are coupled algorithmically. Specifically, the high-frequency conduction analysis derives its local heat transfer coefficient and near-wall air temperature boundary conditions from a quasi-steady cyclic-symmetric simulation of the internal flow. This high-frequency conduction solution is coupled directly with a model for the meshing friction, developed by a collaborator, which was adapted for use in a finite-volume CFD code. The local surface heat flux on solid surfaces is calculated by time-averaging the heat flux in the high-frequency analysis. This serves as a fixed-flux boundary condition in the long time scale conduction module. The temperature distribution from this long time scale heat transfer calculation serves as a boundary condition for the internal convection simulation, and as the initial condition for the high-frequency heat transfer module. \n\nUsing this multi-scale model, simulations were performed for equilibrium and loss-of-lubrication operation of the NASA Glenn Research Center test stand. Results were compared with experimental measurements. \n\nIn addition to the multi-scale model itself, several other specific contributions were made. Eulerian models for droplets and wall-films were developed and implemented in the CFD code. A novel approach to retaining liquid film on the solid surfaces, and strategies for its mass exchange with droplets, were developed and verified. Models for interfacial transfer between droplets and wall-film were implemented, and include the effects of droplet deposition, splashing, bouncing, as well as film breakup. These models were validated against airfoil data. \n\nTo mitigate the observed slow convergence of CFD simulations of the enclosed aerodynamic flows within gearboxes, Fourier stability analysis was applied to the SIMPLE-C fractional-step algorithm. From this, recommendations to accelerate the convergence rate through enhanced pressure-velocity coupling were made. These were shown to be effective. \n\n\nA fast-running finite-volume reduced-order-model of the gearbox aero-thermodynamics was developed, and coupled with the tribology model to investigate the sensitivity of loss-of-lubrication predictions to various model and physical parameters. This sensitivity study was instrumental in guiding efforts toward improving the accuracy of the multi-scale model without undue increase in computational cost. In addition, the reduced-order model is now used extensively by a collaborator in tribology model development and testing.\n\n\n\nExperimental measurements of high-speed gear windage in partially and fully-shrouded configurations were performed to supplement the paucity of available validation data. This measurement program provided measurements of windage loss for a gear of design-relevant size and operating speed, as well as guidance for increasing the accuracy of future measurements.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11452], "author_name_tesi": "McIntyre, Sean Michael", "last_name_ssi": "McIntyre", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Sean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Francis Kunz", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Philip John Morris", "Jules Washington Lindau V", "Daniel Connell Haworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Francis Kunz, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Jules Washington Lindau V, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CFD", "conjugate heat transfer", "gearbox", "multi-scale model"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Straight Rock Vane Induced Scour in Central Pennsylvania Lower Order, Gravel Bed Streams\n\n", "id": "10707", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4056", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Stream restoration is a rapidly growing field with an estimate of over a billion dollars being spent on thousands of projects every year in the United States.   However, this type of restoration is a relatively new science and the depth of knowledge surrounding this type of endeavor is still somewhat limited.  In the few cases where projects are systematically studied to evaluate their performance, many structures were found to be either ineffective or outright failures.  One source of these failures is a lack of understanding of how these structures affect bedload transport within the reach.\n  \n    The purpose of this study was to determine how a straight rock vane affects scour within three lower order gravel bed stream channels in north central Pennsylvania.  Scour chains were used to measure the scour and fill associated with flow events of sufficient size as to initiate bedload transport.  Networks of 18 to 26 scour chains were installed in a grid that extended across the channel and from above to below the rock vane and were used to determine the amount of aggradation and degradation occurring at these specific sites.  Bulk core samples of the bed material were taken in order to determine the size of particles that were moving during these flows.\n    \n    Each of the three sites experienced two events that initiated bedload movement.   The amount of scour and fill occurring at each site was then plotted spatially within the channel to determine the effect of the rock vane.  Analysis of scour patterns indicated that flow constriction caused by the vane and the slow velocity areas upstream from the structure and the dissipation of kinetic energy resulting from the drop as the flow passes over the face of the rock vane resulted in greater scour depths through these areas.  A zone was developed in an effort to define better these areas and analysis concluded that the depth of scour occurring within this zone, which averaged 104 mm, was significantly greater than the 77 mm of average scour that occurred in other channel locations.  These results will help to further the understanding of how rock vanes affect bedload transport within gravel bed channels.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4031], "author_name_tesi": "McKay, Michael David", "last_name_ssi": "McKay", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr A R Jarrett", "Albert R Jarrett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr A R Jarrett, Thesis Advisor", "Albert R Jarrett, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["incipient motion", "stream restoration", "rock vane", "scour", "fill", "bedload transport", "scour chains", "shear stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Numerical Simulation of Conditionally Turbulent Oscillatory Boundary Layers in Thermoacoustic Devices", "id": "13472vsm107", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13472", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An unsteady, three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes code is developed using the pseudospectral method.

The regulation allowed anglers to harvest up to two trout in the seven- to twelve-inch range per day during the regular season, with catch-and-release regulations in effect the rest of the year. This study is a social assessment of the regulation change.\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify types of anglers based on their specialization and harvest preference characteristics, and to determine whether they differ based on their demographics and opinion on opportunities for feedback on the change.\nMETHODS: Six research questions were developed based on Bryan\u2019s (1977) Specialization Theory, as well as the harvest preference literature. An online survey addressed angling specialization, harvest preference, support of or opposition to the regulation change, feelings toward opportunity for public feedback, and participant information. Survey recruitment cards were placed on vehicles parked along Penns Creek, at local fly-shops and outdoor stores, and on the Internet.\nANALYTICS: Statistical methods included descriptive statistics, K-Means Cluster analysis, ANOVA and Chi-square analysis. Content analysis of open-ended questions was also conducted.\nRESULTS: Two-hundred and one respondents were found to form three clusters: Minimalists, Moderates and Experts. Distinct specialization and harvest preferences characterized each cluster. The content analysis identified unique response patterns to each clusters\u2019 opinion of the regulation change and their opportunities for public feedback.\nCONCLUSION: The special regulation implemented on Penns Creek was the first of its kind in Pennsylvania. This social assessment of the change exposed anglers\u2019 response to this and prior efforts to regulate change on Penns Creek. The results of this study will help the PFBC and other agencies to: (a) develop strategies to facilitate support for proposed regulation changes, (b) develop and implement proactive strategies that incorporate angler preferences in decisions, and (c) better understand angler types\u2019 support of or opposition to a specific regulation change.

Understanding the behavior behind the movement of these items is far more significant for our understanding of prehistory, than simply determining where copper came from. \n\nStill, determining the ultimate source of copper objects has undeniable implications for our models of prehistoric copper acquisition and consumption. There is disagreement over whether copper was acquired exclusively from the large Lake Superior native copper deposits or from many smaller local sources throughout the eastern Woodlands. The debate surrounding this issue has created a situation in which the question of where has greatly overshadowed the question of how.

I addressed this issue by integrating relational communication into the relational turbulence model and developing specific predictions about the associations among relational turbulence, dominance, disaffiliation, and reactions to hurtful events. Specifically, I hypothesized that relational turbulence would be positively associated with perceptions of dominance and disaffiliation in a hurtful interaction with a romantic partner (H1). I also predicted that perceptions of dominance and disaffiliation would result in more intense reactions to hurt, as indexed by intensity of hurt, negative emotions, and perceptions of intentionality (H2). In an effort to bring a dyadic approach to these predictions, I posited that the associations specified in H1 and H2 remain significant after controlling for the perpetrator\u2019s perceptions of the victim\u2019s reactions to hurt (H3). \nI also considered the effects of relational turbulence on conversations that partners have about a past hurtful message. In a fourth hypothesis, I predicted that relational turbulence is positively associated with people\u2019s perceptions of dominance and disaffiliation in a conversation about a past hurtful event (H4). To the extent that partners are experiencing turbulence, they might have difficulty drawing similar relational inferences. Consequently, I also predicted that relational turbulence increases partner\u2019s discrepancies in perceptions of dominance and disaffiliation in a conversation about past hurtful events (H5). In turn, I hypothesized that discrepancies in partners\u2019 perceptions of dominance and disaffiliation decrease their mutual understanding and increase their perceptions of the difficulty of the conversation (H6). In other words, misaligned relational inferences obstruct people\u2019s ability to achieve mutual understanding and increase feelings of difficulty during a conversation focused on resolving a past hurtful event\n\tI conducted three studies to test my predictions. Although the findings for the associations among relational turbulence, dominance, and disaffiliation were inconsistent across the three studies, the results provided initial support for the integration of relational communication and the relational turbulence model. Results showed that relational turbulence positively influences perceptions of dominance, with regard to either a hurtful interaction or a conversation focused on resolving a past hurt. Furthermore, perceptions of dominance positively predicted perceptions of disaffiliation, which influenced people\u2019s reactions to hurt, as indexed by intensity of hurt, negative emotions, and perceived intentionality. Finally, results showed that discrepancies in perceptions of dominance and disaffiliation between partners negatively influenced their ability to achieve mutual understanding in a conversation about a past hurtful event. This dissertation provides a theoretical contribution to the relational turbulence model by integrating relational communication. Furthermore, it demonstrates the relational inferences that influence hurt, as well as illustrates how relational judgments influence people\u2019s ability to discuss a past hurtful event. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5254], "author_name_tesi": "McLaren, Rachel ", "last_name_ssi": "McLaren", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Denise Haunani Solomon", "James Dillard", "Jon F Nussbaum", "Michael Wenger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Denise Haunani Solomon, Committee Chair", "James Dillard, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member", "Michael Wenger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hurtful messages", "relational turbulence", "hurt", "relational communication"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Reinventing the Wheel: On Games and the Good Life\n", "id": "8879", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3736", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In The Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia, Bernard Suits makes two significant contributions to the field of philosophy.

Using various theoretical approaches, this project seeks to investigate an area so far ill- or untreated by scholars: what is the relationship of film form to the ideas circulated by a given work, whether they be overt or hidden? \n\nTo answer this question, the present study makes a close formal analysis of ten French war films from across the Twentieth century. One significant challenge is to appropriately define the area of study, for the French war film is quite different from its Anglo-American counterpart, and the current study undertakes a gradual redefinition of this sub-genre of the historical film.\n\nWar films are a subject of choice because they react to, or seek to represent, particular moments of crisis for national identity, especially considering France\u2019s troubled experiences during the past hundred years. Thus, one can examine films made under the shadow of war as well as movies made at a historical remove from their subject. This duality of temporal distance and social function allows the current study to employ a dual prism: looking at movies as both documents of social history and as increasingly legitimate historical reconstructions.

These systems are\nincreasingly vulnerable to software-based exploits that have physical\nconsequences. In modern control systems, Programmable Logic\nControllers (PLCs) drive the physical machinery in a plant according\nto control logic programs.  For ease of modification, control logic is\nuploaded to the PLC from the local network, the Internet, or other\nexternal network, making them vulnerable to malicious code\ninjection. PLCs are unique within the control system, in that they\nform the last step of computation between the computer and the\nphysical infrastructures. If they are compromised by an adversary, the\nentire physical system will be under malicious control. If they can be\nregulated by defenders, then adversarial influence over any other part\nof the system is nullified. In short, whoever owns the PLC owns the\ncritical infrastructure.\n\nIn this work, we look at a novel approach to both attacking and\nsecuring automated cyber physical control systems: em\nspecification-based attacks and defenses. The vast body of existing\nwork in computer security focuses on protecting information. In a\ncontrol system, on the other hand, the most critical asset is not\ninformation, but the physical machinery, processes, and personnel,\nwhose safety must be guaranteed. Due to the sheer complexity of modern\ninformation processing systems, it is impossible to completely secure\nthe computer and network perimeters of automated control\nsystems. Thus, instead of trying to harden perimeter security, we\ninstead aim at directly regulating the physical behavior of the\ncontrol system through behavioral specifications.\n\nThis dissertation covers three different systems that demonstrate\nspecification-based attacks and defenses. The attack, called SABOT,\nallows adversaries to attack control systems knowing only their\nphysical behavior. SABOT takes the adversary's idea of how the\nvictim physical system works, and automatically instantiates it into\nrunnable PLC code that executes the desired attack measures. The\nsecond system is a Trusted Safety Verifier (TSV). TSV prevents any\nmalicious code from being uploaded to PLCs. This is done by performing\na novel analysis technique on the PLC code to determine if it violates\nany engineer-supplied safety properties. Finally, we consider a\nController Controller (C2). C2 monitors the commands sent from\nPLCs to physical machinery to block any malicious device usage. C2\nis the most minimal of all these security mechanisms, as even the PLC\ncan be fully compromised, and the security guarantees will still hold.\nThese works are built on early experiences in directed penetration\ntesting of smart electric meters, which found vulnerabilities based on\nthe adversarial goals they achieved.

Pennsylvania produces the second most agricultural pollution of the six states within the Bay Basin.  To combat agricultural pollution, farmers and conservation agencies around the country are turning to best management practices (BMPs).  There are many types of agricultural BMPs, but their effectiveness differs from farm to farm depending on where they are applied, how they are applied, and how they are impacted by weather.\n\tThe goal of this research was to determine the effects of BMP implementation on environmental losses and farm profitability, as applied to typical farms in the Lancaster, Lebanon, and Dauphin County region of Pennsylvania.  Analysis and evaluation of BMPs was conducted by modeling farms and BMPs using the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM).\n\tThree baseline farms were developed to simulate typical farms in this region; a crop farm, an English dairy farm, and a Plain Sect Amish dairy farm.  BMP scenarios applied to the baseline representation of those farms were evaluated based on reduction of sediment and nutrient losses and impact on farm profitability.  The effects of BMPs were different for each farm.  Environmental losses on all farms were reduced by employing strip cropping, nutrient management, reduced tillage, and cover cropping.  Planting and harvesting of a winter cover crop reduced environmental losses over baseline conditions for the English dairy and crop farms, while increasing farm profit.  Profit increased 122% over the baseline condition when the harvested cover crop practice was combined with nutrient management on the crop farm.  Cover cropping without harvest of winter crops was effective at reducing nutrient and sediment losses for the Amish farm, while additional reductions in phosphorus and sediment losses of 71% and 91%, respectively, were observed when cover cropping was combined with no-till planting.  The English dairy baseline had fairly low environmental losses but implementation of improved nutrient management achieved an 8% reduction in nitrogen leaching while increasing profit by 17%.  For all farms, strip cropping provided a substantial decrease in losses of most nutrients and sediment and had a negligible impact on farm profitability. \n\tUsing IFSM to model multiple farm categories, each with multiple BMPs, produced valuable information for regional officials who make BMP recommendations for farms in the focus area.  Comparing profitability and environmental effectiveness of BMPs across multiple farm types exposes relationships between BMP suitability and farm type that should prove valuable to increasing BMP adoption, educating farmers and the public, and improving water quality.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [77], "author_name_tesi": "McLean, Andrew Duart", "last_name_ssi": "McLean", "middle_name_ssi": "Duart", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Michael Hamlett", "Tamie L Veith", "Clarence Alan Rotz", "James Samuel Shortle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Michael Hamlett, Thesis Advisor", "Tamie L Veith, Thesis Advisor", "Clarence Alan Rotz, Thesis Advisor", "James Samuel Shortle, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["BMP", "model", "IFSM", "Amish", "nutrient", "profitability"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Mechanistic Studies into Bacterial Cellulose Synthesis", "id": "14136jbm209", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14136", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cellulose, a polymer of \u03b2-1,4-linked glucose units, is synthesized by plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria. It is the major component of the plant cell wall and, thus, is thought to be the most abundant biological molecule on earth. Cellulose synthase, a membrane-bound glycosyltransferase, synthesizes cellulose through the processive addition of glucose, from UDP-glucose, to the non-reducing end of the cellulose polymer. This enzyme is often found with other proteins in large cellulose synthase complexes.\n\tThe primary focus of the present work is a greater understanding of the mechanisms for initiation, elongation, and termination of the cellulose polymer. Structural studies of cellulose synthase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, called BcsA-BcsB, have revealed much regarding the mechanisms for polymer elongation, however the mechanisms for initiation and termination largely remain a mystery. \nTwo tools were developed for the present work. First was the isolation of a core catalytic subunit of the cellulose synthase complex. The catalytic heterodimer, AcsA-AcsB, was isolated from Gluconacetobacter hansenii by two methods\u2014product entrapment and affinity chromatography\u2014and then subsequently kinetically characterized. Second was the development of a tool for the size analysis of in vitro-synthesized cellulose. Existing methods of cellulose solubilization and separation by gel permeation chromatography were adapted for this tool. \nInitiation of cellulose synthesis can follow either a primer-dependent or a primer-independent mechanism. Using size analysis of in vitro-synthesized cellulose, both AcsA-AcsB and BcsA-BcsB were shown to follow a primer-independent mechanism for initiation. Reducing end analysis of in vitro-synthesized cellulose from both enzymes indicated that glucose is sufficient to initiate synthesis. Finally, BcsA-BcsB demonstrated UDP-glucose hydrolase activity, allowing for the construction of a plausible mechanism for self-priming. Here, cellulose synthase hydrolyzes UDP-glucose and subsequently binds the liberated glucose to initiate new cellulose polymer synthesis. \n\tSize analysis also revealed processivity differences between the two enzymes. To investigate the factors underlying processivity, changes in selected residues in the BcsA transmembrane channel were made. In one variant, the processivity and kinetic rates were altered. \nFinally, size analysis indicated that the active elongation of the polymer by both AcsA-AcsB and BcsA-BcsB is faster than the overall turnover numbers. This suggested that the catalytic cycle minimally consists of a fast and a slow phase. With these data, a minimal kinetic mechanism for cellulose synthesis was constructed.\n\tTo see if the overall turnover number was equally as slow in vivo, quantitative western blotting was employed to calculate the turnover number in whole G. hansenii cells. The turnover number in vivo was much faster than for purified AcsA-AcsB. Three cellulose synthase complex accessory proteins were investigated to test for their involvement in catalysis. Following this, the turnover number for AcsA-AcsB was measured at each step during purification by quantitative western blotting. This analysis showed a decrease in the turnover number immediately after cell lysis, suggesting that association into the cellulose synthase complex, in whole cells, positively impacts the cellulose synthesis rate of AcsA-AcsB.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14594], "author_name_tesi": "McManus, John B", "last_name_ssi": "McManus", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ming Tien", "Hemant P Yennawar", "B Tracy Nixon", "Franklin Lewis Dorman Jr.", "Squire J Booker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ming Tien, Dissertation Advisor", "Hemant P Yennawar, Committee Chair", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Franklin Lewis Dorman Jr., Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cellulose", "acetobacter", "bacteria", "enzymology", "biochemistry", "microbiology"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "AMBIGUITY IN PARENTS\u2019 DIVORCE-RELATED  DISCLOSURES: EFFECTS OF SUPPORT EXPECTATIONS AND STRATEGIC AMBIGUITY \nON PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, RELATIONAL QUALITY, AND COMMUNICATION SATISFACTION\n\n\n\n", "id": "8969", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6172", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent scholarship has suggested that characteristics of parents\u2019 disclosures may offer unique insight into explaining the effects of divorce disclosures. And, while Communication Privacy Management theory posits that the strategy used to reveal private information may influence how the dyad renegotiates their privacy rules and privacy boundaries during periods of change, attention has not been given to specific strategies. Thus, the goals of this dissertation were to develop a context specific, self-report measure of strategic ambiguity, to extend CPM by developing strategic ambiguity as an indirect disclosure strategy, and to shed light on how strategic ambiguity may affect the parent and emerging adult children when discussing divorce-related issues.\n\nTwo studies were undertaken to achieve these three goals. The first study developed a measure of strategic ambiguity. Participants recalled a recent conversation with a parent about a problem at home and answered the 40 proposed items for the scale. Confirmatory factor analysis and reliability analysis were conducted to identify the best set of items to assess strategic ambiguity. The second study required parent-child dyads visit a communication lab to complete a series of questionnaires and discuss two divorce-related topics. Correlation, regression, and repeated measures analysis of variance analyses were conducted to test a series of hypotheses and a research question regarding the role of strategic ambiguity in parents\u2019 divorce-related disclosures.\n\nResults for the two studies indicated that strategic ambiguity could be reliably and validly measured. Additionally, strategic ambiguity consistently predicted emerging adult children\u2019s adjustment outcomes. Tolerance for ambiguity was found to moderate the effects of strategic ambiguity for parents\u2019 relational quality and communication satisfaction. However for offspring, tolerance for ambiguity had direct, rather than moderation, effects on adjustment. Parents\u2019 use and offspring\u2019s perceptions of strategic ambiguity did not differ from one another. Relational quality for parents and children was the most consistent postdivorce adjustment factor predicted by strategic ambiguity. \n\nThe results of Studies 1 and 2 are discussed with respect to how they helped contribute to achieving the methodological, theoretical, and empirical goals of the dissertation. The construction and testing of the strategic ambiguity measure provides a methodological advancement over prior means of examining disclosure. The inclusion of strategic ambiguity offers a useful explanatory tool for examining the effects of private disclosures on relational quality. Finally, strategic ambiguity has been shown to help explain the some of the effects of parent-to-child disclosures, although it did not aid in explaining the discrepant past findings regarding psychological well-being.

Since experts in cyber security exercise very little control over the situations that they encounter, their efforts to counteract the actions taken by their adversaries are reactive and responsive, instead of being proactive and predictive.  Cyber Security by its very nature, and as a result of how it has evolved, has been inherently and detrimentally reactive.  This reactive nature places the experts and professionals working in the domain of cyber security at a distinct disadvantage compared to their adversaries.\nIntelligence and Intelligence Analysis have been used for millennia to gain control over situations.  Gaining control over a situation in this context is equated to gaining a sense of power over the situation by reducing the uncertainty associated with the situation.   Gaining control over the situation utilizing Intelligence has traditionally been accomplished in two ways: 1) intelligence as knowledge and 2) intelligence as a process.\n Intelligence as knowledge is identified as the ability to gain insight, awareness, understanding, comprehension and recognition of the situation through the generation of knowledge about the entities that comprise the situation and the variables and factors that impact or influence the situation.

Vestimentiferan communities are isolated pockets of high biomass in the otherwise nutrient-poor deep-sea.  Chemosynthesis, not photosynthesis, is the underlying energy source for vestimentiferans, which entirely lack a digestive tract and rely on internal sulfide-oxidizing symbionts for fixed carbon.  Symbionts appear to be acquired by the motile vestimentiferan larvae before they settle and become sessile adults.  The ability of both these organisms and their symbionts to disperse across the sometimes considerable distances between sulfidic environments has been a topic of study for over a decade.  This study addresses the question of dispersal by two different methods, with a biogeographical approach of all vestimentiferan species, and through the population genetic analysis of two species within the Gulf of Mexico.  \n\tSpecies distributions can reveal barriers to gene flow, and the range over which an organism maintains a single species reflects the ability of individuals in that species to interbreed between populations.  In the case of the vestimentiferan symbionts, which do not interbreed, symbiont strain distribution reflects the presence of a particular bacterial strain near the vestimentiferan larvae before symbiont acquisition.  Vestimentiferan biogeography reveals that many species have very large species ranges, indicating the exchange of at least one migrant per generation between sites as distant as 6000km.  However, different vestimentiferan species are found between sites that are geographically close but that are at very different depths, suggesting depth may be a barrier to either dispersal or survival of larvae between sites.  The same vestimentiferan symbiont strains are found worldwide, with different host species in sites as distant as the Florida Escarpment and the coast of Oregon containing the same symbiont.  However, as with the vestimentiferan hosts, evidence suggests that depth may affect the presence of symbiont strains.  Symbiont strains may in fact be ubiquitously distributed throughout the world\u2019s oceans but only within a certain depth range, and the particular strain a vestimentiferan host contains may depend predominantly on the depth at which that host lives.\n\tBiogeography serves to define species limits, but does not directly measure gene flow within a species.  Microsatellite markers were developed for use in a population genetics study of Lamellibrachia luymesi and Seepiophila jonesi of the Louisiana Slope of the Gulf of Mexico.  Microsatellite markers are regions of repetitive DNA that tend to be highly polymorphic within a species.  Five polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated from L. luymesi and seven from S. jonesi; these loci had between 7 and 50 alleles.  Samples were collected from aggregations of tubeworms from nine hydrocarbon seep sites from the Louisiana Slope, and screened with the microsatellite loci to reveal departures from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium.  No obvious population structure was found between aggregations within a sample site in either species.  L. luymesi showed some evidence for isolation by distance across the 480km from which it was sampled, but S. jonesi showed no evidence for isolation by distance over 580km.  Both L. luymesi and S. jonesi, however, showed a generalized excess of homozygous individuals which did not reflect underlying population substructure.  These data suggest that both species have high geneflow between aggregations and sample sites, but that L. luymesi dispersal is somewhat more limited than S. jonesi.  The generalized homozygote excess observed reflects a departure from HWE the cause of which is not clearly identified in this study. Cohorts may exist within an aggregation that were not revealed with this sampling plan, leading to mating between related individuals.  A second hypothesis to explain the observed homozygote excess may be strong selection against heterozygous larvae, as is suggested in some marine bivalves. \n\tUnlike most of the deep sea, vestimentiferan communities are characterized by very high biomass.  These communities, however, depend on resources that are patchily distributed across the globe.  Biogeographic data suggest that both vent and seep vestimentiferans have strong dispersal capabilities, and the population genetic analyses presented here support the same conclusion.  However, vestimentiferan dispersal is affected by at least one physical barrier, depth, and may also be affected by water currents.  The polymorphic markers isolated in this study are a tool that can be used to address the presence of physical barriers between vestimentiferan communities, and can also be used to reveal non random mating within a species, as in the Gulf of Mexico study. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1832], "author_name_tesi": "McMullin, Erin ", "last_name_ssi": "McMullin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Erin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Andrew Clark", "Lee Kump", "Kimberlyn Nelson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Chair", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Chair", "Andrew Clark, Committee Member", "Lee Kump, Committee Member", "Kimberlyn Nelson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vestimentiferan", "tube worm", "phylogenetics", "symbiont", "dispersal", "estimated gene flow", "microsatellites", "COI", "16S"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "SYSTEMATICS AND PLASTID GENOME EVOLUTION\nIN THE PARASITIC PLANT GENUS CUSCUTA (DODDER)", "id": "6560", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2977", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-01-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parasitism has evolved independently many times within the course of\nangiosperm evolution.

The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) consists of both teacher- and child-completed measures of academic functioning. Although scores from similar measures effectively predict subsequent academic achievement, the ECLS-K measures have not been examined for their predictive or incremental validity. This research is necessary as teachers are identifying those students who require early intervention. The structure of the Academic Rating Scale (ARS) was identified through exploratory factor analyses, with separate analyses conducted for the kindergarten and third-grade measures. Analyses indicated that both the kindergarten and third-grade ARS were represented by a three-factor structure. Because of high correlations between factors and high internal consistency reliability coefficients for scores from all factors, post hoc confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. Results indicated the three-factor structure resulted in the best fit. The structures obtained for both ARS measures were different from that proposed by the ECLS-K researchers in the number of items that assess each construct. Hierarchical regression determined the degree to which teacher ratings on the ARS incrementally added to the prediction of achievement beyond the contribution of child-completed and demographic information. Consistent with the results of previous research, results indicated that both demographic and direct child assessment data accounted for substantial variance in the prediction of academic outcomes. Results also indicated that the kindergarten and third-grade ARS scores did not contribute an appreciable amount of variance beyond the contribution of other information. In contrast, the direct child data accounted for meaningful amounts of variance beyond the ARS scores. These findings raise questions as to the benefit of collecting the ECLS-K teacher judgment information if the goal of the investigation is to predict future academic performance.

The purposeful sample included six full-time and one adjunct faculty, teaching a mix of undergraduate and graduate courses in education, engineering, and public affairs. All had a desire to move toward online teaching by preparing a course for hybrid delivery during the fall semester of 2009. \n\nThis study used a qualitative action research methodology. The purpose of this study was to explore how faculty learn to teach online and how that may influence their face-to-face teaching. The research questions were: \n   1. Which aspects of the professional development activities do faculty perceive as being most effective in helping them to reflect on and question their previously held assumptions and beliefs about teaching? \n   2. Do faculty experience changes in their previously held assumptions and beliefs about teaching as a result of learning to teach online and, if so, how does transformative learning explain the changes? \n   3. What impact does learning to teach online have on face-to-face teaching practices? \nThese questions required a research paradigm and methodology that tried to understand faculty as unique individuals with a variety of assumptions, beliefs, and lived experiences that have informed how they teach. Action research consists of a cyclical process of planning, acting and observing, reflecting. \n\nThe first phase of planning, which involves problem identification, was completed through a literature review, my own previous research, and dialogue with faculty who considered changes to their face-to-face teaching after teaching online. The second step of the planning phase defined the details of the action research project including intervention strategies, when and how to begin, and how to involve the participants. These details were determined through a review of multiple faculty professional development programs to teach online, by incorporating the essential attributes needed in a faculty professional development program that is framed within adult education, and by integrating intervention strategies that could facilitate transformative learning. These strategies included individual pre- and post-interviews, journal writing and classroom observations. \n\nThe major portion of this project was implemented in 2009 during a six-week summer session and concluded close to the end of the fall semester. The project began with a planning phase that included individual interviews in which the faculty shared their needs, concerns, and personal goals for the program. They were given readings related to online teaching, and access to an online reflection journal and encouraged to complete the readings and post their first journal entry prior to our first face-to-face group meeting. Decisions were made regarding evaluation measures, length of study, and how the action and change would be observed and documented. Faculty were given periodic writing prompts for their personal reflection journals that allowed them to share their learning and ask questions throughout the program. \n\nDuring the acting and observing phase, the action was implemented and data was collected. The pre-interviews, which were recorded and transcribed, lasted between thirty and sixty minutes. The questions were meant to bring awareness to the assumptions and beliefs upon which their teaching practices are based. Post-interviews were conducted at the conclusion of the faculty professional development program to document changes in their assumptions and beliefs from the pre-interviews. \n\nIn the third phase of this action research study, each data collection and evaluation period provided an opportunity to determine whether faculty had an opportunity to reflect on their previously held assumptions and beliefs about teaching. If little or no reflection occurred, a new cycle of action research with a different activity or approach was planned. Alternately, when reflection did occur, then repeating the activity was considered in the next cycle of research. Three cycles of action research were completed so new action could lead to new reflection, which led to more action, and so on. Each cycle provided more learning about the problem and interventions. \n\nLearning to teach online has the potential to transform faculty's assumptions and beliefs about teaching, changing their face-to-face teaching practices. Transformative learning explained changes in previously held assumptions and beliefs about teaching as a result of learning to teach online. This was most clearly evident in the difference between faculty's expectations of teaching online and what actually happened when they taught online. Learning was better than they expected. Learning to teach online impacted face-to-face teaching practices. Beth was able to be more open and flexible, tailoring classroom time based on students\u2019 online discussion. Ralph used to believe that if students were not in class they could not learn, but there was more soft learning online than in the classroom. Kay stepped away from PowerPoint and replaced it with classroom discussion that was more student-driven based on their online discussions. \n\nThe final results from the professional development program to prepare faculty to teach online are shared, including the effectiveness of the various approaches employed, the changes in faculty's assumptions and beliefs about teaching, and the impact on their face-to-face teaching practices. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [913], "author_name_tesi": "McQuiggan, Carol ", "last_name_ssi": "McQuiggan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Carol", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Denise Gaspari Meister", "William John Mahar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Angelica Cranton, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Member", "Denise Gaspari Meister, Committee Member", "William John Mahar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transformative learning", "faculty development", "teaching online"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Elucidation of the developmental and physiological roles of NAD+ biosynthetic pathways ", "id": "14186mrm45", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14186", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "NAD+ biosynthesis has proven to be an attractive and promising therapeutic target for influencing healthspan and obesity-related phenotypes as well as tumor growth.  However, NAD+ is a key metabolite that impacts the entire metabolome. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate exactly how manipulating NAD+ biosynthetic pathways can lead to therapeutic benefits. Also, it is imperative to characterize the unexpected adverse reactions to manipulating the biosynthetic pathways to fully utilize this target for drug discovery.  The goal of our research is to understand how NAD+ homeostasis is maintained to support its core metabolic roles and its signaling and regulatory roles involving NAD+ consumers. In this work, I investigate the developmental and physiological role of NAD+ biosynthetic pathways in C. elegans, their homeostatic interactions, and I reveal a biosynthetic pathway involving an enzyme outside of NAD+ biosynthesis.\nNAD+ is synthesized via distinct routes including de novo synthesis from tryptophan, salvage synthesis from nicotinamide, which feeds into the Preiss-Handler pathway from nicotinic acid in C. elegans, and via the phosphorylation of nicotinamide ribosides or nicotinic acid ribosides using nicotinamide riboside kinase (NMRK). We previously discovered that NAD+ salvage synthesis through the nicotinamidase PNC-1 is required for normal progression of gonad development in C. elegans. Global metabolic profiling suggested that glycolysis was perturbed in our pnc-1 mutants, which have lower global levels of NAD+.  Furthermore, we were able to link compromised glycolysis to gonad delay in our loss of salvage NAD+ synthesis mutants. I investigated this model and demonstrated using metabolic carbon tracing that glycolysis is compromised in our pnc-1 mutants. \nIt\u2019s been reported in the literature that C. elegans lack the de novo NAD+ biosynthetic pathway because quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRTase) is not encoded in the genome.  However, all genes coding for the key enzymes required for production of quinolinic acid (QA) from tryptophan are present in the C. elegans genome. Using metabolic deuterium tracing I revealed that de novo NAD+ synthesis from tryptophan is active. I also demonstrated that UMPS-1 as the enzyme responsible required for converting QA into NAD+ during de novo biosynthesis. In addition to this, I discovered a novel role for NMRK-mediated synthesis in embryonic hatching in C. elegans. Finally, I uncovered a compensatory network amongst the biosynthetic pathways that maintains NAD+ homeostasis. \nIn summary, this work has expanded our knowledge of the developmental and physiological roles of NAD+ biosynthetic pathways. Metabolic carbon tracing was implemented as a tool to examine metabolic flux in C. elegans. Also, this work suggests that an underground metabolic mechanism may contribute to NAD+ biosynthesis. The conserved enzyme UMPS-1 is substituting for the missing QPRTase, raising questions about the relevance of similar underground metabolic activity in higher organisms. This work associates a novel C. elegans\u2019 hatching phenotype to NAD+ biosynthesis. Finally, this work deciphers the impact of manipulating NAD+ biosynthesis for therapeutics. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14599], "author_name_tesi": "McReynolds, Melanie Renee", "last_name_ssi": "McReynolds", "middle_name_ssi": "Renee", "first_name_ssi": "Melanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna-Rose", "Wendy Hanna-Rose", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Teh-Hui Kao", "Andrew David Patterson", "Lorraine C Santy", "Pamela Hankey Giblin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna-Rose, Dissertation Advisor", "Wendy Hanna-Rose, Committee Chair", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Member", "Teh-Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Andrew David Patterson, Outside Member", "Lorraine C Santy, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NAD+ biosynthesis", "NAD+metabolism", "C. elegans", "Metabolic flux", "Metabolomics", "Carbon tracing", "Deuterium tracing", "Salvage NAD+ synthesis", "de novo synthesis from Trp", "NMRK-mediated synthesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Five-dimensional Yang-Mills-Einstein Supergravity on Orbifold Spacetimes: From Phenomenology to M-theory\n", "id": "6065", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5796", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Five-dimensional N=2 Yang-Mills-Einstein supergravity and its couplings to hyper and tensor multiplets are considered on an orbifold spacetime of the form M_{4} X S^{1}/Gamma, where Gamma is the discrete group Z_{2} or Z_{2}XZ_{2}.  As is well known in such cases, supersymmetry is broken to N=1 on the orbifold fixed planes, and chiral 4D theories can be obtained from bulk hypermultiplets (or from the coupling of fixed-plane supported fields).  Five-dimensional gauge symmetries are broken by boundary conditions for the fields, which are equivalent to some set of Gamma-parity assignments in the orbifold theory, allowing for arbitrary rank reduction.  Furthermore, Wilson lines looping from one boundary to the other can break bulk gauge groups, or give rise to vacuum expectation values for scalars on the boundaries, which can result in spontaneous breaking of boundary gauge groups.  The broken gauge symmetries do not survive as global symmetries of the low energy theories below the compactification scale due to 4D minimal couplings to gauge fields.  Axionic fields are a generic feature, just as in any compactification of M-theory (or string theory for that matter), and we exhibit the form of this field and its role as the QCD axion, capable of resolving the strong-CP problem.  The main motivation for the orbifold theories here is taken to be orbifold-GUTs, wherein a unified gauge group is sought in higher dimensions while allowing the orbifold reduction to handle problems such as rapid proton decay, exotic matter, mass hierarchies, etc.  To that end, we discuss the allowable minimal SU(5), SO(10) and E_{6} GUT theories with all fields living in five dimensions.  It is argued that, within the class of homogeneous quaternionic scalar manifolds characterizing the hypermultiplet couplings in 5D, supergravity admits a restricted set of theories that yield minimal phenomenological field content.  In addition, non-compact gaugings are a novel feature of supergravity theories, and in particular we consider the example of an SU(5,1) YMESGT in which all of the fields of the theory are connected by local (susy and gauge) transformations that are symmetries of the Lagrangian.  Such non-compact gaugings allow a novel type of gauge-Higgs unification in higher dimensions.  The possibility of boundary-localized fields is considered only via anomaly arguments.  In particular, the theories with a 5D Chern-Simons form in the Lagrangian will give rise to anomaly inflow classically (which is compensated globally in the S^{1}/Z_{2} case).  However, compensation locally requires the quantum theory to have a chiral anomaly on the boundary, which can arise if there is an appropriate bulk fermionic field content, or otherwise by the addition of appropriate boundary-supported fermionic fields with minimal coupling to the gauge fields propagating there.  Some comments are made regarding the phenomenological features of the models, such as the Yukawa couplings and scalar potentials, which depend on the size of the fifth dimension as well as the scalar vacuum.  Finally, we sketch the possible M-theoretic origins of these theories, which is left for future work.  In particular, the supergravity orbifold theories generally correspond to phases of M-theory distinct from the strongly coupled heterotic string, which has served as the primary phenomenological framework in the past.  Throughout, we try to compare and contrast with the phenomenological model building of rigid susy orbifold-GUTs as well as the string/M-theoretic approaches that have dominated the literature for the past decade.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5792], "author_name_tesi": "McReynolds, Sean ", "last_name_ssi": "McReynolds", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Wallace Robinett", "Luen Chau Li", "Stephane Coutu", "Murat Gunaydin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Wallace Robinett, Committee Member", "Luen Chau Li, Committee Member", "Stephane Coutu, Committee Member", "Murat Gunaydin, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["orbifold field theories", "supergravity", "GUTs"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF A MODELING CAPABILITY FOR ENERGY HARVESTING MODULES IN ELECTRODYNAMIC TETHER SYSTEMS\n\n\n\n", "id": "12063", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2757", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Electrodynamic tethers can be used to harvest energy onboard a spacecraft orbiting the Earth or any planetary body with a magnetic &#64257;eld and surrounding plasma.

Fan powered VAV boxes tend to diminish the buffering effect of the plenum because they may inject highly contaminated return air into occupied space.  Results from parametric multizone model simulations seem to support the observation from laboratory experiments that the plenum functions as a buffer zone that can delay and flatten the peak concentration in occupied space following a release held true in these simulations.  Exposure results indicate that plenum return systems have the potential to significantly reduce short term occupant exposure to contaminants released in occupied spaces.\n\tTo test the applicability of mutlizone model simulation for determining inter-zonal contamination vulnerability of each return air strategy, CO2 tracer gas test results were compared to multizone model simulation results.  Assumptions inherent in multizone modeling, most notably well mixed zones with uniform contaminant concentrations, restrict multizone modeling's applicability in determining inter-zonal contamination vulnerability of return air strategy.  Since the model assumes a well mixed plenum, simulating the transport of contaminants from the plenum to conditioned spaces by parallel fan powered boxes was not possible.  Although there were instances in which multizone modeling accurately simulated inter-zonal contaminant concentration with release zone mixing, simulations were not consistent for different release zone locations and return air strategies.   \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1483], "author_name_tesi": "McWhirter, Dylan Montgomery", "last_name_ssi": "McWhirter", "middle_name_ssi": "Montgomery", "first_name_ssi": "Dylan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William P Bahnfleth", "William P Bahnfleth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William P Bahnfleth, Thesis Advisor", "William P Bahnfleth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CONTAM", "building security", "Iowa Energy Center Energy Resource Station", "multizone model", "fan powered box", "plenum return", "ducted return", "tracer gas test", "Indoor air quality", "interzonal contaminant transfer", "occupant exposure", "energy model", "duct leakage", "contaminant dispersion resistance"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "METABOLIC ENGINEERING OF THE ARCHAEON Methanosarcina acetivorans FOR PRODUCTS FROM METHANE", "id": "13599mum278", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "13599", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Metabolic engineering involves the manipulation of microbial metabolism through genetic engineering and has applications in industry for producing valuable products. While metabolic engineering can entail the insertion of an entirely novel heterologous pathway, processes can be simplified by mainly relying on the host\u2019s natural metabolism, where applicable. In this work, we utilize metabolic engineering involving one or two added reaction steps for converting methane to the value-added products acetate, lactate, and electricity, and for secreting flavins as an economical solution for producing phosphorylated flavins. To create the first organism that grows anaerobically on methane as a pure culture, we engineered the methanogen (archaeon that produces methane) Methanosarcina acetivorans to produce methyl-coenzyme M reductase (Mcr) from the metagenome of a consortium in the Black Sea; Mcr catalyzes the first step in anaerobic methane consumption or the last step in methanogenesis. The host\u2019s entire methanogenic metabolic pathway was thus reversed to allow for growth on methane as the main carbon source and production of acetate as a by-product. The methane-consuming strain was engineered further to produce the stereospecific product L-lactate from methane by having the strain produce 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Hbd) from Clostridium acetobutylicum. Production of Mcr from the Black Sea consortium was also used to generate electricity from methane for the first time by designing a consortium that includes the exoelectrogen (microbe naturally capable of generating an electrical charge) Geobacter sulfurreducens and methane acclimated sludge isolated from a secondary anaerobic digester. The flavin transporter YeeO from Escherichia coli for use as a transporter of phosphorylated flavins was also characterized.

The study applies two lenses of analysis, a narrative analysis following Clandinin and Connelly (2000), and a constant-comparative analysis, and presents the data in those two distinct lenses. \n\tThis study examines the narratives of nine male actors in early adulthood through middle age, and of diverse ethnic backgrounds.  Framed in D'Augelli's (1994) lifespan developmental model of sexual identity, the data in this study illustrate several relevant themes that emerge in the narrative analysis.  First, participants reported that theatre can be a safe space for sexual identity exploration in its openness and the propensity for actors to be more emotionally astute.  Participants described theatre as a site for understanding relationships within several contexts:  mentoring, family, romance, and a community of support.  For many participants, theatre was a site of embodied learning, through the use of the voice and movement, as well as the performance of gender.  Finally, participants framed acting as a politic, and described ways in which they've come to understand power and positionality through their art, and how they have reacted to that understanding through both mainstream and activist theatre.\n\tThe analysis and discussion of the data bridges the gap in empirical literature between adult development and the experience of acting by framing acting within several relevant adult education concepts: acting as a community of practice, acting as an embodied experience, acting as a site of sociopolitical action, and acting as a safe space for identity exploration and development.  Each theme is presented in parallel with D'Augelli's model to illustrate the connection between the adult education themes and the processes within the model.  The data confirm the theoretical model and support its relevance in a contemporary zeitgeist, while challenging some shortcomings in the model:  the linear, unidirectional concept of sexual identity, and the absence of a practical illustration of the role of cultural intersectionality on sexual identity development.\t\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10520], "author_name_tesi": "Mccadden, Theodore Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Mccadden", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Theodore", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robin Redmon Wright", "Edward W Taylor", "Holly L Angelique", "Adam Ross Gustafson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robin Redmon Wright, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward W Taylor, Committee Member", "Holly L Angelique, Committee Member", "Adam Ross Gustafson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adult education", "theatre", "acting", "embodied learning", "performance of gender", "adult development", "LGBT development", "queer theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ESTABLISHING THE GENDER GAP IN ILLEGAL DRUG SALES AND DRUG SALE EARNINGS: A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT USING THE NATIONAL  INCIDENT-BASED REPORTING SYSTEM (NIBRS)", "id": "13084djm524", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13084", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The central aim of this thesis was to clarify the gender gap in illegal drug sales and drug sale earnings using a unique and underutilized dataset (National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS).  The motivation for this study stems from a debate among scholars regarding the extent of female involvement in drug selling and the gender gap in drug sale earnings.  One view is that gender differences in participation and earnings are somewhat small. This view emerged shortly after the introduction of crack-cocaine to North American drug markets in the mid-1980s, and differs from the one traditionally held by drug crime scholars.   The traditional (and alternative) view is that the gender gap in drug sale participation and earnings has been and continues to remain large, and that drug markets remain heavily dominated by males.  Despite considerable interest in this topic, important gaps the literature remain and the debate has yet to be resolved.  \nIn this thesis, I aimed to go beyond prior literature to establish a more complete picture of a) the gender gap in drug sales (overall and by drug type); b) the gender gap in illegal earnings from drug sales (overall and by drug type); and c) the gendered organization of drug sales (e.g., solo or co-offense, same-sex or mixed-sex).  Steffensmeier\u2019s (1983) institutionalized sexism framework, which posits that several interrelated forces (i.e., sex-typing, homosocial reproduction, and task environment of crime) exist to both exclude and marginalize women in profit-oriented crime groups, served as the theoretical justification for this thesis.  \nData were derived from NIBRS incident-level extract files for the years 2010-2012, and were downloaded from the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR).  The final study population totaled 56,267 incidents involving drug selling arrests.  \nKey findings from both bivariate analyses and multivariate OLS regression models provided support for Steffensmeier\u2019s (1983) framework, as well as the traditional view regarding women\u2019s involvement in the drug economy.  First, I found a large gender gap in drug sale participation (overall and by drug type).  Second, I found the size of the gender gap to vary by type of drug (i.e., marijuana, cocaine, crack, and heroin).  Notably, gender differences were smaller for crack and heroin than marijuana and cocaine.  Third, there is a large gender gap in illegal earnings from drug sales in both solo and co-offending incidents.  Fourth, mixed-gender co-offending groups are found to earn more than all-male groups, net of key demographic and structural controls.  \nImplications of this thesis are several.  First, findings contribute to four important strands of criminological research, namely: a) gender and crime literature; b) the literature on gender and drug crime; c) institutionalized sexism literature; and d) the growing body of literature on illegal earnings.  Second, this study offers researchers and policymakers a fresh, quantitative view into the social organization of illicit drug markets.  Third, it provides a strong foundation for scholars interested in investigating race and race by gender differences (e.g., white vs. black) in drug selling and drug sale earnings, and how these vary by drug type and type of organization.  Fourth, this study has helped establish NIBRS as an important dataset for a) scholars and policymakers interested in drug related issues; and b) scholars interested in exploring how institutionalized sexism varies across type of crime activity.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13180], "author_name_tesi": "Mccarthy, Daniel Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Mccarthy", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Criminology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier", "Jeremy Staff", "Holly Nguyen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier, Thesis Advisor", "Jeremy Staff, Committee Member", "Holly Nguyen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gender", "Gender Gap", "Drugs", "Drug Sales", "Drug Distribution", "Illegal Drugs"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Metabolic Potential and Diversity of the Microbial Communities in a Sulfidic Cave System", "id": "27206", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10724", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tProbing of deep-sea sediments and terrestrial soils has made our lack of knowledge of microbial diversity, metabolism, and structure more evident. In order to further explore these microbial communities, we must investigate subsurface environments. Easily accessible and isolated from surface environments, caves host energy-limited (i.e. no light, anoxic, low organic carbon concentration) ecosystems and microbial communities that may provide insight to subsurface microbial communities. Cave microbial communities may be similar to microbes that would have thrived on Earth, prior to the rise in atmospheric oxygen. My dissertation addresses the taxonomic composition of novel cave microbial communities in Frasassi and the metabolic potential of cave microbes based on metagenomics and the geochemistry of their environment. Additional work completed at Magical Blue Hole, which is a low-light karst environment, is included in Appendix A. \n\tIn Chapter 2, I discuss the taxonomic community composition of rope-like microbial communities from anoxic cave waters and the geochemistry of their environment. The population structure of microbial communities of unusual rope-like biofilms discovered in the stratified cave lakes of a sulfidic cave system were investigated using genetic markers. Additionally, bulk geochemistry for the cave lakes was measured and thermodynamic conditions affecting the energy availability of the biofilms was explored. Despite the aphotic, anoxic environment, the rope-like biofilms are diverse with high species richness dominated by Bacteria. The dominant species are Deltaproteobacteria, likely acting as sulfate-reducers, and Chloroflexi, which may be organotrophs. Geochemical analyses of bulk water revealed low levels of organic carbon and no detectable nitrate, suggesting sulfate to be the best available electron acceptor. Low levels of methane and hydrogen suggest these may be used as electron donors. The lack of abundant sources of organic carbon suggests these unique rope-like biofilms are dependent on chemolithoautotrophy. A comparison of the Bacterial community to Census of Deep Life (CoDL) amplicons from other sites, suggest these rope-like biofilms are unique as they create a separate group with the closest communities from the Guaymas basin methane seeps and sediment from the coastal regions of the Frisian Island Sylt. Their unique morphology and distinct community composition suggests these biofilms comprise a new type of subsurface microbial population.\n\tIn Chapter 3, I describe the metabolic potential of one of the rope-like microbial communities (Lago Infinito) from Chapter 2 in detail using annotated bulk and binned metagenomic data. Most microbial populations are limited by the energy available in their surrounding ecosystem and can overcome environmental challenges, such as high salinity or low pH, with abundant energy supply. This would suggest that microbial populations would not survive in low energy environments, however, many such sites exist, such as Lago Infinito. Lago Infinito is a cave lake isolated from surface organic carbon, light, and oxygen in its bottom waters. A rope-like biofilm persists in this environment despite a lack of abundant energy and organic carbon sources. Geochemistry of the surrounding waters suggests very few lithotrophic thermodynamically favorable reactions for this microbial population to thrive on. The lack of organic carbon creates an environment that must rely on primary productivity and carbon fixation, but without an abundant energy source this is unlikely. A survey of carbon fixation genes in the Lago Infinito metagenome reveals an abundance of several autotrophic pathways and is consistent with isotopic data. The Lago Infinito rope-like biofilm is capable of carbon fixation utilizing the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and/or Calvin Cycle and is using lithotrophic energy metabolisms to drive primary productivity. The Lago Infinito biofilm is an extremely diverse microbial community comprised of autotrophic sulfate-reducing microbes and other metabolically-diverse microorganisms.\n\tIn Chapter 4, I explore the metabolic potential of Frasassi Beggiatoa spp. based on binned metagenomic sequences. Both marine and freshwater species of Beggiatoa oxidize reduced sulfur species using oxygen, yet the exact pathways for sulfur oxidation are unclear. Marine Beggiatoa spp. have also demonstrated the utilization of nitrate instead of oxygen, but the ability for freshwater Beggiatoa spp. to use nitrate as an electron acceptor is ambiguous. Previous studies of enzyme assays and genomics suggest a variety of enzymes may a play a role, including reverse-type dissimilatory sulfite reductase (rDSR) and heterodisulfide reductase (HDR). We analyzed four metagenomes and found eleven Beggiatoa-like binned genomes from three sample locations in the sulfidic, freshwater environment of the Frasassi caves. The presence of both periplasmic-type (NAP) and membrane-bound (NAR) nitrate reductase and other nitrogen reductase genes were ubiquitous throughout the binned genomes. Genes encoding rDSR and oxidases were also found in several binned genomes. Our analysis suggests the freshwater Beggiatoa spp. of the Frasassi caves are capable of nitrate reduction for energy conservation and supports other studies in which freshwater Beggiatoa strains utilized nitrate. Additionally, we found genes encoding RuBisCO, suggesting these freshwater Beggiatoa spp. are also capable of carbon fixation via the Calvin cycle, making them more similar to most marine Beggiatoa spp.\n\tIn Appendix A, the variety of microbial populations from Magical Blue Hole, a karst sink hole filled will a mixture of freshwater and seawater rich in sulfide, are photographed and described. Most important of note is that despite light availability below detection limits, the photosynthetic clade of Prosthecochloris is a dominant feature in the biofilm at 33 meters (104 feet).\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10354], "author_name_tesi": "Mccauley Rench, Rebecca Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Mccauley Rench", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Macalady", "Jennifer Macalady", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Christopher Howard House", "Lee Kump"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Macalady, Dissertation Advisor", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Chair", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Chair", "Lee Kump, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Frasassi cave system", "Astrobiology", "Geomicrobiology", "Beggiatoa", "rope-like biofilms"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "AN EXAMINATION OF THE CULTURAL VALIDITY OF THE COUNSELING CENTER ASSESSMENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS-62", "id": "13484jmm909", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13484", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study investigated the cultural validity of the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms-62 (CCAPS-62).

As in many ecosystems, belowground ecology in temperate forests is poorly understood and quantification of many biogeochemical fluxes belowground may be weakly constrained. Fine roots control plant uptake of soil resources such as water and nutrients as well as a major flux of carbon from plants into soil through production and turnover. However, basic patterns of fine root dynamics across species remain elusive and model incorporation of these processes may be inadequate. We address these limitations through both field observations and modeling activities. In Chapter 2 we identified relationships between fine root lifespan with plant growth rate, stem wood density, root diameter, and root nitrogen to carbon ratios across 12 temperate species grown in a common garden in central Pennsylvania, USA. We then further explored the relationships between timing and interannual variation in the amount of root production with different measures of fine root turnover in Chapter 3. Here, results indicated that despite relatively little attention previously given to patterns of root phenology and production, both may have strong effects on root turnover rates in temperate forests and potentially across most perennial plant ecosystems. We then conducted a sensitivity test of four different models of terrestrial biogeochemistry to adjustments in fine root turnover rates and discovered that reasonable adjustments of root turnover rate resulted in substantial changes in total systems carbon (i.e. all live and dead plant carbon plus all soil carbon) that were greater than 30% in some cases (Chapter 4). Finally, given the uncertainty in model parameterizations of fine\nroot dynamics, in Chapter 5 we developed a method to describe fine root lifespan and turnover at broad spatial scales using known distributions of temperate tree species combined with species-specific estimates of root dynamics estimated using direct observations and patterns discovered in Chapters 2 and 3. Future efforts should expand to better appreciate how climate and edaphic factors drive variation in fine root dynamics within species and broadly across sites.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8052], "author_name_tesi": "Mccormack, Michael Luke", "last_name_ssi": "Mccormack", "middle_name_ssi": "Luke", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Eissenstat", "David Eissenstat", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Roger Tai Koide", "Kenneth James Davis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Eissenstat, Dissertation Advisor", "David Eissenstat, Committee Chair", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Member", "Roger Tai Koide, Committee Member", "Kenneth James Davis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["root turnover lifespan", "minirhizotron", "ecosystem model", "functional traits", "scaling", "carbon cycle", "DISTRIB", "MC1", "CENTURY", "ED2"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Factors affecting the physiological consequences of stress in eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus)", "id": "28647", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12309", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the consequences of stress is integral to predicting how organisms will respond to global environmental change. The stress response is generally adaptive, promoting physiological changes that allow an organism to deal with and recover from a threat. However, the stress response can lead to negative fitness outcomes because it diverts energy away from growth, reproduction, and immune function. My dissertation broadly investigates how traits of a stressor and of an organism affect the physiological outcomes of stress. To do so, I utilized populations of eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) that co-evolved with different levels of stress associated with presence of invasive predatory fire ants (Solenopsis invicta). \nStress is typically characterized by duration, with short-duration (\u201cacute\u201d) stress assumed to be neutral or beneficial and long-duration (\u201cchronic\u201d) stress assumed to have negative outcomes. However, the outcomes of stressors that result from repeated short-duration stress (e.g. frequent predator attacks) are not well understood. I first investigated the immune outcomes of these \u201crepeated acute\u201d stressors. Lizards from both high-and low-stress populations enhanced immune function following exposure to repeated acute elevations of exogenous corticosterone (CORT). This demonstrates that repeated acute stressors produce immune outcomes more typical of those expected from short-duration stress (i.e. immune enhancement). I then investigated the role of stressor duration, frequency, and intensity in determining the immune outcomes of stress. My results reveal that stressor intensity is a major driver of immune outcomes of stress in this system and suggest that the current duration-centric terminology is not adequate. Finally, I explored how exposure to stress within a lifetime and across generations affects stress physiology and immune function by raising offspring of lizards from high- and low-stress sites under high and low-stress conditions in the lab and measuring physiological outcomes in adulthood. Early life stress did not affect adult stress physiology, but offspring of lizards from high-stress sites had more robust stress responses than those from uninvaded sites. This suggests that, in this system, stress experienced by an individual\u2019s ancestors may be more important in shaping adult stress physiology than stress that an individual faces within its lifetime. By contrast, within- and across-generational factors interacted to affect adult immune function; CORT-elevation during early life suppressed adult immune function in lizards from low-stress sites but enhanced immune function in lizards from high-stress sites. Together, these results further our understanding of how traits of a stressor and those of an organism influence physiological outcomes of stress. This insight allows us to better predict how organisms will be affected by stress, including that imposed as a result of global change, and to better allocate resources to manage and mitigate these fitness-relevant effects.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11687], "author_name_tesi": "Mccormick, Gail L", "last_name_ssi": "Mccormick", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Gail", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read", "Katriona Shea", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tracy Lee Langkilde, Dissertation Advisor", "Tracy Lee Langkilde, Committee Chair", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read, Committee Member", "Katriona Shea, Committee Member", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["corticosterone", "cross-generational stress", "early life stress", "Escherichia coli", "evolutionary history", "fire ant", "hemagglutination"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Examining the Boundary Conditions of Acknowledging Contextualized Emotion With Women in STEM Interviews ", "id": "28781", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12366", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Displays of emotion in response to emotion-evoking events are often interpreted as evidence of people\u2019s stable dispositions.

The World Health Organization and American Pediatrics Association recommend 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding in order to confer optimal health benefits to both the mother and nursing infant. Exclusive breastfeeding provides numerous benefits for the developing infant including increased growth, optimal immune function, and improved cognitive function compared to infants who don\u2019t breastfeed. Additionally, exclusive breastfeeding is correlated with decreased rates of chronic disease later in life such as adverse cardiovascular health outcomes, diabetes, and decreased rates of obesity. \nThe mammary gland must develop and lactate, therefore understanding how the mammary gland transitions to a secreting phenotype is important. In order for the mammary gland to provide milk of optimal quality and quantity for the nursing infant, it must first undergo sufficient growth and development during several stages of growth throughout the lifetime. Pubertal growth includes the expansion of fundamental ductal structures that invade the mammary fat pad, creating a simple tree-like structure containing alveolar buds at the distal ends, which remain dormant until pregnancy. Further development during pregnancy involves continued secondary and tertiary branching of the ductal tree, and development of alveolar buds into differentiated, lobular structures capable of milk synthesis and secretion. Therefore, understanding how the mammary gland develops into a structure capable of optimal milk production is critical for the health of the nursing infant. \nNumerous factors serve a comprehensive role in regulating mammary gland development and function. One such factor is Zn, which has been shown to regulate mammary gland development and function from a cellular, physiological, and dietary perspective. Zn is required for numerous mammary gland proteins that are critical to mammary gland function and milk synthesis such as the lactose enzyme complex, which is responsible for the synthesis of lactose, the most abundant carbohydrate in milk. Additionally, marginal Zn deficiency has been shown to induce numerous adverse effects on mammary gland biology and milk synthesis including increased levels of apoptosis, decreased milk volume secretion, decreased milk Zn concentration, and decreased abundance of major milk proteins including caseins and whey acidic protein. \nThe Zn transporter, ZnT4 (slc30a4) has been implicated as a critical regulator of milk production and quality. The \u201clethal milk\u201d mouse (C57bl/6Jlm/lm) contains a spontaneous mutation in slc30a4, which results in a non-functional, prematurely truncated protein of greatly reduced abundance. The C57bl/6Jlm/lm mouse displays numerous signs of suboptimal lactation including decreased mammary gland weight, milk volume, and milk Zn concentration which result in the death of pups within one week of birth. The primary goal of my dissertation is to understand the role of ZnT4 in mammary gland development and function during lactation.\nPhysiological Zn requirements are increased during lactation, especially in the mammary gland where a significant amount of Zn is imported into the mammary gland and transported by ZnT4 to supply Zn to Zn-dependent proteins that are critical for mammary gland expansion and milk synthesis. Increased demand is partially met through increased absorption of Zn from the diet. Moreover, it is estimated that 60 to 80% of women of reproductive age are at risk for Zn deficiency due to low intake of bioavailable Zn and increased demands during pregnancy and lactation. How Zn is redistributed within the body to meet the demands of lactation and whether Zn redistribution is altered during Zn deficiency remains unknown. In study 1, we utilized a mouse model to quantitatively ascertain the redistribution of whole body Zn pools during lactation and to assess how a marginal Zn deficiency (15ppm Zn diet) affects Zn redistribution. There was substantial redistribution of tissue Zn pools during lactation including increased Zn concentrations in the stomach, muscle, mammary gland, plasma, pancreas, and red blood cells and decreased concentrations in the liver, femur, and adrenal glands. Zn deficiency perturbed Zn redistribution in several instances for example in the femur and stomach; however, the total amount of Zn accumulated by mammary gland was unaffected. Moreover, we observed that consumption of a marginally Zn deficient diet significantly decreased offspring weight gain and survival. These studies demonstrate that adequate dietary Zn intake is necessary for normal, homeostatic Zn pool redistribution during lactation in order to meet the shifting demands of Zn during this critical time and importantly, that the mammary gland appears protected during periods of low Zn intake\nIn study 2, we explored the sub-cellular location of Zn accumulation in the mammary gland and mammary epithelial cell during lactation. We utilized x-ray fluorescence microscopy and identified the accumulation of large, discrete, labile Zn pools in the lactating mammary gland. We identified the GA as the sub-cellular location of these Zn pools, which was subsequently redistributed in response to PRL stimulation to vesicles destined for secretion from the mammary gland. These studies demonstrate the fundamental role of Zn accumulation in the GA as a critical component of mammary gland Zn homeostasis and function during lactation. \nPrevious studies noted the presence of ZnT4 proximal to the luminal membrane in breast biopsies from lactating women. Additionally, we found that ZnT4 was localized to an intracellular compartment and at the luminal membrane of the lactating mammary gland in rodents, and furthermore, expression is dramatically enhanced during lactation. Therefore, in study 3 we delineated the role of ZnT4 in cultured mammary epithelial cells (HC11) and showed that it transports Zn into the trans-GA for Zn-dependent proteins that are critical for mammary gland function and optimal milk synthesis including 1,4-\u03b2-galactosyltransferase and carbonic anhydrase VI. Additionally, we found that ZnT4 traffics to the cell membrane in response to Zn to transport Zn out of the cell. These studies demonstrate that ZnT4 is responsible for Zn import into the GA and plays a central role in promoting optimal mammary gland function and Zn secretion during lactation.\nIn study 4, we used ZnT4-null mice (C57bl/6Jlm/lm) to investigate the role of ZnT4 in mammary gland development and lactation. Histological analysis revealed significantly impaired ductal expansion as measured by decreased alveolar abundance in nulliparous C57bl/6Jlm/lm mammary glands. Furthermore, C57bl/6Jlm/lm mammary glands had decreased MMP-9 activity suggesting that ZnT4 plays a critical role in mediating Zn-dependent proteins that are critical in expansion of the ductal tree during mammary gland development. Additionally, lactating C57bl/6Jlm/lm mammary glands display a sparser ductal tree structure and fewer alveoli compared to wild-type littermates, indicating that the defects observed in nulliparous C57bl/6J mice carry over to lactation. To further investigate our findings from a mechanistic perspective we attenuated ZnT4 expression in HC11 mammary epithelial cells, which increased cytoplasmic Zn concentration and decreased Zn secretion. These studies indicate that GAZnT4-null C57bl/6Jlm/lm mice are unable to import Zn into the GA to supply Zn to Zn-dependent proteins that are critical for mammary gland development. These studies implicate ZnT4 as a critical mediator of intracellular Zn homeostasis, thereby playing a central role in regulating Zn-mediated enzymes that control fundamental aspects of mammary gland ductal growth and expansion.\nIn summary, results supported a central role for ZnT4 in mammary gland development and function; specifically in its ability to transport Zn to proteins that are critical to optimal lactation and to maintain intracellular Zn homeostasis. Overall, these studies show that ZnT4 is critical for mammary gland ductal growth and expansion during puberty, and understanding the function of ZnT4 will have major implications towards improving our understanding of how the mammary gland is able to properly develop and produce milk of optimal quality and quantity, thereby improving maternal and infant health.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9423], "author_name_tesi": "Mccormick, Nicholas Howard", "last_name_ssi": "Mccormick", "middle_name_ssi": "Howard", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shannon Leanne Kelleher", "Troy Ott", "Kevin John Harvatine", "Michael Thomas Green", "David I Soybel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Dissertation Advisor", "Troy Ott, Committee Member", "Kevin John Harvatine, Committee Member", "Michael Thomas Green, Committee Member", "David I Soybel, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mammary gland", "zinc", "lactation", "zinc transporter", "milk", "ZnT4", "lethal milk"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Emotional Experiences Of Three Early Childhood Teachers\n\nduring Difficult Parent-teacher Conferences:\n\nan Analysis Of Care Strategies In Response To These Emotions\n", "id": "16384", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8256", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using case study design with a semi-structured interview approach and diary journal entries, my research study seeks to describe the emotional experiences of three inner-city, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania early childhood teachers during a difficult parent-teacher conference.

The year prior to this study, the three teachers participated in a year-long professional development program. Cultivating Awareness and Resilience in Education (CARE) was created to provide teachers with mindfulness strategies that may enable them to experience stressful classroom situations with an attitude of curiosity, openness, and acceptance of themselves, others, and the situation.  This study investigates if these teachers, who self-reported that they used CARE strategies in their classroom during the fall of 2011, relied on any of the strategies during what they predicted and described as a difficult parent-teacher conference in February of 2012. \nAs evidenced through the three teacher\u2019s description of their thinking and feelings prior to the anticipated difficult parent-teacher conference, teachers experienced stress.  In addition, each teacher spoke of exchanges with the parent during the conference in which they felt stressed or angry.  The consistent response to these emotions was the teachers\u2019 recognition of what she was feeling and the utilization of deep breathing, a strategy they learned and attributed to their CARE training.  \nIn these three cases, teachers\u2019 judgments about the parenting decisions they witnessed were consistent.  All three teachers spoke about how differently they would respond to the child if they were the parent; all believing that their approach would have been more appropriate in obtaining the desired behavior from the child.  Although unsolicited, the teachers voluntarily spoke about how different their parents were in comparison to the parents sitting across from them during the conference.  \nListening to these judgments about parents, it appears that one of the goals of CARE may not have been realized.  Specifically, CARE strategies were designed to develop within the teachers a sense of acceptance of others.  Based upon the teacher\u2019s critical comments about parents, this acceptance was not evident.

Along with graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoS2, WS2, and ReS2 are among these van der Waals solids and display remarkable properties.  The research contained within this dissertation investigates the optical properties of these 2-Dimensional (2D) materials as well as utilizes substitutional doping and strain to tune their properties.  Chapter 1 discusses the structure, properties, growth, and characterization of various 2D materials.  In Chapter 2, the synthesis of high quality boron-doped graphene is demonstrated using atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) that was characterized by Raman, scanning tunneling microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  It was also shown to have unique sensing capabilities for detecting toxic gases such as NH3 and NO2 in extremely low concentrations (i.e. parts per billion/parts per trillion).  In Chapter 3, the Raman and photoluminescence (PL) of single, bi, and few-layered MoS2 grown by powder vaporization as a function of strain is studied through the development of a method to apply uniaxial strain to the material while collecting Raman and PL.  Before this study, there were no reports on how the properties of few-layered MoS2 under strain were influenced by the number of layers, even though it has been shown that the transport properties of few-layers are more favorable than their monolayered counterparts.  Chapter 4 addresses the significant variation in transport and optical properties found in the literature on TMDs by studying the Raman and PL of monolayered WS2 produced via different growth methods.  Distinct features that indicate the degree of crystallinity in WS2 were observed and it was determined that PL is drastically more sensitive to the quality of the material than Raman spectroscopy.  Finally, the optical properties of a relatively new TMD, ReS2, are investigated in Chapter 5.

A detailed polarization-dependent study was performed for all of the 18 first order Raman modes for different number of layers.

One of these factors, Nipah virus (NiV) C protein, was investigated in the current research to characterize some of the molecular characteristics C protein may require for its role in viral pathogenesis and immune evasion.\nMany paramyxoviruses express multifunctional C proteins; potential roles of C proteins during virus infection include: immune evasion, regulation of viral polymerase function, viral pathogenesis, and recruitment of host factors for virus particle assembly.  Here, it was observed that NiV C protein is a membrane-bound protein that is also highly unstable when expressed in mammalian cells.  NiV C protein turnover was also found to be ubiquitin-proteasome dependent.  It was confirmed that NiV C protein is ubiquitinated and the elimination of all the sites for ubiquitin attachment was required to prevent ubiquitination and partially restore protein stability.  These findings have defined new characteristics of NiV C protein, which are likely important during viral infections.\nIn an effort to identify proteins important for Henipavirus assembly and budding, several screens were performed to identify host protein interactions with Henipavirus matrix (M) proteins.  Several novel host factors that interact with Henipavirus M proteins were identified.  In addition, minimal binding fragments were constructed that, when overexpressed, inhibited the production of Nipah virus-like particles.  A more comprehensive analysis of the identified host proteins revealed that they were frequently found in known mammalian cellular complexes with each other.  These complexes are involved in a variety of cellular functions such as transcriptional regulation, protein translation, protein sorting and transport.  Any number of these may be critical for Henipavirus M protein function.  Additionally, more than half of the confirmed Henipavirus M-interacting proteins contained large serine-rich acidic regions.  These regions were critical for binding and likely allow for electrostatic interactions to occur with Henipavirus M proteins.  Together, these data provide a model where Henipavirus M protein uses electrostatic interactions with host factors for a variety of functions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8044], "author_name_tesi": "Mccrory, Thomas Sean", "last_name_ssi": "Mccrory", "middle_name_ssi": "Sean", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Craig Eugene Cameron"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Paul Schmitt, Dissertation Advisor", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Chair", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Henipavirus", "Yeast two-hybrid", "Nipah virus", "Virus-like particles", "Ubiquitination", "Protein Purification"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Understanding the effects of electrolyte pH and spectator ions on electrocatalysis", "id": "14301itm107", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14301", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "   Recent experimental evidence suggests that the rate and mechanisms of many electrocatalytic reactions depend on electrolyte pH and the identity of the alkali metal cation present in an alkaline electrolyte. In particular, the rate of the hydrogen oxidation reaction, important in hydrogen fuel cells, is 2-3 orders of magnitude slower in an alkaline electrolyte than in an acid electrolyte, even on the most active platinum catalyst. While it is well known that many anions effect the rates of electrocatalytic reactions, through their specific adsorption and blocking of active sites on the electrode surface, the mechanism by which alkali metal cations exert their effects is unknown. Both experiment and density functional theory modeling of the electrode-electrolyte interface are used in this dissertation to better understand how pH and alkali metal cations effect electrocatalytic reactions.\t\n \tDensity functional theory calculations show that alkali metal cation specific adsorption is favorable at low potentials to many electrode surfaces, including platinum, in an alkaline electrolyte. Once on the surface, these alkali metal cations show only a small interaction with adsorbed hydrogen, but a significant weakening of adsorbed hydroxide. These results explain an experimentally observed anomalous shift in the low potential features of cyclic voltammograms measured on Pt(110), Pt(100), and stepped Pt surfaces with increasing pH, which correlate with the pH dependence of the rate of the hydrogen oxidation reaction. The rate of the hydrogen oxidation reaction is experimentally measured in alkaline electrolytes, and is found to depend on the alkali metal cation present, following the trend Li > Na > K > Cs. The density functional theory calculated trend in the effect of these cations on hydroxide adsorption matches the trend in rate, supporting that adsorbed hydroxide may be an intermediate in the hydrogen oxidation reaction. To design highly active hydrogen oxidation/evolution catalysts, both hydrogen adsorption strength and hydroxide adsorption strength must be considered.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14984], "author_name_tesi": "Mccrum, Ian Taylor", "last_name_ssi": "Mccrum", "middle_name_ssi": "Taylor", "first_name_ssi": "Ian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael John Janik", "Michael John Janik", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Chao-Yang Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael John Janik, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael John Janik, Committee Chair", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member", "Chao-Yang Wang, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrocatalysis", "density functional theory", "hydrogen oxidation", "alkaline fuel cells", "specific adsorption", "ion effects"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The effects of vitamin A deficiency on host defense during Citrobacter rodentium infection", "id": "27247", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11968", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vitamin A deficiency is still a prevalent problem in resource limited countries, affecting more that 250 million preschool aged children.  Vitamin A deficiency is associated with increased severity of respiratory and diarrheal diseases, a major cause of childhood mortality.  Vitamin A supplementation is associated with increased vitamin A status and decreased disease severity, indicating a link between vitamin A status and immune function.  Using the murine enteric pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium, I explored the relationship between host vitamin A status, intestinal infection and immune response.  The first objective was to determine the effect of vitamin A deficiency on C. rodentium infection.  My study showed that vitamin A deficient (A-) hosts did not clear the infection and 40% of the A- animals developed a lethal infection.  Additionally, retinoic acid treatment of A- hosts promoted infection clearance and survival.  The findings from this study suggest that A- hosts may harbor enteric pathogens but retinoic acid treatment was effective during C. rodentium infection.  The second objective was to determine how retinoic acid promotes C. rodentium clearance in the A- host.  My data shows that 1 dose of retinoic acid in an A- host was effective at clearing infection.  Two doses of retinoic acid treatment promoted il17a expression in the colon of A- mice yet, retinoic acid treatment of splenocytes in vitro inhibited IL-17 secretion.  Vitamin A host status was found to have no effect on the microbiota and B cell numbers in the gut, indicating that other acquired immune cells may be targets of RA.   To understand the effects of retinoid signaling on T cells, T-dnRAR mice were generated.  T-dnRAR mice had significantly more CD8+ thymocytes but significantly fewer CD8+ T cells in the spleen and mesenteric lymph node.  Together, the work presented in this dissertation indicates that vitamin A deficient hosts may be asymptomatic carriers of enteric infections and that vitamin A treatment during infection promotes a local IL-17a response that is associated with clearance of C. rodentium.
