A literature review in this area shows that the existing studies on OPEC still have some major deficiencies in theoretical interpretation and empirical estimation technique. After a brief background review in chapter 1, chapter 2 tests Griffin\u00a1\u00afs market-sharing cartel model on the post-Griffin time horizon with a simultaneous system of equations, and an innovative hypothesis of OPEC\u00a1\u00afs behavior (Saudi Arabia in particular) is then proposed based on the estimation results. Chapter 3 first provides a conceptual analysis of OPEC behavior under the framework of non-cooperative collusion with imperfect information. An empirical model is then constructed and estimated.\nThe results of the empirical studies in this thesis strongly support the hypothesis that OPEC has operated as a market-sharing cartel since the early 1980s. In addition, the results also provide some support of the theory of non-cooperative collusion under imperfect information. OPEC members collude under normal circumstances and behave competitively at times in response to imperfect market signals of cartel compliance and some internal attributes. Periodic joint competition conduct plays an important role in sustaining the collusion in the long run. Saudi Arabia acts as the leader of the cartel, accommodating intermediate unfavorable market development and punishing others with a tit-for-tat strategy in extreme circumstances. \n", "semester_ssi": "", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [873], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Bo ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mineral Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Nathan Kleit", "Mark John Roberts", "Adam Zachary Rose", "James S.

With the proliferation of the third generation wireless networks, it is expected that multimedia data transmission and manipulation will achieve even larger growth in the next decade. The improved bandwidth and mobility of computing devices enable the possibility of accessing multimedia data ~{!0~}anytime, and anywhere~{!1~}, providing the foundation for mobile multimedia data management.\n  At the same time, due to the characteristics of multimedia data (e.g. large data volume and lack of accurate semantic content representation), the existing multimedia information retrieval systems cannot guarantee accuracy, efficiency, and robustness when performing distributed content-based retrieval. In addition, the mobile environment has put further requirements on the manipulation of multimedia data: 1) The mobile computing devices are often disconnected from the network for prolonged periods of time due to the battery power limitations; 2) The network infrastructure is organized in a peer-to-peer fashion, making the traditional centralized or flooding-based search schemes ineffective; 3) The mobile computing devices in the network have frequent relocations, making it important to consider location information in the query processing; 4) The limitation of system resources (e.g. bandwidth and storage) require efficient approaches for handling voluminous multimedia data; and 5) The information retrieval system needs to integrate the heterogeneous and autonomous mobile data sources to provide a global framework for content-based multimedia data access. Generally, the overall performance of multimedia information retrieval is greatly influenced by the emerging issues in mobile networks.\n  Despite the fact that a great deal of research has been done on multimedia data access, there has been little work done in integrating content-based multimedia retrieval in the mobile environment, especially in the wireless ad hoc networks. In addition, there is not much research work reported on the semantic analysis and content representation of mobile multimedia data. These research issues, however, are crucial for the successful and efficient multimedia communications in mobile networks. Therefore, it is highly necessary to investigate these challenges and devise a novel methodology for mobile multimedia data management.\n  This dissertation is intended to present and analyze a new semantic-aware multimedia representation and accessing model in distributed and mobile database environments. Semantic classification and categorization of the multimedia databases are based on the Summary Schemas Model (SSM). The ability of summarizing general information provides a promising mechanism to represent and access multimedia data entities. In this dissertation, we propose a logic-based model that can be integrated in the SSM and used as the paradigm for multimedia data content representation. This dissertation also investigates the feasibility of the proposed model, compares and contrasts it against several models as advanced in the literature.\n  To provide an efficient platform for multimedia information retrieval in ad hoc networks, we propose to cluster ad hoc multimedia databases based on their semantic contents, and construct a virtual hierarchical indexing infrastructure overlaid on the mobile databases. This clustering scheme uses a semantic-aware framework as the theoretical foundation for multimedia data organization. Several novel techniques are presented to facilitate the representation and manipulation of multimedia data in ad hoc networks: 1) using concise distribution expressions to represent the semantic similarity of multimedia data, 2) constructing clusters based on the semantic relationships between multimedia entities, 3) reducing the cost of content-based multimedia retrieval through the restriction of semantic distances, and 4) employing a self-adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts to the content and topology changes of the ad hoc networks. \n  As an extension to the aforementioned multimedia content representation model, we also presented a semantic-aware image caching scheme to facilitate content-based multimedia information retrieval in ad hoc networks. The caching scheme can efficiently utilize the cache space and significantly reduce the cost of image retrieval. It is based on several innovative ideas: 1) multi-level partitioning of the semantic space, 2) association and Bayesian probability based content prediction, 3) constraint-based representation method showing the semantic similarity between images, and 4) adaptive QoS-aware cache consistency maintenance.\n  Overall, the focus of this dissertation is to provide a semantic-aware framework that is capable of representing, organizing, and searching multimedia data objects in the distributed and mobile environments. The proposed framework is scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient in performing content-based multimedia retrieval as demonstrated in our combination of theoretical analysis and extensive experimental studies.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [893], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Bo ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali R Hurson", "Wang Chien Lee", "John Joseph Hannan", "Kultegin Aydin", "Raj Acharya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali R Hurson, Committee Chair", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member", "John Joseph Hannan, Committee Member", "Kultegin Aydin, Committee Member", "Raj Acharya, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multimedia information retrieval", "distributed database", "mobile computing"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "TRANSVERSE DISTRIBUTION FACTORS FOR HORIZONTALLY CURVED BRIDGES UNDER THE EFFECT OF PERMIT VEHICLES", "id": "14871bxy5065", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14871", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Permit vehicles with non-standard gage are increasingly used to carry heavy and \noversized cargos.

Therefore, the effect of permit vehicles on GDFs \nfor curved bridges needs to be determined to allow rapid and efficient evaluation for issue \nof permits. Four permit vehicles obtained from a Pennsylvania Department of \nTransportation (PennDOT) database and twenty-seven curved bridges from Kim (2007) \nare analyzed with CSiBridge\u00ae to conduct the parametric study.

A \nlinear regression analysis is conducted to determine the relationship between AASHTO \napproximate GDFs and GDFs for curved bridges subjected to permit vehicles to develop \na proposed, approximate GDF equation for curved girder bridges.

The recent advances of ultrafast (< 100 fs) pulse laser systems generated new applications in many research fields, including Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc., where an intensity or polarization modulator is usually needed. Also, the recent interests in free-space optical communication also call for a polarization modulator to implement a link that can be encrypted with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) in a stable way.

Forests are a potential carbon sink, and certain forest management activities can effectively result in increased carbon sequestration. This study tries to answer two questions: 1) Can owners of oak forest stands in Pennsylvania benefit by participating in carbon markets and are the benefits sufficient to induce participation? And 2) If so, to what extent and how would participation in carbon markets change the management behavior of Pennsylvania oak forest owners? In order to answer these questions, two objectives are addressed: First, apply the CAR Forest Project Protocol to a variety of Pennsylvania oak forest management scenarios on a sample of oak forest stands that vary in terms of age, site quality and stocking. Second, Evaluate how participation in CAR would affect the profitability of each management scenario and, if so, how participation would likely change the preferred management practice for each stand. \n  Thirty-six oak plots in Pennsylvania were selected from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database, with two from each of 18 groups based on Stand Age, Basal Area, and Site Condition. Seven management alternatives (two even-aged alternatives, four uneven-aged alternatives, and a No Management alternative) were simulated for each of the sampled plots using the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS). Carbon credits, or  Climate Reserve Tonnes (CRTs), were calculated for each plot and management scenario using the Forest Project Protocol from CAR. The Shelterwood 80 (SW 80) management alternative was designated as the baseline scenario. The present value of the CRTs were calculated based on two carbon prices ($10 tCO2e and $30 tCO2e) and discounted rates (4% and 6%). In addition, the present value of timber harvests was also calculated for each plot and management scenario. Negative quantified removals were addressed by assuming that each plot/stand was part of a larger ownership and that negative removals are offset by positive removals on the rest of the property in any given year. Thus, no negative removals were carried over and no buffer pool was needed to account for reversals. This approach is referred to as the \u201centerprise-wide perspective.\u201d Confidence deductions were also set at 10%. \n  Total quantified removals are generally larger for the no management scenario and the SW120 scenario but are lower and often negative for the other treatments. When carbon price is at $10/ tCO2e and the discount rate is 4%, the present values of the projected carbon credits shows that No Mgt or U 30W management is probably the better choice for landowners interested in maximizing CRTs. However, uneven-aged management treatments tended to produce the greatest present values of timber revenues. At a carbon price of $10/tCO2e, timber values tend to be much larger than carbon values. However, at a carbon price of $30/ tCO2e, the No Mgt option produces nearly as much value from carbon alone as the timber values from other options. This finding suggests that raising carbon price could make the No Mgt become the best scenario even though it produces no timber revenue. The higher discount of 6% disproportionately negatively affects the management scenarios that favor waiting longer before harvesting and reduces the ability of carbon credits to shift the optimal management regime to longer rotations and waiting longer before harvesting.\n  Some limitations of the analysis presented here include the lack of cost data and possible inaccuracies in the way FVS projects stand development under the uneven-aged management scenarios.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9251], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Chieh-chung ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chieh-chung", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marc Eric Mcdill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marc Eric Mcdill, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Oak stands", "Pennsylvania", "carbon credit", "carbon benefits", "CAR"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A TIME-VARYING PERSPECTIVE ON MINDFULNESS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY", "id": "14492cuy128", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14492", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Physical activity and mindfulness training can each be health enhancing but limited efforts have been made to integrate them in research or clinical practice. Combining physical activity with mindfulness as a single intervention have potential to escalate the health effects. Practicing mindfulness during physical activity interventions may also help people to maintain their increased physical activity level, leading to a more sustainable intervention. The disproportional attention on trait mindfulness but limited focus on state mindfulness in previous studies signifies a main barrier that restricted the application for implementing mindfulness in physical activity interventions. To overcome this main obstacle, three studies in this dissertation were designed to address the barrier and advance understanding of the relation between physical activity and mindfulness. \nThe first study involved a systematic review of peer-reviewed research articles in major academic database and Google Scholar to synthesize and identify gaps in the mindfulness-physical activity literature. Available evidence showed that physical activity and trait mindfulness were positively related, but little has been known regarding the association between physical activity and state mindfulness. Based on the lack of state mindfulness studies in the current literature, a three-level mindfulness framework (global, contextual, and situational level) was proposed to organize current research studies and available mindfulness self-report measures within each mindfulness level. This hierarchical framework that differentiated the contextual and temporal specificity of mindfulness is needed to bridge the gap in the literature. \nThe second study applied experience sampling methods to investigate the relations between momentary time allocation in different daily activities/postures and well-being among college students (N=158). Results from multilevel analysis suggested that college students\u2019 negative affect was associated with their daily activities/postures and mindfulness in the within-person level. When students moved more or stood more compared to sitting in their daily life, they reported lower levels of negative affect. Further, students\u2019 situational mindfulness seemed to moderate this within-person association between momentary activities/postures and negative affect. When students were more mindful while moving, they experienced greater degrees of reduction in negative affect momentarily. \nThe final study designed and evaluated an outdoor mindful walking program to determine its feasibility, acceptability, sustainability and preliminary efficacy in reducing negative affect among older adults. Community-dwelling older adults (N=27) attended a one-month, eight session mindful walking program and completed multiple self-report measures before, during, and after the program. Overall, participants perceived this outdoor mindful walking program to be acceptable, engaging and appealing. After the program, most of them were still willing to maintain and actually continued practicing mindful walking in their leisure time. Preliminary efficacy of the program was also identified. After the mindful walking sessions, reductions in negative affect were associated with increases in situational mindfulness among older adults.  Based on the promising results, future randomized controlled trials are warranted to test the efficacy of mindful walking program among older adults.\nCollectively, these studies highlight the value of studying mindfulness as a time-varying construct in physical activity studies. Differentiating global mindfulness from context- or situation-specific mindfulness not only broadens our scope in understanding the relation between physical activity and mindfulness, but also provides a new avenue for future research. Each study in the current dissertation made unique contributions to the physical activity and mindfulness literature. First, this dissertation synthesized research evidence on the physical activity-mindfulness association, identified the literature gap, and provided a useful framework for further studies to close the gap. Second, this dissertation was the first experience sampling study that identified the time-varying association between momentary physical activity, mindfulness, and negative affect in daily life. Lastly, this dissertation designed an innovative and feasible mindful walking program which may inform future dissemination for reducing negative affect in older adults. In general, the within-person associations between physical activity and mindfulness established in this dissertation provided valuable implications in facilitating and developing effective behavioral intervention strategies to promote health and well-being in different populations.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15437], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Chih Hsiang", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "Hsiang", "first_name_ssi": "Chih", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David E.

After decades of development, nonlinear optical microscopy modalities are playing a vital role in modern medical and biological research and applications. Conventional nonlinear microscopy is usually too slow for dynamic applications due to its imaging approach of three-dimension (3D) point-by-point scanning. By integrating technologies of nanofabrication, spectroscopy and diffractive optics, we successfully eliminated the mechanical scanning along depth dimension, and therefore the three-dimension nonlinear imaging including second harmonic generation (SHG), two-photon absorption (TPA) and confocal can be significantly expedited. In the chapter 2 of this thesis, I will describe two of my Ph.D. research projects on non-axial-scanning 3D nonlinear imaging. In order to further optimize the performance of nonlinear optical microscopy, fundamental research on light-matter interactions has been intensively carried out. Some other related domains like photon coherent control and laser source optimization can also benefit from this research. Critical information of light-matter interactions is contained in the amplitude and phase information of coherent light. Our group proposed a solution of collinear frequency-resolved optical gating (cFROG) based on a second harmonic nanoprobe (SHARP) for in situ characterization of ultrafast laser pulses in the nano-femto spatiotemporal scale. As a further step forward, here we combine holography technique with cFROG method to completely characterize the field and this newly-developed technique has enabled us to obtain detailed information of the pulse propagation. This new technique for spatiotemporal characterization of laser pulse will be detailed in Chapter 3. As the most used instrument for my experimental research on nonlinear optics, the optical spectrometer is one of the most important and most widely used instruments in various research areas. However, most spectrometers are too expensive or too bulky. Therefore, we developed the prototype of a miniature spectrometer with a single diffractive element that integrates the functions of multiple components installed in a traditional spectrometer. Our palm-size prototype has comparative performance to some existing much-more-expensive commercial spectrometers. In addition, the material for fabricating the device was carefully selected so that the cost can be lowered down significantly.

Hence, to model large nonlinear viscoelastic deformations, Christensen\u2019s viscoelastic theory was used. The analytical viscoelastic material model was validated with experimental results for specimens undergoing uniaxial deformation. Furthermore, non-axisymmetric actuator configurations with cavities in the shapes of an ellipse and rectangle were investigated using a finite element model.\n\nAn analytical model for dielectric elastomers was developed using the theory of large elastic deformations known as hyperelasticity. From these results a better understanding of how a dielectric elastomer annulus deforms was obtained by understanding the effects of varying Maxwell pressures, pre-stretches, and inner radial pressures, and internal stresses. Through the use of the analytical model, it was found that the radial and circumferential stresses transitions from tensile to compressive stresses at a \"critical\" Maxwell pressure. The significance of this is the determination of the Maxwell pressure that will cause the elastomer to buckle or wrinkle. Also, the model not only showed that prestretching yields the benefit of greater strain, but that there exists an \"optimum\" pre-stretch range that would yield a larger percent change in radius for a given incremental increase in the effective Maxwell pressure. In addition, a fixed-free annulus with an inner radial pressure, which may simulate a portion of a simple fluid pump, was modeled. It was found that there exists an operating range of the inner radial pressure and effective Maxwell pressures for the device to be physically as well as mathematically viable.\n\nA nonlinear finite deformation viscoelastic model for dielectric elastomer membranes was developed using Christensen\u2019s viscoelastic model in the stretch regime 1.5<\u00eb<3. This model is applicable for small and large nonlinear deformations. In this research, the Mooney-Rivlin elastic material model was utilized. Uniaxial creep tests were conducted to determine the material constants of an exponentially decaying relaxation modulus. The analytical model validated with experimental results from a constant load uniaxial tensile test. The degree of agreement was a function of the relaxation modulus, g(t). A relaxation modulus was found and correlated very well with experimental data within one time constant of the relaxation modulus. The same relaxation modulus could not predict viscoelastic deformations beyond this time constant. A single relaxation function that characterizes the material over a large time [0,t] domain can be obtained by choosing a more complicated mathematical form of the relaxation modulus. \n\nFurthermore, the general-purpose finite element (FE) software ABAQUS was used to develop an FE model of non-axisymmetric dielectric elastomer actuators undergoing large nonlinear viscoelastic deformations. Rectangular framed actuators with rectangular and elliptical cavities at the center were investigated. Hyperelastic and viscoelastic material properties were determined from uniaxial constant load tensile and creep test data, respectively. The FE model was validated using experimental data from actuators with uniaxial, in-plane axisymmetric, and in-plane non-axisymmetric deformations. The FE hyperelastic (time-independent) results for uniaxial, in-plane axisymmetric, and in-plane non-axisymmetric deformations correlated well with experimental data. The time-dependent FE results of activated (non-zero electric field) uniaxial and in-plane axisymmetric (annular configuration) deformations correlated well with experimental data. The FE and experimental correlations degraded for time-dependent deformations of non-axisymmetric geometries. The cause for this may be due to the limitations of FE models that use uniaxial test data to define the material properties. Utilization of test results from in-plane tensile tests and in-plane shear tests may improve the FE model to better simulate in-plane deformations.\n\nFinally, the FE model was used to model activated strains of cylindrical silicone dielectric elastomer actuators as these materials exhibit negligible viscoelastic behaviors. The material properties were once again defined using uniaxial tensile test data. The activated strains of the cylindrical tubes were subjected to uniaxial tensile tests. As expected, the FE model correlated well uniaxial test data.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1741], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Eunice Eun-Young", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "Eun-Young", "first_name_ssi": "Eunice", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Alan Snyder", "H J Sommer Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker, Committee Chair", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Chair", "Alan Snyder, Committee Member", "H J Sommer Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electroactive polymers", "modeling", "finite element", "electrostrictive", "large nonlinear viscoelastic deformations"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EXCHANGING SOCIAL SUPPORT ONLINE: DECODING MOTIVATING FACTORS FOR PROMOTING SOCIAL SUPPORT IN A VIRTUAL COMMUNITY OF IBS PATIENTS ", "id": "14349fuy106", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14349", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous literature has repeatedly documented the positive association between receiving social support and individual well-being.

Such models are of great importance in understanding the underlying mechanisms of complex disease and designing preventive or therapeutic strategies. Complex diseases often start with abnormal mutations of the system, which can be modeled as network damage in network dynamical model. Network control problems design strategy to influence or drive the system to a desired state. Thus network control and damage mitigation strategies are a promising avenue toward developing disease intervention and therapies.\n\nDeveloping network dynamical models and network control strategies are challenging tasks as numerous components interact in a diverse ways in a biological system and  we often have incomplete information including the dynamical mechanism and precise quantitative parameters from experimental data. Logic dynamical models, such as Boolean network models, demonstrate their value in such situations, including having considerable dynamic richness and capacity to capture emergent characteristic of real biological systems. I contributed to developing two framework to solve network control problem in Boolean network models.  I design compensatory interactions to mitigate multiple network deregulations and stabilize the system as disease prevention or immediate treatment method. I also applied a heuristic algorithm to solve the target control problem in Boolean network models, which can be used to design disease treatment. This heuristic algorithm is based on a concept called domain of influence of node states, which describes the stabilization effect of a long-term intervention. These two frameworks complement each other in their method and purpose. Another way to proceed with incomplete information is structure-based control of continuous models. I test and compare two established methods, structural controllability and feedback-vertex control to understand their differences and elucidate relationship between network topology and network dynamics.\n\nI applied the above framework to several real biological models, including dynamical models involved in complex disease such as cancer and T-LGL leukemia. These analytical and computational tools not only generate solutions consistent with established experimental results and previous established tools, but also make predictions to help guide experimentalist to design real solutions to the challenging complex diseases. These developed frameworks in my dissertation also points out new directions for future research in network control. \n\nThe dissertation is organized in the following way. In chapter 1, I introduce the background, concepts and methods involved in network modeling and network control problems. In chapter 2, I report the work to design immediate damage mitigation strategies through compensatory interactions in Boolean network models. In chapter 3, I report the work to solve the target control problem in Boolean network models through the concept of domain of influence.

The conventional liquid electrolytes in the lithium ion battery brought about safety problems such as fire and explosion. Related safety accidents (e.g., cell phone explosion, laptop fire, plane smoldering, etc.) have been reported many times. This also eliminates the possibility of using lithium metal as anode material which has much higher theoretical specific capacity in comparison with commercial graphite electrode because of the growth of uncontrolled lithium dendrites can lead to short circuit and other serious accidents. Solid polymer electrolytes have many advantages over conventional liquid electrolytes. They are light-weighted, non-volatile and have much better safety features than liquid electrolyte. Meanwhile, they are also better than the ceramic electrolyte in terms of their excellent flexibility and processability. Currently, low ionic conductivity of solid polymer electrolytes (e.g., polyethylene oxide (PEO)) at ambient temperature still hinders their practical application. Ionic liquids (ILs) are non-flammable and have negligible volatility. Its ionic conductive nature, excellent chemical stability, and good electrochemical stability enable them to be regarded as useful components for next generation battery electrolytes. In this thesis work, focus will be placed on synthesis and characterization of ionic liquid tethered organic/inorganic hybrid polymer electrolyte with high room temperature ionic conductivity. Moreover, their electrochemical properties and prototype battery performances were also looked into.\n         The use of highly conductive solid-state electrolytes to replace conventional liquid organic electrolytes enables radical improvements in reliability, safety and performance of lithium batteries. Here in chapter 2, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new class of nonflammable solid electrolytes based on the grafting of ionic liquids onto octa-silsesquioxane. The electrolyte exhibits outstanding room-temperature ionic conductivity (~4.8 \u00d7 10-4 S/cm), excellent electrochemical stability (up to 5 V relative to Li+/Li) and high thermal stability. All-solid-state Li metal batteries using the prepared electrolyte membrane are successfully cycled with high coulombic efficiencies at ambient temperature. Good cycling stability of the electrolyte against lithium has been demonstrated. This work provides a new platform of solid polymer electrolyte for the application of room-temperature lithium batteries.\n         In chapter 3, an organic-inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte with ionic liquid moieties tethered onto dumbbell-shaped octasilsesquioxanes through oligo(ethylene glycol) spacers was synthesized. The hybrid electrolyte is featured by its high room-temperature ionic conductivity (1.2\u00d710-4 S/cm at 20 oC with LiTFSI salt), excellent electrochemical stability (4.6 V vs Li+/Li), and great thermal stability. Excellent capability of the hybrid electrolyte to mediate electrochemical deposition and dissolution of lithium has been demonstrated in the symmetrical lithium cells. No short circuit has been observed after more than 500 hrs in the polarization tests. Decent charge/discharge performance has been obtained in the prepared electrolyte based all-solid-state lithium battery cells at ambient temperature.\n         In chapter 4, hybrid polymer electrolyte network (XPOSS-IL) synthesized by crosslinking the individual dendritic POSS-IL was investigated. To be specific, after grafting mono-broninated hexaethylene glycol to the POSS cage, 1-vinyl imidazole was adopted for the subsequent quarternization reaction.  Then the chain end double bonds underwent free radical crosslinking process to produce XPOSS-IL. The ionic conductivity of LiTFSI dissolved XPOSS-IL is 5.4 \u00d710-5 S/cm at 30 \u2103. By adding a small fraction of ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide  (EMITFSI), the ionic conductivity increases to 1.4 \u00d710-4 S/cm at room temperature. It is also found that EMITFSI will enhance the anodic stability of XPOSS-IL. The Li/LTO and Li/LFP cell assembled with X-POSS-IL-LiTFSI/EMITFSI demonstrates capability of delivering high specific capacities at room temperature and elevated temperature. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16434], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Guang ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "first_name_ssi": "Guang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qing Wang", "Qing Wang", "Robert Hickey", "Enrique Gomez ", "Jian Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qing Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qing Wang, Committee Chair", "Robert Hickey, Committee Member", "Enrique Gomez , Committee Member", "Jian Yang, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lithium metal battery", "octasilsesquioxane", "hybrid electrolyte", "polymers", "ionic conductivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "CHINESE EMERGING ADULTS IN A QUICK-CHANGING WORLD:\nDISCRETIONARY TIME ACTIVITIES, CULTURAL ORIENTATIONS, AND THE MEANINGS OF LEISURE \n", "id": "9718", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2386", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-01-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The overarching aim of this qualitative research was to understand the experiences of college students in China, with focus on discretionary time activities, perceived changes in cultural orientations and leisure meanings. Because data collection was in progress partly during the 2003 SARS medical epidemic in China, when restrictions were imposed on students, this research also includes an examination of the impact of SARS on students\u2019 discretionary time choices. This research is reported in three separate articles that address three unique sets of research questions, but all data come from time diaries and in-depth interviews of a sample of 16 college students in Xi\u2019an, China, in 2003.\nThe focus of the first article is how people make choices about activity engagement during discretionary time. Discretionary time choices are of increasing interest to those studying quality of life issues. Assuming choices are made to maximize individual welfare, several factors are believed to influence these choices. Constraints theory from leisure research suggests these choices, within a set of motivations to maximize personal welfare, are heavily influenced by intrapersonal, interpersonal and structural constraints. Leisure affordance theory focuses on these motivations by suggesting the importance of more positive influences on choices within a set of constraints. In this study an inventory of discretionary time activities and reasons for choosing these activities was documented for a sample of Chinese college students. Because of the occurrence of an unanticipated SARS epidemic, the impact of the SARS crisis on students\u2019 daily choices was also examined in detail. Findings revealed that, despite the constraints imposed by SARS, particularly the suspension of off-campus activities, some students did not perceive a change in daily life, while others perceived positive changes in attitudes and behavior. Findings are important not only because they shed light on the experiences of college students in China, but also because decisions made during this very influential time of life may affect future choices related to discretionary time.\nThe second article focuses on the extent to which Chinese college students perceived globalization impacts on their cultural orientations, or cultural identity. This is an important research topic as college students, or \u201cemerging adults,\u201d are going through a critical life stage of transition from adolescence to adulthood, with active exploration in worldviews and identity as an important characteristic. Worldviews and cultural identity achieved at this stage of life is likely to persist through adulthood. Students with a variety of characteristics were asked to describe western and traditional Chinese cultural orientations towards many aspects of life, and discuss their perceptions of shifts in orientation among young Chinese students as a result of increased exposure to western orientations. A majority of participants thought that the cultural identity of college students in China today is a mixture of some traditional Chinese attitudes and beliefs and some Western attitudes and beliefs. These students believed that the primary sources of traditional orientations are family, community, school, books, and the media, whereas the primary sources of Western characteristics are media, books, peers, school and society. Students reported that they find the mixture of traditional and western cultural orientations is good, or at least acceptable. The competition/cooperation spectrum, one major aspect of citizenship roles, was explored specifically. Competition was believed to be extremely important by these Chinese college students, while cooperation, although also believed important, was observed less in behaviors. Participants identified many contextual factors that encourage competition in the lives of college students in China and identified fewer opportunities to cultivate cooperation. Findings suggest that emerging adults in China, and possibly in other non-Western countries, are susceptible to developing bi-cultural, or multicultural, identities as a consequence of globalization-caused increase in exposure to other cultures, and that this shift will likely be evident in changing citizenship roles, leaning increasingly towards individualism and away from collectivism.\nThe focus of the third article is an investigation of how Chinese college students view the role of leisure in their lives. Emerging adults are believed to enjoy more freedom and opportunities to explore identity through leisure activities than during their adolescent years and adulthood, and leisure provides an important context for both individual and social identity exploration. This article explores gender differences in leisure preferences and the self-reported likelihood of persistence of college leisure activities into later stages of life. Women were found more likely than men to orient their leisure toward relationships with others. In contrast, men were more likely than women to report participating in physical activities, structured organizational activities, and playing cards and chess. Men also seemed to show more interest than women in starting new leisure activities or improving skills related to leisure activities. The majority of men in this study perceived that it was unlikely to continue their current college leisure activities after graduation, while the majority of women believed their current college leisure activities would persist into later stages of life. Time spent on leisure activities was also explored through examining shifts in activity choices in and the intensity of participation between high school and college. Findings revealed a substantial increase in engagement in leisure activities in college, suggesting strongly that the transition from high school to college is especially beneficial to Chinese emerging adults in terms of identity exploration through leisure.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2370], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, He ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "He", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry C Zinn", "Garry Chick", "Geoffrey Clay Godbey", "Eva Sharon Lefkowitz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry C Zinn, Committee Chair", "Garry Chick, Committee Member", "Geoffrey Clay Godbey, Committee Member", "Eva Sharon Lefkowitz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["emerging adults", "affordance", "constraints", "discretionary time activities", "Chinese college students", "cultural identity", "meanings of leisure", "gender difference"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Three Dimensional Finite Difference Time Domain Modeling of Schumann Resonances On Earth and Other Planets of the Solar System", "id": "8037", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2379", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Resonance properties of the Earth-ionosphere cavity were predicted by W. O. Schumann in 1952.  Since then observations of electromagnetic signals in the frequency range 1-500 Hz have become a powerful tool for variety of remote sensing applications, which in recent years included studies of thunderstorm related transient luminous events in the middle atmosphere and related lightning discharges. In this thesis, a three dimensional Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) model is developed to study the propagation of the extremely low frequency (ELF) waves in the Earth-ionosphere cavity and in similar cavities on other celestial bodies of the Solar System.\n\nA comparison of the results from this FDTD model with a set of classical eigenfrequency ($f_n$) and quality factor ($Q_n$) solutions for laterally uniform spherically symmetric Earth-ionosphere cavity and with recent observations of Schumann resonance (SR) during solar proton events (SPEs) and X-ray bursts is provided. The FDTD $f_n$ and $Q_n$ solutions for the uniform cavity appear to be in excellent agreement (within several $\\%$) with well-known experimental results documented in the literature. The related analysis indicates that the frequency of the first SR mode decreases during SPEs and increases during X-ray bursts by a fraction of a Hz, in agreement with physical arguments presented in previously published literature and with observations. The FDTD model is extended to include the effects of the geomagnetic field on SR parameters. A higher penetration height of SR electric and magnetic components is found with the presence of the geomagnetic field.\n\nIn a realistic cavity, the conductivity distribution is not laterally uniform and spherically symmetric, but varies with local time and seasons reflecting related variations in the effects of solar radiation on the conductivity of the lower ionosphere. The global lightning activity in the three main areas (Africa, South-East Asia, and South America) also has diurnal and seasonal variation patterns, which manifest themselves in the diurnal and seasonal variations of SR parameters. In this thesis, the FDTD model is used to account for the realistic cavity at different local time and seasons using asymmetric conductivity profiles derived from International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model. The FDTD results are compared with observational data in the available literature. The influence of the diurnal and seasonal conductivity variation, the global lightning activity, and the positions of the observation stations on the SR parameters are discussed. Another important factor influencing the SR power is related to the shifts of the global thunderstorm regions due to the El Ni~{n}o and La Ni~{n}a phenomena. Due to the different spatial field distributions of SR electric and magnetic components in the Earth-ionosphere cavity, the different power variation patterns are clearly observed in the electric and magnetic components with the motion of the thunderstorm center in our FDTD results. A new method is proposed to detect the shifts of the thunderstorm regions related to the El Ni~{n}o and La Ni~{n}a phenomena using a combination of electric and magnetic components of Schumann resonances at a single station.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the exploration of the other planets in the Solar System. On January 14, 2005, HUYGENS probe landed on Titan, and started exploration of this largest moon of Saturn. One of multiple missions of HUYGENS probe is to find if there are lightning discharges in the Titan\u2019s atmosphere. It is believed that conducting properties of the Titan\u2019s atmosphere are favorable for the formation of the cavity for propagation of electromagnetic waves, so the existence of SR will give a support for the existence of the electrical discharges in the lower atmosphere on Titan. SR parameters are also useful in the study of the electromagnetic properties of Titan\u2019s lower ionosphere. Several papers have recently been published in the refereed literature, which discuss SR parameters on Titan. In this thesis, the 3D FDTD model is used to predict the SR frequencies and Q-factors on Titan. The FDTD results are also compared with those obtained by other analytical and numerical techniques reported in the previously published papers. Besides Titan, we also discuss SR on other planets, specifically Mars and Venus. The atmospheric conductivity profiles for these studies are derived from the previously reported ionospheric models for these planets.

Although the topic of each chapter differs, the approach is shared: I extend a random matching model of money by augmenting the set of money holdings, and compute socially desirable allocations in the spirit of mechanism design analysis. The augmentation is not just technically improving the model, but making the model rich enough to think about the economic problem that each chapter delves into. I document some interesting properties of the desirable allocations, and highlight the differences generated by the extension.\n\nChapter 1. \"A beneficial role of government bonds\"\nI study a random matching model of money to show that the existence of bonds can be beneficial to a society, compared to having only money. In the model, anonymous agents randomly meet in pairs to produce and consume, hence money becomes essential. I compare two identical economies except the availability of bonds, in the sense that people can use any available assets as payments. Following the mechanism design approach, I define implementable allocations and the optimum. Under the notion of the implementability, social planner can devise trading mechanisms that induce people to hold both assets without exogenously given advantages of money as means of payment. I find that having both bonds\nand money in the economy can improve social welfare over having only money. This role of bonds is associated with a beneficial effect of inflation produced by lump-sum transfers, and it is achieved differently from the previously documented mechanism.\n\nChapter 2. \"Optimal intervention in a random-matching model of money\" (joint with Wataru Nozawa)\nWallace [2014] conjectures that there generically exists an inflation-financed transfer scheme that improves welfare over no intervention in pure-currency economies. We investigate this conjecture in the Shi-Trejos-Wright model with different upper bounds on money holdings. The choice of an upper bound affects the results as some potentially beneficial transfer schemes cannot be studied under small upper bounds. Numerical optima are computed for different degrees of discounting rate and risk aversion. As the upper bound on money holdings increases, optima are more likely to have positive money creation (and inflation),\nand this result is in line with the conjecture.\n\nChapter 3. \"Optimal inflation in a model of inside money: A further result\" (joint with Wataru Nozawa)\nWe extend the Deviatov and Wallace [2014] model of inside money in which they find some examples where inflation is beneficial. Their model is restrictive in that it cannot address policies that provide interests on cash (Friedman rule). With a higher upper bound on money holdings than what they use, such policies can be engineered without inflation and resulting allocations are potentially better than what they find, in which case positive inflation is not a property of good allocation. We investigate this possibility and confirm their results in a more generalized setting for some parameters. At optima for the examples, interest on cash is not provided and positive inflation arises in a similar manner to their work. Welfare\nat optimum increases monotonically with respect to discount factor and public monitoring capacity of a society, but other variables change in a more complex way.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12017], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Hoonsik ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hoonsik", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil Wallace", "Neil Wallace", "Shouyong Shi", "Ruilin Zhou", "Jenny Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neil Wallace, Dissertation Advisor", "Neil Wallace, Committee Chair", "Shouyong Shi, Committee Member", "Ruilin Zhou, Committee Member", "Jenny Li, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["coexistence of money and bonds", "money", "inflation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SEEKING THE DAO IN CHILDREN\u2019S LITERATURE: READING WESTERN FANTASIES FROM A DAOIST PERSPECTIVE\n\n\n", "id": "11726", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2310", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Western knowledge and literary theories have dominated the research and teaching of children\u2019s literature.

I argue that Daoist rhetorical theory by Laozi, Sunzi, and Zhuangzi can offer important interpretation and critique of Western fantasies. \nFounders of Daoism (Taoism), Laozi (571-471 B.C.E), Sunzi (around 500 B.C.E.), and Zhuangzi (369-286 B.C.E.) entertain the unity of opposites and the metamorphosis of contraries. The sages see life as a perpetual cyclic movement. Fortune and misfortune happen by turn and exist at the same time. They also argue that the soft can overcome the strong like water. A selfless and humble person can be compared to water, who nourishes others but locates herself in a lower place. Governing military operation is also like water: an army should stay away from the enemy\u2019s strong points and strike his weak points. The sages use different rhetorical strategies in their treatment of military affairs and educational issues. Laozi demonstrates his mastery over metaphysical philosophy and politics with spare and abstract language. Zhuangzi concretizes Laozi\u2019s philosophy through stories and dialogic conversations. Sunzi puts his Daoist (Taoist) philosophy into warfare practice and applies the Dao (Tao) to various war topics such as making assessments, disposition, momentum, and using spies.\nMy dissertation offers an in-depth Daoist reading of Western fantasies. Based on my teaching experience, I chose the following popular fantasies as my case studies. They are Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s fairy tales, E. B. White\u2019s Charlotte\u2019s Web, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u2019s The Little Prince, and the 2008 Hollywood movie The Forbidden Kingdom. In my analysis, I seek places in the chosen works that resonate with the core thoughts of the Daoist philosophy. They include the plot, philosophical or moral messages, and the persuasive style. In addition, I highlight the transnational nature of these Western fantasists\u2019 life experiences, which calls for a transnational perspective on Western fantasies. While I acknowledge the contribution of Western literary theories in deepening our understanding of these texts, the Daoist perspective offers unique insights to appreciating these Western fantasies in the age of globalization. My research will help language art teachers and children\u2019s literature scholars recognize the culture-specific differences and the shared commonality in popular Western fantasies. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2290], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Hsiao-Hui ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hsiao-Hui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Hade & Vivian Yenika Agbaw", "Daniel Dean Hade", "Vivian Yenika Agbaw", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh", "On Cho Ng"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Hade & Vivian Yenika Agbaw, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Dean Hade, Committee Chair", "Vivian Yenika Agbaw, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh, Committee Member", "On Cho Ng, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Taoism", "Daoism", "fantasy", "children literature", "Chinese philosophy", "Multiculturalism"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "MULTI-FIELD SIMULATION OF THE SPARK PLASMA SINTERING PROCESS\n", "id": "10790", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2314", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Spark plasma sintering (SPS), also known as field assisted sintering, plasma activated sintering, pulsed electric current sintering, pulsed discharge pressure sintering, and/or the current activated sintering, which belongs to a class of techniques that use electric current to make sintering easier, is the most widely used electrically assisted sintering nowadays, even though the fundamental understanding of the principle mechanisms of SPS are not well established.

Currently commercialized LIBs adopt graphite as anode for its long cycle life, abundant material supply, and relatively low cost. However, graphite suffers low specific charge capacity (372 mAhg\u22121), which is obviously insufficient for powering new generation electronic devices. Thus, considerable efforts are being undertaking to develop alternative anode materials with low cost, high capacity, and long cycle life. A variety of high capacity anode materials have been identified, and silicon (Si) stands as the leading candidate and has attracted much attention for its highest theoretical capacity (4200 mAhg\u22121). Nevertheless, inherent to the high-capacity electrodes, lithium (Li) insertion-extraction cycling induces huge volumetric expansion and stress inside the electrodes, leading to fracture, pulverization, electrical disconnectivity, and ultimately huge capacity loss. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the degradation mechanisms in the high-capacity anodes during lithiation-delithiation cycling is crucial for the rational design of next-generation failure-resistant electrodes.\n\tIn this thesis, a finite-strain chemo-mechanical model is formulated to study the lithiation-induced phase transformation, morphological evolution, stress generation and fracture in high capacity anode materials such as Si and germanium (Ge). The model couples Li reaction-diffusion with large elasto-plastic deformation in a bidirectional manner: insertion of the Li into electrode generates localized stress, which in turn mediates electrochemical insertion rates. Several key features observed from recent transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies are incorporated into the modeling framework, including the sharp interface between the lithiated amorphous shell and unlithiated crystalline core, crystallographic orientation-dependent electrochemical reaction rate, and large-strain plasticity. The simulation results demonstrate that the model faithfully predicts the anisotropic swelling of lithiated crystalline silicon nanowires (c-SiNWs) observed from previous experimental studies. Stress analysis reveals that the SiNWs are prone to surface fracture at the angular sites where two adjacent   facets intersect, consistent with previous experimental observations. In addition, Li insertion can induce high hydrostatic pressure at and closely behind the reaction front, which can lead to the lithiation retardation observed by TEM studies.\n\tFor a comparative study, the highly reversible expansion and contraction of crystalline germanium nanoparticles (c-GeNPs) under lithiation-delithiation cycling are reported. During multiple cycles to the full capacity, the GeNPs remain robust without any visible cracking despite ~260% volume changes, in contrast to the size dependent fracture of crystalline silicon nanoparticles (c-SiNPs) upon the first lithiation. The comparative study of c-SiNPs, c-GeNPs, and amorphous SiNPs (a-SiNPs) through in-situ TEM and chemo-mechanical modeling suggest that the tough behavior of c-GeNPs and a-SiNPs can be attributed to the weak lithiation anisotropy at the reaction front. In the absence of lithiation anisotropy, the c-GeNPs and a-SiNPs experience uniform hoop tension in the surface layer without the localized high stress and therefore remain robust throughout multicycling. In addition, the two-step lithiation in a-SiNPs can further alleviate the abruptness of the interface and hence the incompatible stress at the interface, leading to an even tougher behavior of a-SiNPs. Therefore, eliminating the lithiation anisotropy presents a novel pathway to mitigate the mechanical degradation in high-capacity electrode materials. \n\tIn addition to the study of the retardation effect caused by lithiation self-generated internal stress, the influence of the external bending on the lithiation kinetics and deformation morphologies in germanium nanowires (GeNWs) is also investigated. Contrary to the symmetric core-shell lithiation in free-standing GeNWs, bending a GeNW during lithiation breaks the lithiation symmetry, speeding up lithaition at the tensile side while slowing down at the compressive side of the GeNWs. The chemo-mechanical modeling further corroborates the experimental observations and suggests the stress dependence of both Li diffusion and interfacial reaction rate during lithiation. The finding that external load can mediate lithiation kinetics opens new pathways to improve the performance of electrode materials by tailoring lithiation rate via strain engineering. Furthermore, in the light of bending-induced symmetry breaking of lithiation, the mechanically controlled flux of the secondary species (i.e., Li) features a novel energy harvesting mechanism through mechanical stress.\n\tBesides the continuum level chemo-mechanical modelings, molecular dynamics simulations with the ReaxFF reactive force field are also conducted to investigate the fracture mechanisms of lithiated graphene. The simulation results reveal that Li diffusion toward the crack tip is both energetically and kinetically favored owing to the crack-tip stress gradient. The stress-driven Li diffusion results in Li aggregation around the crack tip, chemically weakening the crack-tip bond and at the same time causing stress relaxation. As a dominant factor in lithiated graphene, the chemical weakening effect manifests a self-weakening mechanism that causes the fracture of the graphene. \n\tMoreover, lithiation-induced fracture mechanisms of defective single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. The variation of defect size and Li concentration sets two distinct fracture modes of the SWCNTs upon uniaxial stretch: abrupt and retarded fracture. Abrupt fracture either involves spontaneous Li weakening of the propagating crack tip or is absent of Li participation, while retarded fracture features a \u201cwait-and-go\u201d crack extension process in which the crack tip periodically arrests and waits to be weakened by diffusing Li before extension resumes. The failure analysis of the defective CNTs upon lithiation, together with the cracked graphene, provides fundamental guidance to the lifetime extension of high capacity anode materials.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9574], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Hui ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sulin Zhang", "Sulin Zhang", "Charles E Bakis", "Long Qing Chen", "Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sulin Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Chair", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lithium-ion battery", "Anode materials", "Chemomechanical modeling", "Diffusion", "Orientation-dependent interfacial mobility", "Fracture"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "User Centered Design of Visual Analytics and its Applications in Healthcare", "id": "23590", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10661", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the era of big data, healthcare practitioners are increasingly generating and analyzing data. The huge volume of data provides opportunities for evidence based medicine to answer research and practical questions, and for individuals to make better informed, smarter decision. Yet, making sense of massive healthcare datasets remains a fundamental challenge. \nIn order to make inferences on the data, an effective visual representations of the data is needed. We propose visualization as a means to derive inferences on healthcare data. Design of visual analytics tools, therefore, becomes important in the healthcare domain. Healthcare is a broad area involving users with high variation in roles, expertise, and background. The diverse characteristics of users and their shifting contexts makes it a challenge to process and to present healthcare data in appropriate visual representations that is directly relevant to the analytics tasks.\nWe advocate using the User-Centered Design (UCD) approach in designing and developing visual analytics tools in healthcare. The core research question is how a user centered approach should be adopted in designing visual analytics tools. We address the question by bringing the user centered design process and visual analytics process together, and by applying interdisciplinary methods, such as data mining, information visualization and network analytics. \nIn particular, the dissertation looks to three studies in the healthcare domain where practitioners follow UCD to design visual analytics in healthcare domain. We emphasis the role of user involvement in the entire iterative design lifecycle. The users spanning these studies include patients, physicians, nanomaterial scientists, biomedical professionals, and healthcare policy makers. \nThe three studies are:\n1. Developing a visual web-based tool called VisOSA to interpret and explore medical records of patients with sleep apnea. For physicians, the ClinicView provides an interactive tool to have an overview of the entire medical record of patients including anomalies, and therefore help with generating research hypothesis. For patients, the PatientView allows the lay individual - without any medical background - to understand their health conditions under treatment at a glance. We also defined medical dashboard in this study. We conducted a supporting quantitative behavioral research to examine the effect of multiple monitors on people\u2019s performance. Results suggested that the medical dashboard needs to be arranged as that the most important information is in a single screen. \n2. Studying the nanomaterial environmental impact (NEI) is a critical task in nano-health and safety. The information visualization module for NEIMiner is a visual analytic tool that can efficiently query and present large-scale bibliography meta-data, NEI characterizations and nanomaterial toxicity. It supports nanomaterial scientists and analysts to explore the concepts and relationships in studying nanomaterial toxicity and its impact on health. \n3. Translating research findings into effective clinical care is another overwhelming task. VATS is a scalable multi-scale visual analytical tool for advancing translational sciences. The system integrates the data of National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) funded projects and publications from NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORTER) and PubMed, and helps healthcare policy makers to understand the big picture of translational science and to evaluate the impact of NCATS funded projects through publicly available data sources.\nThrough these studies, we discuss how innovative visual analytics techniques and capabilities with help users understand and act on various type of data. The results and applications demonstrate what purposes visualizations are used for each problem, how the design and development team make decisions around datasets, and the different visual representations healthcare practitioners use to explore and gain insight of data. \nThe research contributions are (1) a joint model of UCD and visual analytics process that overcomes the design challenges, (2) a justification of how existing data mining and visualization techniques can be usefully combined to support analytics task in healthcare, (3) the approaches to integrate and enrich the dataset, and turn the data into reliable and provable information,  (4) the visual encoding and interaction mechanisms to present complex information, (5) three visual analytics system built are beneficial to healthcare community and society. \nThe design guidelines and recommendations generated from these studies are applicable to various domains.

Evidence suggests that inflammation is the causal mechanism of the adverse cardiovascular events in OSA as well as a biological factor that may cause everyday symptoms in adults with OSA. There is a paucity of research that identifies the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and OSA symptoms; there is also relatively known about the relationship between diurnal variation of inflammatory biomarkers and OSA symptoms such as sleepiness and fatigue. Even though OSA symptoms are prevalent in adults with OSA, not all patients with OSA express these symptoms. Therefore, studies exploring molecular signatures related to OSA symptom expression are needed. \nStudy Purpose: The primary aim of the study was to identify the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers, i.e., cytokines, and everyday symptoms in adults with OSA. Two secondary aims were also addressed; (1) to identify if there is a relationship between diurnal variation of inflammatory biomarkers and everyday symptoms in OSA, and (2) to explore symptom phenotype in OSA.\nTheoretical Framework: An adapted conceptual model that combines a physiological model of inflammation in OSA and the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms was developed to support this study. The theory addresses the diverse factors affecting multiple symptoms and the association between the factors and multiple symptoms in adults with OSA. \nMethods: A cross-sectional cohort study of adults with OSA (n=22) employed convenience sampling with strict inclusion/exclusion criteria for adults undergoing diagnostic polysomnography was conducted. Symptom questionnaires and blood samples were measured pre-sleep bout (8pm; Time 1) and post-sleep bout (6am; Time 2); objective sleep characteristics were measured by polysomnography. Cytokine plasma concentrations including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10(IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were measured by using a Luminex Human MMP 5-Plex Panel; C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured by using ELISA. Symptom measures included Stanford Sleepiness Scale (higher mean score=sleepier), Lee Fatigue and Energy Scale (higher fatigue score=more fatigue; lower energy score=less energy). Diurnal variation was calculated as (Time 2 \u2013 Time 1). Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney test, and Spearman's partial rank-order correlation adjusting for the confounding effects of age, body mass index (BMI), cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus were used. Cluster analysis for symptom phenotype exploration, used cosine similarity to measure the distances between symptom vectors and clusters were visualized with network graphs by using yED Graph Editor.  \nResults: The sample (n=22) was middle aged (49 \u00b1 17.12), overweight or obese, men and women. Most of the sample was non-Hispanic white (86.4%) and had mild OSA (68.2%). There was a significant difference between evening TNF-\u03b1 and morning TNF-\u03b1, with a higher level at post-sleep bout (p=0.0012). There were no significant relationships between each inflammatory biomarker and AHI or between diurnal variation of each inflammatory biomarker and AHI; however, there were significant relationships between diurnal variation of IL-6 and oxygen desaturation indices and between morning IL-6 and oxygen desaturation indices. Evening IL-6 was negatively correlated with evening energy level (r=-0.685, p=0.001); whereas, morning fatigue was positively correlated to both morning IL-8 and morning TNF-\u03b1 (r=0.582, p=0.021; r=0.453, p=0.05, respectively). Only IL-10 diurnal variation had a significant relationship with evening energy level. After removing outliers, the diurnal variation of IL-8 had a significant association with both morning fatigue and diurnal variation of energy level (r=0.548, p=0.03; r=-0.537, p=0.03, respectively). Two symptom clusters, momentary symptom cluster and lasting symptom cluster, were identified in adults with mild OSA.\nConclusions & Implications: Pre-sleep bout IL-6 was significantly associated with symptom expression in OSA; post-sleep bout IL-8 and IL-8 diurnal variation were correlated with morning symptoms. These findings may provide mechanistic insights for symptom management in OSA. The study findings highlight the importance of continued research for identification of the causal factor(s) of symptom expression in OSA. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14922], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Hyunju ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "first_name_ssi": "Hyunju", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amy M Sawyer", "Amy M Sawyer", "Judith E Hupcey", "Christopher Gerald Engeland", "Tonya Sharp King", "Xiang Gao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Amy M Sawyer, Dissertation Advisor", "Amy M Sawyer, Committee Chair", "Judith E Hupcey, Committee Member", "Christopher Gerald Engeland, Committee Member", "Tonya Sharp King, Outside Member", "Xiang Gao, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Obstructive Sleep Apnea", "Cytokine", "Inflammatory Biomarker", "Molecular Signature", "Symptom", "Sleepiness", "Fatigue", "Energy", "Symptom Phenotype", "Momentary Symptom", "Lasting Symptom"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The role of social capital at home and in school in academicachievement: The case of South Korea", "id": "28715", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12498", "abstract_tesi": "Using data from the Korean Educational Longitudinal Study of 2005-2007, the current study investigated the role of family and school social capital in students\u2019 academic achievement in South Korea.

Yet, nitrogen fertilizer is one of the most costly agricultural inputs, and inaccessible in sufficient quantities to low-input farmers. Conversely, excess application of fertilizer to maximize yields in intensive commercial operations has resulted in environmental damage and economic losses; an estimated 50% of applied nitrogen is not captured by crops, and contaminates ground water, creates hypoxic zones, or volatilizes as harmful greenhouse gases.\nMaize (Zea mays L.) is a dominant crop, with approximately 1 billion tons produced globally for food, fuel, and industrial uses per year.

Moreover, NK cells, including thymic NK cells, generated in the perinatal stage contribute to the skin immune system in adults. In addition, skin-homing ILCs can be generated in skin-draining lymph nodes (sLNs) of adults. Under homeostatic condition, ILCs are continuously activated in sLNs to acquire the expression of CCR10 for their localization into the skin. Foxn1 and Notch/ligands signals are involved in the induction of CCR10 expression on ILCs in fetal/neonatal thymi and adult sLNs for their skin localization. The generation of CCR10+ ILCs and their maintenance in the skin are dependent on T cell-regulated homeostatic environments and are suppressed under inflammatory conditions. Reciprocally, ILCs regulate the homeostasis of skin-resident T cells. My findings provide insights of mechanisms that regulate the establishment of innate lymphocytes in the skin and their cross-regulation with adaptive immune cells. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11089], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Jie ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Na Xiong", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Girish Soorappa Kirimanjeswara", "Yanming Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Na Xiong, Dissertation Advisor", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Girish Soorappa Kirimanjeswara, Committee Member", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["innate lymphoid cells", "skin-homing", "CCR10", "fetal thymic programming"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Measurement of Agreement for Categorical Data\n", "id": "7705", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3239", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Measurements of agreement are used to assess the reproducibility of a new assay or instrument, the acceptability of a new or generic process, methodology or method comparison.

With the upgrade and development of advanced power\nreactors, however, enhancing the nucleate boiling rate and its\nupper limit, Critical Heat Flux (CHF), becomes the key to the\nsuccess of external passive cooling of reactor vessel undergoing\ncore disrupture accidents. In the present study, two boiling heat\ntransfer enhancement methods have been proposed, experimentally\ninvestigated and theoretically modelled. The first method involves\nthe use of a suitable surface coating to enhance downward-facing\nboiling rate and CHF limit so as to substantially increase the\npossibility of reactor vessel surviving high thermal load attack.\nThe second method involves the use of an enhanced\nvessel/insulation design to facilitate the process of steam\nventing through the annular channel formed between the reactor\nvessel and the insulation structure, which in turn would further\nenhance both the boiling rate and CHF limit.\n\nAmong the various available surface coating techniques, metallic\nmicro-porous layer surface coating has been identified as an\nappropriate coating material for use in External Reactor Vessel\nCooling (ERVC) based on the overall consideration of enhanced\nperformance, durability, the ease of manufacturing and\napplication. Since no previous research work had explored the\nfeasibility of applying such a metallic micro-porous layer surface\ncoating on a large, downward facing and curved surface such as the\nbottom head of a reactor vessel, a series of characterization\ntests and experiments were performed in the present study to\ndetermine a suitable coating material composition and application\nmethod. Using the optimized metallic micro-porous surface\ncoatings, quenching and steady-state boiling experiments were\nconducted in the Sub-scale Boundary Layer Boiling (SBLB) test\nfacility at Penn State to investigate the nucleate boiling and CHF\nenhancement effects of the surface coatings by comparing the\nmeasurements with those for a plain vessel without coatings. An\noverall enhancement in nucleate boiling rates and CHF limits up to\n100% were observed. Moreover, combination of data from\nquenching experiments and steady-state experiments produced new\nsets of boiling curves, which covered both the nucleate and\ntransient boiling regimes with much greater accuracy. Beside the\nexperimental work, a theoretical CHF model has also been developed\nby considering the vapor dynamics and the boiling-induced\ntwo-phase motions in three separate regions adjacent to the\nheating surface. The CHF model is capable of predicting the\nperformance of micro-porous coatings with given particle diameter,\nporosity, media permeability and thickness. It is found that the\npresent CHF model agrees favorably with the experimental data.\n\nEffects of an enhanced vessel/insulaiton structure on the local\nnucleate boiling rate and CHF limit have also been investigated\nexperimentally. It is observed that the local two-phase flow\nquantities such as the local void fraction, quality, mean vapor\nvelocity, mean liquid velocity, and mean vapor and liquid mass\nflow rates could have great impact on the local surface heat flux\nas boiling of water takes place on the vessel surface. An upward\nco-current two-phase flow model has been developed to predict the\nlocal two-phase flow behavior for different flow channel\ngeometries, which are set by the design of insulation structures.\nIt is found from the two-phase flow visualization experiments and\nthe two-phase flow model calculations that the enhanced\nvessel/insulation structure greatly improved the steam venting\nprocess at the minimum gap location compared to the performance of\nthermal insulation structures without enhancement. Moveover,\ndepending on the angular location, steady-state boiling\nexperiments with the enhanced insulation design showed an\nenhancement of 1.8 to 3.0 times in the local critical heat flux.\n\nFinally, nucleate boiling and CHF correlations were developed\nbased on the data obtained from various quenching and steady-state\nboiling experiments. Additionally, CHF enhancement factors were\ndetermined and examined to show the separate and integral effects\nof the two ERVC enhancement methods. When both vessel coating and\ninsulation structure were used simultaneously, the integral effect\non CHF enhancement was found much less than the product of the two\nseparate effects, indicating possible competing mechanisms (i.e.,\ninterference) between the two enhancement methods.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3103], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Jun ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung", "Horacio Perez Blanco", "Stefan Thynell", "John Harlan Mahaffy", "Dhushy Sathianathan", "H Joseph Sommer Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Chair", "Horacio Perez Blanco, Committee Member", "Stefan Thynell, Committee Member", "John Harlan Mahaffy, Committee Member", "Dhushy Sathianathan, Committee Member", "H Joseph Sommer Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CHF", "two-phase flow", "microporous coating", "boiling heat transfer enhancement techniques", "downward facing boiling", "nucleate boiling"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Reliability and Aging in Patterned Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 Films ", "id": "13519jxy194", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13519", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research was targeted at understanding how and why aging and reliability are influenced by lateral feature size in PZT thin films patterned by ion beam milling and reactive ion etching. \nLead zirconate titanate, PZT thin films (with Zr/Ti ratios of 52/48) were grown on a  PbTiO3 seed layer and patterned into feature sizes of 100 \u03bcm, 50 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm using argon ion beam milling. It was found that as the pattern dimensions decreased, the remanent polarization increased, presumably due to the fact that the ferroelectric polarization near the feature perimeter is not as severely clamped to the substrate. It is believed that clamping at the film/substrate interface produces deeper wells that prevent some fraction of the spontaneous polarization from switching at high field. The dielectric nonlinearity in the serpentine patterned PZT thin films was described using the Rayleigh law at modest ac electric fields. Both Rayleigh parameters (\u03b5init and \u03b1) increased with decreasing serpentine line width after recovery annealing. It was observed that \u03b5init of 500 mm square patterns was 1510 \u00b1 13; with decreasing serpentine line width, \u03b5init  rose  from 1520 \u00b110 for the 100 \u03bcm serpentine to 1568 \u00b1 23  for the 10 \u03bcm serpentine. The irreversible parameter, \u03b1, for the square patterns was 39.4 \u00b1 3.2 cm/kV and it increased to 44.1 \u00b1 3.2 cm/kV as the lateral dimension is reduced. However, etched patterns also aged more rapidly. Based on this, it was concluded that sidewall damage produces shallow wells that lower the Rayleigh constants of aged samples at small fields. These observations are consistent with a model in which shallow wells can be overcome by the large fields used to measure the remanent polarization and the large unipolar electric fields typically used to drive thin film piezoelectric actuators.\n \t\n600nm thick PZT (52/48) thin films were also patterned into squares and antenna-shapes with feature sizes of 10 \u03bcm, 8 \u03bcm, 5 \u03bcm, and 2 \u03bcm using a reactive ion etching process. The effect of feature size on  (1) highly accelerated lifetime tests (HALT), (2) the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, and (3) the property stability as function of time using Rayleigh measurements was then investigated.  HALT measurements were made at temperatures ranging from 120 oC to 180 oC and electric fields ranging from 100 kV/cm to 225 kV/cm. The characteristic time to failure t50 increased with decreasing feature size. The activation energy for all feature sizes were 0.82eV ~ 1.1eV; the range of voltage acceleration factors for all feature sizes was 3.4 ~ 5.2. It is hypothesized that the sidewall and the bulk of the film both contribute to the observed feature size dependence of the median time to failure and activation energy in patterned PZT thin film. HfO2 was deposited using ALD to minimize sidewall damage such as dangling bonds on the etched surfaces. After ALD coating, the lifetime of all features sizes increases because the sidewall damage is partially recovered without significant changes in the activation energies. \nI-V data were measured at temperatures ranging from 50oC to 150oC to investigate possible conduction mechanism. The most reasonable fits were obtained using a Schottky emission model.\nTo investigate the aging mechanisms for patterned PZT films, Rayleigh measurements were conducted as a function of time. Two methods were used to obtain preferred polarization states in the ferroelectric. First, patterned PZT films were exposed to a dc bias (poling); secondly, films were poled at elevated temperature to promote alignment of defect dipole complexes. Both poled and hot poled samples have loops that are shifted negatively along the electric field axis due to development of the internal field. Thermal poling at 150 oC reduced aging rates to ~ 0.6  %/decade for \u03b5init and 1.1 %/decade for \u03b1.  In contrast, the aging rate of unpoled samples were ~ 1.3  %/decade for \u03b5init and ~1.8 %/decade for \u03b1 value. Also, all feature sizes showed the same trend; \u03b1 / \u03b5init decreased rapidly over short time scales (on the order of 1-150 seconds) and then gradually decreased at longer time. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13692], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Jung In", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "In", "first_name_ssi": "Jung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry", "Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ferroelectric", "Reliability", "Aging", "HALT", "Conduction mechanism", "Patterned PZT thin film"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Development Of A Numerical Model Applicable To Dual Porosity Hydrocarbon Reservoirs With Complex Well Structures", "id": "23587", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10584", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multilateral drilling and completion technology has been developed and widely applied in hydrocarbon reservoirs.

Treatment with LY294002 restored transcriptional activation of HIV and IL-2 by YFFY and FYYF, consistent with the role of PI3K in negative regulation of CD28 signals.  Comparative analysis of CD28 tyrosine mutations revealed redundant signals by Y188, Y191 and Y200 that cooperate to counterbalance negative regulation by Y173.  Taken together, these data confirmed negative regulation of CD28 signaling by Y173-associated PI3K and the requirement of Y188 and Y191 in addition to Y200 to overcome this signaling restriction.\nThe multifunctional HIV-1 protein Nef possesses several motifs that interact with signaling molecules in infected T cells.  In order to determine whether Nef influences T cell activation, cells were infected with Nef-positive and Nef-negative clones of HIV.  CD28 expression and changes in tyrosine phosphorylation were monitored.  We observed no Nef-dependent changes in CD28 expression or function.  However, infection with Nef-positive virus led to changes in tyrosine phosphorylation.  This Nef-induced phosphorylation was observed in unstimulated cells, and c-Cbl was identified as one of the proteins whose phosphorylation was upregulated by Nef.  Furthermore, Lck is required for Nef-mediated c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation.  These results suggest that Nef modifies T cell signaling in the absence of T cell receptor engagement and co-stimulation.\nIn summary, these results demonstrate that efficient activation and replication of HIV is subject to constraints imposed by the requirements of T cell signaling, including regulation by CD28 signals.  In adapting to these constraints, HIV has evolved means to manipulate the property of T cell activating signals, potentially to maximize viral response to activating stimuli.  Deeper understanding of the interplay of this two aspects of HIV life cycle will provide us with insights not only in the strategy of viral replication, but also in the mechanism of gene regulation by T cell activation.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5008], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Polung ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Polung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Avery August", "Richard John Frisque", "Biao He", "Brian Wigdahl"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "Biao He, Committee Member", "Brian Wigdahl, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "CD4+ T cells", "signal transduction", "CD28", "Nef", "Cbl", "PI3K", "tyrosine phosphorylation", "transcription"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Measuring Technical Efficiency in Agricultural Extension Services", "id": "22510", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10245", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With rapid technological advances in the second half of last century, the increasing dependence on science-based agriculture has placed greater importance on the fast and efficient transfer of the advanced knowledge to farmers. For most of countries, without an efficient agricultural sector, a country is severely constrained in its ability to feed itself and in consuming other goods and its development.\n\nAgricultural extension is one of the most common forms of public support to enhance the agricultural productivity. With costs rising, limited resources available, decreasing proportion of agricultural sector in the economy and changes in the prevailing philosophy of the appropriate extent of government intervention, it becomes more imperative to improve the performance of agricultural extension.\n\nOur research focuses on quantifying these changes brought up by agricultural extension. Existing literature on this quantification work on agricultural extension is scarce and inconclusive. Measuring the technical efficiency in a variety of fields has achieved rapid progress via the newly adopted econometric toolboxes; however, the corresponding work in agricultural extension failed to keep in pace. One particular aspect that has been overlooked in agricultural extension literature is the possibility of sample selectivity.\n\n\nGiven the public goods nature of agricultural extension, one should distinguish between the two production processes that are involved. In the first stage, an intermediate output is produced using only discretionary inputs (i.e.,variable and controllable by the decision making unit). In the second stage, final outcomes are determined by the level of the intermediate output and by environmental (i.e.,fixed) variables.\n\n\nIn quantifying the technical efficiency levels present at the farm level, we extend the existing framework on measuring technical efficiency to account for sample selectivity. Stochastic production frontier approach with accommodations for sample selectivity is used to measure technical efficiency and technical efficiency scores of individual farm. In addition, we test for sample selectivity from the statistical causal effect perspective.\n\n\nAn empirical study is conducted based on this extended framework and some hypothesis testing of our interest will be done as well. Our study confirms the existence of sample selectivity from both econometrical and statistical approaches. Efficiency scores are calculated based on our econometrical estimation procedure. Comparisons between farms receiving and those not receiving extension visits are made. We find that there is no significant difference in the level of technical efficiency between these two types of farms. However, farms receiving the extension services have higher productivity level than those not receiving extension services. This finding is consistent with the existence of sample selection. Farms' herd behavior, debt/asset ratio and education level are identified as possible sources of sample selectivity. We also reinforce the conclusion of the existence of sample selectivity following causal inference approach. Several matching algorithms are conducted. Similar conclusions are drawn as in the econometric approach.\n\n\nAt the macro level, a static game theoretic model with incomplete information adapted from mechanism design is developed to characterize the interactions among all participants in the two production processes. Extension agents are assumed to have up to three different types characterized by productivity levels. The government's objective is to maximize social welfare by setting up a truth-telling mechanism subject to a set of constraints. Equilibrium results and policy implications are discussed. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze the interactions of the government, extension agents and farms using game theoretic model. A simulation study is conducted to learn the comparative statics, which is based on the two nonlinear equation systems provides us insight into the impact of productivity difference among agents on economic variables of our interest.\n\n\nBased on our study, policy implications can be multi-fold. At the micro level, policy makers should alleviate the possible influence of sample selection in farm's choices of extension services. Several instruments identified in our analysis including educational level, debt status can serve for such a purpose. At the macro level, we establish a solid foundation that government should be less involved in specific production process of extension service. Our findings are consistent with the decreasing resource allocation to agricultural sector and the increasing financial, human resource input by nongovernment organization and many other private sectors. In addition, the different reaction patterns to the changes in relative productivity may guide policy makers to design mechanisms suitable to different types of extension agencies. In particular, the different price reaction curves to the change in relative productivity may be studied so that extension agencies charger different prices to different farm types. In this case, the true demand rather than the demand distorted by sample selectivity can be more accurately identified.\n\n\nFollowing future research is of our particular interest. Our estimation of stochastic production frontier function is limited due to data availability in several aspects. In particular, farm types are classified as receiving and not receiving extension services. The exploration may go deeper if we can further distinguish between private and public extension service provision. Increasing the number of individual farms in our data set would make it possible to compare the performance of private extension services to that of public extension services.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9928], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Qiong ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qiong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou", "Spiro E Stefanou", "Stephan J Goetz", "Edward C Jaenicke", "Debashis Ghosh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou, Dissertation Advisor", "Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Chair", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Member", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Member", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["agricultural extension", "stochastic production frontier", "technical inefficiency", "agricultural extension"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Reinvestigation of causal effects of Right Heart\ncatheterization: a matching approach", "id": "22760", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10246", "abstract_tesi": "Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) is a common procedure applied in critically ill patients.

Although there is no absolute clinical contradiction with the use of RHC, its effect has not been statistically validated using randomized controlled trials due to the lack of randomized data. Instead, studies on RHC have been using observational data to quantify its causal effect, which should be taken with caution because of the issues in estimating true causal effect in observational studies.\nIn my study, I reinvestigate the causal effect of RHC on subsequent survival using observational data and several multivariate matching schemes including nearest neighbor matching, optimal matching, full matching and genetic matching. Data for the study is from the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT), with a total of 5735 subjects.\nOur study has three main findings. First, RHC increased the risk of dth30, after controlling for the observed confounders under each of the four matching schemes, which coincides with earlier studies using SUPPORT data. Second, the\nMonte Carlo simulation experiment conducted in our analysis suggests that our conclusion on the causal effect of RHC is robust because: 1) The bias, defined by the difference between true and estimated causal effect, is small with acceptable variance; 2) Our simulation results are robust to a variety of specifications on additivity and/or linearity in the relationship between confounders and the treatment indicator. However, for the case where strong nonlinearity is present, the model performance is not as good as in other scenarios.

Unfortunately, 12.5 million children (>17%) are overweight in the United States today and the majority of these youngsters are not getting their recommended dose of physical activity daily. Furthermore, research shows that American teenagers are spending a lot more time in front of TV\u2019s and computers than being physically active and 87% of 8 to 17-year-old children play video games at home. The problem is, other than organized sports, physical education classes and occasional after school programs there are not many alternative and enjoyable opportunities for children to obtain the recommended 60 minutes of MVPA daily. However, alternatives such as exergames (video fitness games) are gaining popularity, may have the potential to help our nation\u2019s obesity crisis if properly implemented. Exergames require physical activity and moving your body as the controller rather than a traditional hand-held game controller. Purpose: The purpose of these studies was to determine the differences of time spent in MVPA, energy expenditure, ratings of perceived exertion and enjoyment while playing three fitness video games (XaviX tennis, EyeToy Kinetic, and Dance Dance Revolution).  Methods: A series of studies was conducted on 23-27 adolescents ranging from 14 to 18-years-old from a community health center in Northeastern USA. Participants played each of the three games for at least fifteen minutes consecutively on the first day and up to an hour on three separate occasions. Participants wore a heart-rate monitor and Sensewear Armband, and at the end of each session they reported their level of enjoyment and perceived exertion. Analysis: Using separate one-way repeated-measures ANOVAs on game conditions, differences were determined for duration, percentage of time spent in MVPA, perceived exertion, energy expenditure, and across five motives for physical activity (enjoyment, competence, fitness, appearance, social). Correlation analyses and Bland Altman plots were conducted to compare energy expenditure data from heart rate monitors and Sensewear Armbands. Results: Of the 27 participants that completed the studies, 82.5% were Non-Hispanic White, 14.9% were Non-Hispanic Black, and 3.7% were Hispanic of any race. All participants, ten females and 17 males, completed all portions of the protocol that was approved by the university\u2019s Institutional Review Board.  Study 1: ETK elicited a significantly higher mean heart rate, percentage of time spent in MVPA, and level of enjoyment. Both ETK and DDR were perceived to be more strenuous than XVT; Study 2: Given up to sixty minutes to play, ETK was played the longest, elicited the highest mean MVPA and was enjoyed the most. XVT recorded the lowest RPE and participants rated fitness a reason why they played ETK more than XVT; Study 3: Across all games and conditions (phase 1 vs. phase 2), ETK was consistently played at higher intensities (calories, calories per minute). In comparing calories and calories per minute measured by heart rate monitor and Sensewear Armband, Pearson correlation coefficients determined strong associations in Phase 2, and Bland Altman plots showed good agreement in the assessment of calories for both Phases.  Conclusion: All three exergames were played at moderate to vigorous intensity levels, and were found to be enjoyable despite higher levels of perceived exertion. The SenseWear ArmBand ws also found to be a comparable device to measure calories and calories per minute while playing exergames. The exploration to use exergames to decrease sedentary time and assist community leaders, educators, and parents in providing healthy alternative programming is suggested.\u2003", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8106], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Stephen Peter", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "Peter", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Jean Bopp", "Melissa Jean Bopp", "Karl Maxim Newell", "Linda L Caldwell", "Robert Scott Kretchmar", "David E Conroy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Jean Bopp, Dissertation Advisor", "Melissa Jean Bopp, Committee Chair", "Karl Maxim Newell, Committee Member", "Linda L Caldwell, Committee Member", "Robert Scott Kretchmar, Committee Member", "David E Conroy, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["exergame", "energy expenditure", "video game", "physical education", "kinesiology", "exertion", "exercise", "physical activity", "MVPA"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "MICROFLUIDIC DEVICES FOR ON-LINE MONITORING OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT PROTEINS DURING CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS PROCEDURES", "id": "7090", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6038", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It is well known that cardiac surgery induces systemic inflammatory responses, particularly when cardiopulmonary bypass procedures are used. \nThus, it is crucial to develop a system which can measure inflammatory responses in a continuous, real time fashion because it will allow physicians or clinicians to understand the relationship between systemic inflammatory responses and cardiopulmonary bypass procedures. \nThe goal of this study was to produce core technologies for the development of a microanalytical system, which can separate blood plasma from whole blood and measure inflammatory responses in a continuous fashion. \nThroughout this dissertation, two independent microfluidic devices are discussed.

One limitation of the existing tagging SNP selection algorithms is that they assume the reported genotypes are error-free. However, genotyping errors are often unavoidable in practice. Recent studies have demonstrated that even slight genotyping errors can lead to serious consequences with regard to haplotype reconstruction and frequency estimation. In this thesis, we present a tagging SNP selection method that allows for genotyping errors. Our method is based on the pair-wise r2 tagging SNP selection algorithm proposed by Carlson et al. We modified the standard EM algorithm in Carlson\u2019s method to incorporate genotyping errors, in an attempt to obtain better estimates of the haplotype frequencies and r2 measure. Through extensive simulation studies we compared the performance of our algorithm with that of the original algorithm. We found that the number of tags selected by both methods increased with increasing genotyping errors, though our method led to smaller increase. The power of haplotype association tests using the selected tags decreased dramatically with increasing genotyping errors. The power of single marker tests also decreased, but the reduction was not as much as the reduction in power of haplotype tests. When restricting the mean number of tags selected by both methods to be similar to the baseline number, Carlson\u2019s method and our method led to similar power for the subsequent haplotype and single marker tests. Our results showed that, by incorporating random genotyping errors, our method can select tagging SNPs more efficiently than Carlson\u2019s method.

A composite approach can either greatly enhance the performance of ferroelectric materials or induce emerging properties and phenomena which expands the range of its applicability. Through microstructure design, performances of ferroelectric composites and heterostructures can be optimized for multiple applications. This dissertation focuses on theoretical understandings of various properties of ferroelectric composites and heterostructures by employing a phase-field model. \nMagnetoelectric coupling is a phenomenon in which a material exhibits a polarization response to an applied magnetic field. We formulate a phase-field model coupled with constitutive equations to investigate the magnetoelectric cross-coupling in magnetic/ferroelectric composites. The model allows us to obtain static piezoelectric, piezomagnetic, dielectric, and magnetoelectric properties under a given magnetic or electric field, from the local distributions of polarization, magnetization, and strain in the composites. As an example, effective magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, i.e., magnetic-field-induced voltage output (or changes in polarization), of the CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 composites is numerically calculated. Influences of the phase connectivity and the phase fraction of the composites on the magnetoelectric coupling coefficient are discussed.\nWe further develop a phase-field model to study the local elastic coupling between magnetic and ferroelectric domains that show one-to-one pattern match. A multiferroic layered heterostructure of Co0.4Fe0.6/BaTiO3 is considered. Kinetics of the local elastic coupling is investigated by simulating the time-dependent electric-field-driven changes in local magnetization/polarization/strain distributions and by comparing the associated velocities of the magnetic and ferroelectric domain walls. It is found that the electric-field-driven magnetic domain evolution manifests itself as an alternating occurrence of local magnetization rotation and coupled motion of magnetic and ferroelectric domain walls with almost identical velocities.\nThe electrocaloric effect is a phenomenon in which a dielectric material absorbs or releases heat in response to an applied electric field. An anomalous negative electrocaloric effect in ferroelectric/relaxor composites showing cooling upon applying an electric-field pulse without subsequent heating, is studied by applying a phase-field model. Evolution of domain structure and changes in dipole ordering upon applying the electric field pulse is simulated. It is revealed that coexistence of the normal ferroelectric phase and the ferroelectric relaxor phase in the composite enables stability of two distinct remnant states with ordered and disordered dipoles, respectively. Application of an electric field switches the composite between ordered and disordered states and induces the anomalous electrocaloric effect. The dependence of the electrocaloric cooling temperature and overshooting phenomena on operating temperature is simulated and discussed.\nApplying an ultrafast stimulus to a ferroelectric material allows one to explore possible new transient phenomena or new metastable domain patterns that may emerge during the relaxation from its excited state to its original or a new equilibrium state. In this work, we develop a phase-field model for understanding and predicting the dynamical responses of both ferroelectric and ferroelastic domain patterns under ultrafast electrical, thermal, mechanical, and optical stimuli, with advanced numerical algorithms for solving the governing dynamical equations.  As an example, the nanoscale and mesoscale domain dynamics of BaTiO3 crystals under certain types of ultrafast stimuli were investigated. We demonstrate domain dynamics under an external local heat pulse with a combined characteristic of thermal conduction and polarization dynamics under pyroelectric effect. We predict possible deterministic 180\u00b0 ferroelectric domain switching through the application of ultrashort mechanical stimuli. We further reproduce experimentally observed laser-pulse-induced domain dynamics with distinct responses determined by both the orientation and the location of the domains. Mesoscale mechanisms of ferroelectric domain and domain wall responses, as well as intrinsic lattice vibrations, are revealed. The theoretical insights on ultrafast domain dynamics will provide useful guidance for manipulating dynamic functionalities of ferroelectric materials.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16546], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Tiannan ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "first_name_ssi": "Tiannan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Long-Qing Chen", "Long-Qing Chen", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Sulin Zhang", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Long-Qing Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Long-Qing Chen, Committee Chair", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ferroelectric materials", "ferroelectric composites", "materials modeling", "phase-field model"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "STUDY OF ACTIVE ROTOR CONTROL FOR IN-PLANE ROTOR NOISE REDUCTION ", "id": "13357twy5044", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13357", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research consists of two parts: the main part of this research is the study of active rotor control for in-plane rotor noise reduction.

Health disparities exist along several social dimensions such as gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Among them, somewhat less attention has been paid to geographic health disparities. In contrast to urban places, rural areas are characterized by lower insurance coverage rates, fewer health service facilities, and unfavorable socioeconomic conditions. However, these disadvantages do not translate into higher death rates. Rather, the mortality rates are lower in rural than urban areas \u2013 constituting a puzzle known as the \u201crural paradox.\u201d\n\tThere are three shortcomings in the literature on residential mortality differentials: 1) underdeveloped conceptualization and measurement of rurality, 2) a lack of a spatial perspective and attention to spatial dependency, and 3) incomplete attention to the array of possible determinants of the rural paradox. By addressing these issues, a more nuanced measure of rurality and four mediators between rurality and mortality are employed \u2013 population composition, social capital, internal inequality, and environmental hazards. Rurality is further divided into three dimensions: \u201cdenseness,\u201d \u201cexogenous economic integration\u201d (EEI), and \u201cfarming, fishing, and forestry industries\u201d (FFF). Methodologically, not only is the traditional analytic approach (ordinary least squares) explored, but also four other spatial modeling techniques are used: spatial error, spatial lag, mixed, and the conditional autoregressive method. An overall comparison among these methods is also provided. \n\tBy analyzing county level data in the contiguous U.S., the following conclusions are reached. First, the effect of rurality on mortality differs by dimensions. EEI and FFF confirm the rural paradox, but denseness has a countervailing effect on mortality. Second, the exploratory spatial data analyses show a strong spatial clustering of mortality in the U.S.The Black Belt, Appalachia, Mississippi Valley, and Delta Region comprise the high mortality zone. The Midwest, Great Plains, and the U.S.-Mexico border region have relatively low mortality rates. Third, controlling for environmental hazards, denseness has a beneficial impact on mortality, which follows the intuitive expectation that urban residents benefit from better social conditions and other health-related services. Fourth, social capital and environmental hazards could explain the influence of FFF on mortality, though FFF still has a statistically significant effect in the full model. Fifth, population composition could partially account for EEI\u2019s adverse impact on human health. Sixth, inequality shows a non-linear and unfavorable effect on mortality but could not help to explain the rural paradox. Seventh, spatial modeling techniques are necessary for ecological studies of mortality because they outperform the traditional method with respect to model fit and predictive ability. Finally, residence still matters because the rurality effects on mortality could not be fully explained by the four mediators. However, a clearer picture of the rural paradox is depicted.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6302], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Tse-Chuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tse-Chuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leif Jensen", "C Shannon Stokes", "Diane K Mc Laughlin", "Murali Haran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leif Jensen, Committee Chair", "C Shannon Stokes, Committee Member", "Diane K Mc Laughlin, Committee Member", "Murali Haran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["inequality", "environmental hazards", "social capital", "health disparity", "mortality", "rurality"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Status Seeking and Product Type on the Purchase of Luxury Goods and Luxury Experiential Services", "id": "15259", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7571", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Given the unprecedented growth of the luxury hospitality market in the past decade, gaining a deeper understanding of the differences between luxury goods and luxury experiential services, as well as luxury consumers\u2019 buying behaviors in different consumer groups, has become increasingly important. Based on extant studies on luxury consumption and cultural capital theories, this dissertation examines the consumption-related need for status and establishes a negative relationship between cultural capital levels and status consumption motives.\n\nIn addition, building on the luxury 4P typology, identity signaling approach, and status consumption theories, this dissertation investigates the joint effects of consumer group and product type on luxury consumers\u2019 divergence intentions. Using less affluent mimickers to trigger potential out-group influences, this dissertation reveals that Parvenus are more likely to change their attitudes toward their favorite luxury goods brands than experiential services brands after less affluent mimickers have adopted the same consumption object, whereas Patricians experience equal change toward the two types of product brands.\n\nThis dissertation also lends support to the theory of Experience Recommendation and suggests that consumers seeking to advance their happiness prefer luxury experiential services to luxury goods. Moreover, the results of this dissertation reveal that compared to Patricians, Parvenus are less likely to choose luxury experiential services to advance their life happiness.\n\nThe results of this dissertation provide several important managerial implications for luxury practitioners. Knowing that people with higher cultural capital levels tend to be less likely to seek conspicuous products, luxury marketers can use cultural capital indices to segment their luxury markets more precisely and customize their product offerings in different segments. Meanwhile, this dissertation suggests that luxury experiential services are more resistant than luxury goods to affluent consumers\u2019 attrition as a result of downward market extension, therefore luxury experiential services companies may find it easier to expand to less affluent markets than their luxury goods competitors. In addition, luxury experiential services companies that mainly attract Parvenus may promote cultural activities among their customers in order to cultivate their cultural capital levels, encouraging their consumers to purchase luxury experiential services. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7506], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Wan ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Hotel, Restaurant, and Institutional Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anna S Mattila", "Anna S Mattila", "David Allen Cranage", "Hubert Van Hoof", "Harry Zinn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anna S Mattila, Dissertation Advisor", "Anna S Mattila, Committee Chair", "David Allen Cranage, Committee Member", "Hubert Van Hoof, Committee Member", "Harry Zinn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["luxury consumption", "identity signaling", "cultural capital", "status consumption", "experiential services", "experience recommendation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "TRANSITION METAL CATALYZED BIOMASS CONVERSION AND POLYMER SYNTHESIS \n\n", "id": "11267", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6563", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I have mainly worked on two areas during my graduate study in Dr. Ayusman Sen\u2019s group.

As one of the most advanced fuel cell technologies, hybrid fuel cell power plant has shown its potential for applications and is already under commercialization. A hybrid fuel cell with gas turbine power plant was envisioned as a base-load power source for distributed generation. As an emerging technique, the need of advanced control systems, which are essential components that guarantee reliable and efficient operations for the power plant, has motivated this investigation.\n\nThis dissertation seeks to develop an intelligent control system to improve the energy conversion efficiency and the reliability of the hybrid fuel cell power plant. Toward this goal, an intelligent overall control system is established in the dissertation by developing and integrating a hybrid plant model, an optimal reference governor, and a fault diagnosis and accommodation system in the comprehensive control system. The hybrid plant model provides a novel modeling method that combines a mathematical model and a neural network model, which can identify plant parameters and uncertainties from operational data and can considerably improve the model accuracy for the following and future analysis and research work. The optimal reference governor is achieved by particle swarm optimization algorithms and a neural network state estimator to generate optimal setpoints and feedforward controls to improve plant efficiency. A nonlinear multi-objective optimization framework is developed by integrating heuristic optimization and artificial neural network technologies. Meanwhile, a fault diagnosis and accommodation system is implemented with fuzzy logic to detect and regulate system faults, preventing instabilities and damages to the power plant during system failures. The capability of the fuzzy theory in detecting and regulating system faults is demonstrated.\n\nThe individual control systems are finally integrated into a comprehensive system that provides overall management for the hybrid power plant. With the integrated control system, the power plant can have high energy conversion efficiency in normal operations and can be well regulated during system failures. As a result, an intelligent autonomous control system is achieved to perform high quality plant-wide control, by which both efficiency and reliability can be guaranteed. Moreover, the presented intelligent control system and its design approach are not only valid for the hybrid fuel cell power plant, but also capable of other types of power plants, where efficiency and reliability need to be improved and guaranteed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6626], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Wenli ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenli", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kwang Yun Lee", "Kwang Yun Lee", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Robert M Edwards"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kwang Yun Lee, Dissertation Advisor", "Kwang Yun Lee, Committee Chair", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member", "Robert M Edwards, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["optimization", "system modeling", "hybrid power plant", "fuel cells", "Control systems", "fault diagnosis and accommodation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION OF ACTIVATED CARBON AIR CATHODE  TOWARDS SCALE UP APPLICATIONS OF MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS", "id": "bk128989j", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12946", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "   Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are emerging technologies that produce bio-electricity from inorganic and organic wastes. Air cathodes used in MFCs need to have high catalytic activity for oxygen reduction, but they must also be easy to manufacture, inexpensive, and watertight. Several different approaches were used here to improve air cathode performance, and reduce water leakage. A low cost poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) phase inversion coating was developed as a cathode diffusion layer (DL) to improve power. A maximum power density of 1430 \u00b1 90 mW m\u20132 was achieved at a PVDF-HFP loading of 7.1 mg cm\u20132 (4:1 polymer:carbon black), with activated carbon as the oxygen reduction cathode catalyst. This power density was 31% higher than that obtained with a more conventional platinum (Pt) catalyst on a carbon cloth (Pt/C) cathode with a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) diffusion layer (1090 \u00b1 30 mW m\u20132). The improved performance was due in part to the larger oxygen mass transfer coefficient of 3 \u00d7 10\u20133 cm s\u20131 for the PVDF-HFP coated cathode, compared to 1.7 \u00d7 10\u20133 cm s\u20131 for the carbon cloth/PTFE-based cathode. The diffusion layer was resistant to electrolyte leakage up to water column heights of 41 \u00b1 0.5 cm (7.1 mg cm\u20132 loading of 4:1 polymer:carbon black) to 70 \u00b1 5 cm (14.3 mg cm\u20132 loading of 4:1 polymer:carbon black). This new type of PVDF-HFP/carbon black diffusion layer could reduce the cost of manufacturing cathodes for MFCs.\n   A simple one-step, phase inversion process was used to construct an inexpensive cathode using a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder and an activated carbon catalyst. The phase inversion process enabled cathode preparation at room temperatures, without the need for additional heat treatment, and it produced for the first time a cathode that did not require a separate diffusion layer to prevent water leakage. MFCs using this new type of cathode produced a maximum power density of 1470 \u00b1 50 mW m\u20132 with acetate as a substrate (28 mL reactor), and 230 \u00b1 10 mW m\u20132 with domestic wastewater (130 mL reactor). These power densities were similar to those obtained using cathodes made using more expensive materials or more complex procedures, such as cathodes with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder and a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) diffusion layer, or a Pt catalyst. Even though the PVDF cathodes did not have a diffusion layer, they withstood up to 1.22 \u00b1 0.04 m of water head (~12 kPa) without leakage, compared to 0.18 \u00b1 0.02 m for cathodes made using PTFE binder and PDMS diffusion layer. The cost of PVDF and activated carbon ($3 m\u20132) was less than that of the stainless steel mesh current collector ($12 m\u20132).  PVDF-based AC cathodes therefore are inexpensive, have excellent performance in terms of power and water leakage, and they can be easily manufactured using a single phase inversion process at room temperature.\n   Applications of MFCs will require cathodes that are highly resistant to water leakage. This can be accomplished by using a better diffusion layer even with cathodes relatively resistant to water leakage, but the materials must be inexpensive. To improve the resistance of the cathode to leakage, a hydrophobic PVDF membrane synthesized using a simple phase inversion process was examined as an additional low cost ($0.9/m2), carbon black free DL that could prevent water leakage at high pressure heads compared to a more expensive PTFE/carbon black DL ($11/m2). The power density produced with a PVDF (20% ,w/v) DL membrane of 1400 \u00b1 7 mW/m2 was similar to that obtained using a wipe DL [cloth coated with poly(dimethylsiloxane)]. Water head tolerance reached 1.9 m (~19 kPa) with no mesh supporter, and 2.1 m (~21 kPa, maximum testing pressure) with a mesh supporter, compared to 0.2 \u00b1 0.05 m for the wipe DL. The elimination of carbon black from the DL greatly simplified the fabrication procedure and further reduced overall cathode costs.\n   While the PVDF membrane was shown to be a useful DL, a method was needed to integrate the DL into the cathode structure. A hot pressing method was used to bind the PVDF DL onto the air side of the activated carbon cathode, and additional catalyst layers were added to improve performance. Cathodes pressed at 60 \u00b0C produced a 16% higher maximum power density of 1630 \u00b1 10 mW m\u20132 than non-pressed controls (1400 \u00b1 7 mW m\u20132). Cathode performance was further increased to 1850 \u00b1 90 mW m\u20132 by catalyst stacking, through the addition of an extra catalyst layer (CL), which better utilized the available surface area of the stainless steel mesh (SS) current collector. The use of one stainless steel current collector and two catalyst layers (SS/2CLs) produced more positive cathode potentials compared to other designs (SS/CL or 2SS/2CL). Low materials costs and high power production for MFCs using these cathodes could enable more cost effective power production using MFCs.\n   To improve oxygen reduction kinetics of the cathode catalyst, an iron-nitrogen-carbon co-catalyst was incorporated into activated carbon (Fe-N-C/AC), resulting in a nearly four electron transfer, compared to a two-electron transfer for plain activated carbon (AC). With acetate as the fuel in 200 mM phosphate buffer solution, the maximum power density was 4.7 \u00b1 0.2 W m\u20132, which is higher than any previous report for an air-cathode MFC. With domestic wastewater as a fuel, MFCs with the Fe-N-C/AC cathode produced up to 0.8 \u00b1 0.03 W m\u20132, which was twice that obtained with a platinum-catalyzed cathode. The use of this Fe-N-C/AC catalyst can therefore substantially increase power production, and enable broader applications of MFCs for renewable electricity generation using waste materials.\n   Long-term operation of MFCs can result in substantial degradation of AC air-cathode performance. In order to examine a possible role in fouling from natural organic matter in water, cathodes were exposed to high concentrations of humic acids. Cathodes treated with 100 mg L\u20131 of humic acids did not exhibit any significant change in performance. Exposure to 1000 mg L\u20131 of humic acids, which increased the mass of the cathodes by ~5% (14 \u00b1 2 mg of organic matter per cathode), decreased the maximum power density of the MFCs by 14% (from 1310 \u00b1 30 mW m\u20132 to 1130 \u00b1 30 mW m\u20132). Total cathode resistance increased by 30% (from 57 \u03a9 to 74 \u03a9) for cathodes treated with 1000 mg L\u20131 of humic acids, primarily due to an increase in the diffusion resistance (from 32 \u03a9 to 50 \u03a9), based on resistance components measured using electrochemical impendance spectroscopy. The adsorption of the humic acids decreased the total surface area by 12% (from 520 m2 g\u20131 to 460 m2 g\u20131), suggesting that the main impact of the adsorption of organic matter was due to pore blockage. Minimization of external mass transfer resistances using a rotating disk electrode reduced the impact of organic matter adsorption to only a 5% reduction in current, indicating about half the impact of the humics was associated with external mass transfer resistance and the remainder was due to internal resistances. Rinsing the cathodes with deionized water did not restore cathode performance. These results demonstrated that humic acids could contribute to cathode fouling, but the extent of power reduction was relatively small in comparison to the large mass of humics adsorbed.

A central hypothesis of our research is that genetic variability and differential regulation of EPHX1 in human tissue are likely important determinants of interindividual responsiveness, resulting toxicities, and carcinogenicity outcomes related to chemical exposures. Our laboratory has demonstrated that the expression of the human EPHX1 gene is driven by the use of alternative promoters. An alternative promoter region, termed the E1-b promoter, is localized ~ 18.5 kb 5\u2019-upstream from the structural region of the EPHX1 gene. The E1-b promoter is used exclusively to drive expression of EPHX1 mRNA transcripts in most tissues, along with a more proximal and highly liver-specific E1 promoter. Results of quantitative Real Time-PCR analyses demonstrated that the E1-b variant transcript is preferentially and broadly expressed in most tissues, such that it accounts for the majority of total EPHX1 transcript in vivo. In the studies conducted within this thesis research, detailed analysis of the E1-b promoter region demonstrated that this upstream EPHX1 promoter is replete with transposable elements. Further, we identified that two specific Alu elements are polymorphic (i.e. some chromosomes carry the two Alu insertions, whereas other do not) in the genome structure of different individuals. Results of luciferase gene reporter assays conducted in several human cell lines with E1-b promoter constructs demonstrated that the inclusion of the Alu (+/+) insertion significantly decreases basal transcriptional activities. Although we identified a putative aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding motif within the Alu element structure, expression of human EPHX1 in an in vitro system was only modestly responsive to AhR ligands and we conclude that AhR regulation does not associate with the presence/absence of Alu elements. Two non-synonomous genetic polymorphisms that alter the EPHX1 amino acid structure were identified in our laboratory\u2019s previous research efforts and several epidemiologic investigations have now implicated these EPHX1 coding region polymorphisms as a risk factor for lung cancer. In this study, using haplotype block analyses, we determined that the E1-b polymorphic promoter region was not in linkage disequilibrium with two previously identified non-synonomous SNPs in the coding region or with functional SNPs previously identified in the proximal promoter region of the gene. \nModulation of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes by chemopreventive agents is a promising strategy offering protection against toxicity mediated by certain chemical carcinogens. In this research, we discovered that in human cells, EPHX1 mRNA and protein expression were regulated tissue-specificaly by the potent chemopreventive agent, sulforaphane. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that Nrf2/ARE pathway plays a central role in sulforaphane\u2019s modulation of EPHX1. In the HepG2 cell line, co-expression of Nrf2 was found to activate EPHX1 promoter activity. However, in BEAS-2B cells, the presence of Nrf2 suppresses the EPHX1 transcriptional expression. A novel E1-b\u2019 transcript was further identified in this research and our results suggest that upstream open reading frames existing in the EPHX1 gene transcripts may function to regulate translational efficiency of EPHX1 expression. In summary, the investigations contributed by this research have substantially expanded our knowledge of the genetics and complex transcriptional regulation of EPHX1; and, given the significant association between EPHX1 genetic polymorphisms and lung cancer risk, highlight the chemopreventive potential of targeting EPHX1 as a defense against carcinogens. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6695], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Xi ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Curtis John Omiecinski", "Curtis John Omiecinski", "Robert Paulson", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Adam Bleier Glick", "Joshua D Lambert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Curtis John Omiecinski, Dissertation Advisor", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Adam Bleier Glick, Committee Member", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chemopreventive", "Microsomal epoxide hydrolase", "polymorphism"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Sulfation Behavior of Calcium-based Sorbents under Oxy-combustion Conditions at High Pressures", "id": "27429", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11795", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Oxy-combustion, combustion in oxygen without nitrogen, has already been used to reduce fuel consumption and emissions to advance clean coal combustion technologies for electrical power generation. The same system can also use limestone and dolomite to capture SO2. Therefore, fluidized-bed oxy-combustion at high pressures is now being explored to produce and sequester a pure stream of CO2 as flue gas in an attempt to design zero-emission power plants. Sulfation of limestones typically occurs in two stages\u2014calcination and then sulfation. Previous studies have shown that when the partial pressure of CO2 in a system is higher than the equilibrium pressure, direct sulfation of limestones without the calcination step occurs. However, the mechanism for this process is not clear. In oxy-pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC), the effects of CO2/O2 ratio (CO2 partial pressure), sorbent petrography, and MgCO3 are not well documented and need to be understood in order to properly design a PFBC combustor. The primary objective of this study was to compare the sulfation degrees of three different sorbents at pressurized and atmospheric conditions and to elucidate the mechanism for higher sulfation degrees under direct sulfation. The effect of CO2/O2 ratio on sulfation was also investigated. Sulfation tests on two limestones (Graymont and Michigan) and one dolomite (Ohio) were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 870 \u00b0C at higher pressure (8 bar) and at atmospheric pressure under typical oxy-combustion conditions. The reactor was equipped with a continuous gas analyser to monitor CO2, SO2, and O2. The decomposition study of the sorbents was carried out using hot-stage X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) for in-situ observation, simulating the phase changes during the heating process of each sorbent in the reactor. Further, a fixed-bed reactor was designed to use higher amounts of sample than a typical thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) so that subsequent analyses could be performed on the samples to understand the mechanism. Typically, a TGA uses 5-20 mg of sample. In this fixed-bed reactor, however, approximately one gram of sample was spread in a boat to reduce mass transfer effects. The degree of sulfation of the sulfated samples was determined using XRD technique, and the grain sizes of crystallites were also determined by XRD analysis. The cross-sections of the sulfated sorbents were then observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and elemental maps were taken by coupling energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The effects of petrographic characteristics, sulfation pattern, CO2 partial pressure, and total pressure were then analysed and correlated. \nHot-Stage XRD analysis conducted at atmospheric pressure showed that under a pure CO2 environment, CaCO3 did not decompose between 200 and 900 \u00b0C, whereas CaMg(CO3)2 started to decompose to CaCO3, MgO, and MgCO3 at 650 \u00b0C. The sulfation results showed that the conversion increased with an increasing CO2/O2 ratio at any given pressure, and a higher conversion was observed at high pressure than that at atmospheric pressure for a given gas composition. Further, prediction of the sulfation patterns based on petrographic characteristics agreed with the SEM results. Sulfation patterns are categorized as network, core-shell, and uniform based on the way sulfur is distributed throughout the particles. For a given sorbent, the patterns were the same under both the pressurized system and the atmospheric system. However, under the same experimental conditions, the patterns were different for different sorbents. Therefore, sulfation pattern was correlated with the petrographic characteristics of each sorbent, independent of the chemical reaction.\n Graymont limestone had the lowest conversions among all three sorbents for a given condition. With a network-dominated sulfation pattern, increasing the CO2/O2 ratio improved the conversion of Graymont limestone more effectively than increasing the total pressure. Dolomite had a uniform dominated sulfation pattern and showed the highest conversions both at high pressure and at atmospheric pressure. The S/Ca ratios across the cross-sections were higher for the sorbents that have a higher conversion. The similar trend of S/Ca ratios across the cross-sections and conversions suggested that high pressures improved the conversions by increasing sulfur penetration depth in the particles with a core-shell sulfation pattern. Another interesting observation in this study was that the CaMg2(SO4)3 phase was found in Michigan limestone and in two sulphated dolomite samples at high pressure, indicating that Mg actually participated in the sulfation process at high pressure. Thermodynamic equilibrium simulations using FactSage\u2122 confirmed that the formation of CaMg2(SO4)3 was controlled by the ratio between SO2 and Mg, which increased with the pressure. This phase has not been reported in previous sulfation literature; however, further experiments are needed to fully study the mechanisms of the formation of CaMg2(SO4)3\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11255], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Xiaojing ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaojing", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sulfation", "limestone", "dolomite", "oxy-combustion", "fluidized-bed", "pressurized-systems", "sulfation", "calcination", "SEM", "petrographic"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Investigating the roles of primary cilium in Gli protein activation and Hedgehog signaling pathway using Sufu/Gli ciliary recruitment system", "id": "14719xzy112", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14719", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is crucial for various developmental processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell migration.

To implement BMA, we select two different modeling scenarios: exchangeable and non-exchangeable members. We term the BMA postprocessing with exchangeable members BMAx. To compare the postprocessors, as part of our experimental setting, we use 24-h precipitation accumulations and lead times of 24- to 120-h. As the study area, we select the middle Atlantic region (MAR) of the United States (US). In contrast with previous postprocessing studies, we consider here a wider range of forecasting conditions (e.g., the effect of spatial pooling, training length, lead time, precipitation threshold, and seasonality) when evaluating BMA and HCLR. Additionally, BMA and HCLR have not yet been compared against each under a common and consistent experimental setting. \nTo implement BMA and BMAx, we use a sliding window of 25 days and train each GEFSRv2 cell separately, as opposed to using spatial pooling. These training conditions were selected by carefully examining the skill of forecasts associated with different window lengths and number of cells. To compare and verify the postprocessors, we use the BSS, CRPSS, and reliability diagrams, conditioned upon the forecast lead time, precipitation threshold, and season. Overall, we find that HCLR tends to outperform BMA/BMAx but the differences among the postprocessors are not as significant. Also, BMA and BMAx behave similarly across lead times and seasons, iv thereby indicating that the GEFSRv2 members remain indistinguishable across lead times. The improved performance of HCLR over that of BMA seems related to the ability of HCLR to include the ensemble variance as a predictor.

In this thesis, I present a simulation study with SimRoot, a functional-structural plant model, with the goal of testing the hypothesis that CCS, CCFN, and their interactions with root cortical aerenchyma (RCA), may be useful adaptations to limited soil N, P and K availability. Interactions of CCS and CCFN with lateral root branching density (LRBD) and elevated atmospheric CO2 are simulated with limited N, P and K availability. The combination of CCS and CCFN increases the growth of simulated maize up to 105%, 106% or 144% respectively under limited N, P or K availability. Interactions among CCS, CCFN and RCA result in additive benefits of up to 135%, 132% and 161% under limited N, P or K. Under low phosphorus and potassium availability, increased LRBD approximately doubled the utility of CCS and CCFN. The utility of CCS and CCFN is stable as atmospheric CO2 concentration doubled, but decreases as atmospheric CO2 further increased. Our results support the hypothesis that CCS, CCFN, and their interactions with RCA could increase nutrient acquisition by reducing root respiration and root nutrient demand. CCS and CCFN enhance growth via better establishment of the root system and accumulating early stage benefits. Phene synergisms may exist between CCS, CCFN and LRBD.

Cyclic hydrocarbons will consequently play a more significant role in combustion devices. However, understanding of the oxidation of cyclic hydrocarbons lags behind the transition and few cyclic compounds have been studied in depth.  In this work, five cyclic hydrocarbons, methylcyclopentane (MCP), cyclohexane (CH), methylcyclohexane (MCH), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin), and decahydronaphthalene (decalin), are studied in a motored CFR octane rating engine with controlled extent of oxidation. The focus is on low temperature oxidation and autoignition behavior which is critical to combustion processes in internal combustion engines. Reactions are conducted at constant engine speed (600 rpm), intake pressure (~ 1 bar), and equivalence ratio (0.25). Compression ratio and engine intake temperature are adjusted to control the reaction extent.\nBy analyzing stable reaction intermediates from engine exhaust gases, global reactivity and oxidation chemistry are revealed. Molecular structure exerts a profound effect on low temperature oxidation reactivity. Decalin is the most reactive compound whose oxidation increases monotonically with increased temperature and pressure. MCH is more reactive than CH, but both show clear negative temperature coefficient behavior in that the fuel conversion decreases with increased temperature and pressure. MCP and tetralin exhibit little low temperature reaction before critical conditions for autoignition are reached. Octane numbers of these compounds correlate with the trend of low temperature reactivity but do not correlate with the trend of critical compression ratios or engine intake temperatures. Increasing reaction temperature inhibits low temperature reactivity and promotes NTC behavior. Except for decalin, low temperature oxidation of cyclic hydrocarbons releases little chemical energy and results in negligible change in engine cylinder pressure and temperature. Decalin is the only compound showing two-stage ignition. \nQualitative conformational analysis is conducted to understand how the cyclic structure affects the reactivity in low temperature oxidation. It is revealed that the hydrogen distribution and rigidity of the chair form cyclohexane ring significantly limited (1,5) H-shift during isomerization of fuel peroxy radicals (ROO&#61599; &#8594; &#61599;QOOH), the key step in low temperature chain branching. Such H-shift can only proceed via an axial peroxy group abstracting an axial hydrogen. Also important is the degeneracy of (1,5) isomerization of fuel peroxy radicals, i.e. the number of hydrogens available to (1,5) H-shift for a given peroxy group. The number of axial hydrogens in decalin, MCH, CH, and tetralin is 10, 6, 6, and 4, respectively. Decalin has also four equatorial hydrogens available for (1,5) H-shift. Degeneracy in (1,5) H-shift for decalin, MCH, CH, and tetralin is 3~4, 2~3, 2, and 1, respectively. These numbers explain the low temperature reactivity of these compounds observed in the experiment. The higher reactivity of MCH than CH is due to the equatorial preference of the methyl group which forces the peroxy group to stay at an axial position and facilitates (1,5) H-shift. These qualitative conclusions are supported by ab initio quantum mechanical calculations being performed outside this work. \nDetailed products analyses reveal that ring dehydrogenation to form conjugate olefins \u2014 the olefins of the same molecular structure as the fuel compound but with one C=C bond \u2014 is a common and major reaction channel among cyclic hydrocarbons in pre-ignition reactions. The amount of conjugate olefins formed correlates with reactivity in low temperature oxidation: less reactive compounds produce more olefins. This is the direct result of the cyclic steric structure. The cyclic structure limits the (1,5) isomerization channel for peroxy radicals which alternatively abstract hydrogens on adjacent carbons via (1,4) H-shift to form conjugate olefins.  It is also noted that CH and decalin produce similar amounts of propene relative to ethene, while the methyl substitution in MCP and MCH promotes the production of propene relative to ethene.  In these experiments, over 84% of fuel carbon is recovered in the products of MCP, CH and MCH, while carbon balance is not obtained with tetralin and decalin due to the high boiling point. Nevertheless, major oxidation products, in particular, those of similar structure to the fuel molecule, are identified for all the compounds. Primary oxidation mechanisms are constructed adopting the new understanding from conformational analysis. For MCP and MCH, yields of conjugate olefin isomers are exploited to derive the percentage of fuel peroxy radicals converted into these olefins. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6799], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Fuel Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Thomas Litzinger", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Sarma V Pisupati"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Dissertation Advisor", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Chair", "Thomas Litzinger, Committee Member", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gas chromatography", "conformational analysis", "low temperature oxidation", "combustion kinetics", "cyclic hydrocarbons", "motored engine"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Towards Compromise Resilient Wireless Sensor Networks", "id": "10957", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6883", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sensor networks are envisioned to be powerful and economical solutions for both civilian and military applications, because of their capability and flexibility built on top of low-cost and small-size sensors. Meanwhile, sensor networks are also targets of all kinds of security attacks due to their extremely scarce resources and their unattended, hostile operating environment. Among all the potential attacks, insider attacks from compromised sensors are very challenging and difficult to be addressed. Compromised sensors have valid credentials, so that they can take part in the normal network operations and provide correct responses once challenged. My objective is to reduce or remove the possible damages that compromised sensors might bring to the network and further to identify and revoke those compromised sensors. In the literature, a lot of techniques have been proposed to achieve the above goal. I work on the following important issues that have not been well solved yet.\n\nFirst, I propose SDAP, a secure hop-by-hop data aggregation protocol for sensor networks. Data aggregation is a very important technique in sensor networks to reduce data redundancy and communication overhead during sensor data collection. SDAP can preserve the efficiency of the ordinary hierarchical hop-by-hop data aggregation and meanwhile provide high assurance on the trustworthiness of the final aggregation result, even though multiple compromised sensors may collude to trick the base station to accept bogus data from them.\n\nThen, I devise two distributed software-based attestation schemes to detect compromised sensor nodes, in which multiple neighbors of a suspicious node collaborate in a challenge-response process and make a joint decision regarding the trustworthiness of a suspicious sensor node in a distributed manner. The schemes only involve regular neighboring nodes and no trusted verifier or BS is included, so the attestation could be finished in a timely and distributed manner; also, they do not rely on response time difference to distinguish between a benign node and a compromised node, so the result is more accurate and reliable.\n\nLast but not least, I target on a potentially (if not the most) severe attack from compromised sensors, which is named sensor worm attack. We not only validate the possibility for worm attack to happen in sensor networks, but also propose an effective defensive scheme based on software diversity.

Those apps usually require data communications through wireless interfaces, which will drain the battery quickly. Thus, it is of great value to characterize the energy consumption of wireless communications and propose energy saving solutions. \n\nThe specific goal of this dissertation is to optimize the energy consumption of wireless communications on mobile devices. Specifically, this dissertation has four foci. First, we propose network quality aware prefetching algorithms to save energy for in-app advertising. The cellular interface on smartphones continues to consume a large amount of energy after a data transmission (referred to as the {\\em long tail problem}). Then periodically fetching ads through the cellular network may lead to significant battery drain on smartphones. To reduce the tail energy, we can predict the number of ads needed in the future and then prefetch those ads together. However, prefetching unnecessary ads may waste both energy and cellular bandwidth, and this problem becomes worse when the network quality is poor. To solve this problem, we propose network quality aware prefetching algorithms. We first design a prediction algorithm which generates a set of prefetching options with various probabilities, and then we propose two prefetching algorithms to select the best prefetching option by considering the effect of network quality. Second, we generalize the prefetching problem, where the goal is to find a prefetching schedule that minimizes the energy consumption of the data transmissions under the current network condition. To solve the formulated nonlinear optimization problem, we first propose a greedy algorithm, and then propose a discrete algorithm with better performance. Third, we consider the context information when offloading tasks for wearable devices. Considering the low energy consumption of the Bluetooth data transmissions, wearable devices usually offload computationally intensive tasks to the connected smartphone via Bluetooth. However, existing smartphones cannot properly allocate CPU resources to these offloaded tasks due to lack of context information, resulting in either energy waste on smartphones or high interaction latency on wearable devices. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware task offloading framework, in which offloaded tasks can be properly executed on the smartphone or further offloaded to the cloud based on their context, aiming to achieve a balance between good user experience on wearable devices and energy saving on the smartphone. Finally, we characterize and optimize Bluetooth energy consumption on smartwatches. Bluetooth is used for data communications between smartwatches and smartphones, but its energy consumption has been rarely studied. To solve the problem, we first establish the Bluetooth power model and then we perform an in-depth investigation of the background data transfers on smartwatches. We found that those data transfers consume a large amount of energy due to the energy inefficiency attributed to the adverse interaction between the data transfer pattern (i.e., frequently transferring small data) and the Bluetooth energy characteristics (i.e., the tail effect). Based on these findings, we propose four techniques to save Bluetooth energy for smartwatches.

Economics of these reservoirs are tied closely to the performance of multi-fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs), which is the most direct indicator of stimulation effectiveness. Thus, greater understanding and analysis of the factors affecting performance of MFHWs are critical for the efficient exploitation of such reservoirs. Hydrocarbon production data analysis (PDA) techniques have been commonly used to characterize hydraulic fracture (HF) and, ultimately, to evaluate hydraulic-fracturing jobs. Recent studies have shown that rate transient analysis of flowback data can also provide early insight into HF attributes. While PDA methods seek long-time production data, flowback analysis can be conducted using early water and gas production data obtained immediately after the completion of stimulation jobs. However, in comparison with the long-term hydrocarbon production period, the physics of the process is more difficult to capture during flowback production because of its short duration, at which one or more flow regimes may occur. In addition, the flowback flow system could be single- or two-phase, depending on reservoir type. According to reported field data, single-phase flowback can be observed in tight sands, but two-phase flow is expected in the case of shale gas. Although various mathematical models have been proposed to analyze single-phase (water) and two-phase (gas and water) flowback data, analytical models for interpretation of data are still at an early stage of development.  \nThe objectives of this study are first to reproduce the relevant analytical models available in literature and understand their advantages and limitations; then, to develop single-phase and two-phase analytical models capable of predicting HF attributes such as fracture half-length and fracture permeability using early water and gas production data. \nIn this study, a set of numerical simulations was conducted using CMG (IMEX) to examine the capacity of available mathematical models. It was found that most of the single-phase flowback models in the literature are accurate only under pseudo steady-state conditions, where a boundary-dominated flow regime with a constant production rate has been established. Another limitation of current models is that they can only estimate one fracture attributes: kf or xf. Knowing the shortcomings of current models, I developed a set of analytical models for both single- and two-phase systems, which were validated against numerical simulations. The single-phase model can closely estimate HF attributes, such as permeability and half-length under constant pressure as well as constant flowrate condition, for both transient and boundary dominated flow periods. Furthermore, I extended the developed single-phase model to variable bottomhole conditions by employing superposition principle. \nIn the case of two-phase flow system, I developed an analytical model under fracture depletion mechanism for both early gas production (EGP) and late gas production (LGP) periods. In the case of EGP, gas flux from matrix to HF is assumed to be negligible. Comparisons of numerical results with those obtained from the analytical model show that the developed two-phase model for EGP can accurately predict fracture attributes. In the case of LGP, a coupled model is developed to include the effect of gas influx from matrix to HF on flowback data, where a uniform pressure decline rate is assumed in fracture-matrix system. The two-phase model has the advantage of linear behavior of water properties and avoids the computational complexity. With typical Barnett shale properties input in the numerical simulation, the analytical model can accurately estimate fracture attributes within a 10% error margin. Sensitivity analyses of fracture conductivity and initial water saturation in fracture have been conducted to illustrate the validity of two-phase flowback model applied in LGP. The results reveal that, within the physical range of fracture conductivity and initial water saturation, the two-phase flowback model can accurately evaluate fracture attributes. However, the model is more accurate for cases with smaller fracture conductivity and higher initial water saturation in fracture. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15975], "author_name_tesi": "Yang, Yun ", "last_name_ssi": "Yang", "first_name_ssi": "Yun", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H", "Hamid Emami-Meybodi", "Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H, Thesis Advisor", "Hamid Emami-Meybodi, Thesis Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Flowback Analysis", "Rate Transient Analysis (RTA)", "Production Data Analysis (PDA)", "Fracture Characterization", "Two-phase Flowback Model", "Single-phase Flowback Model", "Shale Gas", "Tight Sand Gas"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "SPACES OF POLYNOMIALS RELATED TO MULTIPLIER MAPS", "id": "25171", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11373", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Let f be a complex polynomial of degree n.

Orobanchaceae is the only family containing species with the full spectrum of parasitic capabilities, including one nonparasitic autotrophic genus, Lindenbergia, and more than 90 genera (>2000 species) of parasites with varying degrees of photosynthesis and host dependence. To understand the genetic changes that led to a parasitic lifestyle, a transcriptome sequencing project was initialized to interrogate multiple stages of growth and development of three parasitic plants that span the range of parasitic dependence. Around 180 genes are upregulated during haustorial development following host attachment in at least two species, and these are enriched in proteases, cell wall modifying enzymes, and extracellular secretion proteins. The majority of parasitism genes were duplicated before the divergence of Orobanchaceae and Mimulus, a related nonparasitic plant. This suggests that gene duplication plays a role in the origin of parasitism. A comparative analysis of these genes\u2019 homologs in sequenced nonparasitic plant genomes revealed that parasitic plants make haustoria by co-opting genes from root and floral development. Gene duplication, often taking place in a nonparasitic ancestor of Orobanchaceae, followed by regulatory neofunctionalization, was an important process in the origin of parasitic haustoria. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), acts as another evolutionary force contributing to parasite adaptation. At least 42 gene families accounting for 52 transfers \u2013 largely via genomic integration - result in functional transcripts that were primarily involved in translation, defense responses, transposable element (TE), and other diverse roles. Three lines of evidence indicate an adaptive role of HGT in parasite evolution - (i) A majority of HGT genes are upregulated in haustoria-related tissues in the most parasitic Phelipanche aegyptiaca; (ii) A higher frequency of HGTs are observed in parasites with a higher degree of parasitism; (iii) A portion of genes detected to have evolved some adaptive sites under positive selection. The study of strigolactone (SL) pathway in parasitic plants reveals that parasitic plants still retain genes in SL synthesis. Two SL biosynthesis genes and D14 (the receptor) are upregulated in haustorial structures, indicating a possibility of SL in haustoria development.

Unfortunately, limited capability in process planning automation for six-axis WEDM requires significant process planning time and effort.\nThis research presents the development of a methodology and the associated algorithms for using WEDM as a subtractive rapid prototyping process. Specifically, an automatic process planning system is built for six-axis WEDM process. A boundary representation is used to model part geometry and the manufacturability of a part on a six-axis WEDM machine is addressed in this research as well. In particular, a stereolithography (STL) file is used as the input for the algorithms. Global tangent visibility, fabrication orientation, and the setup requirements and numerical control code are the output.\nSimilar to the importance of visibility analysis in the automation of the milling process planning, global tangent visibility analysis is the foundation in the automation of WEDM process planning. In this research, an algorithm to calculate the global tangent visibility for polyhedral computer-aided design (CAD) models was developed. A greedy algorithm is also developed to classify the global visibility results and to determine the setup plans for producible geometries on six-axis WEDM. Number of setup orientations is determined automatically for six-axis WEDM machines. A method to generate machine instructions automatically based on tangent visibility results and setup plans was also developed. In order to verify the methodology, a verification system is built; and several sample parts are fabricated.\n The methodology and algorithms developed in this research result in a systematic automatic process planning method for applying WEDM as a subtractive RM tool.

The dissertation is divided into six chapters and the contents of every chapter is briefly introduced as follows. \nChapter 1 introduces the motivation of the dissertation. Chapter 2 presents the synthesis and characterization of ZnO nanostructures for one-dimensional (1-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) systems. 1-D ZnO nanostructures\u2014ZnO nanowires\u2014were delivered by a rapid growth microwave-assisted vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid method. 3-D ZnO hierarchical nanostructures\u2014ZnO nanoforest\u2014were synthesized via a cost-effective hydrothermal method. The obtained ZnO nanoforest has the potential to break through the limitation of the surface areas of DSSC. Chapter 3 presents the synthesis and characterization of ZnO/TiO2 composite nanostructures. The discussions were focused on the density-controlled capability of ZnO nanorod arrays and the conformal shell coating of ZnO\u2013TiO2 core\u2013shell nanostructures which have the feasibility to provide a direct electron transport pathway for conventional TiO2 nanoparticles DSSC.

Moreover, a high open-circuit voltage is reported and the physical mechanism is discussed and verified with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Furthermore, the overall solar conversion efficiency can be improved by this nanocomposite photoelectrode.\nIn addition, radiation detection has been investigated during my Ph.D. studies. Chapter 5 demonstrates the standoff alpha radiation detection technique based on the physical mechanism of excited state absorption of air molecules. Both theoretical analysis and experimental verifications were conducted. The experimental results confirmed that the radiation could be detected at a 10 m standoff distance.\nChapter 6 summarizes the dissertation with two developed photoelectrodes with the improvement of surface areas and electron transport property for a high solar conversion efficiency of DSSC and proposes potential future works regarding to further enhanced the efficiency.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10667], "author_name_tesi": "Yao, Jimmy ", "last_name_ssi": "Yao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jimmy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shizhuo Yin", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Julio Urbina", "Qi Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shizhuo Yin, Dissertation Advisor", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "Qi Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanocomposite", "Nanoforest", "Dye-sensitized solar cell"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF CYTOSKELETON PROTEIN ACTIN IN SYNAPSE MATURATION AND PLASTICITY", "id": "7802", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3115", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Long-term synaptic plasticity, which is accompanied by both functional and morphological changes of synapses, may involve not only postsynaptic potentiation, but also presynaptic enhancement. Activation of postsynaptic silent synapses has been found to contribute significantly to long-term synaptic plasticity during early developmental stage of neurons. Postsynaptic silent synapses only show NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activity but not AMPA receptor (AMPAR) activity before the induction of LTP. Postsynaptic silent synapses are activated through NMDAR-dependent insertion of AMPARs to postsynaptic density. On the other hand, presynaptic silent synapses have also been found during recent years. Presynaptic silent synapses are likely due to very low probability of neurotransmitter release. However, not like postsynaptic silent synapses, the mechanism underlying activation of presynaptic silent synapses is not well understood.\n\nActin is an essential type of cytoskeleton protein which plays a vital role in synapse development and synaptic plasticity. Postsynaptically, actin filaments may undergo activity-dependent remodeling and play a critical role in the maintenance of LTP and stabilizing/destabilizing dendritic spines. In presynaptic terminals, actin filaments are surrounding synaptic vesicles and thus may regulate synaptic vesicle cycling. Moreover, activity-dependent presynaptic actin redistribution facilitates new synapse formation. In addition, actin was found to maintain synaptic integrity during neuronal development.\n\nThe main objective of this doctoral thesis was to address the functional role of the actin during the activation of presynaptic silent synapses and long-term synaptic plasticity. Here, I have shown that repetitive spaced stimulation induced long-term synaptic plasticity in immature but not mature hippocampal neurons. Functional FM imaging and retrospective immunostaining revealed a transition of presynaptic silent boutons into active ones in response to repetitive stimulation. Electrophysiology analysis and FM imaging indicated that the activation of presynaptic silent synapses may be triggered by L-type Ca2+ channel-mediated Ca2+ influx and is dependent on downstream PKA/PKC signaling cascades, but independent of postsynaptic NMDA receptors. Moreover, inhibition of actin polymerization prevented the activation of presynaptic silent synapses, whereas promoting actin polymerization facilitates the conversion of silent to active synapses. In summary, our data suggest that the activation of presynaptic silent synapses significantly contribute to the long-term synaptic plasticity during early developmental stage of rat hippocampal neurons, and actin polymerization plays an important role in regulating such presynaptic plasticity.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3104], "author_name_tesi": "Yao, Jun ", "last_name_ssi": "Yao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gong Chen", "Richard W Ordway", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Si Qiong Liu", "Pamela J Mitchell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gong Chen, Committee Chair", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Si Qiong Liu, Committee Member", "Pamela J Mitchell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["actin", "activity", "synaptic platicity", "presynaptic", "silent synapse", "hippocampus"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Automated analysis of composition and style of photographs and paintings ", "id": "19026", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8967", "abstract_tesi": "Computational aesthetics is a newly emerging cross-disciplinary field with its core situated in traditional research areas such as image processing and computer vision. Using a computer to interpret aesthetic terms for images is very challenging. In this dissertation, I focus on solving specific problems about analyzing the composition and style of photographs and paintings. First, I studied the problem of distinguishing van Gogh\u2019s paintings from his contemporaries. The application of rhythmic and spontaneous brushstrokes is a prominent trait for van Gogh\u2019s paintings. His unique brushstroke style is characterized by features calculated from automatically extracted brushstrokes. Statistical analysis on the extracted brushstroke features shows success in tackling real-world painting analysis tasks designed by art historians. Second, I explore the possibility of characterizing styles of paintings without visible brushstrokes, specifically artworks by Norval Morrisseau. Curve elegance measurements are used to differentiate authentic works from forgeries. Then, I present my studies on the topic of photography composition. Composition is closely related to the aesthetic qualities of images and a key factor that distinguishes professional photographs from snapshots. I design a spatial composition classifier to analyze the compositional properties for general photographs. A new integrated system is presented to render on-site photography feedback for users by retrieving high-quality exemplar photographs with similar compositions.\nUser studies substantiate the system\u2019s performance. Finally, I propose a dark-light re-composition algorithm to emulate the dodging and burning techniques used in darkroom photography. The algorithm performs region-wise intensity adjustments by utilizing the intensity distribution and the Notan structure of an exemplar. Overall, this dissertation studies computational approaches to the interpretation of artistic terms and explores potential applications in digital painting analysis, automatic photography feedback and photo enhancement.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8804], "author_name_tesi": "Yao, Lei ", "last_name_ssi": "Yao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Z Wang", "Jia Li", "David J Hall", "Xiaolong Zhang", "Patrick John Mc Grady"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Z Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jia Li, Dissertation Advisor", "David J Hall, Committee Member", "Xiaolong Zhang, Committee Member", "Patrick John Mc Grady, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["painting analysis", "photography composition", "photo enhancement", "image processing", "computer vision", "aesthetics inference"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Shrinkage Mitigation Strategies For Internally Cured Alkali-activated Slag Mortars", "id": "26449", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11553", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) is a by-product of iron manufacturing. When GGBFS is activated by an alkaline solution, calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), calcium aluminate hydrate (C-A-H) and calcium aluminate silicate hydrate (C-A-S-H) are formed, which provide similar compressive strength to hardened ordinary portland cement. Since the alkali-activated slag (AAS) can provide the binder phase in concrete, it can be used to replace up to 100% of portland cement in concrete. However, AAS concretes undergo significant shrinkage, which may cause a high risk of cracking and impede its industrial application. \nInternal curing, which provides internal water reservoirs and distributes the reservoirs inside the concrete, is proved to be an efficient curing method for concrete with low permeability. Porous lightweight aggregate with high absorption can be used as an internal curing agent. The application of lightweight aggregate to the portland cement concrete shows that it has a significant effect on reducing autogenous shrinkage and delaying drying shrinkage. However, there is little research about its application to AAS concrete.\nThe main objective of this research was to investigate the effect of internal curing with lightweight aggregate on AAS binders. The properties of AAS investigated included the autogenous shrinkage, drying shrinkage, setting time and compressive strength. Three lightweight aggregate contents (0%, 10% and 20% volumetric replacement of normal weight aggregate) and two types of slag (Grade 100 and Grade 120 slag) were studied. The activating solutions included two different concentrations of sodium hydroxide (2 molar sodium hydroxide and 4 molar sodium hydroxide) and the combination of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate with different concentrations (lower silica concentration and higher silica concentration). \nThe effect of lightweight aggregate on the setting time of AAS was found to be negligible, while the setting time increased with the decreasing content of Na2O and SiO2 and pH value. Lightweight aggregate significantly reduced the autogenous shrinkage of AAS, regardless of the type of slag and the type and concentration of the activators. The AAS mixtures internally cured by lightweight aggregate showed lower drying shrinkage and lower shrinkage rates in the early age, but in the long term, lightweight aggregate showed a negligible effect on drying shrinkage and shrinkage rate. Weight change of AAS mixtures in drying shrinkage experiment was higher with the higher content of lightweight aggregate, likely due to the fact that more water absorbed in the lightweight aggregate can be lost when the mixtures with higher content of lightweight aggregate are subject to drying environment. The effect of lightweight aggregate on the compressive strength of AAS depends on the type and concentration of activators and the grade of slag. The water absorbed in the lightweight aggregate may be released into the paste and affect the concentration of the activating solution, which ultimately affects the compressive strength of AAS.

Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an alternative to WBI, which significantly decreases the number of patient visits. In contrast to 16-36 doses of radiotherapy in WBI, APBI usually involves twice-daily treatments over 4-5 days. Three important issues related to BCS-related radiation therapy are the focus of this dissertation. First, factors underlying regional disparities in the receipt of radiation after BCS are not well understood. The second issue relates to a knowledge gap about the effect of treatment features on the probability of choosing a treatment among different alternatives. The third issue is the increasing use of brachytherapy APBI among early stage breast cancer patients without conclusive population-based evidence of clinical effectiveness.\nObjectives: This dissertation includes three related studies that each address a key question related to radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer: (1) What mechanisms underlie geographic variation in the omission of radiation therapy after BCS? (2) What are the effects of treatment characteristics on the probabilities of choosing various alternative local therapies for early stage breast cancer? and (3) What is the comparative effectiveness of brachytherapy ABPI versus WBI among elderly women after BCS?\nMethods: This dissertation analyzes data from SEER, SEER-Medicare, the Area Resource File, Medicare Local Coverage Determination database, and Census files. Cancer registry codes and Medicare claims codes were used to identify the study cohort and diagnosis and treatment information. Spatial exploratory data analysis, logistic regression, nested logit modeling, log-rank tests, Cox proportional hazards modeling, and instrumental variable analyses were used to address the research questions.\nFindings: The first study found that metropolitan patients living in counties that have WBI, AAPBI, or both services are more likely to omit radiation after BCS than other patients living in counties without radiation therapy facilities. Study 2 found that treatment alternatives with longer treatment and recovery times and longer travel distances are associated with decreased probability of being chosen. Alternatives recommended by guidelines and covered by Medicare are associated with increased probabilities of being chosen. Study 3 found that the risk of death in patients treated with APBI-Brachy was not significantly different from patients treated with WBI. Factors independently associated with an increased risk of death included older age, invasive cancer, tumor size greater than 2 cm, lymph node involvement, ductal histology, negative estrogen receptor status, undifferentiated tumor, the existence of comorbid conditions, and living in a census tract with median household income below the national median. Results from the instrumental variable analysis were similar to the results in the standard model (HR= 0.85; 95% CI, 0.36-2.01; p =0.70). \nConclusions and Implications: Taken together, the study findings suggest several conclusions. Improving the availability of radiation therapy services may not reduce regional disparities in the receipt of recommended radiotherapy among metropolitan women. Regarding use of specific types of radiotherapy, APBI will increasingly be used as an alternative for WBI if the availability of WBI and APBI resources increase and Medicare coverage of APBI improves, while only marginal improvement of adherence to adjuvant radiotherapy is likely to be achieved. Policymakers and researchers may want to focus more attention on examining new radiotherapies with shorter treatment and recovery time such as the one dose intraoperative radiotherapy. Finally, partial breast brachytherapy was not associated with inferior survival compared with whole breast irradiation in elderly breast cancer patients. This finding will eventually need to be confirmed by the ongoing phase III randomized trial; however this work supports the use of partial breast brachytherapy until such data are available. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8304], "author_name_tesi": "Yao, Nengliang ", "last_name_ssi": "Yao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nengliang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "Roger T Anderson", "Stephen Augustus Matthews", "John Raymond Moran Jr.", "Pamela Farley Short"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Dissertation Advisor", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Chair", "Roger T Anderson, Committee Member", "Stephen Augustus Matthews, Committee Member", "John Raymond Moran Jr., Committee Member", "Pamela Farley Short, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Radiation Therapy", "Breast Cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "HARD PRETZEL CHARACTERIZATION AND PROCESS OPTIMIZATION\n\n\n\n", "id": "6475", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4710", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Pennsylvania ranks first in the nation in the production of snacks including potato chips and pretzels with over 23 pretzel-manufacturing companies in Pennsylvania, that contribute significantly to the rural economy. Despite technical advances in hard pretzel production since the 1980s, which include several patents granted for new methods in hard pretzel manufacturing, very little research has been conducted with regard to raw materials and process conditions on pretzel shelf life and quality. Based on a previous research to understand the causes of pretzel breakage, research elaborated in this dissertation was initiated first to evaluate flour property variation used in hard pretzel manufacturing, and then progressed with the development of a statistical model for optimizing process parameters in an effort to enhance the quality and consistency of the product.\nSeetharaman et al (2004) reported that water played an important role in controlling hard pretzel breakage. Pretzel quality appeared to be a function of appropriate gluten development and starch gelatinization in the product. In investigating the causes for differences in pretzel qualities under similar levels of water addition, as is the practice in the industry, we evaluated the variation in flour properties received at various companies. Studies indicated that significant variations existed in flour properties. The properties of hard pretzels made by using flours with different protein contents indicated that hard wheat flour would produce a harder pretzel but would not affect the surface color of final product. However, soft wheat flour with a lower amount of damaged starch, low water absorption levels and lower water binding powers was found to be desired for making hard pretzels. The significant variations in flour properties revealed in this study suggest that a more thorough understanding of the effects of processing steps on the pretzel quality is necessary. \nSince obtaining flours with prescribed quality is not a practical consideration for small-sized, low profit-margin pretzel companies, research was launched to see if the variability in flour properties could be accommodated by manipulating process conditions. Therefore, a screening experimental design was used to identify critical processing parameters influencing pretzel quality. \nEleven process variables were selected and a two-level-eleven-factor (211) fractional factorial experimental design was used to screen a variety of process variables. Several responses were measured for dough before and after extrusion, for half-baked and fully baked pretzels. The responses selected are important indicators of consistency and quality during pretzel production. Results indicated that flour protein content, the amount of water added to make dough, and dough mixing time were important variables influencing dough behavior. Caustic concentration affected the brightness of half-baked pretzels but did not influence the color of final products. Baking time was the most important factor for both half-baked and final product quality. The hardness of fully baked pretzels was influenced by baking time, temperature in baking oven zone 1, drying time and drying temperature under the experimental conditions investigated in this study. A key observation of this study was that none of the raw material or dough processing parameters, within the range tested, influenced final pretzel quality as defined by pretzel moisture content, hardness or color. \nBased on the above results, four process parameters; baking time, temperature in baking oven zone 1, drying time and drying temperature, were further selected for optimization. Desirability Function Approach (DFA) was applied in optimizing multiple responses including moisture content, &#8710;Eab value and pasting time. Hardness was not included in the analysis since the model was not significant although the transformed model was significant. Although process parameters showed a significant effect on hardness of final products in screening experiment design, under the narrow range of values used in the optimization design, the four processing parameters did not show significant effects on pretzel hardness. The analysis of variance for the eight responses indicated that models developed did not show significant lack of fit except for color a* values. The models for moisture content, &#8710;Eab value and pasting time explained 99%, 87% and 91% of the variability, respectively. The coefficients of each response showed baking time had a significant effect on each response measured, while the other factors had a minor effect on the responses. Most of the interaction effects were not significant. The overall effect analysis of the four parameters on the responses also suggested that baking time had the most significant impact on all responses investigated among the four factors. Validation experiments results revealed that the two most important qualities of pretzel, moisture content and &#8710;Eab, can be reliably predicted, but pasting time was not predicted reliably. \nThe study showed that Response Surface Methodology was effective in producing predictive models and establishing relationship between processing factors and key responses of hard pretzel production. DFA was an effective and convenient multiple response optimization method in achieving different optimization goals.\nEffects of alkali cooking on starch, protein and color changes in products were also investigated in this study. Experiments were conducted in the laboratory to mimic reactions occurring on the pretzel surface and also in a pilot plant with products. \nSurface starch granules were gelatinized following treatment with alkali or water at 80\u201eaC, but the interior of the product was not gelatinized when treated with hot alkali or water at the pilot plant. Furthermore, the amylose-lipid complex dissociated even at low temperature of alkali treatment, but the dough hydration property did not show a significant increase until the temperature increased to 80\u201eaC.  Dough surface color after dipping was different but was not significantly different following baking when pigments were extracted from the flour. The results suggest that significant changes occur following treatment with alkali. The development of pretzel color could not be attributed to any pigments present in the flour but possibly is due to reactions within or between the starch or protein hydrolysis derivatives during baking.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4675], "author_name_tesi": "Yao, Ni ", "last_name_ssi": "Yao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ni", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Koushik Seetharaman", "John D Floros", "Richard K Owusu Apenten", "Joseph Irudayaraj"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Koushik Seetharaman, Committee Chair", "John D Floros, Committee Member", "Richard K Owusu Apenten, Committee Member", "Joseph Irudayaraj, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Drying", "Extrusion", "Flour", "Dough", "Screening", "Optimization", "Alkali", "Pretzel", "Baking"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "spatially dense 3d morphometric study of human craniofacial sexual dimorphism with respect to ancestry", "id": "22818", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10439", "abstract_tesi": "Numerous studies have found population variations in craniofacial traits and sexual dimorphism of the human face, but little research has been done to investigate the impact of ancestry on sexual dimorphism.  This thesis quantified the degree of sexual dimorphism across seven population samples (West African, East Asian, Irish, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and South Asian) and examined the inter- and intra-population sex variation patterns. A standard x, y, z coordinate system for 7,150 quasi-landmarks was applied to 3D faces of 3739 people aged from18 to 40. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduced the dimension to 44 feature variables explaining 98% of total variations. 773 individuals in the seven populations were extracted from the overall principal component (PC) space to be the focus of this study. MANOVA test on the scores of the top five PCs shows overall main effects of sex and ancestry (p-value = 0) and a sex*ancestry interaction term (p-value = 0). Univariate Two-way ANOVA further confirms the existence of main effects in every single PC (p value =0) and that interaction effect is present only in PC2 (p-value = 0.0017, family-wise alpha rate = 0.01). Then the levels of sexual dimorphism were calculated in two different ways: 1) as sex differences between averaged male- and female faces of a population group, illustrated by the visual patterns of sexual dimorphism between average faces; 2) as averaged individual sex differences, supplemented by intra-sex facial variability.  These sample estimates were computed using two distance methods, Mahanalobis and Root-mean-square error (RMSE). The ancestry differences in the expression of sexual dimorphism were discovered by generating the 95% bootstrap confidence intervals for the sample statistics from 10,000 bootstrap replicates, One-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons of unequal group means on the bootstrap distributions of sex distances. Lastly, the population groups are ranked based on their Mahanalobis and RMSE sexual dimorphism distance sample mean, bootstrap mean validated by ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s HSD test. We found that in the level of sexual dimorphism between consensus faces, East Asians rank the highest in both Mahanalobis and RMSE distance measures. Irish ranks the lowest in Mahanalobis distance, while West Africans rank the lowest in RMSE distance. When sexual dimorphism is calculated as the average individual face sex differences, East Asians rank the lowest and West Africans the highest in Mahanalobis distance, whereas West Africans rank the lowest and South Asians the highest in RMSE distance.

Traditional process design tools tend to be inflexible and can only support rigidly defined processes (e.g., order processing in the supply chain). This considerably restricts their real-world applications value, especially in the dynamic and changing environment. Recently, studies have contributed to the development of Adaptive Process Management Systems (APMS) that can facilitate fast implementation and deployment of business processes that allow for flexible adaptation. Most of them, however, only support ad hoc changes that require human intervention and only ensure structural correctness of these changes. This type of adaptation is time and effort consuming if such changes happen frequently. It is also difficult to trace and manage the sources of such changes so as to support automatic adaptation and improve reusability on the basis of past experiences. Furthermore, these approaches are not feasible in a knowledge-intensive environment because few of them examine semantic correctness of process changes. Hence, there is a need for new approaches that aim to design processes for flexibility and adaptability. \nThis dissertation introduces a new approach toward integrating context-awareness in process flexibility and adaptation to overcome these limitations. This dissertation centers around three main projects using principles of the design science methodology. First, we discuss the need of context-awareness in flexible process design and develop a formal approach to enable this design process. We propose to use an ontology-based method to model process contexts and Complex Event Processing (CEP) to detect critical situations. We also discuss the architectural support for context management. \nNext, we propose various adaptation strategies and integrate them at both process model and instance levels in a context-aware manner. Specifically, we developed a process template and rule-based approach, considering business contexts such organizational policies, to configure process models at design time. This can handle a larger number of process models with small variance and facilitate their management when business objectives change. At the instance level, we propose a placeholder-based approach to customize the subsequent workflow on the fly based on the dynamic contexts and case data at runtime. Since the context that impacts process instance adaptation is highly domain dependent, we describe this work in clinical settings in this dissertation. We proposed a framework called ConFlexFlow, and showed how flexible and adaptable clinical pathways can be designed taking into account medical knowledge in the form of rules and detailed contextual information to achieve a high quality outcome. These pathways are selected during workflow execution based on rules that encapsulate medical knowledge and the dynamic context at runtime. Thus, each process instance is customized to an individual patient case based on the patient data, resources availability, etc. \nThird, we propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model to check the compliance of process models and to validate the semantic correctness of process adaptations. We propose a formal specification language to model semantic constraints of activities, including presence and dependency relationships, ordering sequences, role assignment and obligations. Then the compliance issue is formulated as an MIP problem. We propose three novel ideas: the notion of a degree of compliance of a process, the concepts of full and partial validity of change operations, and the idea of compliance by compensation. Based on the above ideas, we use mixed-integer programming to check: (a) the semantic compliance of a process model and its evolution; and (b) if the ad hoc changes made to running process instances are semantically valid or not. If not, we calculate the minimal set of compensation operations needed based on degree of non-compliance, and transform a non-compliant process into a compliant one. We show that this novel approach is more elegant and superior to a pure logic-based approach.\nThroughout this dissertation, most of the examples are from the healthcare domain for illustration. Clinical workflow has been considered as a killing area for the application of process management technologies, due to its dynamic, complex and knowledge-intensive nature. We prove that our approach can improve the care quality by increasing the flexibility and adaptability of clinical pathways while ensuring its semantic correctness. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7433], "author_name_tesi": "Yao, Wen ", "last_name_ssi": "Yao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Hsien Chu", "C Lee Giles", "Heng Xu", "Akhil Kumar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Hsien Chu, Committee Chair", "C Lee Giles, Committee Member", "Heng Xu, Committee Member", "Akhil Kumar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["process flexibility and adaptation", "process variant", "context-aware design", "healthcare", "process compliance"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Bulk wave nonlinear acoustics evaluation of crept Inconel 617", "id": "23419", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10626", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The urgent demand for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM) systems for Next Generation Nuclear Power Plants accelerates the development of nonlinear acoustics for material characterization. Taking advantage of its high sensitivity to microstructure changes, the nonlinear acoustics method utilizes higher harmonic generation due to nonlinearity in structures to characterize microstructure damage prior to the development of macroscale damage. The very high temperature reactor (VHTR) is designed to survive up to 1000oC and last for 60 years. Inconel 617 is a primary candidate material for the VHTR. \nThe aim of this thesis was to use nonlinear acoustics approaches to evaluate microstructure changes in crept Inconel 617 specimens and compare them with microscopy results. Control mechanical creep tests were first conducted on seven Inconel 617 specimens. Then these seven specimens, as well as an additional uncrept specimen, went through experimental nonlinear acoustic bulk wave second harmonic measurements with the wave propagation direction along the loading axis. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were both used to characterize the microstructure degradation, such as microvoids, dislocations, grain refinements, and precipitation in the specimen. Last but not least, correlation between nonlinear acoustic response and microstructure degradation was analyzed and discussed.\nExperiment results show that the nonlinear parameter first increases and then decreases as creep strain to rupture life percentage grows, which correlates with microscopy observations of the precipitate distribution. Therefore, nonlinear acoustic measurements are more sensitive to precipitation in crept Inconel 617 than other microstructure evolution, such as microvoids and dislocation density.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10262], "author_name_tesi": "Yao, Xiaochu ", "last_name_ssi": "Yao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaochu", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nonlinear acoustics", "creep", "Inconel 617", "bulk wave", "microstructure evaluation"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATION OF THE GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON HYPERTENSION (HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE) IN AFRICAN AMERICANS\n\n", "id": "7768", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6697", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "      According to the National Center for Health Statistics, African Americans have among the highest rates of hypertension of any race or ethnic type in the world.

Some current nanomechanical testing techniques include vibrational resonance, bend testing, and tensile testing. However there is a huge variability in the nanowire data recorded utilizing these techniques. The nanowires typically reveal structural properties that are identical to bulk, indicating that their elastic properties should also match bulk. Often the data reveal elastic moduli covering a large range of values, some so low or so high that they are nonphysical. The inconsistencies in the data bring into question the validity and reproducibility of these nanomechanical testing techniques and indicate that there exists a basic experimental problem inhibiting the tests from producing accurate data. This study uses silicon, a well understood, model material, in order to probe the technique of tensile testing nanowires using a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) and determine where in the experimental setup that these problems are occurring. \n\nIn this study, the mechanical properties of silicon nanowires were explored using a MEMS tensile testing device. The nanowires were grown by the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) method off the top of an anodized alumina membrane. Silicon was chosen as an ideal model material because its bulk properties are well understood and should translate to the nanoscale, ensuring that the MEMS is operating properly. In order to thoroughly examine the material properties of silicon, a theoretical model using higher order elastic constants was used to model the constitutive behavior of silicon, which revealed a nonlinear elastic region at high strains and the ultimate strength of silicon in various crystallographic directions. The model should hold true for nanoscale silicon that is still large enough to contain hundreds of atoms in its cross-section. The nanowires tested in this study had a very low, controlled defect density, indicating that they should have high strengths approaching the theoretical limit. The diameter and orientation of the nanowires were first characterized in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The diameters ranged from 100 to 500 nm and the growth directions included single crystalline [100], [110], [111], [112], and bicrystalline [112]. The MEMS device used for tensile testing the nanowires consisted of a thermal actuator, a load cell comb drive, and a specimen gap. Testing was performed in vacuum after manipulation in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a Ga focused ion beam. The nanowire was anchored to the MEMS specimen gap with a FIB deposited Pt composite (45 atomic% Pt, 28% Ga, 24% C, 3% O). A total of 15 tensile tests were performed, only six of which contained both stress and strain data. The remaining 9 tests were performed on MEMS designs that did not accurately track the force in the nanowire. From the six tests with both stress and strain data, the strength of the nanowires ranged from 3.88 to 10.1 GPa and the strain to failure from 4.86% to 6.16%. The elastic moduli, E, determined from the least squares linear fits of the data at low strains ranged from 64.4 to 159.1 GPa for [112] oriented nanowires (Bulk [112], E = 174GPa). The elastic modulus measured for a [111] nanowire was 116.4 GPa, compared to 188 GPa for bulk. The stress-strain curves from these experiments were also compared to the theoretical behavior of silicon and it was found that the tests with elastic moduli near that of bulk mapped well onto the theoretical until very high strains, where the experimental stress was lower than the theoretical. This indicated that an experimental problem was occurring at the high strains. Other tensile tests that had shown elastic moduli significantly lower than that of bulk did not map well onto any part of the theoretical model, indicating that the experimental problem was occurring throughout the experiment. The strains measured for the remaining nine tests ranged from 4.04% to 8.41%, which from the theoretical model correspond to strengths ranging from 6.67 to 12.5 GPa. \n\nFractography was also performed using a field emission SEM (FE-SEM) on a few of the nanowires failed during the tensile tests. The surfaces contained rough bumpy features that were unlike anything seen before in bulk silicon. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was then used to image the failed nanowires and a Pt sheath covering the nanowire and fracture surface was revealed. The sheath presumably was created from overspray and wicking during the deposition of the Pt composite anchors, and was deformed plastically during the tensile test and, after failure, collapsed over the fracture surface. This sheath also implies a compliance issue and inaccuracy in the strain measurements taken during the tests and explains why the experimental stress-strain curves deviated from the theoretical model. Therefore nanowire mechanical testing techniques that use a deposited material in order to fix the nanowire in place provide unreliable strain measurements due to compliance and an inability to observe the nanowire directly due to a sheath of the material covering the nanowire surface. The solution to this problem would be the development of a method that enables the strain in the sample to be monitored directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4341], "author_name_tesi": "Yashinski , Melisa Sue", "last_name_ssi": "Yashinski ", "middle_name_ssi": "Sue", "first_name_ssi": "Melisa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Muhlstein", "Christopher Muhlstein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Muhlstein, Thesis Advisor", "Christopher Muhlstein, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["silicon", "nanomechanical testing", "nanowires"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Effect of Large Elastic Strains on Phonons in GaP Nanowires", "id": "15148", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7680", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Phonon deformation potentials (PDPs) directly relate shifts in phonon frequency, measured through Raman spectroscopy, to strain in a material. To measure a material's PDPs, one needs to decouple the PDP dependence on phonon shift rate by measuring multiple shift rates. This is possible through uniaxial tension, which distorts the shape of the crystal causing phonons that are degenerate at zero strain to split and shift at different rates. Historically, PDPs have been measured on bulk samples under uniaxial compression up to fairly low strains and total phonon shifts. This thesis has clearly shown that PDPs not measured up to high enough strains to induce visible phonon splitting are flawed. The implementation of flawed PDPs leads to an overestimated strain measurement and underestimated properties such as elastic modulus. This study has used a GaP nanowire model system that is capable of withstanding large strains before failure that enabled highly accurate PDP measurements. This study has also generalized phonon deformation theory so that, when combined with accurate PDPs, reliable strain and material property measurements are possible on any specimen independent of scale, geometry, or testing condition. Therefore the application of accurate PDPs to phonon deformation theory extends to a variety of experiments that rely on Raman spectroscopy to quantify strain in the material, including, but not limited to: assessing strain transfer in a fiber embedded matrix under different loading conditions; measuring stress distribution in metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices in order to better predict failure; characterizing residual stress due to crystallographic mismatch in materials such as superlattices and core-shell wires; and quantifying the effects of varying defect densities on the mechanical properties of a material.\n\nTensile experiments were performed on ten [111] oriented GaP nanowires with diameters ranging from 53 to 260 nm, five of which included PDP measurements. These GaP nanowires exhibited fairly high tensile strengths (1.09 GPa <= 4.97 GPa) and large phonon frequency shifts (up to 9.22 cm^(-1) in the LO phonon, 13.6 cm^(-1) in the TO1 phonon, and 22.2 cm$^{-1}$ in the TO2 phonon). Phonon shift rates measured in the TO$_{2}$ phonon were used to measure the PDPs of GaP: gamma=(-p+2q)(6w^2)=2.99 +/- 0.63$ and r/w^2=-1.27 +/- 0.46. These PDPs were used to determine strains to failure ranging from 0.70% to 3.69% and experimental elastic moduli ranging from 112.6 to 208.3 GPa from the LO data, 144.5 to 169.7 GPa from the TO1 data, and 158.8 to 168.8 GPa from the TO2 data. These experimental moduli matched closely to the theoretical elastic modulus of [111] GaP (E=166.7 GPa) determined in the strength model implemented in this thesis.\n\nThe PDPs measured in this study were higher and predicted larger phonon shift rates than PDPs measured on bulk GaP [Balslev 1974]. Strains to failure determined from bulk PDPs (1.57% to 21.6%) were unrealistically high and the corresponding elastic moduli (14.7 to 86.8 GPa) were unrealistically low. A comparison between the raw data (phonon shift as a function of stress) from the bulk experiment and nanowire experiments revealed that the bulk data did not differ from the nanowire data. Rather, the bulk experiment ended at a stress (0.38 GPa) much lower than the stress (0.5 - 1.5 GPa) at which clear splitting in the TO phonon was observed in the nanowire experiments. Information for TO splitting in the bulk was gained by fitting two Lorentzian functions to a slightly broadened TO peak, which underestimated the phonon shift rate and led to flawed PDPs. In order to correctly measure a material's PDPs, the experiment must extend to high enough strain such that splitting in the degenerate phonon is visible, which occurs when the difference between a single Lorentzian fit and double Lorentzian fit, Delta L_fit, exceeds 0.1. \n\nExperimental work in this study has highlighted the importance of peak splitting in PDP measurements. Phonon deformation theory has been generalized in this study to show how PDPs, strain, and peak splitting are related in any crystalline material. If a material's crystallographic space group is known, then its phonon frequency shift and strain relationship can be determined, which depends on a combination of the material's independent PDPs and the strain tensor. The theory demonstrates that measurement of PDPs requires multiple phonon shift rates, possible via uniaxial tension, that will comprise a set of linear equations that decouple the PDPs. The less symmetry a crystal system possesses, the more independent PDPs are required to fully describe the relationship between phonon shift and strain. Therefore a material with n independent PDPs requires n/2 uniaxial tension experiments that, after phonon splitting, will measure $n$ phonon shift rates that will comprise a set of $n$ linear equations with $n$ unknowns (PDPs). Once a material's PDPs are known, phonon deformation theory can be used to relate phonon shift in a material under any possible strain state, independent of specimen scale, geometry, or testing condition. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7615], "author_name_tesi": "Yashinski , Melisa Sue", "last_name_ssi": "Yashinski ", "middle_name_ssi": "Sue", "first_name_ssi": "Melisa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Muhlstein", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Francesco Costanzo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Muhlstein, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanowires", "Gallium Phosphide", "GaP", "Mechanical behavior", "stress", "strain", "phonon", "vibrational mode", "Raman spectroscopy", "tension"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "CONVERGENT DEVELOPMENT OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES IN MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS\n", "id": "11891", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4072", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are often inoculated with rich sources of microorganisms from a single wastewater source, but it is not known to what extent this inoculum choice affects community development or power production. The temporal development of microbial communities in MFCs was examined using inocula from three different sources: a local wastewater treatment plant known to produce consistent power densities; a second nearby wastewater treatment plant; and an anaerobic bog sediment. The bog inoculum MFCs initially produced much higher power densities than the wastewater samples, but after 60 d all MFCs on average converged to similar voltages (0.47 \u00b1 0.02 V, 1000 &#937; external resistor) and maximum power densities (590 \u00b1 170 mW/m2). While voltages produced by MFCs inoculated with bog sediment were not significantly different among triplicate reactors, one of the MFCs inoculated with wastewater produced substantially less voltage.

These results suggests that MFC replicates need not be sampled and analyzed for their individual microbial communities when exhibiting similar performance, but sub-optimal performance can arise from a lack of predominance of specific microorganisms in the anode communities. The extent to which this finding can be generalized for MFCs needs to be further examined for other substrates, inocula, and reactor types.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4047], "author_name_tesi": "Yates, Matthew D", "last_name_ssi": "Yates", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["convergence", "mfc"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Sustainable Resource Recovery And Energy Conversion Processes Using Microbial Electrochemical Technologies", "id": "22435", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10230", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microbial Electrochemical Technologies (METs) are emerging technological platforms for the conversion of waste into usable products. METs utilize naturally occurring bacteria, called exoelectrogens, capable of transferring electrons to insoluble terminal electron acceptors. Electron transfer processes in the exoelectrogen Geobacter sulfurreducens were exploited here to develop sustainable processes for synthesis of industrially and socially relevant end products. The first process examined was the removal of soluble metals from solution to form catalytic nanoparticles and nanoporous structures. The second process examined was the biocatalytic conversion of electrons into hydrogen gas using electrons supplied directly to an electrode.\nNanoparticle formation is desirable because materials on the nanoscale possess different physical, optical, electronic, and mechanical properties compared to bulk materials. In the first process, soluble palladium was used to form catalytic palladium nanoparticles using extracellular electron transfer (EET) processes of G. sulfurreducens, typically the dominant member of mixed-culture METs. Geobacter cells reduced the palladium extracellularly using naturally produced pili, which provided extracellular adsorption and reduction sites to help delay the diffusion of soluble metals into the cell. The extracellular reduction prevented cell inactivation due to formation of intracellular particles, and therefore the cells could be reused in multiple palladium reduction cycles. \nA G. sulfurreducens biofilm was next investigated as a biotemplate for the formation of a nanoporous catalytic palladium structure. G. sulfurreducens biofilms have a dense network of pili and extracellular cytochromes capable of high rates of electron transfer directly to an electrode surface.  These pili and cytochromes provide a dense number of reduction sites for nanoparticle formation without the need for any synthetic components. The cells within the biofilm also can act as natural agents for preventing agglomeration of nanoparticles, and subsequent decrease of active surface area, on the electrode surface. The cell template was carbonized and removed via thermal treatments, leaving a catalytically active mesoporous palladium structure. The biotemplated mesoporous structure had a high surface area composed of nanoparticles, and a high pore volume and surface area. The biotemplated porous structure also exhibited an increased catalytic activity compared to an electroplated palladium electrode and an electrode coated with synthetically produced palladium nanoparticles attached to the surface with a Nafion binder. The biotemplated mesoporous structure was found to be an alternative process to form a porous structure directly on an electrode using only materials and processes that naturally occur in G. sulfurreducens biofilms.\nBiotemplated catalytic structures are an alternative method to form a porous structure with high catalytic activity without using any synthetic compounds. However, their uses in large scale processes require that the catalyst layer be durable. The electrochemical and mechanical stability of biotemplated mesoporous structures was tested on different support materials (polished graphite, carbon paper, carbon cloth, and stainless steel) subjected to electrochemical and/or mechanical stress. Carbon paper was found to withstand the most electrochemical and mechanical stress of the four different support materials tested. Polished graphite was able to withstand electrochemical stress, but deteriorated under a combination of electrochemical and mechanical stress. Different readily available and inexpensive polymers (polyaniline and polydimethylsiloxane) were also tested against a widely used polymer (Nafion\u00ae) to stabilize the palladium catalyst on the polished graphite surface. The polyaniline was the most effective binder because it enhanced the catalytic activity and could be electropolymerized around the catalyst, giving the greatest amount of control over the thickness of the polymer layer.\nThe second process studied used exoelectrogenic bacteria in METs for the conversion of electrons to hydrogen via water electrolysis in a biocathodic system. Naturally occurring biocatalytic cell material on the cathode surface was used to lower the cathode overpotential. Different cell cultures (G. sulfurreducens, Methanosarcina barkeri, and Escherichia coli) were tested for their effect on hydrogen formation using electrons supplied to an insoluble electrode. The mode of hydrogen production was investigated by monitoring hydrogen production over three to five months using G. sulfurreducens biofilms (pregrown under anodic conditions with acetate) that were: (1) not supplied with an organic carbon source for cell growth and maintenance, (2) killed with ethanol, or (3) supplied with lactate, an organic carbon source and electron donor for G. sulfurreducens. Hydrogen was produced at a rate 10\u201320 times higher over five months in reactors that were either not given organic carbon or killed with ethanol, compared to reactors with lactate added. The methanogen, M. barkeri, was also tested as a biocatalyst because it is able to grow autotrophically. However, M. barkeri cells did not grow in the reactor with the electrode potential poised, based on the lack of evidence for methane production. Despite the lack of cell activity, the rate of hydrogen production with M. barkeri was similar to the rate observed in killed G. sulfurreducens reactors. The addition of E. coli, a non-exoelectrogenic bacteria, resulted in an initial elevated hydrogen gas production, but hydrogen production rates similar to background levels after three months. No cells were detected on the electrode surfaces after five months using scanning electron microscopy and unique metals, such as iron, nickel, cobalt, and zinc, were detected on the electrode surfaces exposed to cells. The identifiable peptides extracted from the electrodes were found to be derived primarily from metalloproteins produced by G. sulfurreducens and M. barkeri cells. These findings show that hydrogen can be produced in a biocathodic system by abiotic cell material attached to a graphite electrode surface and that it does not require electron uptake by living cells.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9913], "author_name_tesi": "Yates, Matthew D", "last_name_ssi": "Yates", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "John Michael Regan", "Christopher Aaron Gorski", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Dissertation Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Chair", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Christopher Aaron Gorski, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bioelectrochemistry", "Geobacter", "Biotemplate", "Palladium", "Nanomaterial", "Hydrogen", "metalloprotein"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK IMPLEMENTATION FOR EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF CYCLIC CO2 INJECTION IN NATURALLY FRACTURED BLACK-OIL RESERVOIRS", "id": "14408mxy5162", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14408", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Increasing oil and gas consumption of countries has increased demand for oil for their energy needs.\nTherefore, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods have become attractive for these countries to\nreach their required production since only a small portion of the original oil in place (OOIP) can\nbe produced with primary and secondary production techniques. Gas injection, specifically cyclic\nCO2 injection, has been found to be an effective EOR method to improve oil recovery in naturally\nfractured reservoirs. Fractured reservoirs favor this process because the fractures in this system\nprovide an extensive contact area for injected gas to penetrate into the reservoir and diffuse into\nthe low-permeable matrix. These fractures contribute to an easy delivery not only for injecting the\ngas but also for producing the oil. Therefore, in cyclic CO2 injection, a single well is used for both\ninjection and production.

Commercial reservoir simulations require heavy computational time in order\nto go through a large number of possible scenarios to determine the optimal design parameters.\nThus, an artificial neural network (ANN) that is able to solve non-linear and complex relationships\nin a remarkably short time has been used as an alternative to overcome these limitations in recent\nyears.\nIn this research, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are developed to determine the performance\nindicators and the optimum design parameters of a cyclic CO2 injection process in naturally fractured\nreservoirs.

It has a latent hydraulic reactivity, which can be catalyzed using proper activators, such as alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates or silicates, to form cementitious materials. Alkaline activated slag (AAS) produces alternative binders that could have important technical, economical and ecological advantages over traditional ordinary portland cement (OPC). However, this new binder suffers from several problems as a building material, including large autogenous and drying shrinkage and micro-cracking. The scientific reasoning behind the considerable shrinkage magnitude and extensive volumetric instability of AAS has not been explained to date. The main objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms of large shrinkage in AAS and to develop and evaluate effective mitigation strategies again these deterioration mechanisms. \n\nIn the first chapter of this dissertation, the physical models of drying and shrinkage in cementitious materials were reviewed, as fundamental of this research. To investigate the shrinkage mechanisms of AAS, the extensive experimental program was implemented to study the physical-chemical changes in AAS during drying. The main finding of this work is that the shrinkage development of AAS shows pronounced visco-elastic/visco-plastic characteristics, which may be attributed to the reorganization and rearrangement of calcium-alumina-silicate-hydrates (C-A-S-H). The results also indicate that the incorporation of alkali cation (e.g. Na+, K+) into C-A-S-H is responsible for the characteristic viscous deformation of AAS. \n\nSeveral conventional shrinkage mitigation strategies used for OPC were implemented in AAS, including steam curing, sulfate-enrichment, and calcium-enrichment. Our results indicate that the steam curing can stabilize the C-A-S-H in AAS by strengthening the bonding between adjacent particles, hence reducing the magnitude of shrinkage; however, the early-age expansive reaction (e.g. due to the formation of sulfate-bearing phases) is insufficient in offsetting the long-term viscous deformation of C-A-S-H. \n\nThe effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere on the volume change of AAS during drying was studied by comparing the shrinkage behaviors of AAS in nitrogen gas and air environments. The results indicate that carbonation of AAS results in expansion, rather than shrinkage as in conventional OPC system, which may be attributed to the crystallization stress of calcium carbonates in the restrained pore structure of AAS. \n\nThe effect of alkalis (Na+, K+) with various types and sources on the volumetric stability of OPC was examined, since it is proposed in this study that the incorporation of alkali cation in the nanostructure of C-A-S-H is the cause of high shrinkage and characteristic viscous deformation in cementitious materials, regardless it is AAS or OPC. The experimental results support the above statements. \n\nThe last chapter summarizes the main findings of this research and provides some recommends for the future research.

Those data are usually presented and accessed with hierarchies, compositions, and relations. Understanding the structures and functions behind such data requires using models and methods for specifically analyzing their associated data structures. One of the biggest challenges in achieving this goal is developing a principled data and model framework capable of meaningfully exploiting the structured knowledge of data. Those structures of data include compositional and relational patterns: multiple entities have to interact and group in order to make sense. Although the conventional vector-based data analysis pipelines have become the standard quantitative framework for many fields in sciences and technology, they are not directly applicable to and have several limitations for extracting knowledge from compositional and relational data.\nThe goal of this thesis research is to introduce new mathematical models and computational methods for analyzing large-scale compositional and relational data, as well as to validate the models\u2019 usefulness in solving real-world problems. We begin by introducing several backgrounds, including optimal transport, an old but refreshing topic in mathematics, and probabilistic graphical model, apopular tool in statistical modeling. Particularly, we explain how optimal transport relates to an important modeling concept, a.k.a. matching, in machine learning. Next, we present our work related to computational algorithms of those relational and structural models including a fast discrete distribution clustering method using Wasserstein barycenters, a simulated annealing-based inexact oracle for Wasserstein loss minimization, a Bregman ADMM-based oracle for Wasserstein geodesic classification, and a probabilistic multi-graph model for consensus analysis. Their computational complexities, numerical difficulties, scalability, and accuracy issues are discussed in depth.

In the first part, we develop a new\nstatistical procedure for analysing HIV data to improve efficiency of parameter\nestimates by incorporating extra available information. Also, we use the procedure\nto study the impact of this additional information. In the second part, we develop a\nnew error variance function estimation procedure for ultrahigh dimensional varying\ncoefficient models.\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus that causes HIV\ninfection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Accurate estimation\nand prediction of HIV epidemics can help people have a better understanding\non HIV epidemics, and also help government make laws and formulate policies.\nTwo key indicators, prevalence and incidence, are widely used to estimate HIV\nepidemics. HIV prevalence is the proportion of HIV positive population among\nthe general population. HIV incidence is the proportion of new HIV infections\namong the general population.The new treatment, Antiretroviral treatment (ART),\nreduces the AIDS-related deaths, and changes the AIDS-related mortality rate\nsubstantially. In the UNAIDS 2014 Gap report, the number of people who are\nnewly infected with HIV is continuing to decline in most countries and regions\nin the world, which suggests a slow-down of HIV epidemics. Traditionally, the\nincrease of HIV prevalence rate mostly is due to the increase of new infections.\nHowever, reduction of AIDS-related deaths becomes another important reason of\nincreasing HIV prevalence rate. In this case, knowing incidence helps people fuller\nunderstand the HIV epidemic. One of our goals is to utilize the newly available\nincidence assays in the process of estimation and projection of HIV epidemics, and to\nunderstand the contribution of such data in the presence of historical HIV prevalence data, which has been the main data source for estimating HIV epidemics. The\nSusceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) system is widely used in the epidemiology.\nUnder Bayesian framework, Incremental Mixture Importance Sampling (IMIS) can\nbe used to draw the posterior samples. The current method to incorporate new\nincidence assays with SIR model is to fit the historical prevalence data and new\nincidence data all over again even if the fitted results to the prevalence data are\navailable. We propose a new method, Sequential IMIS, to estimate prevalence\nand incidence with assay data. Our method reduces the computing time in most\nscenarios, and enables the study the impact of incidence assay data in multiple\nscenarios. Also, we improve the stopping rule for IMIS to avoid the algorithm\nstops in the local maximum. Incidence assay data are impact by four parameters:\nprevalence, incidence, the false recent rate (FRR), and mean duration of recent\ninfection (MDRI). We use the proposed method to study the impact to prevalence\nand incidence rates and impact to the changes of prevalence and incidence rates\nover time when incorporating the new incidence assay data. This impact takes\nboth one time data and time series data into consideration. Our research shows\nthat in most countries, incidence assay data can significantly improve the accuracy\nof the incidence estimate.\nIn the second part, we propose a new estimation procedure for error variance\nfunction estimation for ultrahigh dimensional varying coefficient models (VCM).\nLow dimensional VCM was systematically introduced in Hastie and Tibshirani\n(1993), and is one of the most commonly used nonparametric regression models in\nstatistics. Error variance function estimation plays important roles in estimation\nof confidence interval and hypothesis testing for VCM, and is very challenging in\nthe present of ultrahigh dimensional covariates. A naive way is to select variables\nfirst, and refit the model with low dimensional selected models. We first show both\ntheoretically and empirically that this naive estimator significantly underestimates\nthe error variance and may lead to an inconsistent estimate. We further propose a\nnew estimation procedure for error variance function by using group least absolute\nshrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and refitted cross-validation (RCV)\ntechniques. We study the asymptotic property of the RCV estimate, and compare\nit with the naive estimate. Our findings include that the RCV estimator is consistent\nestimator and follows an asymptotic normal distribution with smallest variance. It\nsignificantly improves the naive estimator. We further conduct simulation studies\nto examine the finite sample performance of the RCV estimate.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16127], "author_name_tesi": "Ye, Jingyi ", "last_name_ssi": "Ye", "first_name_ssi": "Jingyi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Runze Li", "Runze Li", "Le Bao", "Zhibiao Zhao", "Lan Kong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Runze Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Runze Li, Committee Chair", "Le Bao, Committee Member", "Zhibiao Zhao, Committee Member", "Lan Kong, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HIV", "prevalence and incidence", "incidence assay data", "refitted cross-validation", "high dimension data", "varying coefficient model", "varying error variance"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Mining User-Generated Geo-Social Data for Search and Recommendation", "id": "15302", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7564", "abstract_tesi": "With the increasing availability of GPS-enabled smart phones, rapid development of locationbased\nservices, and growing interests in on-line social networking, a number of location-based\nsocial networking (LBSN) services such as Facebook Places, Foursquare, Whrrl, Yelp, EveryTrail\nand TripAdvisor have emerged. These services allow users to explore places, write\nreviews and blogs, and share their locations and experiences with others. In this thesis, we propose\nto mine those user-generated geo-social data (e.g., places, reviews, blogs and social links)\nto enable better search and recommendation services through several innovative techniques.\nFirst, we develop a travelogue service that discovers and conveys various travelogue (or trip\nblog) digests, in form of theme locations, geographical scope, traveling trajectory and location\nsnippet, to users. In this service, theme locations in a travelogue are the core information to\ndiscover. Thus we aim to address the problem of theme location discovery to enable the above\ntravelogue services. Due to the inherent ambiguity of location relevance, we perform location\nrelevance mining (LRM) in two complementary angles, relevance classification and relevance\nranking, to provide comprehensive understanding of locations. Furthermore, we explore the\ntextual (e.g., surrounding words) and geographical (e.g., geographical relationship among locations)\nfeatures of locations to develop a co-training model for enhancement of classification\nperformance. Built upon the mining result of LRM, we develop a series of techniques for\nprovisioning of the aforementioned travelogue digests in our travelogue system.\nSecond, we develop a semantic annotation technique for location-based social networks\n(e.g., Foursquare and Whrrl) to automatically annotate all places with category tags which are a\ncrucial prerequisite for location search. Our annotation algorithm learns a binary support vector\nmachine (SVM) classifier for each tag in the tag space to support multi-label classification.\nBased on the check-in behavior of users, we extract features of places from i) explicit patterns\n(EP) of individual places and ii) implicit relatedness (IR) among similar places. The features\nextracted from EP are summarized from all check-ins at a specific place. The features from\nIR are derived by building a novel network of related places (NRP) where similar places are\nlinked by virtual edges. Upon NRP, we determine the probability of a category tag for each\nplace by exploring the relatedness of places. Both EP and IR features are complementary with\neach other and beneficial for the proposed classification task.\nThird, we provide a point-of-interests (POIs) recommendation service for the rapid growing location-based social networks (LBSNs), e.g., Foursquare, Whrrl, etc. The idea is to explore\nuser preference, social influence and geographical influence for POI recommendations.\nIn addition to deriving user preference based on user-based collaborative filtering and exploring\nsocial influence from friends, we put a special emphasis on geographical influence due to the\nspatial clustering phenomenon exhibited in user check-in activities of LBSNs. We argue that\nthe geographical influence among POIs plays an important role in user check-in behaviors and\nmodel it by power-law distribution. Accordingly, we develop a collaborative recommendation\nalgorithm based on naive Bayesian method, by incorporating geographical influence. Furthermore,\nWe propose a unified POI recommendation framework, which fuses user preference to a\nPOI with social influence and geographical influence.\nFinally, social friendship has been shown beneficial for item recommendation for years.\nHowever, existing approaches mostly incorporate social friendship into recommender systems\nby heuristics. Here, we argue that social influence between friends can be captured quantitatively\nand propose a probabilistic generative model, called social influenced selection(SIS), to\nmodel the decision making of item selection (e.g., what book to buy or where to dine). Based\non SIS, we mine the social influence between linked friends and the personal preferences of\nusers through statistical inference. To address the challenges arising from multiple layers of\nhidden factors in SIS, we develop a new parameter learning algorithm based on expectation\nmaximization (EM). Moreover, we show that the mined social influence and user preferences\nare valuable for group recommendation and viral marketing.\nWe conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the performance of our proposed approaches.\nThe experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches and their\nsuperiority over state-of-the-art approaches in corresponding domains.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7499], "author_name_tesi": "Ye, Mao ", "last_name_ssi": "Ye", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wang Chien Lee", "Tom La Porta", "Piotr Berman", "Xiaolong Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wang Chien Lee, Committee Chair", "Tom La Porta, Committee Member", "Piotr Berman, Committee Member", "Xiaolong Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Social Network", "Data Mining", "Location-based Services", "Recommender Systems", "Information Retrieval"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A PSEUDOFUNCTIONLESS DENSITY DIFFUSIVITY EQUATION APPROACH TO NATURAL GAS RESERVOIR ENGINEERING ANALYSIS\n", "id": "12468", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4983", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The traditional approach employed in the analytical analysis of unsteady state responses for natural gas reservoirs is firmly based on recasting the reservoir diffusivity equation in terms of new pseudo variables or pseudofunctions\u2014namely, pseudopressure and pseudotime\u2014able to render the equation amenable to analytical treatment. Since the pseudofunction-based approach succeeds in linearizing the equation and hence generating such required analytical solutions, the recognized inconvenience of these variables in terms of their units and usual introduction of iteration procedure \u2014 is understood to be their necessary trade-off that comes with the study of natural gas reservoirs. In this study, we propose a rigorous yet pseudofunctionless density diffusivity equation approach for the analytical solution of the gas diffusivity equation which is more readily linked to the fundamental principle of mass conservation. To demonstrate its validity, we discuss analytical arguments and perform numerical simulations to corroborate performance for the most widely used inner boundary conditions: constant pressure and constant rate production. By honoring the proper material balance equations and implementing the concept of depletion-driven dimensionless parameters, the proposed pseudofunctionless density equation is found to be able to fully describe reservoir unsteady behavior while keeping all variables involved in the analysis firmly grounded in physical intuition.\n\nThis work also presents another important application of the proposed pseudofunctionless density diffusivity equation approach\u2014rate decline curve analysis. Decline curve analysis is the technique most extensively used by engineers in the evaluation of well performance, production forecasting, and prediction of original fluids in place. State-of-the-art natural gas decline curve analysis heavily relies on the use of liquid (oil) type curves combined with the concepts of pseudopressure and pseudotime and/or empirical curve fitting of rate-time production data using Arps hyperbolic decline model. In this study, we present the true decline equation\u2014in its analytical, closed functional form\u2014that rigorously models production from any gas well producing at constant pressure under boundary dominated flow (BDF) without the use of pseudofunctions or empirical concepts from Arps decline models. New-generation analytical decline equations for boundary dominated flow (BDF) are presented for gas wells producing at 1) full production potential under true wide-open decline and 2) partial production potential under less than wide-open decline. The proposed analytical BDF equation for gas reservoirs producing at full production potential invalidates the commonly-held assumption that the hyperbolic decline exponent (\u201cb\u201d) proposed by Arps is subject to empirical determination from gas rate-time data in single-phase volumetric gas reservoirs. In addition, decline behavior of gas reservoirs producing at partial production potential or drawdown is shown to exhibit a hyperbolic decline character during early boundary dominated flow, but exponential decline character at later times. The proposed model enables the generation of rigorous type-curves for the analysis of natural gas reservoirs producing at constant pressure and under BDF for both full and partial production potential. A universal, single-line BDF gas type curve is shown to be straightforwardly derived for any gas well producing at their full potential. The proposed analytical model and resulting pseudofunctionless type curves can be used to rigorously forecast boundary-dominated performance and, more remarkably, predict original gas in place without: 1) iterative procedures, 2) prior knowledge of reservoir storage properties or geological data, 3) pseudo-functional manipulation of rate-time production data obtained in the field. In addition, another method for the estimation of original gas in place using the back-tracking of viscosity-compressibility changes is also provided.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4960], "author_name_tesi": "Ye, Peng ", "last_name_ssi": "Ye", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Peng", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Luis F Ayala H"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor", "Luis F Ayala H, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["decline curve", "density", "Natural gas", "reservoir engineering"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Investigation of impact of fuel injection strategy and biodiesel fueling on engine emissions and performance", "id": "12663", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7014", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Both biodiesel fueling and changes of fuel injection pressure have significant impacts on diesel engine emissions.

Three fuel injection parameters:  start of injection, fuel injection pressure and fuel injection duration were investigated to investigate their impact on engine emissions. With the control of fuel injection strategy, it is shown in this work that the biodiesel engine NOx emission penalty can be eliminated. \nA fuel spray, mixture stoichiometry field and lift-off length model was employed to explain the variations of NOx emission from biodiesel fueling and change of fuel injection strategy. Linear correlations between the average oxygen equivalence ratio of the fuel-air mixture at the autoignition zone near the lift-off length and brake specific NOx emissions were observed for all load conditions, regardless of fuel type. This confirms that the dominant factor that determines NOx emissions is the ignition event controlled by the oxygen equivalence ratio at the autoignition zone.\nThe impact of late in-cylinder (post) injection combustion with biodiesel on lubricating oil dilution was investigated in this work. It is shown that this injection strategy could effectively decrease engine NOx emissions, while increase the CO and unburned hydrocarbon emissions. The lubricating oil dilution depends on the post injection timing: an increase in the lubricating oil dilution can be only observed if the post injection timing is later than 45\u00ba after top dead center.\nThe impacts of fuel injection pressure on diesel and biodiesel soot morphology and oxidative reactivity were investigated. It is shown that compared with engine condition and fuel injection pressure, biodiesel has much less significant impact on soot morphology. For soot oxidative reactivity, it is found that both diesel and biodiesel soot from higher fuel injection pressure have higher reactivity, and biodiesel soot has higher reactivity than diesel soot when both of them are obtained from the same injection pressure. \nThe optimized apparent heat release pattern for improved engine thermal efficiency was investigated with a zero-dimensional engine thermodynamic simulation. The results suggest that the optimized apparent heat release is a \u201cwide and low\u201d peak. The reason for this kind of heat release is that it can decrease the in-cylinder temperature and consequently decrease heat loss.

It is critical for mobility, sensory functions and signal transduction. The primary cilium plays critical roles in vertebrate development and physiology. Over the last decade, benefited from active biological and medical studies on this organelle, an increasing number of human genetic diseases have been found related to cilia defects, collectively known as \u201cciliopathy\u201d.\nPreviously, our lab identified C2 calcium-dependent domain containing 3 (C2cd3) as an essential regulator for ciliogenesis. C2cd3 homozygous mutants exhibit defects in neural tube development, left-right asymmetry and limb patterning, consistent with the phenotypes of other cilia mutants. A great reduction in cilia number observed in C2cd3 mutants suggests it is essential for cilia formation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying C2cd3 function in ciliogenesis is still elusive. To understand the function of C2cd3, I examined its subcellular localization. A dynamic subcellular localization of C2cd3 is observed during the cell cycle. C2cd3 forms punctae around centrosome during interphase, which are dispersed during mitosis but leaving two fine dots at each spindle pole. This implies that C2cd3 may be localized to both centriolar satellites and centrosomes.\nTo confirm its centriolar satellite localization, I found that C2cd3 punctae were dependent on dynein-mediated microtubule-dependent retrograde transport. Furthermore, C2cd3 colocalizes and physically interacts with known centriolar satellites components, Pcm1 and Bbs4. I also discovered that C2cd3 was targeted to centriolar satellites through the interaction between its C-terminus and Pcm1. However, C2cd3 is dispensable for centriolar satellite integrity and many known centriolar satellite functions, including Rab8 ciliary localization, microtubule arrangement and cell cycle progression. Surprisingly, I found that C2cd3 is essential for centriolar satellite recruitment of Centrin, suggesting its role in centriolar satellite-mediated transport.\nTo study the second localization of C2cd3, I pinpointed C2cd3 to the distal ends of centrioles. Interestingly, C2cd3 is essential for the recruitment of both distal and subdistal appendages to the mother centriole. Furthermore, loss of C2cd3 results in failure in the recruitment of Ttbk2 to the mother centriole as well as the removal of Ccp110 from the mother centriole, two critical steps in initiating ciliogenesis. C2cd3 is also required for recruiting the intraflagellar transport proteins Ift88 and Ift52 to the mother centriole during ciliogenesis. Consistent with its role in distal appendage assembly, C2cd3 is essential for ciliary vesicle docking to the mother centriole. These results suggest that C2cd3 regulates cilium biogenesis by promoting the assembly of centriolar distal appendages, which are critical for docking ciliary vesicles and recruiting other essential ciliogenic proteins.\nFinally, to elucidate the role of C2cd3 in distal appendage assembly, I found that C2cd3 contributes to the centriolar recruitment of Centrin, a centriolar distal end protein. Ofd1 and Dzip1, two regulators of distal and subdistal appendages, fail to be recruited to centrioles in C2cd3 mutant cells. I propose that C2cd3 may mediate distal appendage recruitment by regulating centriole elongation.\nIn summary, my results indicate that C2cd3 regulates cilia formation by facilitating the recruitment of centriolar distal appendages. In the absence of C2cd3, distal appendages fail to be installed onto the mother centriole and all the downstream events for initiating the ciliogenesis are affected. The distal appendage defect might be a secondary effect of disrupted centriole diatal structure when C2cd3 is absent. I have also described the road map for studying how C2cd3 regulates centriole biogenesis and interplays with other distal appendage regulators in the future.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10327], "author_name_tesi": "Ye, Xuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Ye", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aimin Liu", "Gong Chen", "Graham Hugh Thomas", "Melissa Rolls"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aimin Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Gong Chen, Committee Chair", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Member", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["C2cd3", "cilium", "ciliopathy", "centriole", "centriolar satellites", "distal appendages", "ciliary vesicle docking", "Ttbk2", "Centrin"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECT OF BUFFER CHARGE AND BUFFER RETENTION ON BIOELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND POST-TREATMENT FOR MICROBIAL FUEL CELL EFFLUENT WITH FLUIDIZED BED MEMBRANE BIOREACTORS", "id": "14641yuy144", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14641", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) are very promising technologies for simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy recovery. In MFCs, buffers are typically used to improve performance by stabilizing the electrode pH and increasing the electrolyte conductivity, but the importance of the buffer net charge at current densities typical of MFCs on cathode performance has received little attention. Current production in MFCs produces an electric field that drives cations towards the cathode, and anions to the anode. A series of biological buffers were selected with positive, negative, and neutral charges that had pKas ranging from 5 to 10.8. Cathodic current production using these different buffers in solutions with different pHs and conductivities was compared using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). At lower pHs, buffers with positive charge increased cathodic current by as much as 95% within certain ranges (potential windows) of cathode potentials. No difference in cathodic current was shown in current for buffers with neutral or negative charge. The reason for this increase with the net positive charge buffers was likely due to a more stable electrode pH produced by electric field driving the positively charged ions towards the cathode. The potential window for the positively charged buffers was positively correlated to the concentration of cationic buffer in the electrolyte. At a pH higher than 9, no improvement in cathodic current was shown for buffers with positive charge, indicating at these higher pHs diffusion dominated buffer transport.\nIn two-chamber microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) with anion exchange membranes (AEMs), a phosphate buffer solution (PBS) is typically used to avoid increases in catholyte pH as Nernst equation calculations indicate that high pHs adversely impact electrochemical performance. However, ion transport between the chambers will also impact performance, which is a factor not included in those calculations. To separate the impacts of pH and ion transport on MEC performance, a high molecular weight polymer buffer (PoB), which was retained in the catholyte due to its low AEM transport and cationic charge, was compared to PBS in MECs and abiotic electrochemical half cells (EHCs). In MECs, catholyte pH control was less important than ion transport. MEC tests using the PoB catholyte, which had a higher buffer capacity and thus maintained a lower catholye pH (<8), resulted in a 50% lower hydrogen production rate (HPR) than that obtained using PBS (HPR=0.7 m3-H2 m-3 d-1) where the catholyte rapidly increased to pH=12. The main reason for the decreased performance using PoB was a lack of hydroxide ion transfer into the anolyte to balance pH. The anolyte pH in MECs rapidly decreased to 5.8 due to a lack of hydroxide ion transport, which inhibited current generation by the anode, whereas the pH was maintained at 6.8 using PBS. In abiotic tests in ECHs, where the cathode potential was set at \u20131.2 V, the HPR was 133% higher using PoB than PBS due to catholyte pH control, as the anolyte pH was not a factor in performance. These results show that hydroxide ion transport through AEM to control anolyte pH is more important than obtaining a more neutral pH catholyte.\nMFCs cannot effectively treat wastewater with low a COD, so a post-treatment is usually needed for polishing MFC effluent. Anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactors (AFMBRs) use granular activated carbon (GAC) particles suspended by recirculation to effectively treat low strength wastewaters (\u223c100\u2013200 mg L\u22121, chemical oxygen demand, COD), including MFC effluent, but the effluent contains dissolved methane. An aerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor (AOFMBR) was developed to avoid methane production and the need for wastewater recirculation by using rising air bubbles to suspend GAC particles. The performance of the AOFMBR was compared to an AFMBR and a conventional aerobic membrane bioreactor (AeMBR) for domestic wastewater treatment over 130 d at ambient temperatures (fixed hydraulic retention time of 1.3 h). The effluent of the AOFMBR had a COD of 20 \u00b1 8 mg L\u22121, and a turbidity of <0.2 NTU, for low-COD influent (153 \u00b1 19 and 214 \u00b1 27 mg L\u22121), similar to the AeMBR and AFMBR. For the high-COD influent (299 \u00b1 24 mg L\u22121), higher effluent CODs were obtained for the AeMBR (38 \u00b1 9 mg L\u22121) and AFMBR (51 \u00b1 11 mg L\u22121) than the AOFMBR (26 \u00b1 6 mg L\u22121). Transmembrane pressure of the AOFMBR increased at 0.04 kPa d\u22121, which was 20% less than the AeMBR and 57% less than the AFMBR, at the low influent COD. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated a more uniform biofilm on the membrane in AOFMBR than that from the AeMBR biofilm, and no evidence of membrane damage. High similarity was found between communities in the suspended sludge in the AOFMBR and AeMBR (square-root transformed Bray\u2013Curtis similarity, SRBCS, 0.69). Communities on the GAC and suspended sludge were dissimilar in the AOFMBR (SRBCS, 0.52), but clustered in the AFMBR (SRBCS, 0.63).\nAlthough the production of dissolved methane can be avoided in AOFMBR, the process is energy intensive due to the large air flowrates. In addition, ammonia nitrogen is not effectively biologically removed in either AFMBRs or AOFMBRs. Membrane aerators were added into an AFMBR to form an aerated membrane fluidized bed membrane bioreactor (AeMFMBR) capable of simultaneous removal of organic matter and ammonia without production of dissolved methane. Good effluent quality was obtained for domestic wastewater (193\u00b123 mg/L and 49\u00b15 mg-N/L) treatment, with non-detectable suspended solids (<2 mg/L), 93\u00b15% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal to 14\u00b111 mg/L, 89\u00b17% of soluble COD removal to 13\u00b111 mg/L, and 74\u00b18% of total nitrogen (TN) removal to 12\u00b13 mg-N/L. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations were always low (< 1 mg-N/L) during continuous flow treatment. The ammonia removal rate (AR) was higher with continuous flow treatment than fed batch operation, higher for a synthetic wastewater compared to a domestic wastewater, but independent of the hydraulic retention time. Membrane fouling was well controlled by fluidization of the granular activated carbon (GAC) particles as shown by a low transmembrane pressure (<3 kPa). No methane was detected in the treated effluent (<0.5 mg/L). Analysis of the microbial communities suggested that the nitrogen removal was due to nitrification and denitrification based on the presence of microorganisms associated with these processes.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15622], "author_name_tesi": "Ye, Yaoli ", "last_name_ssi": "Ye", "first_name_ssi": "Yaoli", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "Christopher Aaron Gorski", "Rachel Alice Brennan", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Dissertation Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Chair", "Christopher Aaron Gorski, Committee Member", "Rachel Alice Brennan, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bioelectrochemical systems", "hydrogen", "membrane bioreactor", "membrane aerator", "membrane fouling control", "polymeric buffer", "simultaneous organic and nitrogen removal", "buffer retention", "post-treatment", "microbial electrolysis cell", "microbial fuel cell", "Nernst-Planck equation", "migration", "Ion transport", "microbial community analysis", "granular activated carbon particles", "effluent dissolved methane", "nitrification and denitrification"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The role of motivation affecting the influence of narratives and exemplification in health messages.\n", "id": "23721", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10833", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Health messages are designed to get people\u2019s attention and persuade them to adopt recommended health behaviors.
