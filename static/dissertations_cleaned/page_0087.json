Under the theoretical framework of coercion theory, cognitive social learning theory, and coping competence theory and the conceptual framework of dynamic systems theory, the study had the following specific aims: (1) to determine whether individual aspects of maternal functioning and child functioning, which may function as possible control parameters under a dynamic systems framework, influenced both initial levels and changes in children\u2019s aggressive behavior in predicted directions; (2) to determine whether patterns of interaction discriminated between mother-child interactions of dyads with aggressive preschoolers and comparison dyads in predicted ways; and (3) to exploratorily determine whether individual maternal and child characteristics which predicted changes in aggression over time were related to differences in mother-child interaction patterns. Participants were clinically aggressive and comparison preschool boys and their mothers, who were recruited by Speltz, Greenberg, and DeKlyen (1990, 1995) for the larger \u201cDevelopmental Risk for Disruptive Behavior Disorders\u201d study.  Child ODD, ADHD and CD diagnostic criteria were determined via a multi-informant assessment. Maternal characteristics were assessed via self-report questionnaire measures, and child IQ and verbal fluency were assessed via child performance measures. Interaction variables were determined through microscopic coding of videotaped mother-child interactions.  HLM and synergetics analyses were used to test the specific aims and capture the dynamic, interactive nature of childhood aggression.  Results revealed that these analytic techniques provided additional information relative to that provided by traditional parametric analyses.  Maternal efficacy and child ADHD emerged as the best predictors of changes in ODD symptoms.  Dyads differed in predicted ways in their interactions and many of these differences were also related to maternal efficacy and child ADHD. Results provide preliminary evidence that a dynamic systems perspective on aggression development enhances the understanding provided by a coercion theory perspective by providing an explanation for discrepant findings.  Results are discussed in light of their conceptual and clinical implications.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2634], "author_name_tesi": "Nissley-Tsiopinis, Jenelle D.", "last_name_ssi": "Nissley-Tsiopinis", "middle_name_ssi": "D.", "first_name_ssi": "Jenelle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jean E Dumas", "Keith E Nelson", "Cynthia Stifter", "Brian A Rabian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jean E Dumas, Committee Chair", "Keith E Nelson, Committee Chair", "Cynthia Stifter, Committee Member", "Brian A Rabian, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["preschool", "aggression", "mother-child interactions", "coping competence theory", "dynamic systems theory", "coercion theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "CPU- and GPU-Based Triangular Surface Mesh Simplification", "id": "13892", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7303", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mesh simplification and mesh compression are important processes in the realms of computer graphics and high-performance computing, as they allow the mesh to take up less memory.

Identifying the sources of disruption risks in a supply chain, quantifying and mitigating disruption risks, have become important areas of research in the last decade. \nIn this thesis, a combined inventory and transportation model considering disruption risks for a four-stage, global supply chain is developed. Multiple modes of transportation, each with different lead times and freight rate structure, are modeled. Disruption risk is quantified by means of risk indices that are computed separately for each site and the different transportation modes (ocean, road, rail and air) using subjective decision making tools, including AHP, ranking and Borda count methods. The risk indices are then used in a multi-objective mathematical programming model that aims at maximizing the profit of the entire supply chain, while simultaneously maximizing responsiveness and minimizing disruption risks. \nPreemptive and non-preemptive goal programming methods are employed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The problem is illustrated using a realistic data set and the resulting solutions are analyzed. The findings and their managerial implications are also discussed.

Recently, several emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies, such as Phase Change Random Access Memory (PCRAM or PCM), Spin Torque Transfer Random Access Memory (MRAM or STT-RAM), and Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM), have been studied intensively as potential candidates for the next generation memory technologies. Among all of these emerging technologies, ReRAM has been demonstrated with excellent scalability beyond the 10nm technology node, fast speed with <10ns access latency, and capability of high density due to the multi-level cell (MLC) and cross-point array structure.\n\nHowever, there are several challenges before ReRAM can be adopted as a viable commercial main stream technology. First, cell-level non-uniformity, which is caused by the process variation and stochastic switching mechanism of resistance switching materials, requires a worst-case design methodology. The worst-case design results in a significant waste of energy consumption and the degradation of performance. Second, at array-level, although the cross-point structure is effective in improving the memory density, its inherent disadvantages, such as sneak current and voltage drop along metal wires, introduce extra design challenges. Third, as an emerging memory technology, ReRAM-based main memory lacks architecture-level exploration and optimization.\n\nThis dissertation proposes to model and architect a low cost and high performance ReRAM-based main memory with optimization methods from both circuit-level and architecture-level. First, a mathematical model is built to evaluate reliability, energy consumption, area overhead, and performance for ReRAM at array-level. Second, based on the mathematical model, we conduct a design space exploration and propose an architecture-level ReRAM main memory design. Third, we introduce a design flow and provide key insights into architectural tradeoffs of ReRAM chips among different array structures and cell parameters.

The initial step of energy audits is to collect the building energy use data. The data collection supports the development of the baseline energy modeling, which is used to determine potential energy savings of potential energy conservation measures. However, there are few standards to define the data collection for energy audits, which makes it difficult to perform an energy audit at the initial stage and to leverage the information exchange to benefit downstream energy modeling.  This research evaluated the information exchange between energy auditing data collection and the computerized energy modeling based on the content analysis of current public energy audit data collection templates and widely used energy modeling software input. The average data alignment between the two steps was only 31%. The inconsistent level of detail of the information was suggested to be one of the reasons for the low alignment of data. \n\tTo address the issue, a Level 1 or walk-through energy audit data collection and energy modeling input protocol was developed to define the information exchange scope and data transfer requirements.

These rhythms are regulated by internal circadian clocks including the master clock located in the central nervous system and peripheral clocks present in most tissues. Light and timing of feed availability are regarded as the major environmental factors that entrain the circadian rhythms of animals. Specifically, many physiological variables are known to follow a circadian pattern in the dairy cow including feed intake, body temperature, locomotor activity, plasma insulin, urea, cortisol, and growth hormones.\nThe objective of the first experiment was to determine the effect of feeding time on milk production and the circadian rhythm of feed intake and plasma hormones and metabolites in dairy cow. Treatments for this experiment were cows fed 1 x/d at 0830 h or 2030 h and fed 2 x/d in equal amount at 0830 and 2030 h. Daily feeding activities of dairy cow including meals conditioned to feed delivery within 2 h after feeding and spontaneous meals at the other time of the day were observed by an automated feed observation system. Time of feeding had a large impact on the size of conditioned meals, but only a modest effect on the pattern of spontaneous meal. Feeding at night increased the conditioned meal and insulin secretion after feeding and resulted in decreased plasma glucose after feeding and decreased plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) during the overnight period. This experiment demonstrated that time of feeding can reset the circadian rhythms of feeding intake and plasma hormones and metabolites of dairy cows, however, little impact on daily dry matter intake (DMI) and milk production were observed. \nThe objective of the second study was to determine the effect of offering total mixed rations (TMRs) that differed both in fiber and fermentable starch concentration during the high intake or low intake period of the day on milk production and the circadian rhythm of feed intake and plasma hormones and metabolites in dairy cows. Diets were control (Con; 30.7% NDF, 24.5% starch), a low forage and high fermentable starch diet (L; 27.4% NDF, 31.7% starch), and a high fiber and lower fermentable starch diet (H; 31.7% NDF, 22.3% starch). The L and H diets were balanced to provide the same composition as the control diet when combined in a 1 to 3 ratio of L to H. Treatment was feeding control diet at 0700 h (Con), H diet at 0700 h and L diet at 2200 h (HL), and L diet at 0700 h and H diet at 1100 h (LH). The L and H diets were offered in a 1 to 3 ratio, respectively. There was no treatment effect on daily dry matter intake, but LH decreased milk fat concentration and yield compared to HL. The circadian rhythm of fecal neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and indigestible neutral detergent fiber (iNDF) concentration was only detected for Con and LH, but not for HL. In addition, HL increased the conditioned meal and post-feeding insulin secretion and resulted in the loss of NEFA and glucose rhythmicity and a decrease in the amplitude of the rhythm of insulin and blood urea nitrogen. This experiment demonstrated that feeding two TMRs with differed in fiber and starch level and starch fermentability can reset circadian rhythms in dairy cows. Furthermore, feeding a low forage and high fermentable starch diet during the low intake period of the day may stabilize rumen function over the day.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8995], "author_name_tesi": "Niu, Mutian ", "last_name_ssi": "Niu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mutian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin John Harvatine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin John Harvatine, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["feeding time", "diet composition", "circadian rhythm", "dairy cows"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CONTROL MECHANISIMS OF MULTI-FINGER GRASPING\n", "id": "11245", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6651", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Object manipulation with the hand is a complicated task for the central nervous system (CNS). In numerous investigations of multi-finger prehension (reviewed in Zatsiorsky and Latash 2004, 2008), it has been found that the CNS simplifies control by employing stable patterns of conjoint changes in finger forces and moments of force, called prehension synergies (PSs).  Although PSs have been comprehensively studied in a series of customized experiments, certain aspects of them have not been well-addressed in current literature. To cover this deficiency, we investigate: (1) the effect of transcrainial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the stability of multi-finger prehension synergies, the relationship between the background magnitude and TMS-induced changes, and the applicability of the principle of superposition under these conditions; (2) the effect of grasping force magnitude on prehension synergies, including a test of the scale invariance hypothesis for multi-finger prehension; (3) the applicability of a newly-developed inverse optimization method (analytical inverse optimization, ANIO) to multi-digit grasping, including a comparison with other optimization methods; and (4) the reproducibility of both multi-finger prehension over time, and the associated optimization cost functions. \nA series of experiments have been performed, and the following conclusions have been reached: (1) the TMS-induced changes in normal forces, tangential forces and moments of force were proportional to the background force/moment magnitudes; (2) the restoration of prehension patterns after TMS involved two phases: synergy restoration (i.e., the restoration of the correlation between elemental variables) and force magnitude restoration; (3) observations of PS restoration time after TMS supported the principle of superposition in human hand grasping; (4) the scale invariance hypothesis was confirmed only for zero-torque tasks, and rejected for tasks with torque; (5) the inverse optimization problem for force-sharing among fingers could be solved using the Analytical Inverse Optimization (ANIO) method, creating good agreement with the experimental observations; (6) reproducibility of PSs and the reconstructed cost functions over time was confirmed for multi-finger prehension; and (7) the planarity of finger forces in multi-finger prehension was valid for all subjects over time; the 2nd order coefficients of the cost function, Ki, had a linear relationship with finger force averages. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6648], "author_name_tesi": "Niu, Xun ", "last_name_ssi": "Niu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vladimir M Zatsiorsky", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky", "Mark Latash", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Andris Freivalds", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vladimir M Zatsiorsky, Dissertation Advisor", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky, Committee Chair", "Mark Latash, Committee Member", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["synergy", "optimization", "grasping"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Does the H67D HFE genotype impact macrophage phenotype and disease process?", "id": "14595amn185", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14595", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Iron homeostasis is tightly regulated to prevent disease resulting from too little or too much iron within the body. The HFE protein is involved in iron regulation and when mutated it is associated with several iron-related disorders. In particular, the H63D HFE mutant variant is the most prevalent HFE mutation in the Caucasian population. Although HFE is known to modulate iron homeostasis through its interaction with transferrin receptor (TfR), its precise role in iron metabolism and cellular function remain unclear. One cell type in the body whose function may be especially impacted by the HFE mutation is the macrophage. Macrophages play critical roles in iron regulation through scavenging and recycling of iron, providing a mechanism to both reduce and reallocate excess iron. The effects of perturbed iron regulation in macrophages in neurodegenerative disease progression is not yet established. Here, this thesis aims to investigate the role of HFE in macrophage function, and determine how HFE mutant macrophages contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Parkinson\u2019s Disease. We hypothesize that the H67D macrophages would have altered iron handling and inflammatory response, promoting Parkinson\u2019s progression.\nTo investigate the role of H67D genotype on macrophage phenotype, bone marrow macrophages from H67D mutant mice were generated and compared to wildtype derived macrophages for the status of iron related proteins, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and macrophage-related cell functions (i.e. migration and phagocytosis). The H67D macrophages had increased levels of L-ferritin, but no significant differences in TfR or ferroportin, indicating differences in iron handling specifically in the resting state. In addition, H67D macrophages functionality was altered as they displayed decreased migration, and increased phagocytosis\niii\nactivity compared to WT. The H67D macrophages also expressed increased levels of chemoattractant proteins and decreased inflammatory cytokines.\nThe alterations in macrophage function with the HFE mutation could impact the role of these cells in neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, we generated a Parkinsonism mouse model using paraquat to selectively target and induce the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons within the nigrostriatal pathway. In this model, we found WT mice had impaired motor function, and decreased number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons, whereas the H67D mice showed no motor impairment following exposure to paraquat. Surprisingly, the mice with the H67D mutation had a significant reduction in TH neurons in both treated and untreated mice compared to WT. Thus, the HFE mutation was associated with significant loss of TH neurons but this loss was not increased by paraquat. The loss of these neurons could be the result of a developmental flaw or due to an initial stressor that led to neuroprotection; which is discussed in the final chapter.\nThe third chapter used the same paraquat model to determine if there was a genotype effect of cholesterol or statin exposure. Cholesterol and statin have been proposed as agents that progress Parkinson\u2019s Disease. Moreover, the H63D/H67D mutation is associated with disruption in cholesterol metabolism. The results showed that the cholesterol diet negatively affected motor function of WT mice when injected with paraquat, however there was no effect on motor function with a statin diet. The H67D mice have no change in motor function when on either a cholesterol or statin diet indicating the H67D genotype is resistant to the toxic effects of cholesterol. In addition, a statin diet does not exacerbate the results of paraquat induced neurotoxicity.\niv\nv Our results show that the H67D genotype plays a role in iron and immune response of\nmacrophages but also can be neuroprotective in a Parkinsonism disease model possibly due to the initial stress exerted by the macrophages. Overall, these findings encompass a complete role of H67D from periphery to a disease model. The H67D mouse model can further be used to interrogate the mechanism for the neuroprotection against exposure to paraquat and to cholesterol plus paraquat.

Here, I study factors involved in triggering and maintaining reproductive changes in honey bee queens. These changes can be regulated by multiple factors including manipulation of the reproductive tract, insemination volume, and seminal fluids. In honey bees, carbon dioxide, which is used as an anesthetic during instrumental insemination, can also trigger post-mating changes. Previous studies on honey bees suggest that insemination volume and seminal fluid components both play a role in triggering queen post-mating changes. However, these studies only examined changes in newly mated/inseminated queens and did not directly uncouple the effects of volume and substance.  The long-term effects on queens that have reached their final reproductive state \u2013 egg-laying \u2013 had not been previously characterized. \nBy manipulating the mating process I examined the factors causing immediate behavioral changes and longer-term physiological and molecular changes in queens that reached their final reproductive state of high ovary activation. In chapter 1, I examined the behavioral (mating flights and egg-laying), physiological (ovary activation), and molecular (gene expression) changes in the queens treated with CO2 alone and queens treated with both CO2 and physical manipulation.   In chapter 2, I used the same parameters to characterize the queens inseminated with low and high volumes of either semen or saline. My data indicate that CO2, physical manipulation of the genital tract, and insemination volume  cause early behavioral changes, while seminal fluid components play a role in maintaining long-term physiological and transcriptional changes. \nMating also causes changes in production of queen pheromones which are important for regulating the behavior and physiology of workers, as well as overall colony organization. Therefore, an important question is whether or not mating quality can have long-term effects on pheromone production as well as on queen-worker interactions. Indeed, in chapter 3 I found that the above mentioned factors have distinct effects on two different pheromone producing glands in queens, and workers can detect these differences. Furthermore, in chapter 4 I demonstrated that the queen insemination volume affected worker behavior and physiology in colonies, as well as queen overwintering survival. \nIn conjunction with previous studies, my results show that multiple factors are involved in regulating short- and long-term post-mating changes in honey bee queens.  More importantly, in social insects, this not only affects the reproductive female, but can alter social interactions in entire colony by altering pheromone communication systems. The results of my dissertation will lead to improved breeding techniques of honey bees and other agriculturally important insects, and it will also provide fundamental insights into insect reproduction in general.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7166], "author_name_tesi": "Ni\u00f1o, Elina Lastro", "last_name_ssi": "Ni\u00f1o", "middle_name_ssi": "Lastro", "first_name_ssi": "Elina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christina M Grozinger", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster", "James Harold Marden", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "Anita Collins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christina M Grozinger, Dissertation Advisor", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster, Committee Member", "James Harold Marden, Committee Member", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Committee Member", "Anita Collins, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["honey bee queen", "mating", "reproduction", "pheromone", "semen", "instrumental insemination"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "GENETIC MAPPING OF RESISTANCE GENE ANALOGS IN AN INTERSPECIFIC POPULATION OF TOMATO SEGREGATING FOR EARLY BLIGHT RESISTANCE", "id": "6253", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1523", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-11-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Limited sources of genetic variation exist within the cultivated tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., for resistance to one of its most destructive foliar diseases, early blight (EB), which is caused by the imperfect fungus Alternaria solani Sorauer. Current breeding strategies are trying to identify specific chromosomal regions in wild tomato relatives carrying genes that significantly contribute to an enhanced resistance response. The introgression of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for EB resistance into the cultivated varieties is greatly facilitated by innovative molecular approaches such as marker-assisted selection (MAS). \nA recent trend in crop breeding is the utilization of gene-markers with assigned functions or putative roles in the expression of the trait under evaluation. Plant resistance genes (R-genes) are some of the most attractive gene-markers because of their direct involvement in vertical resistance and their presumed contribution to quantitative and non-specific resistance. In the past few years the structural similarities between R-gene proteins have been efficiently exploited in the identification, mapping and cloning of new R-gene analog (RGA) sequences and specificities. \nA purpose of this study was to develop PCR-based markers by using the conserved domains of proteins encoded by R-genes as template for primers capable of detecting RGAs in tomato. Ninety-nine polymorphic marker loci were detected after the separation of the total amplification products of these primers by high-resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These markers were added to a genetic map of tomato which was previously developed in our laboratory based on a BC1 population of a cross between a L. esculentum (EB susceptible) and a L. hirsutum (EB resistant) lines. The mapped markers were initially considered as RGAs because of their observed resemblance to R-genes\u2019 genomic organization and their coincidence with the locations of QTLs for EB resistance in the genetic map. A second purpose of this study was to determine whether the markers mapped in the tomato BC1 population corresponded to regions of R-genes or R-gene analogs. For this purpose, all markers were isolated from dried gels, cloned, sequenced and compared to the thousands of nucleotide and protein sequences stored in the GeneBank. Blast homology searches revealed that, despite their genomic organization and coincidence with R-genes and QTLs, very few of the markers were genuine RGAs. \nThese results indicate that, contrary to what has been continuously assumed and reported by other investigators, most markers produced by R-gene-derived primers are not in fact R-gene analogs. However, the R-gene primer approach appears as a valuable tool for the development of new molecular markers and saturation of targeted chromosomal regions such as QTLs for disease resistance. Furthermore, while the nature of clustering of these markers remains unclear, the R-gene primer approach may provide useful markers associated with QTLs for use in MAS. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1508], "author_name_tesi": "Ni\u00f1o-Liu, David Orlando", "last_name_ssi": "Ni\u00f1o-Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "Orlando", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Majid R Foolad", "John Edward Carlson", "Richard Craig", "Mark Guiltinan", "Seogchan Kang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Majid R Foolad, Committee Chair", "John Edward Carlson, Committee Member", "Richard Craig, Committee Member", "Mark Guiltinan, Committee Member", "Seogchan Kang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tomato", "molecular breeding", "disease resistance", "molecular markers", "RGAs"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "In Search of El Dorado?

Worse, critics tend to minimize both the role of French imperialism and the strength of African cultures as they read these works. Their analyses raise the broad question of just how African migration literature can be interpreted to reflect the social realities which frame the action of the protagonists who are most vulnerable to France's contradictory immigration policies.  Drawing on the concept of tragedy as both a genre and as a philosophical framework, I analyze four novels that convey the stories of francophone African immigrants to Europe. These are Fatou Diome\u2019s Le Ventre de l\u2019Atlantique, Alain Mabanckou\u2019s Bleu Blanc Rouge, Bessora\u2019s 53 cm and Nathalie Etok\u00e9\u2019s Un amour sans papiers.\n\nThe study reveals that the novels\u2019 characters, style and narrative progression indicate the authors\u2019 attempt to simultaneously articulate the suffering of poorer African migrants and appeal to the Republic to redress it. The search for a middle ground between Africa and France minimizes the Republic\u2019s pursuit of power at the cost of African lives. This result contradicts the tragic imperative that the powerful actors receive blame for the suffering of the most vulnerable members of society. The unsuccessful attempt at neutrality also reflects the paradoxical situation of Africans who use the French language to articulate the dilemmas in which the Republic is heavily implicated. \n\nThis study thus proposes a model of criticism that acknowledges the role of migrant experiences, African traditions and critics\u2019 personal inclinations in the experience of and narratives about migration to France. It complements works by Jean-Paul Sartre, Frantz Fanon and Lewis Gordon that call on intellectuals to accept their implication in pressing social issues and to situate events on a global stage. The study also emphasizes the need to include a range of social, historical and environmental factors in determining the causes of injustice. Above all, it presents reality based criticism as an alternative to literary criticism dominated by theoretical concerns that often minimize the challenges of every day life.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6530], "author_name_tesi": "Njoya, Wandia ", "last_name_ssi": "Njoya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wandia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Albert Hale", "Christine Clark Evans", "Jennifer Boittin", "Pius Adesanmi", "Ambroise Kom"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Albert Hale, Committee Chair", "Christine Clark Evans, Committee Member", "Jennifer Boittin, Committee Member", "Pius Adesanmi, Committee Member", "Ambroise Kom, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["African Literature", "France", "Immigration", "Francophone Literature", "Tragedy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Impacts of Legal Status and Residential Contexts on Mexican Immigrants' Post-migration Experiences", "id": "29584", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12725", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The overarching objective of this dissertation is to advance scholarship on immigrant families by investigating whether and how post-migration residential contexts affect family formation among Mexican immigrants. I draw from multiple scholarly perspectives\u2014urban sociology, the sociology of immigration, and family sociology\u2014to incorporate neighborhood effects into the study of family formation in an immigrant population. Moving beyond the acculturation framework, which explains immigrants\u2019 experiences in terms of individual-level changes, this dissertation emphasizes two major axes of stratification with profound implications for Mexicans: legal status and post-migration neighborhood contexts (Glick 2010b; Massey and Bartley 2005). \n\tAcross three studies, I first examine theories and innovative methods regarding neighborhood effects and apply them to the study of families. In the second chapter, I review neighborhood effects theories and empirical limitations to introduce the concept of activity spaces, which captures the actual spatial exposures of individuals rather than their residential contexts. In the third chapter, I examine Mexican-origin adults\u2019 subjective assessments of neighborhood quality. Using the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A.FANS), I examine the types of neighborhoods in which Mexican adults reside and use a multilevel framework to analyze how neighborhood types are associated with neighborhood perceptions. Results demonstrate that there are five qualitatively distinct types of neighborhoods Mexican-origin adults reside in: Mexican immigrant enclaves, Mexican ethnic communities, ethnic ghettos, non-Hispanic white neighborhoods and Asian immigrant enclaves. Locational attainment models show that Mexican immigrants\u2019 legal status is a critical factor in neighborhood type: undocumented Mexican immigrants are most likely to reside in Mexican immigrant enclaves and least likely to reside in non-Hispanic white neighborhoods. In terms of neighborhood perceptions, residing in immigrant enclaves is associated with a higher level of perceived neighborhood danger, while it is associated with a lower level of collective efficacy. In the fourth chapter, I examine how residing in a Mexican immigrant marriage market and legal status are associated with three family formation transitions: the transitions to marriage, cohabitation, and singlehood. Results show that residing in a Mexican immigrant marriage market is associated with higher odds of making all three types of family transitions. Such findings illustrate that it is indeed important to move beyond individual characteristics to consider the influence of neighborhood context to understand Mexican-origin adults\u2019 family formation transitions. In short, this dissertation demonstrates the importance of post-migration neighborhood contexts and legal status for understanding Mexican-origin adults\u2019 family formation transitions in the United States.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11933], "author_name_tesi": "Noah, Aggie Jooyoung", "last_name_ssi": "Noah", "middle_name_ssi": "Jooyoung", "first_name_ssi": "Aggie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy S Landale", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa", "Barrett Alan Lee", "Mayra Y Bamaca", "Tse Chuan Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy S Landale, Dissertation Advisor", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa, Committee Member", "Barrett Alan Lee, Committee Member", "Mayra Y Bamaca, Committee Member", "Tse Chuan Yang, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Immigrant", "Families", "Neighborhoods", "Activity Spaces"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Modeling Mental Workload with Eye Tracking Using Latent Profile Analysis", "id": "q237hr938", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12930", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Supervisory process control occupations present real challenges to maintaining the proper level of mental workload of human operators. Although it is known that both underloading and overloading can lead to serious consequences, a feasible technology has not been implemented to measure and track operator workload within this type of dynamic environment. This is partially due to the fact that the construct of mental workload, and the measurement of it, is not universally agreed upon. Eye tracking technology and methodology presents an opportunity to clarify how mental workload is conceptualized and measured. The significance of eye tracking, compared to other measurement methods, is that it can be most easily implemented in real work environments causing minimal to no interference. In this dissertation, three research questions were investigated to address the problem statement that mental workload is not currently measurable in today's control rooms. \n\nThe first question was formulated into Hypothesis 1: Eye-tracking metrics can be related to mental workload in a process control monitoring task. Experiment 1 was conducted to investigate various eye-tracking metrics within a simulated process control task using 48 operators from industry. Among other findings, three primary pieces of evidence were found to support Hypothesis 1. Several eye-tracking metrics were found to be in agreement with NASA TLX (subjective workload) for a secondary task (Multi Attribute Task Battery); participants felt less workload as the experiments progressed and this was also indicated by less fixations and shorter fixation durations. The second finding was that while performance was improved in low complexity scenarios, participants also transitioned between tasks more frequently in low complexity scenarios. The third finding was that several eye-tracking measures were consistent with showing reduced workload in a schematic display while also showing improved performance, both occurring during low complexity scenarios. These measures which corresponded to reduced workload included: shorter mean fixation durations, longer total saccade durations, longer mean saccade durations, and lower fixation/saccade duration ratios.\n\nThe second research question was formulated into Hypothesis 2: Mental workload is dynamic within a process monitoring task, and this can be detected with specific eye-tracking metrics. Eye-tracking data from Experiment 1 was further analyzed to investigate this hypothesis. It was found that both blink rate and pupil size could be used to track the cognitive load of operators over time. Lower blink rates resulted in lower cognitive load as a sharp drop was observed within the first three minutes of scenarios. It was suggested that this is an indication of an orientation phase at the start of scenarios. Additionally, the blink rate increased while participants responded to situation awareness questions. This also supports the interpretation made that cognitive load increased during this time. Pupil size was shown to explain higher workload in high complexity tasks, and in conducting the second experimental trial (from a possible learning effect). NASA TLX also showed this effect for trial. Pupil size also showed continuously decreasing slopes over the duration of the task scenarios. This was suggested to explain overload conditions, which would cause pupil constriction. In overload situations, participants would start to give up by putting forth less effort, reducing their workload. This, however, was not conclusive. What was evident is that change in workload was detected over time by variations in pupil size. Finally, it was found that NASA TLX was not as sensitive as pupil size, as it did not capture a difference in scenario difficulty.\n\nThe third research question was formulated into Hypothesis 3: A specific set of eye-tracking metrics can be used to profile an individual\u2019s cognitive workload dynamic experience, which in turn, can explain an individual\u2019s level of success in a process control monitoring task. Experiment 2 was designed and conducted to model mental workload as a latent construct within eye movement. The intention for this was two-fold. First to use the modeling to better explain how and why individuals experience mental workload. Secondly, to demonstrate an alternative method to measure mental workload that can provide benefits above existing methods. \n\n45 participants conducted a process monitoring task using the Multi Attribute Task Battery (MATB) with only the System Monitoring and Resource Management tasks enabled. Each participant conducted three complexity-level scenarios (low, medium, hard) in blocked-random order so that 15 participants experienced a different sequence set. A head-mounted binocular eye tracker recorded gaze at 60Hz for each of the 6-minute MATB scenarios. NASA TLX was recorded after each scenario as measures of perceived workload. Task performance on MATB was determined by applying equal weight to both tasks. A pilot test of 15 participants was conducted first to verify that: 1) low and high complexity scenarios differed in demand and performance results, 2) one 6-minute scenario was sufficient to overcome a learning effect, and 3) 15 participants per task sequence (3x15=45 total) provided enough statistical power.\n\nLatent Profile Analysis was conducted to produce a five-profile model based on the following five eye-tracking metrics: mean fixation duration, blink rate, transitions between MATB tasks, pupil size variation, and mean saccade velocity. Out of the five profiles modeled, two were significant in size, Profile 3 (n=25) and Profile 4 (n=12). The remaining profiles only contained 1-3 participants and were considered outlier groups. Statistical analyses resulted in Profile 3 outperforming Profile 4 participants along the following measures: MATB overall performance, MATB Resource Monitoring task, NASA TLX, a fast counting (subitizing) cognitive test, and a 2-back memory cognitive test. Additionally, no significant confounds were detected for: basic demographic difference, education level, vision health, computer/videogame experience, or task sequence for complexity order.\n\nProfile 3 performed better and had less perceived workload. Additionally, Profile 3 contained preferred eye-tracking metrics \u2012which differed from Profile 4\u2012 so that the metrics were consistent with the literature on what direction represents reduced workload. It was found that the modeling produced two distinct typologies which all demonstrated a preference for Profile 3. It is suggested that the results contribute to both theory and application of mental workload. This is because the identified profiles can be broken down into characteristics which demonstrate validity on multiple fronts.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12086], "author_name_tesi": "Noah, Benjamin ", "last_name_ssi": "Noah", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ling Rothrock", "Ling Rothrock", "David Arthur Nembhard", "Andris Freivalds", "Richard Alan Carlson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ling Rothrock, Dissertation Advisor", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Chair", "David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Carlson, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mental Workload", "Eye Tracking", "Process Control", "Supervisory control", "Cognitive workload"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "\"i didn't want that!\" An Experimental Study on Deceptive Online Post-transaction Marketing Offers", "id": "21525", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9882", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Post-transaction marketing offers are often designed to mislead consumers into purchasing products that are only tangentially related to their primary purchase. These products are presented directly following the completion of legitimate first-party transactions. To sell these offers, marketers use deceptive tactics that include illegally acquiring data from merchants and exploiting cognitive psychology. These practices are not only unpopular with consumers, but are possibly illegal. A US Senate report released in 2009 estimated that between 1999 and 2009 over 35 million people were misled into purchasing offers that they did not want and did not use. Due to the lack of regulations, and the global nature of the Internet, these deceptive practices are far from being extinct. In order to address this problem, this thesis presents a scenario, based on actual cases, where a small music shopping site has partnered with a third-party marketer to show post-transaction marketing offers to consumers. After a successful primary transaction in the music store, customers are automatically redirected to a post-transaction offer.  The goal of this thesis is to examine the effectiveness of two ways of intervening to mitigate the harm of the deceptive post-transaction offer. This problem can be addressed from the perspective of the first-party e-commerce site or the perspective of the third-party marketers. This thesis presents the results of two experiments, each with over 450 participants, which test solutions from these two perspectives.  The first experiment highlights the difficulty in reducing the harm of post-transaction offers from the first-party merchant perspective \u2013 only the strongest intervention significantly reduced the likelihood of participants purchasing a post-transaction offer. The second experiment empirically tests how different presentations of post-transaction offers play a role in how many participants purchase the offers.

Different selectivity of C-O bond cleavage of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin between the reactions with OA and TMAH was demonstrated, and the sequential combination of OA and TMAH treatments exhibited an enhancing effect on conversion of biomass, which proves the promise of the proposed concept. A similar enhancing effect of combination was further confirmed in the reactions with mineral acid and base. \nInterestingly, characterization of solid residue from reactions of biomass and further investigation of the reactions of commercial cellulose revealed that the A-B sequence (the first reaction with OA and the second with TMAH) enhanced the conversion of cellulose at the second step with TMAH. It was suggested from the NMR and XRD study of solid residues that this enhancement was caused by the reduction of crystallinity of cellulose by the first reaction with OA. This effect was shown to be an interesting feature of A-B treatment sequence for converting lignocellulosic biomass. To improve the yield of monomeric sugars, the effect of adding organic solvents to the system was also studied. No improvement on sugar yield was observed under the explored conditions.

For the case of 2Na+&#8594; Ba2+ exchange, Na-2-mica and Na-ETS-4 had high preference for Ba2+ over Na+ with most of the equilibrium solutions used. Na-2-mica showed higher selectivity for Sr2+ and Ba2+ than Na-3-mica and Na-4-mica because of higher expansibility of Na-2-mica resulting in easier accessibility to exchange sites in interlayer space than the other two micas. This expansibility was limited by increasing electrostatic attraction with the increase in intercalated divalent cations. In the case of 2Na+ &#8594; Hg2+ exchange reaction, Na-ETS-4 was found to have higher distribution coefficient (Kd) value than any other ion exchangers tested. The Kielland plot for Hg2+ showed that only Na-ETS-4 had selectivity for mercury (II) with most of the exchange solutions used. 2Na+ &#8594; Co2+exchange equilibria revealed that Na-2-mica and Na-ETS-4 had high selectivity for cobalt ions over sodium ions at low Co equivalent fraction in the solid phase.\nTwo different (001) phases of ~12 \u00c5 and ~14 \u00c5 were seen in the XRD patterns of the Na-micas after 2Na+ &#8594; M2+ (M=Sr, Ba, Hg) exchange reactions with different exchange solutions. This difference in the d001-value suggested the presence of adsorbed divalent cations with different hydration states in interlayer space after ion exchange reactions, because of partial dehydration of intercalated cations by strong electrostatic attraction between adsorbed cations and negatively charged layers. Both the extent of divalent cations intercalated and layer charge density affected the attractive electrostatic force. As the uptake of adsorbed divalent cations in the solid phase and the layer charge density increased, the electrostatic attraction increased contributing to the increase in the extent of the dehydration of cations intercalated. Unlike other cases, after 2Na+ &#8594; Co2+ exchange reaction, strong ~14 \u00c5 phase of Na-2-mica was retained even at high Co2+ uptake, while ~12 \u00c5 phase decreased as the amount of Co2+ increased. This is due to stronger hydration energy of Co2+ ions than those of Sr2+, Ba2+and Hg2+ ions. The results on cation exchange properties of the above ion exchangers indicated that Na-2-mica and Na-ETS-4 could be excellent ion exchangers for separation and remediation of radioactive species such as Sr2+ and Ba2+ while only Na-ETS-4 would be useful for decontamination of Hg2+.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6923], "author_name_tesi": "Noh, Young Dong ", "last_name_ssi": "Noh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Young Dong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sridhar Komarneni", "Sridhar Komarneni", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Carmen Enid Martinez", "Della M Roy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sridhar Komarneni, Dissertation Advisor", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Chair", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Carmen Enid Martinez, Committee Member", "Della M Roy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mica", "Titanosilicate", "Ion exchange", "Selectivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Phase Behavior And Flow Analysis Of Shale Reservoirs Using A Compositionally-extended Black-oil Approach", "id": "27487", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11668", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Pore sizes are on the order of nanometers for shale and tight rock formations.  Such small pores can affect the phase behavior of in-situ oil and gas owing to increased capillary pressure.  Not accounting for increased capillary pressure can lead to inaccurate estimates of ultimate recovery. In this research, capillary pressure is coupled with phase equilibrium equations and the resulting system of nonlinear fugacity equations is solved to present a comprehensive examination of the effect of small pores on saturation pressures and fluid properties.  The results show, for the first time, that accounting for the impact of small pore throats on PVT properties explains the inconsistent GOR behavior observed in tight formations. The small pores decrease bubble-point pressures and either decrease or increase dew-point pressures depending on which part of the two-phase envelope is examined.  \nTo estimate production from shale reservoirs, a simulation model should be designed to account for the effect of high capillary pressure on fluid properties. We have chosen to use a compositionally-extended black-oil approach since it is faster and more robust compared to a fully compositional simulation model. Black-oil fluid properties are calculated by flash calculations of the reservoir fluid.  Allowing for a variable bubble-point pressure in black- or volatile-oil models requires a table of fluid properties be extended above the original bubble-point. We calculate continuous black-oil fluid properties above the original bubble-point by adding a fraction of the equilibrium gas at one bubble-point pressure to achieve a larger bubble-point pressure. This procedure continues until a critical point is reached. Unlike other commonly used methods, our approach provides a smooth and continuous pressure-composition curve to the critical point. If another component is added, the model further allows for injection of methane or CO2 to increase oil recovery.  Further, the approach allows the use of black-oil or volatile-oil properties for tight rocks where capillary pressure affects hydrocarbon phase behavior. \nThe compositional equations (gas, oil, and water components) are solved directly with principle unknowns of oil pressure, overall gas composition, and water saturation. Flash calculations in the model are non-iterative and are based on K-values calculated explicitly from the black-oil data. The advantage of solving the black-oil model using the compositional equations is to increase robustness of the simulations owing to a variable bubble-point pressure that is a function of two parameters, namely gas content and capillary pressure. Leverett J-functions are used to establish the effective pore size-Pc-saturation relationship. The input fluid data to the simulator are pre-calculated fluid properties as functions of pressure for three fixed pore sizes. During the simulation, at any pressure and saturation, fluid properties are calculated at the effective pore radius by using linear interpolation between these three data sets. Our results show that there is up to a 90% increase in recovery when capillary pressure is included in flash calculations. Reservoir initial pressure, reservoir permeability, initial water saturation, and critical gas saturation are among the factors influencing the increase in recovery due to the effect of capillary pressure.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11157], "author_name_tesi": "Nojabaei, Bahareh ", "last_name_ssi": "Nojabaei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bahareh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns", "Russell Taylor Johns", "Turgay Ertekin", "Luis Ayala", "James Terry Engelder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns, Dissertation Advisor", "Russell Taylor Johns, Committee Chair", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Luis Ayala, Committee Member", "James Terry Engelder, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Shale reservoirs", "phase behavior", "reservoir flow simulation", "capillary pressure"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Effects of Ignoring Hierarchical Data Structure on Factor Analytic Models", "id": "21823", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10052", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Educational research often involves hierarchical or nested data such as students nested within classrooms.

However, the ability to perceive bitterness differs across individuals due to genetic variation within bitter receptor genes (TAS2Rs). The goal of the present thesis is to investigate effects of bitter receptor polymorphisms on liking and perception, of reported bitterness and sweetness of non-nutritive and the remembered liking of different alcoholic beverages. The work presented here compares genotypes for putatively functional polymorphisms in bitter receptor genes in attempt to explain individual differences. Major experimental findings include: Study 1- Polymorphisms (SNPs) in bitter receptors TAS2R9 and TAS2R31 explains 13.4% of the variation in the perceived bitterness from Acesulfame K (AceK). Study 2 - The non-nutritive sweetener rebaudioside A (RebA) elicited greater perceived bitterness than rebaudioside D (RebD), with no difference in sweetness intensity. SNPs that were previously reported in Study 1 to explain AceK bitterness were not associated with perceived bitterness of RebA or RebD. Study 3 - Liking ratings for non-sweet alcoholic beverages were associated with TAS2R38 diplotype. However, the diplotype failed to predict liking for sweet alcoholic beverages. This latter finding was as anticipated, as we would not expect TAS2R38 to meditate liking or intake for foods or beverages where mixture suppression removes bitterness. Together these findings expand the understanding of individual differences in taste perception with the respect to polymorphisms within taste receptor genes. With this knowledge, researchers and product developers may be better positioned to explore consequences of genetic variations, to further expand the relationship associated with intensity, liking and intake, and to develop tailored products.

Many chemesthetic agents are regularly consumed, including capsaicin, ethanol, menthol, mustard oil, cinnamonaldehyde, and piperine. Psychophysical responses to these compounds have been well investigated in terms of chemesthetic sensations (e.g. the burn of capsaicin); however, little is known regarding their secondary qualities, mainly taste responses. \nThe first section of this dissertation will explore the chemesthetic and taste sensations from capsaicin and ethanol. Both of these stimuli are consumed regularly, with capsaicin being the active ingredient in chili peppers while ethanol is a key component in alcoholic beverages, both of which are widely used by numerous peoples around the world. \nPsychophysical response to these compounds is known to vary greatly across concentrations and individuals. Here, I will establish dose response functions for both ethanol and capsaicin, reporting on both burning and bitterness response to these stimuli. I will then take two different approaches to investigate individual differences in bitterness response. The first approach will explore single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in bitter taste receptor (TAS2Rs) and transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) genes. Multiple bitter compounds are known to vary in the bitterness they evoke due to variability within bitter taste receptor genes (TAS2Rs). Whether similar effects are seen for TRPV1 agonists will be tested here. \n Second, I will explore the influence of prior experience with and exposure to these stimuli on the sensations they evoke, as differences in response to capsaicin and ethanol have been attributed to intake frequency of chili peppers and alcohol, respectively. Several theories have been proposed in order to explain reduced responses, including differences in scale usage due to dissimilarities in prior experience, greater familiarity with the compound or, genetic variability in chemosensory receptors. For ethanol, the difference in response will be explored across consumption, but additional research is needed to investigate the mechanism further. In the case of chili pepper intake, reduced responses to capsaicin are widely believed to be due to hypoalgesia or desensitization. \nNumerous studies show that perceptual responses to capsaicin are reduced following repeated intermittent exposure to a constant concentration; this phenomenon is commonly known as capsaicin desensitization, but is more accurately called hypoalgesia. Hypoalgesia to capsaicin, and other compounds (e.g. menthol and zingerone) is thought to be unique to chemesthetic agents. Hypoalgesia can be conceptualized as being acute or chronic, depending on the duration of reduced response, with acute hypoalgesia occurring within a test session while chronic hypoalgesia lasts across days. Here, we are interested in the effects of repeated capsaicin exposure, and the development of chronic capsaicin hypoalgesia. There are several purported mechanisms that may result in acute hyperalgesia, including depletion of substance P and calcium ions. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding the mechanism(s) that result in chronic capsaicin hypoalgesia.\nTo gain insight into the mechanism(s) leading to chronic capsaicin hypoalgesia, I investigate the mRNA expression of TRPV1. TRPV1 is activated by both capsaicin and ethanol, along with other exogenous and endogenous compounds. I describe the variability of TRPV1 expression in human oral tissue as a function of capsaicin exposure, which may provide an explanation for chronic capsaicin hypoalgesia. These results have the potential to translate to human health, as patients with oral cancer and burning mouth syndrome are known to have increased mRNA expression of TRPV1 in lingual tissues. Understanding this mechanism of hypoalgesia and TRPV1 regulation may help to inform future treatments to reduce TRPV1 expression and possibly reduce inflammation and pain. \nThis dissertation is focused on extending our knowledge of the psychophysical response to chemesthetic stimuli and exploring the effects of repeated exposure on perception. Here, I investigate how individual differences in response to stimuli associate with prior intake along with genetic variability in chemosensory receptors. I evaluate TRPV1 mRNA expression in humans and explore whether variability in expression is associated with capsaicin response and development of capsaicin hypoalgesia. To do so, the dissertation is broken down into four aims, which are detailed here.\nThe first aim is to determine the response to capsaicin and ethanol across a wide range of concentrations. Developing a dose response curve for these two stimuli is important in order to determine appropriate concentrations for subsequent research. These stimuli were examined for their variability in burn and bitterness responses, while also exploring whether reported intake of foods containing these compounds is associated with their perception. \nThe second aim is to explore the relationship between the variability of the reported burn and bitterness of sampled ethanol and individual\u2019s genetic differences in TRPV1 and TAS2Rs. My findings complement prior work showing a relationship between alcoholic beverage intake and genetic variability in TAS2Rs by providing novel data on the variation of sensations from ethanol with TAS2R SNPs. This is also the first report linking differences in ethanol sensations to variability in the TRPV1 gene. \nThe third aim is to determine the extent of the effects of repeated capsaicin exposure on the perceptual responses to capsaicin. This will be evaluated i) by measuring self-reported intake free-living individuals and ii) in controlled experiments where participants are systemically and repeated exposed to capsaicin. The development of a robust capsaicin exposure protocol is essential to achieving our fourth aim. This is the first evidence of chronic hypoalgesia after participants rinsed with low concentrations capsaicin for two weeks.\nThe fourth aim is to determine if capsaicin hypoalgesia, brought on by either dietary chili pepper intake or controlled repeated capsaicin exposure, is associated with a decrease in TRPV1 expression. The relationship between capsaicin exposure and TRPV1 expression will be explored in two different studies, the first will use free-living participants and collect self-reported intake of chili peppers, and the second will use a laboratory controlled exposure protocol. These experiments will explore the relationship between TRPV1 mRNA expression with the perceived burn of sampled capsaicin and the effects of capsaicin exposure. The second study will be designed to measure the change in expression following repeated oral exposure to capsaicin, in order to determine if the development of hypoalgesia is associated with a down-regulation or decrease in TRPV1 expression. This will be one of the first studies to explore the effects of dietary exposure on expression of chemosensory receptors, and the first related to capsaicin and the TRPV1 receptor. \nThe findings from this dissertation have the potential to influence multiple areas of inquiry. For example, the dose response curves generated from aim one can influence development and design of sensory studies exploring responses from chemesthetic agents. Aims 3 and 4 have the potential to inform the development of new therapies or treatment options for patients with oral pathologies associated with altered TRPV1 expression, including burning mouth syndrome or oral cancer. Furthermore, these findings may provoke additional research in other systems and organs that could impact other chronic inflammatory diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome.

If so, do differential effects contribute to increasing achievement gaps between high and low achievers?  3) Do the effects of ability grouping vary by schools or classrooms?   4) Do the effects of ability grouping vary by students\u2019 initial abilities and schools or classrooms?  The ECLS-K dataset is used, which consists of a nationally representative sample of kindergarteners.  Findings suggest that although first-grade reading ability grouping has no significant effects on the average reading achievement for the population as a whole, ability grouping effects are found to vary by student initial abilities and school characteristics, but not classroom characteristics.  Ability grouping leads to higher achievement for all students in schools that are least likely to practice ability grouping.  In these schools achievement inequalities may be reduced because stronger effects are found among low initial ability students.  In contrast, ability grouping leads to lower achievement particularly for students with low and middle initial abilities in schools that are more likely to practice ability grouping.  This suggests increasing achievement inequalities in these schools.  The schools with positive ability grouping effects are likely to be non-public, smaller, and more homogenous in student cognitive and behavioral characteristics.  They also have higher SES, fewer racial minorities, and students with better reading skills than schools with negative ability grouping effects.  I argue that school contexts, particularly ability distributions, are key factors both as the determinants and consequences of ability grouping practices.

These include the ndhB gene, which, encodes a subunit of the type I NADH dehydrogenase, the petJ1 gene that encodes cytochrome c6, the petJ2 gene that encodes a putative second c-type cytochrome, the bcpA gene which encodes a putative blue-copper protein, the hoxH gene which encodes the large Ni containing subunit of the hydrogenase enzyme, the hoxF gene which encodes the FMN containing subunit of the hydrogenase enzyme, the ctaDI gene, which encodes the large subunit of the type I cyanobacterial cytochrome oxidase, and the ctaDII gene, which encodes the large subunit of a secondary heme-copper oxidase in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002.  This study found that the ndhB and petJ1genes are essential for the viability of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and therefore could not be inactivated.  The hoxH, hoxF, petJ2, bcpA, ctaDI, and ctaDII genes are all non-essential to Synechococcus sp. PCC 702 under normal growth conditions and could be inactivated.  \n\tPhysiological studies of the hoxH, hoxF, petJ2, and bcpA inactivated strains of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 revealed that there were no significant phenotypes under the conditions tested.  However, evidence has been found in this study that the heme-copper oxidase enzymes encoded by the ctaCIDIEI and ctaCIIDIIEII gene clusters have significant roles in respiration, high-light tolerance and oxidative stress responses in Synechococcus sp.

This dissertation contextualizes the socio-spatial significances of their usages of cell phones by exploring three aspects of consumption geographies: 1) multiple meanings associated with ownership, use patterns, and experiences; 2) personal management of communication systems which cell phones are part of and; 3) social negotiations involved with using cell phones in different socio-spatial contexts. Central to the examination of these topics is the issues of mobility, extensibility, and surveillance. This study contributes to the growing number of studies on cell-phone consumption and on young people and technology in two respects. First, it offers empirical findings on the practices, the meanings, and the experiences associated with cell-phone consumption by university students attending two Pennsylvanian campuses through the analysis of data collected through both survey questionnaires and personal interviews. The data compiled are assessed qualitatively and quantitatively and triangulated with a textual analysis of university publications across the nation. Second, in the light of the empirical findings, this research provides discussions on the social constructions of youth and technology by drawing upon and fusing theories and frameworks found primarily in the fields of young people\u2019s geographies and studies of the social dimensions of technologies. I illustrate how uses, meanings and experiences associated with consumptions of cell phones are related to students\u2019 various identities and lifestyles, often reinforcing and defying various stereotypes. In addition, this work also highlights how the management of personal cell-phone uses revolves around aspects of residential and familial circumstances, cost, and the degrees of openness and aspirations of students to social connectivity. Finally, I discuss how various social negotiations involving young people in domestic settings, campus spaces, transitional spaces, and public roads involve different levels of monitoring processes. Their cell-phone ownership and usages are both legitimized and problematized according to the perceived and actual \u201cnecessity,\u201d \u201ccompetency,\u201d and degree of \u201cpersonal freedom.\u201d \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3629], "author_name_tesi": "Nomura, Kaori ", "last_name_ssi": "Nomura", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kaori", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deryck William Holdsworth", "Lorraine Dowler", "John Philip Jenkins", "C Gregory Knight"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deryck William Holdsworth, Committee Chair", "Lorraine Dowler, Committee Member", "John Philip Jenkins, Committee Member", "C Gregory Knight, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["young people's geography", "cell phone", "information and communication technology", "mobility", "extensibility", "surveillance"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Gender and Climate Change in Nepal", "id": "13113", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "585", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Climate change discourses, including Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, have focused on differential climatic risks and impacts among different social groups of people. From a gender perspective, women in developing countries are considered more vulnerable than men due to their limited access to resources in comparison to men. However, overemphasis on women\u2019s limited resources or lower capacities often leads to the stereotyped view of women as helpless victims and undermines their coping strategies. It is also problematic to view women as a universal group of the vulnerable, ignoring the intersection of gender with other socioeconomic factors of class, caste/ethnicity, and age. \n Findings from the author\u2019s field research in 2009 in two flood-prone communities in Nepal show some key implications of gender and climate change. In these sites, vulnerability and adaptive capacity were firmly shaped by the structural inequality of gender, caste/ethnicity, and age. People\u2019s experiences and risk perceptions varied by different adaptive capacity, including location, economic status, educational levels, and access to information and technology. Vulnerable people, including poor women and lower caste/minor indigenous groups, struggled with on-going economic crises other than climatic changes. Unlike biased views, some vulnerable people resisted against climatic and economic crises with their indigenous knowledge and networks.\n In the context of climatic changes, gendered responsibilities, space, and access to resources changed with women\u2019s decision-making power and limited control over resources exacerbated. While many men were free from climatic and economic risks due to their migration or engagement in labor work, women left at home took double responsibilities and were still exposed to both risks. Poor uneducated women particularly suffered from food shortage and financial burdens. These findings indicate that without transforming unequal power relations, vulnerable men and women will fell into further deficit. The climate adaptation policies that fail to challenge unequal power relations in everyday life may exacerbate the existing structural inequality and generate long-term food insecurity problems. This dissertation calls for urgency that policy makers recognize and integrate the actual implications of gender and climate change.

Art historians have argued that artists exploited photography, video, and other time-based media to negotiate these concepts, but they often overlook the importance of printmaking during this period. In this thesis, I argue that printmaking operated in the same way as other reproductive media, and artists found the process to be receptive to similar explorations. This dissertation, specifically, analyzes the manner in which pressed indices and the subsequent reproduced signs describe, or trouble, conventions of gendered, nationalist, ethnic, and artistic identity, which came under increasing scrutiny during the 1960s and 1970s.

The electrical characterizations on both devices were investigated. Current \u2013 Voltage technique was used for finding the barrier height and the ideality factor. Capacitance \u2013 Voltage characterization technique is also used to obtain the value of the carrier concentration of both GaN and SiC SBDs and also. Thermally Stimulated Capacitance (TSCAP) graph was used on GaN SBDs device to detect the traps and their concentrations. Charge based \u2013 Deep Level Transients Spectroscopy (Q-DLTS) mechanism was applied to both GaN and SiC SBDs for the investigation of the deep charge trapping levels in both devices. The measurements employed included Schottky output characteristics at room temperature and at different temperature values.\nIt is concluded from the experiments that the barrier height for both devices is increasing with the increase of the temperature whereas the ideality factor is decreasing with the increase of the temperature. The values of the barrier height and the ideality factor of GaN Schottky diode are 0.35 eV and 1.2 at 120K and 0.93 eV and 0.47 at 430K, respectively. The value of the barrier height and the ideality factor of SiC Schottky diode are 0.36 eV and 1.5 at 120K and 1.14 eV and 0.4 at 430K, respectively. Three different regions were selected to calculate the carrier concentration of the SiC and GaN SBDs from the C-V characteristics at room temperature. The carrier concentration of the SiC remains constant through the three regions while the carrier concentration of GaN device increases as the reverse bias increases.

This work focused on how environmental conditions affect population growth, abundance, and seed bank persistence of M. vimineum, as well as its response to suppression measures.  \nPatches of M. vimineum were planted into five environments and monitored for four years.  Population growth tended to be highest in the roadside environment and lowest in intact forest, although due to the variability of the data, these differences were not significant.  Small-scale environmental variables, particularly soil moisture and pH, explained much of the variation in final patch size.  \nTo further investigate pH effects, field surveys compared M. vimineum along limestone and shale gravel roads. Soil pH along limestone roads was significantly higher than along shale roads as far as 25 m from the road edge.  M. vimineum occupied significantly more of the roadside area along limestone than along shale roads.\nTo evaluate the influence of the environment on management outcomes, herbicide and mechanical treatments were applied to M. vimineum populations along forest roads, disturbed forest, and wetlands, and plant communities were monitored for three years.  Selective herbicide in upland environments did little damage to non-target plant communities while adequately suppressing M. vimineum, but mowing was preferable in the wetland environment where the best permissible herbicide also suppresses the non-target plant community.\nA buried seed study in the same three environments was used to parameterize population matrix models.  Population parameters varied slightly between environments but did not result in different responses to the simulated herbicide scenarios.  Biocontrol via a recently discovered pathogen was not sufficient to suppress population growth; however, it allowed a longer interval between herbicide applications in logged and roadside environment.\nIn conclusion, M. vimineum populations do respond to various environmental factors, at least in some instances responding as a beneficiary of ecological changes rather than a primary driver of change.  The outcomes of M. vimineum suppression efforts are driven less by context-sensitive population dynamics than by the influence of environmental context on choice and efficacy of suppression tactics.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [312], "author_name_tesi": "Nord, Andrea Nafziger", "last_name_ssi": "Nord", "middle_name_ssi": "Nafziger", "first_name_ssi": "Andrea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A Mortensen", "David A Mortensen", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye", "Larry Hunter Mc Cormick", "Denice Heller Wardrop"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David A Mortensen, Dissertation Advisor", "David A Mortensen, Committee Chair", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye, Committee Member", "Larry Hunter Mc Cormick, Committee Member", "Denice Heller Wardrop, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["invasive plants", "plant ecology"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Patience is a virtue: Delayed phenology is an adaptive response for plants in soils with low phosphorus availability.", "id": "9246", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1712", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Annual plants confronting stressful conditions generally flower and mature order to\navoid stress.

Experts in the field of technology and education agree that for today\u2019s student to compete in this technologically powered global environment, students must have the necessary skills. These skills, referred to as 21st Century skills, include group problem solving, collaboration, creativity, and formal reasoning abilities. To provide students with these skills, the current learning environment must shift from a teacher-centered (didactic) environment to a student-centered (constructivist) environment. To facilitate this pedagogical shift, in 2006 Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell announced a three-year, $200 million Classrooms for the Future (CFF) initiative to provide technology and technological support in the form of professional development and technology coaches. However in 2008, an unanticipated additional challenge for schools came in the form of a global recession. This economic downturn led to funding limits for technology purchases. These funding limits directly resulted in cuts which made it difficult for schools to purchase and install all of the hardware recommended by the CFF initiative. The result of budgetary constraints was varying levels of technology implementation in the schools. Using data collected by the CFF evaluation team located at Penn State, this study will examine the technology levels (low to high) that schools were able to implement and if the amount of technology implemented had an impact on teacher practices. The primary research question is: are there differences in changes in reported teacher practices, moving from a teacher-centered to a student-centered environment, based on the levels of technology implemented into their classrooms?", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9054], "author_name_tesi": "Nordstrom, Patricia Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Nordstrom", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Patricia", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Priya Sharma", "Roy Clariana", "Rose Marie Baker", "Joan S Thomson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Priya Sharma, Dissertation Advisor", "Roy Clariana, Committee Chair", "Rose Marie Baker, Committee Member", "Joan S Thomson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["educational technology", "21st Century Skills"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Understanding the Influence of Parameter Modulation in Machining-based Processing", "id": "18102", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8607", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It is widely believed that the parameters of cutting speed and undeformed chip thickness can be used to influence the specific energy consumption of traditional machining processes. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the degree to which these two parameters affect the system load response (e.g. force, power consumption) \u2013 and in turn the specific energy consumption \u2013 when they are applied quasi-statically as well as dynamically. This was carried out experimentally using a CNC planer (to study the effects of cutting velocity) and a CNC lathe (to study the effects of undeformed chip thickness). Furthermore, this study purposed to ascertain whether the loading response of a system to dynamic parameter manipulation can be predicted based on a characterization of the system\u2019s response to static changes in the same parameter. This involved discretizing the time-varying cases and treating them as a continuous series of static cutting instances, each of which could then be assigned a predicted force value. Obviously, such a technique would only be effective if there is close agreement between the static and dynamic loading responses of the given system.\nAs a result of empirical testing, close agreement was found between the loading responses for static and dynamic variations in cutting speed for both AA6061-T6 and OFE Copper. When similar variations were applied to AA6061-T6 and Ti3Al2.5V in the direction of undeformed chip thickness, close agreement between static and dynamic loading responses was again found, but for low to moderate values of the processing parameter. These observations suggest that, for many materials, the nature of material response in low-frequency, modulation-assisted machining (MAM) is similar to that which occurs in conventional machining. Based on this similarity, it was also found that the general shape of the characterized load response to static parameter manipulation could be used to predict whether MAM would consume more or less specific energy than its conventionally cut counterpart. Specifically, MAM will generally require slightly more energy for dynamic changes in cutting velocity but significantly less energy for dynamic changes in undeformed chip thickness, as compared to conventional cutting. \n\nIt is suggested that further research be performed which incorporates dynamic changes in cutting speed and rake angle into the energy prediction model for MAM as applied in the direction of undeformed chip thickness. Finally, a further study may also make use of an intermediate variable, such as thickness of the primary deformation zone, as the predicted quantity for the dynamic cases. Such might provide insight as to the existence of a common physical mechanism underlying the energetics of both modulated machining configurations and would act as an extension of the research performed by Kececioglu [2,14].\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8489], "author_name_tesi": "Norman, Joshua Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Norman", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Christopher Saldana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Christopher Saldana, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["orthogonal", "cutting", "machining", "modulation", "MAM", "specific energy"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Assessment of Uncertainties in Atmospheric Transport and Surface Flux of Carbon from the North American Terrestrial Biosphere", "id": "14676cpn107", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14676", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The North American terrestrial biosphere acts as a strong sink of atmospheric CO2 and therefore plays a key role in the global carbon cycle. The atmospheric inversion approach is used to quantify the magnitude and distribution land-atmosphere carbon exchange, and requires accurate atmospheric transport and surface flux prior. We evaluate the relative sensitivity of simulated atmospheric total, biological, and fossil fuel CO2 mole fractions in the atmospheric boundary layer and integrated column over North America to changes in transport model and surface fluxes. We run three versions of a mesoscale model that incorporate different physics parameterization schemes and identical surface fluxes; we run the same mesoscale transport model with two different surface fluxes. All simulations are conducted for North America during 2008.\n\n Observed CO2 mole fractions reveal that seasonal amplitude ranges from 13 ppm in the West to over 34 ppm in the Midcontinent, and the models tested match these amplitudes to within a few ppm. Biology drives both the magnitude of the seasonal amplitude and regional differences in amplitude. Fossil fuels exhibit a seasonal cycle that is smaller than biological CO2, but not trivial. \n\nDuring the growing season, variations in surface fluxes yield mean differences in regionally, seasonally averaged atmospheric boundary layer total CO2 mole fractions that are larger for all regions than those resulting from varied transport model. The relative contributions of biological and fossil fuel to total mean difference CO2 show distinct quantitative patterns for varied flux and transport, and can provide information for attributing model-model differences in total CO2.  Seasonal amplitude is much greater in the ABL than in the integrated column.  Simulated total biological, and fossil fuel integrated column XCO2 are about 1/10th the magnitude of their signal in the atmospheric boundary layer. Flux and transport differences are also found in the integrated column at approximately 1/10th their atmospheric boundary layer values. While transport error is a significant problem for identifying terrestrial carbon fluxes, it is not an overwhelming one. Our work indicates that there is potential for remotely sensed integrated column XCO2 to distinguish between the flux signal and transport errors. Understanding transport error deserves more study, motivating current and future observational campaigns and modeling.\n\nWhile reducing transport uncertainty in atmospheric inversions has received considerable attention in recent years, quantification of carbon surface flux uncertainty remains a challenge. Model-observation studies can help identify model temporal and spatial limitations. To this end, we organize 166 CO2 flux tower measurement sites across North America by region, climate, and vegetation type into 23 groupings. The data span from 2000 through 2014 and are compared to output from eight atmospheric inverse estimates and 17 terrestrial biosphere models. We generate a mean year of observed and simulated net ecosystem exchange for each regional vegetation group and for each model. \n\nThe NOAA CarbonTracker inverse estimates, major carbon flux inverse products, almost always underestimate amplitude of the seasonal cycle (biased positive relative to observations) and have a small spread. Furthermore, the inversions don\u2019t typically improve upon the prior with respect to the observations. Groups characterized by large seasonal amplitudes are not well represented by the models. For these groups, drawdown is underestimated. The terrestrial biosphere models often encompass the observations, but may have too much model-model variability. No one model is best everywhere. Model performance varies by vegetation and location. Certain biomes are well represented, certain biomes are not, and some models are reliably better than others. In general, evergreen forests in the north and east are better represented by the models than grasslands or crops in the midcontinent and southwest. Our large-scale, regional approach to model-observation analyses provides insight into the vegetation- and location-dependent performance of many inverse and terrestrial biosphere model estimates of land-atmosphere carbon exchange. This can help inform selection and application of surface flux priors in future inversions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16086], "author_name_tesi": "Normile, Caroline Palmer", "last_name_ssi": "Normile", "middle_name_ssi": "Palmer", "first_name_ssi": "Caroline", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis", "Kenneth James Davis", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr.", "David R Stauffer", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Thomas Claude Yves Lauvaux"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth James Davis, Committee Chair", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Committee Member", "David R Stauffer, Committee Member", "Erica A H Smithwick, Outside Member", "Thomas Claude Yves Lauvaux, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["carbon dioxide", "forest carbon", "atmospheric boundary layer", "WRF", "North America", "terrestrial bisosphere", "fossil fuels", "eddy covariance"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "OZONESONDE CLIMATOLOGY AND SATELLITE PRODUCT  EVALUATION: TROPOSPHERIC OZONE IN THE MID-ATLANTIC FROM 2005-2010\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12356", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1112", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Geostationary satellite missions are proposed to remotely assess regional air quality over large swaths, although the precise capability of the current set of satellite instruments to accurately resolve urban scale pollution remains unverified.

In the horse specifically, the involvement of epithelial cell and tight junctional deterioration are hypothesized in the etiologies of laminitis induction, colic, and ulceration throughout the gastrointestinal tract. In this work, two forms of bovine colostrum were hypothesized to mitigate the predicted increase in gastrointestinal permeability induced by high starch, low forage diets in long Quarter Horse yearlings. In order to address this hypothesis, the optimization and validation of sugar absorption tests (SAT) in the horse as a measure of gastrointestinal permeability were performed. Nine Quarter Horse yearlings were utilized in a repeated Latin square design, which consisted of three 28 d periods. Each period contained one 14 d low concentrate high forage (LCHF) washout interval and one 14 d high concentrate low forage (HCLF) treatment interval. During the HCLF treatment intervals, yearlings were placed in one of three supplemental groups: whole bovine colostrum (WBC), concentrated bovine colostrum (CBC), or no supplement (NC), with each yearling receiving each supplement once throughout the study. Weekly fecal pH measurements were taken along with bi-weekly meal response measurements for both packed cell volume (PCV) and total plasma protein (TPP). At the conclusion of each two-week period a SAT was performed on each animal. Intricacies involving useful sugar marker dose, appropriate feeding protocol, urine collection and preservation, alditol acetate preparation for analysis, and protocols for gas chromatography with flame ionization detection of urine sugar markers have been included as a part of validation of this technique in the horse. The SAT involved a sixteen-hour fast followed by administration of sugar markers via nasogastric tube to initiate a 24-hour total collection of urine. Fecal pH was lower on the HCLF (6.53 \u00b1 0.04) diet in comparison to the LCHF diet (6.95 \u00b1 0.04) (P < 0.0001). Irrespective of diet, fecal pH was lower on day 14 than on day 7 of each interval (P < 0.0001).

All expanding green tissue is susceptible.  The influence of inoculum concentration, wetness duration and temperature at inoculation, cultivar, relative humidity, and daily internode expansion, were evaluated under controlled conditions. \nConsistent development of black rot shoot symptoms by artificial methods has been difficult.  A small humidity chamber was developed that promoted shoot infection and symptom development. Application of conidia at concentrations of 1x104 and 1x105 spores/ml promoted significantly (p<0.05) greater disease severity.  Pycnidium production was significantly higher at an inoculum concentration of 1x105 spores/ml on <i>Vitis</i> shoots, regression analysis of the instantaneous growth rate calculated from daily internode measurements (GRI) immediately after inoculation was significant (p=0.0350, R2=0.026) for the square root (SQRT) of pycnidia density (PD-- pycnidia/cm2) but not for symptom severity (DS) in the absence of the concentration terms in the analysis.  \nThe effects of temperature and surface wetness duration on the development of black rot of grape shoots by G. bidwellii conidiospores was evaluated on three cultivars, Niagara\u00af (<i>V. labrusca</i>),Chardonnay (<i>V. vinifera</i>) and Aurore (<i>V. labrusca</i> x <i>V. vinifera</i>).  Plants were inoculated at combinations of seven temperature levels (12C to 30C in 3C intervals) and six shoot wetness durations (10 to 30 hours in 5 hour intervals) and evaluated for black rot shoot symptom incidence, DS, and PD.  Symptoms did not develop at 12 and 30C at wetness durations less than 15 hours.  All other temperature treatments promoted disease development on shoot tissue with wetness durations of 10 hours or greater.  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analyses were used to determine linear, quadratic, or cubic functional relationships between temperature and shoot wetness duration and disease severity (%) and pycnidium density (pycnidia/cm2).  Significant terms were incorporated into a regression model to describe the relationship. \nSquare root transformed DS was significantly (p<0.0001) influenced by wetness duration, temperature and the interaction term.

Each cultivar was examined separately due to the significant cultivar response.  The response of Aurore and Chardonnay was significantly influenced by temperature.  At 24C significantly more pycnidia were produced than at any other temperature.  Wetness duration was significant for Niagara, 20 hours of wetness produced a significantly greater number of pycnidia than any other wetness period.  \nA refinement of the infection requirements was conducted on <i>V. vinifera</i> cv. Chardonnay grapes, a minimum of 7.5 hours of shoot wetness at 21C was suitable for infection. Disease severity and pycnidium density increased as leaf wetness increased at a given temperature.\nDS and PD were both significantly (p<0.0001) influenced by temperature, wetness duration, the average growth rate immediately after inoculation (GRA2) and the wetness-temperature interaction.  The growth four to five days after inoculation (GRA5) also significantly influenced shoot DS (p=0.003) and PD (p=0.0005).  \nTwo experiments looked at the susceptibility of <i>V. labrusca</i>, <i>V. vinifera</i>, interspecific hybrids, and <i>V. riparia</i> cultivars.  Eighteen cultivars were screened for DS and PD from shoot infections by conidia.  Cultivar significantly influenced  DS and PD (p=0.0001).  Individual runs differed in the order of the cultivars, but generally the <i>V. vinifera</i> cultivars, Riesling, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Chardonnay, <i>V.labrusca</i> Niagara, and the interspecific hybrid Aurore were significantly higher in disease severity than the other cultivars (p<0.05).    Pycnidium density (PD) was generally highest among the V. vinifera cultivars, the <i>V. labrusca</i> cultivar Niagara and the American hybrid cultivar Cayuga White. <i>V.labrusca</i> cultivar Concord, recognized as susceptible to black rot leaf and fruit infections, was not among the most susceptible cultivars for shoot infections.  \nThe influence of post infection relative humidity level (RH) on the development of shoot symptoms after inoculation and subsequent drying of foliage with G. bidwellii conidia was investigated.  There was a significant effect of relative humidity treatment for PD (p=0.038) but not for DS (p=0.3840).  PD was significantly greater when RH=86.1(sd 3.1%) (High), as opposed to RH=36.7 (sd 12.3%) (Low) for the first five days after inoculation, RH conditions five days after inoculation had no effect on PD.

This is especially true for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Pennsylvania where the Pennsylvania Sex-Age-Kill (PASAK) model is used to estimate annual abundance.  Historically, the PASAK model only provided point estimates of abundance.  However, statistically valid estimates of precision are needed to quantify uncertainty.  Additionally, assumption violations can incorporate bias into estimates, the extent of which is unknown.  I estimated survival and harvest rates based on data from 1,131 radio- or GPS-collared white-tailed deer and obtained harvest data (number killed, age-sex structure, etc.) to (1) evaluate assumptions of the PASAK model, (2) develop a method to estimate precision, and (3) evaluate model sensitivity and robustness.  \nThe PASAK model input parameters for the mature (\u00a1\u00dd 2.5 years old) male harvest rate, yearling (1.5 years old) male harvest rate, and percent yearling females in the adult (\u00a1\u00dd 1.5 years old) female population did not meet required assumptions.  Mature male harvest rates differed by as much as 32.8% among wildlife management units (WMUs) studied.  However, this spatial variability could be reliably modeled using a hunting effort index as a covariate.  I found difficulties in the current method used to estimate yearling male harvest rates.  However, direct yearling male harvest rate estimates from radiocollar data, which differed by < 16.5% among WMUs studied, provided a suitable alternative estimate.  In addition, variation in hunting effort was related to spatial variability in yearling male harvest rates.  Yearling female deer were nearly 50% more likely to be harvested than mature female deer, which caused the PASAK model to underestimate population size.\nMean coefficient of variation (CV) estimates by WMU, 14.1% in year t, were slightly above benchmarks recommended for managing game species populations          (\u00a1\u00dc 12.8%).  Doubling reporting rates by hunters or doubling the number of deer checked by personnel in the field would improve mean CVs in year t to recommended levels.  The PASAK model was robust to variability and bias in estimates for mature male harvest rate, female harvest rate, and non-harvest mortality.  However, model estimates were sensitive to variability and bias in yearling male harvest rates.  Consequently, yearling male harvest rate estimates had the greatest influence on the accuracy of population estimates. \nVery few studies have monitored spatial and temporal variability in male white-tailed deer harvest rates.  My results support the hypothesis that the majority of variability in mature male white-tailed deer harvest rates can be explained by variation in hunting effort.  Similar variability exists in yearling male harvest rates, however, antler point restrictions (APRs) in Pennsylvania limit the extent of variability.  Although minimized by APRs, yearling male harvest rate variability has profound influences on PASAK model estimates.  Because harvest rates in the PASAK model are assumed constant across years, potential influences of regulation changes or shifts in hunting practices that alter male harvest rates will have profound influences on model performance.  Yearling male harvest estimates are similarly important, and research to evaluate their accuracy will improve reliability of PASAK model estimates.  Increasing harvest reporting rates by hunters may be the most efficient approach to improve precision of harvest estimates, whereas similar improvements by increasing the number of deer checked and aged may be more difficult or expensive to achieve.  Independent estimates for the percent of yearling males in the adult male population will reduce the importance of yearling male harvest rate and harvest estimates. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [370], "author_name_tesi": "Norton, Andrew Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Norton", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach", "Duane R Diefenbach"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor", "Duane R Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["temporal variability", "spatial variability", "harvest rate", "bootstrapping", "Sex-Age-Kill", "ecology", "wildlife", "population modeling", "white-tailed deer", "Odocoileus virginianus", "deer", "sensitivity", "robustness", "Pennsylvania", "precision"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Micropublics: Mob Life in Antebellum American Literature", "id": "15437", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "7631", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Micropublics: Mob Life in Antebellum American Literature argues that mob activity, as it is represented in the imaginative literature of the antebellum period, helps to construct, maintain, and challenge the boundaries of liberal democracy, national belonging, gender identification, and racial formation in the years leading up to the Civil War. As avenues to political participation and forms of social belonging became ever more concretely stratified in the nineteenth century, mob life (the experience of mob activity transfused into literary art) describes the imaginative archive of the variety of ways individuals conceived of participating in their governance and of interacting with others. In this framework, mobs maintain and perpetuate forms of oppression (in the form of lynch mobs or anti-abolition rioting) while they also enable the disempowered to resist intermittently their marginal social and political positions. When antebellum authors took up mob activity, they also attempted to map the contours of liberal subjectivity\u2014both what would count as legitimately political within liberal democracy and what would be excluded from the liberal public sphere. In this way, mobs take on a micropublic character in that they interact with and range across a variety of publics and counterpublics, constructing a frightening other to liberalism\u2019s rational actors while offering a fuller range of possibilities for political practice. As mobs\u2019 micropublicity enters the aesthetic realm of imaginative literature, it draws attention as well to the tenuousness of generic categorization and implicitly argues for interpretations of aesthetic experience that focus on generic variety and mixture.

Broad patterns of variation between human populations tend to follow geographic clines that are highly correlated with the amount of UVR striking the surface of the earth.  Many have suggested that the broad patterns of human pigmentation variation reflect changes due to natural selection while others feel that sexual selection is a better explanation.  The purpose of this dissertation is to improve current understanding of localized patterns of pigmentation variation in Island Melanesia, the genes underlying that variation, and the potential role that natural selection has played in determining global patterns of pigmentation.  \nTo assess phenotypic variation across a localized geographic region I analyzed quantitative measures of skin and hair pigmentation in 1135 Island Melanesians.  While skin pigmentation variation in the region has likely been constrained by natural selection the patterns of variation that I observed within and between islands suggests that localized patterns of variation may have been influenced by genetic drift and/or sexual selection.  The population history of the region is characterized by intermittent waves of migration and long periods of isolation and drift in some islands.  This has led to complex population substructure across the region that complicates the interpretation of genotype-phenotype associations that I observed between the OCA2 and ASIP genes and skin pigmentation and the MC1R gene and hair pigmentation.  To control for this stratification in future studies I proposed a method using a panel of neutral markers that will be able to differentiate between different subpopulations in the region  \nPairwise locus-specific FST is used to detect signals of selection in six pigmentation candidate genes in six geographically diverse populations.  Four of the six genes show high pairwise FST values that may be indicative of population divergence due to selection.  All four were confirmed to be associated with normal skin pigmentation variation using admixture mapping.  I also typed these four loci in the CEPH-diversity panel to confirm these signals of selection.  Two of these genes, OCA2 and ASIP, are associated with pigmentation differences between lightly and darkly pigmented populations.  The distribution of the light and dark alleles at OCA2 A355G in the CEPH-diversity panel suggests that polymorphism at OCA2 may be quite old; the high frequency of the light OCA2 allele in the Khoisan sample is consistent with this interpretation.  The distribution of the light and dark alleles at ASIP A8818G in this sample set suggests that the ASIP dark allele is most common in Africa and occurs at much lower frequencies elsewhere, including at least some (but not all) Island Melanesian populations.  MATP and TYR show strong signals of European-significant divergence, suggesting that lighter skin in European populations may be due to mutations independent of those associated with lighter pigmentation in East Asian populations.  This is consistent with the genotyping results in the CEPH-diversity panel, which demonstrated that the light allele in each gene occurs at its highest frequency in Europe and declines rapidly as one moves east and south.  \nThis dissertation has highlighted the potential for localized variation in human skin and hair pigmentation to have been shaped by genetic drift or sexual selection while still being constrained by natural selection.  It has also demonstrated the importance of being able to control for population stratification in genotype-phenotype association studies.  Lastly, it used a locus-specific FST-based method to identify pigmentation candidate genes that may have been subject to selection.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2201], "author_name_tesi": "Norton, Heather Lynne", "last_name_ssi": "Norton", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynne", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Shriver", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss", "Jeffrey Arnold Kurland", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Shriver, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Arnold Kurland, Committee Member", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Island Melanesia", "natural selection", "skin pigmentation"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "PATRIOTS OR PARANOIDS?

One of the features of many stealth aircraft is a high aspect ratio rectangular nozzle that is mounted above the aircraft fuselage. This nozzle configuration allows the aircraft fuselage to shield the noise and other detectible properties generated by the jet engine. While this type of wall bounded jet produces a lower acoustic signature, it also introduces additional issues. The jet stream exiting the nozzle can travel at supersonic speeds and potentially generate shocks and expansion waves that impinge on the aircraft fuselage. Additionally, the turbulent eddies from the jet shear layer can impinge on the flight deck and produce additional unsteady forces on the aircraft. All of these forces can cause the deck to vibrate with a resulting decrease in the fatigue life of the structure. \nA coordinated project has been underway at the Pennsylvania State University in an effort to improve CFD predictions of unsteady aerodynamic loading generated by the exhaust of a rectangular jet on a deck downstream of the nozzle exit. Numerical simulations are conducted using Wind-US, a computational platform developed by the NASA Glenn Research Center and the Arnold Engineering Development Center. Parametric studies are carried out to investigate the effects of several numerical parameters, including time discretization, grid density, upstream forcing, turbulence dissipation and numerical schemes on the computed turbulent flow.  The impact of a boundary layer shield on the Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) solution is also investigated. The numerical models included a boundary layer stability preservation technique which combined a time accurate solution with a constant CFL solution in the boundary layer to maintain numerical stability, independent of the boundary layer spacing. Results from the LES running with the boundary layer preservation scheme showed a 20-fold decrease in wall-clock time compared to the fully time-accurate simulations. Numerical predictions characterizing the structural loading on the deck surface are compared to experimental values measured at the United Technology Research Center (UTRC). A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is applied to several of the CFD solutions to provide further insight into some of the non-physical behaviors found in the LES simulations running with the boundary layer stability preservation algorithm.

Anti-ram barriers put in place to protect structures from moving vehicles follow a different design, analysis, and construction approach than most structures due to the extreme nature of the vehicle impact load. In many situations, it is also important to consider aesthetic implications of anti-ram barriers when completing a design. Hollow structural section (HSS) steel members are very useful for the design of anti-ram barriers because of their efficiency in dealing with torsion or biaxial loads, and their aesthetic and architectural advantages. Certain types of load sharing configurations involving pierced HSS member connections and an HSS transfer member do exist as a nature of the HSS shapes, however their behavior under impact loading is largely undocumented. There existed a need to understand the use of these connections and transfer members parallel to the direction of impact in anti-ram barriers for load sharing purposes. A prototype structure using basic pierced HSS connections and an HSS transfer member was designed and its performance under vehicle impacts was examined parametrically. The prototype structure was designed using a basic plastic collapse analysis. Varied parameters included member sizes, piercing hole sizes, and connection orientation with respect to the piercing member. The prototype structure was examined using finite element (FE) analysis with modeling techniques selected from past modeling of full-scale crash tests and past literature. Additionally the FE models were validated against past full-scale tests of partially restrained moment connections. Results from the validated FE models that examined barrier behavior were presented in the form of member force time histories at important locations and via internal strain energy calculations. These results indicated that the use of a basic pierced HSS connection and HSS transfer member oriented parallel to the direction of impact effectively shared load between bollards in anti-ram barriers. In addition, recommendations for reducing member sizes when using the studied connection and transfer member are provided.

However, it is necessary that airflow simulation programs have correct boundary conditions which can be provided by energy simulation (ES) programs. In order to develop simulation tools for precise evaluations of thermal comfort and indoor air quality in buildings, the existing Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) airflow program is improved by adding new models for the calculation of thermal boundary conditions. Subsequently, this program is coupled with the newly-developed ES program.\n\nThis thesis considers different methods for coupling ES and CFD programs with particular attention given to boundary conditions on enclosure surfaces which connect the modeling domains of these two programs. Three different coupling approaches were investigated with special consideration given to accuracy and computation time. The results show that the Integrated Coupling Method provides the optimum compromise between accuracy and computation time.  \n\nIn order to improve the accuracy of the calculations of thermal boundary conditions on building internal surfaces, experiment-based convection correlations are implemented in the CFD program. In the process, new convection correlations are developed based on measurements conducted in a state-of-the-art experimental facility. Correlations for characteristic surfaces in rooms with: cooled ceiling panels, displacement ventilation, or high aspiration diffusers are developed. \n\nFurthermore, additional experiments are performed to collect data so as to validate new models for calculating thermal boundary conditions. A comparison of numerical and experimental results shows that the new models for thermal boundary conditions calculation, implemented in CFD, perform substantially better than wall functions. A certain level of grid dependency of heat flux calculation with new models still exists. However it is much smaller than with wall functions.\n\nFinally, this thesis provides examples, which demonstrate that the coupled ES and CFD program is an effective tool for the evaluation of energy consumption, thermal comfort, and air quality in buildings.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [334], "author_name_tesi": "Novoselac, Atila ", "last_name_ssi": "Novoselac", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Atila", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jelena Srebric", "Stanley Allan Mumma", "William P Bahnfleth", "John Harlan Mahaffy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jelena Srebric, Committee Chair", "Stanley Allan Mumma, Committee Member", "William P Bahnfleth, Committee Member", "John Harlan Mahaffy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermal comfort", "IAQ", "building analysis", "CFD", "energy simulation", "convection corelation"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Using Topological Constructs to Model Interactive Information Retrieval Dialogue in the Context of Belief, Desire, and Intention Theory", "id": "6586", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "926", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An internet search with a modern search engine involves iterations of composing a query, submitting the query to the search engine via a text box, reviewing the returned search results list for relevant web pages, and visiting potentially relevant web pages.

The survey gathered relevant subject background information, queries related to two different search tasks that were presented to the subjects, and subjects\u2019 intentions behind their queries with regards to recall and precision.  A total of 390 queries were collected from the subjects, of which 334 queries were unique.  The proposed distance measure was applied to the search results of those queries and statistical analysis was performed on the survey data to find correlations between query distances and subject background information, experience, and intentions.  The results indicate that query surveys show potential for learning more about search engine user behavior and that the proposed distance measure shows potential as a basis for developing internet search tools.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [918], "author_name_tesi": "Nowack, Craig Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Nowack", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Craig", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Eli Christopher C Byrne", "Natarajan Gautam", "Shankar Sundaresan", "Richard Donovan Koubek"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Chair", "Eli Christopher C Byrne, Committee Member", "Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member", "Shankar Sundaresan, Committee Member", "Richard Donovan Koubek, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["search engine", "dialogue", "topology", "queries"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "On  Multi-parameter Semimartingales, Their Integrals and Weak Convergence", "id": "17439", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8437", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates the weak convergence of stochastic integrals driven by processes defined on the plane.

Six yearlings, maintained on dry lot and were provided ad libitum access to <5% starch hay, were used in a crossover study design conducted over 12 weeks with four 21 day treatment periods. During periods 2 and 4, yearlings were split into 2 groups, with one group receiving high starch feed (~40% starch on a DM basis) and the other group receiving low starch feed (<10% starch on a DM basis). All yearlings received low starch feed in periods 1 and 3. Synovial fluid and plasma samples were collected every 21 days and analyzed using 2D PAGE and CPII, C2C and IGF \u2013 I specific ELISAs. Gel images were analyzed using Progenesis SameSpots software and select spots were chosen for mass spectrometry based on their level of significance and relationship to dietary treatment. Changes in protein expression ranged from a 1.2 fold \u2013 2.5 fold difference. Seven proteins were upregulated in response to dietary treatment. Four of the 7 proteins, identified as isoforms of IgG, were greater in synovial fluid from animals fed high starch feed. Two proteins, identified as isoforms of albumin, were greater in high starch feed samples.  Fibrinogen, haptoglobin, vitamin D binding protein and clusterin were greater in plasma compared to synovial fluid.  Alpha-1 antitrypsin and albumin were greater in synovial fluid compared to plasma. There were no significant differences in C2C or IGF \u2013 I between dietary treatments.  Proteins identified in this study initially do not have a clear mechanistic link with OC.  This study demonstrates an approach that may be useful in investigating changes in protein expression in plasma and synovial fluid that may affect joint health. The plasma and synovial fluid proteomic profiles and individual proteins identified here may be useful in future examination of the etiology of OC in horses. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1699], "author_name_tesi": "Nowelsky, Erin Ashley", "last_name_ssi": "Nowelsky", "middle_name_ssi": "Ashley", "first_name_ssi": "Erin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Staniar", "William Staniar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Staniar, Thesis Advisor", "William Staniar, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["osteochondrosis", "nutrition", "horse", "cartilage", "proteomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Chaucer, Gower and the Invention of History", "id": "7730", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5785", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Late fourteenth-century English writers of history and poetry understood rhetorical invention in two distinct but related ways. On the one hand, as a formalized process for creating and organizing written discourse, invention was the central principle for medieval thinking about textual composition. On the other hand, invention was a kind of historical act in its own right, a \u201cdeed\u201d constitutive of history. Invention offered a procedure by which particular chroniclers shaped their texts and, through them, their understanding of past events. Invention became a part of the topical material chroniclers treated as subject matter, and it presented a historical problem as serious as any other political or social issue. For English poets, invention likewise offered a structural framework for creating imaginative discourse. The creative potential of understanding invention at once as a textual and historical concept, though, receives its fullest treatment in the poetic exchanges of John Gower and Geoffrey Chaucer, two late-century English writers who take historical invention itself as a topic for narrative poetry. They do so by sharing historical topics in their inventions and by engaging each other\u2019s inventions in their poetry. Gower\u2019s poetry presents a dominant authorial persona whose poetics impose inventional control over the disparate narratives of history. Gower attempts to refigure his literary opus as a series of poetic res gestae, transforming poetic works into events constitutive of English history in order to rejuvenate English culture. Chaucer\u2019s later poetry critiques Gower\u2019s poetics both directly and indirectly, destabilizing Gower\u2019s model without offering a suitable replacement. Chaucer suggests the futility of poetry as a means of holistically rejuvenating supposed cultural decay, and he rejects Gower\u2019s construction of a dominating authorial persona.

The depth and temperature deficit of the imposed stable boundary layer, which together define the convective inhibition (CIN), are varied in a suite of simulations.\n\nWhen compared with a control simulation with little surface-based CIN, each supercell simulated in a stable boundary layer exhibits weaker low-level vertical vorticity and weaker low-level vertical velocity despite similar most unstable convective available potential energy (MUCAPE); in general, low-level vertical vorticity and vertical velocity decrease as CIN increases. It was found that while the presence of a stable boundary layer decreases low-level updraft strength, all supercells except those initiated over the most stable boundary layers had some updraft parcels with surface origins.  Furthermore, the existence of a stable boundary layer does not prohibit downdraft parcels from reaching the surface, though decreased negative buoyancy decreases downdraft speed. Trajectory and circulation analyses indicate that the weaker rotation at low levels is a result of the decreased generation of circulation at low levels coupled with decreased convergence of the near-ground circulation by weaker storm updrafts in the stable-layer scenarios.

This investigation uses coupled radiation and land-surface schemes within an idealized cloud model to identify the effects of organized boundary layer convection in the form of horizontal convective rolls (HCRs) on the strength, structure, and evolution of simulated supercell thunderstorms.  The influence of HCRs and the importance of their orientation relative to storm motion is tested by comparing simulations with a convective boundary layer (CBL) against those with a horizontally homogeneous base state having the same mean environment.  The impact of anvil shading on the CBL is tested by comparing simulations with and without the effects of clouds in the radiative transfer scheme. \n\t\nThe results of these simulations indicate that HCRs provide a potentially important source of environmental vertical vorticity in the sheared, near-storm boundary layer.  These vorticity perturbations are amplified both beneath the main supercell updraft and along the trailing outflow boundary, leading to the formation of occasionally intense misovortices.  HCRs perpendicular to storm motion are found to have a detrimental effect on the strength and persistence of the low-level mesocyclone, particularly during its initial development.  Though the mean environment is less supportive of low-level rotation with a wind profile conducive to HCRs oriented parallel to storm motion, such HCRs are found to often enhance the low-level mesocyclone circulation.  When anvil shading is included, stabilization results in generally weaker low-level mesocyclone circulation, regardless of HCR orientation.  Moreover, HCRs diminish in the near-storm environment such that the effects of HCRs on the supercell are mitigated.   HCRs are also shown to be a necessary condition for the formation of so-called \"feeder clouds\" and flanking line convection in these simulations.  These findings suggest potentially important ramifications regarding both non-mesocyclone and mesocyclone tornadoes in supercell thunderstorms in an environment with active boundary layer convection. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8724], "author_name_tesi": "Nowotarski, Christopher ", "last_name_ssi": "Nowotarski", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Markowski", "Paul Markowski", "Yvette Pamela Richardson", "Hampton Nelson Shirer", "Lyle Norman Long", "George Bryan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Markowski, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Markowski, Committee Chair", "Yvette Pamela Richardson, Committee Member", "Hampton Nelson Shirer, Committee Member", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member", "George Bryan, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supercell thunderstorms", "tornadoes", "simulations", "convective boundary layer", "atmospheric dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Studies on the post-transcriptional regulation of ornithine decarboxylase in non-melanoma skin cancer\n\n", "id": "11389", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5668", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is the first enzyme in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. Under normal physiological conditions, polyamine content and ODC enzyme activity are highly regulated.  Induction of ODC activity is an early step in neoplastic transformation. The studies described here use normal mouse keratinocytes (C5N cells), and spindle carcinoma cells (A5 cells) to explore the regulation of ODC synthesis in non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) development.  We see a marked increase in ODC enzyme activity in A5 cells compared to C5N keratinocytes, which correlates with ODC mRNA stabilization. These data suggest that ODC is post-transcriptionally regulated.  We sought to investigate whether the ODC transcript interacts with the RNA binding protein HuR, which is known to bind to and stabilize its target mRNAs. We show that HuR is able to bind to the ODC 3'UTR in A5 cells but not in C5N cells.  Immunofluorescence results reveal that HuR is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in A5 cells, while it is strictly nuclear in C5N cells.  Knockdown experiments in A5 cells showed that when HuR is depleted ODC RNA becomes less stable and ODC enzyme activity decreases.  Together, these data support the hypothesis that HuR plays a causative role in ODC upregulation during NMSC development by binding to and stabilizing the ODC transcript.  Additionally, we show that the destabilizing RNA binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP) binds to the ODC 3\u2019UTR.  Moreover, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in which TTP is deleted, we find that the ODC transcript is stabilized.  Finally, we show that the 3\u2019UTR and 5\u2019UTR of ODC contain cis-acting negative regulatory elements.  We demonstrate that luciferase activity is significantly lower in both C5N and A5 cells transfected with vectors that contain either the ODC 3\u2019UTR or 5\u2019UTR when compared to cells transfected with vectors that contain neither UTR.  Furthermore, the classical adenosine- and uracil- rich element (ARE) within the ODC 3\u2019UTR acts as a negative regulatory element.  The data in this thesis show for the first time that the ODC transcript is regulated by two trans-acting factors, HuR and TTP.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5664], "author_name_tesi": "Nowotarski, Shannon Lyn ", "last_name_ssi": "Nowotarski", "middle_name_ssi": "Lyn ", "first_name_ssi": "Shannon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa M Shantz", "Lisa M Shantz", "Sarah Bronson", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Scot R Kimball"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa M Shantz, Dissertation Advisor", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Chair", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Member", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HuR", "non-melanoma skin cancer", "ornithine decarboxylase", "polyamines", "TTP"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "essays on no commitment problems", "id": "25871", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11394", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation, which consists of three chapters, is about no-commitment problems.\nThe first two chapters are about reconsideration-proofness, which is a solution concept\nfor infinite-horizon decision problems in which a decision-maker cannot commit to future\nactions. The third chapter deals with a saving problem in which no-commitment also\nplays a role.\nNo commitment can be an issue when a decision maker at one point in time has a\nconflict of interest with himself at another point in time. A standard solution approach\nfor such problems treats the decision maker at different time periods as different selves\nplaying a noncooperative game, and then applies solution concepts in game theory.\nSubgame perfection has been used as one of main solution concepts (see, for example,\nLaibson (1994)). Though the use of subgame perfection is successful in capturing the\ncentral feature of the problems that the decision maker cannot bind future selves due to\nno commitment, it has been criticized for assuming a limited set of possible deviations\nand resulting multiplicity of equilibria. To address the problem, Kocherlakota (1996b)\nproposes a refinement which is called strong reconsideration-proofness. An attractive\nfeature of strong reconsideration-proofness is that the attained value at equilibria is\nunique and strong reconsideration-proofness refines subgame perfection to that extent.\nKocherlakota (1996b) defines reconsideration-proofness for settings without state\nvariables. And he showed for such settings that there exist equilibria that satisfy\nreconsideration-proofness. In chapter 1, I explore ways of extending the notion so that it\napplies to settings with state variables. Such an extension is important because many\nno-commitment problems have state variables. Chapter 1 starts with a seemingly natural\ngeneralization of strong reconsideration-proofness that applies to environments with state\nvariables. However, as I show, it leads to nonexistence in three examples. In the first\ntwo examples, existence can be recovered using a modification of the solution concept\nthat seems attractive. In the last example, nonexistence occurs even with the modified\nsolution concept. Insights about further research are derived from these nonexistence\nresults.\nEven in settings without state variables, no procedure or algorithm has been proposed\nfor computing reconsideration-proof equilibria. Chapter 2 provides such a procedure.\nThe procedure is applicable under an assumption about time-separability of the utility\nfunction. The class of problems that satisfy the assumption includes four of the five\nexamples in Kocherlakota (1996b).\nChapter 3 is about efficient insurance. Efficient insurance in environments with various\nfrictions has been characterized in the literature (see, for example, Thomas and Worrall\n(1988)). In some environments, the first-order approach, suggested by Rogerson (1985),\nis useful in the characterization. This chapter shows that the first-order approach is not\nvalid in an environment with one-sided no commitment and hidden savings, under the\nassumption that the utility function is CRRA or CARA and that the return on savings is\nequal to the inverse of the agent's discount factor. The result complements the numerical\nwork in \u00c1brah\u00e1m and Lacz\u00f3 (2014) which suggests that the first-order approach is valid\nunder those frictions when the return on savings is low.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10916], "author_name_tesi": "Nozawa, Wataru ", "last_name_ssi": "Nozawa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wataru", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil Wallace", "Russell Wade Cooper", "Edward James Green", "James Schuyler Jordan", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neil Wallace, Dissertation Advisor", "Russell Wade Cooper, Committee Member", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "James Schuyler Jordan, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["No-commitment problem", "reconsideration-proofness", "insurance"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Instructional Effects of Refutation Text on Different Types of Knowledge", "id": "21108", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9609", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This quantitative experimental study examined the instructional impact of conceptual change-oriented refutation text on the development of different types of knowledge of college students.  First and second year college students (N = 66) engaged with refutation text (RT) at different levels and their declarative knowledge, conceptual knowledge, and procedural knowledge were tested.  Some students were asked to read the refutation text, while others were asked to read and paraphrase their understanding.  The students were enrolled in two sections of a 200-level class, with different instructors teaching the same syllabus.  Pretest and posttest data were collected.  The three tests that assessed different types of knowledge were used to infer misconceptions at the declarative, conceptual, and procedural knowledge level.\nUsing MANOVA (with follow-up ANOVAs) and mixed within-between subjects statistical analysis, results suggested that RT simultaneously had a profound negative influence on declarative knowledge performance and a positive influence on conceptual knowledge performance.  For declarative knowledge performance, results were therefore counter-intuitive.  Previous research has shown that conceptual change-oriented and generative learning strategies can impede lower forms of knowledge such as verbatim (declarative) knowledge, and simultaneously improve higher forms of knowledge such as conceptual, structural, or procedural knowledge.\nMoreover, a median split that created low-score and high-score groups showed pretest-posttest comparisons suggesting that RT had a profound negative impact on some students\u2019 declarative knowledge performance.  Low-score groups who received RT group one treatment as well as those who received RT group two treatment improved from pretest to posttest, while high-score groups either decreased (RT group one) in conceptual knowledge performance or increased (RT group two). There were statistically significant differences between the low-score and high-score groups across pretest and posttest conceptual knowledge scores in both groups.  Lastly, procedural knowledge pretest-posttest performances for the low-score and high-score groups did not result in statistically significant differences.  \nThe focus on paraphrasing refutation text and studying the influence on three different types of knowledge extends previous research on the effect of conceptual change-oriented learning strategies on learning outcomes.    \nAn extensive literature search, using the key terms and all variations of \u201crefutation text\u201d and \u201cparaphrase\u201d, failed to produce studies that explicitly paraphrased refutation text.

I will focus on human experiences of the beautiful and/or aesthetically admirable in relationship to ethical (or unethical) activities and habits, arguing, ultimately, for an ambivalent and perpetually critical relationship to beauty and ideals.  In other words, this dissertation takes up the question of the relationship between aesthetics and ethics, drawing on American philosopher C.S. Peirce for a complex, non-reductive account of this relationship, and arguing for an ongoing sense of critical ambivalence towards all that is experienced or idealized as beautiful.  I argue, with Elaine Scarry, that on the one hand, the experience of the beautiful, awe-inspiring, or inherently admirable is bound with a sense of ethical valuation, and can therefore be ethically motivating, promoting a sense of awe, respect, wonder, or care, an augmentation of sensitivity/perceptiveness, an impulse to creativity, and actions towards increasingly just social arrangements. On the other hand, as Scarry overlooks, experienced beauty does not always operate as an impetus to justice, but can become a powerful vehicle for oppression, manipulation, self-effacement, or for the creation and maintenance of unjust, oppressive, totalitarian, genocidal, and ecocidal social arrangements and regimes.  In this dissertation I examine both sides of this debate, drawing on Peirce for a technical account of the interdependence of aesthetics, ethics, logic, and habit, and, finally, mobilize Hanna Segal\u2019s psychoanalytic theory of ambivalence in order to advocate for a sense of critical, achieved ambivalence towards beauty/ideals.\nIn sum, I do not advocate a fixed or determinate recovery of beauty that would, once and for all, discern those aspects of the beautiful aligned with ideals of truth and justice.  Rather, I argue for a perpetual, ongoing sense of ambivalence towards, and ongoing critique of, those ideals and their experienced iterations that, even upon sustained critical reflection, stand out as beautiful and ethically admirable.  The sense of ambivalence motivating ongoing critique is, in other words, a long-range project extending into the indefinite future, an ethical necessity as history unfolds into a future we cannot yet imagine. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16222], "author_name_tesi": "Nuckols, Lauren Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Nuckols", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent Colapietro", "Vincent Colapietro", "John Philip Christman", "Sarah Clark Miller", "Anne Carver Rose", "John Philip Christman", "John Philip Christman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent Colapietro, Dissertation Advisor", "Vincent Colapietro, Committee Chair", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Sarah Clark Miller, Committee Member", "Anne Carver Rose, Outside Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Chair", "John Philip Christman, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Semiotics", "Aesthetics", "Beauty", "Ambivalence", "Ethics", "Justice", "Peirce", "Pragmatism", "Psychoanalytic Theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Executive Function in Adolescence: A Validity Study", "id": "14190ajk312", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14190", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Current literature and practice in school psychology has focused upon executive function and the relation to academic, behavioral, emotional, and social outcomes among pre-school and elementary students in clinical and non-clinical samples.

Herein, the degradation mechanisms and rates of benzyltrimethylammonium-, n-alkyl interstitial spacer- and n-alkyl terminal pendant-cations are studied on several architectures. These findings demonstrate that benzyltrimethylammonium- and n-alkyl terminal pendant cations are more labile than an n-alkyl interstitial spacer cation and conclude that Hofmann elimination is not the predominant mechanism of alkaline degradation. Additionally, the alkaline stability of an n-alkyl interstitial spacer cation is enhanced when combined with an n-alkyl terminal pendant.

In addition to presenting the work of de Beauvoir, I include the works of Sartre and Fanon in my thesis because I find them to be just as important as de Beauvoir for my studies. Through their writings, I present three distinct arguments. The first chapter, which mostly covers the work of Sartre, argues that while Sartre\u2019s analysis on French colonialism portrayed the colonial system as racist and un-freeing, what his analysis had to offer to the condition of both colonized women and female \u201ccolons\u201d was very limiting. In the second chapter, in which I supplement Sartre\u2019s view on the Manichean nature of the colonial system, I present the views of Fanon in order to claim that the subject position of women within the colonial system was just as important to acknowledge as the subject position of colonized men and male colonizers. Next I turn to the colonial situation of women colonizer and colonized women, in the third chapter. Here I include the gender and racial analyses of de Beauvoir in order to present an alternative position to and a female perspective on the subjects of Fanon and Sartre\u2019s inquiries. In the third chapter then, I argue for the inclusion of the feminist perspective \u2014 of de Beauvoir\u2019s perspective in particular\u2014to Colonial/Post-colonial Studies. In these three main chapters, I examine the following topics: (1) I show how each thinker understands the political development of colonialism as it affects politics. I explain how the colonial system affects the possibility of freedom and political rights within the system. Then I look at how the theoretical focus on colonialism affects the concept of human freedom within the philosophy of Sartre, Fanon, and de Beauvoir. (2) Along with my analysis of the political development of the colonial system, I examine the structure of the colonial system as it relates to the problems of reciprocity and to the problems of racial, gender, and sexual alterities. As a part of this analysis, I address the following questions: How does the colonial system subjugate and affect the relations between the colonized and the colonizer? How do such relations affect the racialization process and the gender dynamics within the colonial system? How does the colonial depiction of these thinkers either include or exclude women? (3) Finally, since the body of my thesis will focus on war and colonialism, I will examine the concept of violence in the thinking of Sartre, Fanon and de Beauvoir. The ethical and political concepts of freedom and violence will be presented in the body of my thesis. Thus, it will be through the concepts of violence and freedom that my analysis on ethics (on existential ethics more specifically) will be developed. I conclude and show that de Beauvoir, like Sartre and Fanon is an important colonial thinker who can contribute to the theoretical studies of French colonialism, especially during the last stages of French colonialism; from post World War II until the end of the Algerian War (1945-1962).\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9869], "author_name_tesi": "Nya, Nathalie Yonga", "last_name_ssi": "Nya", "middle_name_ssi": "Yonga", "first_name_ssi": "Nathalie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathryn Teresa Gines", "Kathryn Teresa Gines", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathryn Teresa Gines, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathryn Teresa Gines, Committee Chair", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi, Committee Member", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["politics", "existential ethics", "gender", "race", "sartre", "de beauvoir", "fanon"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Misbehaving Organizations: A study of how community and faith based organizations assist in domesticating community residents\n", "id": "7603", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2241", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nCommunity organizations (COs), the study proposes, are social actors whose behavior shapes the participation of local residents in community activities.  Employing critical ethnography as a research approach, the study examines how COs\u2014through activities they sponsor and/or support\u2014promote and/or inhibit the participation of residents as citizens.  Assuming that learning is an outcome of activity, the study argues that behaviors influencing citizen participation also promote and/or inhibit learning for citizen participation.  Guiding the investigation is a theoretical framework that draws upon institutional theory of organizations, social constructivism, community theory, and cultural historical activity theory.  \n\nFieldwork for the study was conducted in a low-income, inner-city neighborhood of a major US city.  Using standard ethnographic methods of participant observation, interviewing and document analysis, data was collected from four community and faith-based organizations that agreed to participate in the study.  \n\nAnalysis of the data revealed that in expressing a preference for skills that are legitimated in the broader society, the behavior of COs devalue the skills and knowledge of local residents.  Furthermore, COs employ tools and processes that impose pre-defined problems and pre-formulated solutions, which consequently inhibit the citizen participation of local residents.  Citizen participation is also inhibited through behavior of COs that affirms taken-for-granted assumptions about specific groups of people based on race, gender and class.  The study also found that motives that drive the activities of COs impacted the participation of residents.  Implications of these behavior patterns for learning for citizen participation are addressed.\n\nThe study illustrates the complex power relationships negotiated by COs with entities within and outside the specific locality.

Demonstrating the ability to form isotropic or near-isotropic graphite would mean that co-cokes and anthracites have a potential use as filler material in the synthesis of nuclear graphite. The approach used to control the co-coke structure was to vary the reaction conditions. Co-cokes were produced by coking 4:1 blends of vacuum resid/coal and decant oil/coal at temperatures of 465 and 500 \u00a2\u00aaC for reaction times of 12 and 18 hours under autogenous pressure. Co-cokes obtained were calcined at 1420 \u00a2\u00aaC and graphitized at 3000 \u00a2\u00aaC for 24 hours. Optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, temperature- programmed oxidation and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the products. It was found that higher reaction temperature (500 \u00a2\u00aaC) or shorter reaction time (12 hours) leads to an increase in co-coke structural disorder and an increase in the amount of mosaic carbon at the expense of textural components that are necessary for the formation of anisotropic structure, namely, domains and flow domains. Characterization of graphitized co-cokes showed that the quality, as expressed by the degree of graphitization and crystallite dimensions, of the final product is dependent on the nature of the precursor co-coke. \nThe methodology for studying anthracites was to select two anthracites on basis of rank, PSOC1515 being semi-anthracite and DECS21 anthracite. The selected anthracites were graphitized, in both native and demineralized states, under the same conditions as co-cokes. Products obtained from DECS21 showed higher degrees of graphitization and larger crystallite dimensions than products obtained from PSOC1515. Demineralization of anthracites served to increase the degree of graphitization, indicating that the minerals contained in these anthracites have no graphitization-enhancing ability. A larger crystallite length for products obtained from native versions, compared to demineralized versions, was attributed to a formation and decomposition of a silicon carbide during graphitization of native versions.\nIn order to examine the anisotropic and isotropic properties, nuclear-grade graphite samples obtained from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and commercial graphite purchased from Fluka were characterized under similar conditions as graphitized co-cokes and anthracites. These samples served as representatives of \u00a1\u00b0two extremes\u00a1\u00b1, with ORNL samples being the isotropic end and commercial graphite being the anisotropic end. Through evaluating relationships between structural parameters, it was observed that graphitized co-cokes are situated, structurally, somewhere between the \u00a1\u00b0two extremes\u00a1\u00b1, whereas graphitized anthracites are closer to the anisotropic end. Basically, co-cokes have a better potential than anthracites to transform to isotropic or near-isotropic graphite upon graphitization. By co-coking vacuum resid/coal instead of decant oil/coal or using 500 \u00a2\u00aaC instead of 465 \u00a2\u00aaC, a shift away from commercial graphite towards ORNL samples was attained. Graphitizing a semi-anthracite or demineralizing anthracites before graphitization also caused a shift towards ORNL samples. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4334], "author_name_tesi": "Nyathi, Mhlwazi  Solomon ", "last_name_ssi": "Nyathi", "middle_name_ssi": "Solomon ", "first_name_ssi": "Mhlwazi ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Caroline Elaine Clifford", "Randy Lee Vander Wal", "Jonathan P Mathews", "Kenan Unlu", "Peter J Pappano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert, Dissertation Advisor", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Chair", "Caroline Elaine Clifford, Committee Chair", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Committee Member", "Jonathan P Mathews, Committee Member", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Member", "Peter J Pappano, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["graphitization", "coke", "coking", "coal", "graphite", "isotropic"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Determining the role of equity in recreation fee acceptance and fair price on federally managed public lands", "id": "6474", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2086", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Equity has been a major public concern related to recreation fees on federally managed public lands.  Despite its importance, equity has been entirely omitted in the empirical studies on recreation fees. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the role of equity in fee acceptance and perceptions of fair price. In order to examine the role of equity, the study was divided into three major objectives: 1) a test of a three-dimensional measure of equity, 2) a test of the mediating role of equity in fee acceptance, and 3) a test of the role of equity in perceived fair price compared to willingness to pay. \n\tA telephone survey was conducted with residents of three western states, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado (Denver Metro), between December, 2003 and February, 2004. The telephone sampling was conducted using a Random-Digit Dial (RDD) process, yielding 867 completed interviews. \n\tThe instrument included multiple items measuring the dependent variable, fee acceptance, and independent variables of equity, information, social trust in agency, experience, and history of paying fees. Within the equity construct, items were included for three different subdimensions, including equity belief, compensatory equity, and democratic equity. The items were measured using a 5-point scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree, or strongly support to strongly oppose. \n\tThe results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the three-subdimensional equity model in a recreation fee context. The preferences for the three subdimensions of equity showed very weak relationships with sociodemographic variables. Although the public prefers to provide discounted fees to elderly, disabled, and low-income people, rather than minorities and large families, results of further analysis highlight that overall, the disadvantaged groups do not seek discounts for themselves. For the test of the mediation effect of equity on fee acceptance, the results of structural equation models showed that equity belief partially mediated the effect of information about fees and trust in agency.  In addition, the study indicated that perceived fair price is generally greater than the price people are willing to pay.  Although the results were not consistent among different types of passes, the results suggested that fair price embraces more aspects of the equity concept than willingness to pay.\n\tThe findings of this study broaden the understanding of recreation fees with various theoretical and management implications. This study empirically supports that equity is an important factor for explaining fee acceptance, as it mediates the effects of information and trust on fee acceptance. The study suggests that the best way to address equity is providing good information about fees and gaining trust from the public, which also helps managers to obtain public support for the fee program.

As a counterpoint to this dominating presentism in current hip-hop scholarship, my project analyzes how the mythological figures of the trickster and the badman, key characters in numerous African-American traditional narratives, have dramatically influenced the modes through which authenticity and notions of communal agency have shaped hip-hop in the United States, France, and Kenya. I show how and why these figures that first emerged in U.S. hip-hop have been extensively reproduced in Kenyan and French rap music. In this fashion, my dissertation tracks the formation and articulation of these tropes in hip-hop music and reveals the extent to which they are symptomatic of key moments in the history of the United States, France, and Kenya. \nThe figure of the trickster has survived for centuries in African-American music, mainly because of each subsequent generation\u2019s ability to reinvent it in their own image as well as accommodate it to their own social predicaments. During slavery, trickster tales emerged as ontological modes of cultural resistance through which Africans could cope with the physical and ideological realities that had been imposed on them. In the 1890s, the trickster tales that had been popularized during slavery evolved into what was to be known as badman heroic figures. The figure of the badman as an outlaw was the antecedent of the \u201cgangsta\u201d persona that later appeared in hip-hop culture. \n     It is only through an exploration of this genealogy that the global cultural translations in contemporary hip-hop become historically intelligible. My project thus seeks to analyze how the badman trope, through its multiple manifestations in both \u201cconscious\u201d and \u201cgangsta\u201d rap, has been appropriated by French and Kenyan hip-hop artists. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4533], "author_name_tesi": "Nyawalo, Mich Yonah", "last_name_ssi": "Nyawalo", "middle_name_ssi": "Yonah", "first_name_ssi": "Mich", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Albert Hale", "Thomas Albert Hale", "Jonathan Paul Eburne", "Jennifer Boittin", "Gabeba Baderoon", "Sophia A Mcclennen", "Dr Aaron L Rosenberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Albert Hale, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Albert Hale, Committee Chair", "Jonathan Paul Eburne, Committee Member", "Jennifer Boittin, Committee Member", "Gabeba Baderoon, Committee Member", "Sophia A Mcclennen, Committee Member", "Dr Aaron L Rosenberg, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Badman", "Trickster", "Hip-Hop", "France", "Kenya", "United States", "Gobalization", "Music", "Social Activism", "Rap"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Factors That Lead to Environmentally Sustainable Practices in the Restaurant Industry:\na Qualitative Analysis of Two Green Restaurant Innovators\n", "id": "15152", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7573", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n         In recent years, more organizations, including restaurants, have concerned themselves with sustainability. As with any new endeavor, guidance is needed.  The purpose of this study was to investigate factors that lead to environmentally sustainable practices in the restaurant industry. \n        Using Rogers\u2019 Diffusion of Innovation Theory as a theoretical framework, this study sought out innovators who could provide insight into ecological restaurant operations. Processes added, management and employee effects, and external influences are covered. \n        A qualitative methodology with certain case study aspects was utilized in the study. Data were gathered through interviews from employees of two different restaurants seen as innovators in the industry. One restaurant was located in an historic inn and offered both casual and fine dining. The other larger one was located in a convention center and likewise offered casual and fine dining. Four employees were interviewed from each restaurant from both the dining room and kitchen components of the operation. A total of eight participants were interviewed.\n         The study found that much of the environmental processes focused around waste streams and local foods. The use of compostable materials and closer inspection of energy and utility levels were also seen.  In addition, critical incidents of each process and their uniquenesses due to setting were noted.\n         The study also found that managers affected the processes outcomes in a number of ways. Management interacted with the initiatives\u2019 success or failure through training, purchasing of both materials and local foods, example setting, and through marketing. Employees affected the processes through peer policing of waste stream contamination, peer training on local food sourcing and nutritional value, and communication of new ideas. \n        External influences included customers and competition that either embraced or did not embrace environmental sustainability. While most of the participants agreed that green customers, either as individuals or groups, would drive the ecological demand, non\u2013green competition could hamper it if the offering were vastly cheaper. \n        Based on the findings, recommendations for both management and employees are offered.

Additionally, the drug trade has far-reaching consequences that include human rights violations, increased criminal activity, community safety risks, adverse health effects, and environmental destruction.  Along with society, the addict and his or her family also pay, as substance abuse, dependence, and addiction are associated with an apparent devaluation of, and inattention to, natural rewards.  This consequence of addiction can be modeled using a reward comparison paradigm where rats avoid intake of a taste cue that comes to predict access to a drug of abuse.  Evidence suggests rats avoid intake following such pairings, at least in part, because the taste cue pales in comparison to the highly rewarding drug expected in the near future.  Along with the devaluation of natural rewards, addiction also is a disease of chronic relapse where drug seeking and drug taking are repeatedly initiated by exposure to stress, the drug itself, and drug-associated cues.  Our paradigm also models this aspect of addiction.  Thus, while rats may initially avoid intake of the taste cue because it pales in comparison to the drug's value, with experience, rats ultimately avoid intake because the taste cue comes to elicit the onset of a conditioned aversive state involving craving, withdrawal, and seeking. \nWe have made progress in delineating the underlying circuitry involved in drug-induced avoidance of a taste cue.  In accordance, lesions of the gustatory thalamus or cortex eliminate avoidance of a taste cue when paired with either a drug of abuse or a rewarding sucrose solution, but not when paired with the aversive agent, LiCl.  The present dissertation investigated the role of a neighboring thalamic structure, the trigeminal orosensory area (TOA), using bilateral ibotenic acid lesions.  In Chapter 2, we found that the TOA lesion eliminated avoidance of a taste cue when paired with experimenter-administered morphine or cocaine using our standard parameters.  The TOA lesion, however, did not disrupt avoidance of a taste cue that predicted access to a preferred sucrose solution or the administration of the aversive agent, LiCl.  This is the first lesion to selectively disrupt avoidance of an otherwise palatable taste cue when paired with a drug of abuse.  In Chapter 3, we provided direct evidence that the drug-paired taste cue elicits withdrawal and that greater withdrawal elicits greater drug seeking and taking.  Lesions of the TOA prevented the onset of cue-induced withdrawal.  In Chapter 4, we showed that, unlike findings obtained in the home cage, the lesion failed to prevent avoidance of the drug-paired taste cue and accompanying signs of cue-induced withdrawal when tested in a runway apparatus.  Factors that may have contributed to the successful performance by the lesioned rats in the runway study, such as the availability of contextual cues and a decreased inter-stimulus interval, were tested in Chapters 5 and 6.  Specifically, in Chapter 5, using self-administration, we determined that contextual cues can, indeed, override the disruptive effect of the TOA lesion.  In this context, TOA lesioned rats avoided the taste cue, showed signs of conditioned withdrawal, and exhibited increased instrumental responding for drug compared with intact rats.  Furthermore, the TOA was essential not only for associating the explicit taste cue with the drug of abuse, but also for reactivating that memory in the absence of supporting contextual cues.  Finally, in Chapter 6, we determined that the length of the interval between presentation of the taste cue and the unconditioned stimulus was pivotal for the development of drug-induced avoidance, but not sucrose-induced avoidance of a palatable cue in the lesioned rats.  Therefore, in sum, we conclude that avoidance of a drug-paired taste cue develops, in part, as a result of devaluation of the taste cue, but with experience is intensified due to the onset of an aversive conditioned state of withdrawal.  In the absence of other exteroceptive cues, the taste cue can support this conditioned state and lesions of the TOA block both avoidance of the taste cue and the onset of the accompanying aversive state.  An intact TOA, however, is not required when the development of the phenomenon is augmented by the addition of contextual cues and/or by the use of a very short inter-stimulus interval.  Thus, while a drug of abuse can be predicted by a myriad of cues, the TOA is essential for acquisition and retention of an explicit taste-drug association.  Further, the TOA is implicated in the development of the opponent process that is integral to the development of addiction and, once the association is learned, to the precipitation of cue-induced relapse.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8209], "author_name_tesi": "Nyland, Jennifer ", "last_name_ssi": "Nyland", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson", "Kevin Douglas Alloway", "Ralph Norgren", "Thomas C Pritchard Iii", "Chester A Ray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson, Dissertation Advisor", "Kevin Douglas Alloway, Committee Member", "Ralph Norgren, Committee Member", "Thomas C Pritchard Iii, Committee Member", "Chester A Ray, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["reward", "thalamus", "addiction", "lesion", "withdrawal"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "A Framework for Representing, Manipulating , and Reasoning with Geographic Semantics", "id": "6477", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2538", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-12-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Broadly speaking, the aims of this dissertation are to examine the potential of new computational representation techniques and reasoning systems to (i) track various aspects of semantics as information products are created, modified and applied and (ii) utilize stored semantic knowledge to generate the workflows or query execution plans that will produce the required information products in response to specific user-requests.

Modifications have also been made to model mixtures containing particles with realistic molecular properties such as mass, diameter, internal degrees of freedom, and rates of exchange of internal energy.\n\nThe direct simulation Monte Carlo method has been used to investigate the hydrogen-chlorine mechanism in systems with and without flow.  Detonation profiles have been examined in detail in order to study initiation sources, boundary effects, the interaction between shock and reaction regions, and reaction sensitivity.  Detonation velocities, peak detonation temperatures and particle distributions across the detonation front have also been studied.  The results obtained are promising and indicate that calculations using this Monte Carlo method are feasible for other complex reaction systems.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4849], "author_name_tesi": "O'Connor, Patrick Dennis", "last_name_ssi": "O'Connor", "middle_name_ssi": "Dennis", "first_name_ssi": "Patrick", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Bernhard Anderson", "Lyle Norman Long", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Mark Maroncelli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Chair", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Member", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DSMC", "Monte Carlo", "detonation"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "REFINEMENT AND APPLICATION OF UNOBTRUSIVE METHODS FOR ASSESSING BEHAVIORAL BLOCKING OF FILTER VENTS ON LOW TAR CIGARETTES\n", "id": "6312", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5205", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Filter ventilation is an important design feature on cigarettes, diluting mainstream smoke with air and reducing tar and nicotine yields in the standard assay.  Smokers are generally unaware of vent holes, and often cover them with fingers or lips while smoking, increasing smokers\u2019 intake of tar and nicotine from nominally \u2018low-yield\u2019 cigarettes.  Vent blocking is most common and has its largest effects in Ultra-Light cigarettes, with increases in exposure to carbon monoxide of 50% to 200%.  Three systems for detecting the presence of vent blocking were compared:  human raters viewing digital images, computer ratings of binary images, and computer ratings of color images.  Three studies were designed to compare and contrast the effectiveness of these systems.  In Study 1, 52 Carlton cigarette butts generated using syringes were evaluated, while in two others human smokers produced butts under specific lip blocking conditions.  All three systems were able to distinguish butts blocked at least 50% from those not blocked at all.  However, the human and binary systems were better than the color system in dividing butts into three categories (0%, 50%, or 100% blocking).  In Study 2, 96 Marlboro Ultra Light butts degenerated by 12 human smokers were evaluated.  Here, HSV saturation color scores were superior to human raters or binary computer ratings at detecting at least 50% blocking and at discriminating among 0%, 50%, and 100% blocking.  Saturation scores could also identify whether a butt had been blocked on only two puffs.  In Study 3, 48 Marlboro Ultra Light butts were evaluated.  Here, only HSV saturation scores were able to reliably detect butts that had been blocked on a single puff.  Results from logistic regression models suggested that combining scores into a statistical prediction model has modest benefit if the outcome of interest is detecting any blocking at all, even a single puff.  Overall, it appears that HSV saturation scores, but not human raters or computer binary scores, can be used to classify cigarette butts has blocked at least 50% or unblocked with accuracy greater than 90%, and that these scores may be directly related to smoke flow through the filter.

(4) What demographic and professional characteristics are associated with teachers\u2019 discretionary participation in CPD activities? A stratified random sample of 2,450 members of the Pennsylvania State Education Association (PSEA) (N=147,000), was mailed a self-administered questionnaire, with 888 respondents meeting all criteria for inclusion in the research sample.

Reasons for participation were more often associated with intrinsic motivation than with extrinsic rewards.  Reasons for nonparticipation carried less importance and were associated with issues related to time, convenience, and program relevance perceptions.

Using kinematic structural data from the area combined with structural analysis of an ~0.5 km2 terrestrial LiDAR survey of the GF-HFF intersection, I show that accommodation at the ridge-transform intersection occurs over distances much smaller than crustal thickness (100\u2019s of meters compared to 10\u2019s of kilometers).  This suggests localized processes are occurring at the inside corner of this intersection.  I used geologic (kinematic) data to study the spatial distribution of normal faulting and mode-1 tensile fracturing magnitude and direction of displacement at the intersection. The azimuth of opening for mode-1 tensile fractures varies along strike of the GF; fractures south of the intersection along the GF indicate plate motion-parallel opening, while fractures near and north of the intersection, indicate a second, HFF-orthogonal direction of opening as well as a plate motion-parallel direction.  This strain partitioning is likely a result of the intersection of the two faults.  Monte Carlo experiments allowed me to calculate the displacement on the GF, ignoring the talus slope covering the scarp.  Total displacement on the GF is 15.6 \u00b1 1.2 m, with 15.2 \u00b1 1.2 m of throw and 2.7 \u00b1 2.1 m of heave.  Using published ages of 3,000-12,000 yrs for the basaltic lava flows at the surface at the intersection, I estimated displacement rates for the Gudfinnugja fault that range from 1.9 \u2013 6.5 mm/yr.  Displacement rates for the Gudfinnugja complex range from 6.3 \u2013 21.0 mm/yr.  For the whole intersection, I calculated displacement rates of a minimum of 3.5 \u2013 5.4 mm/yr and a maximum of 14.0 \u2013 21.7 mm/yr.  These rates are poorly constrained, but provide an initial estimate for the slip budget across the HFF-GF intersection and Northern Volcanic Zone.\n To study temporal variations in deformation, I supplemented the geologic data (~10 kyr) with geodetic GPS data (~10 yrs). To investigating short-term elastic strain accumulation in this region I modeled the velocity field across the HFF and GF using a 2-year geodetic data set from Jouanne et al. (2006). I found that the HFF appears to accommodate ~50% of the total plate motion, and therefore has ~10 mm/yr displacement rate. Velocity profiles across the GF show a velocity gradient with the largest velocity difference of ~15 mm/yr occurring >20 km east of the GF and of Krafla.  This study not only increases our knowledge of the plate boundary in northern Iceland and ridge-transform intersections, but also provides a valuable field-test for the structural analysis of terrestrial LiDAR data.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [920], "author_name_tesi": "O'Hara, Caroline Anne", "last_name_ssi": "O'Hara", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Caroline", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Peter C La Femina", "Peter Christopher Lafemina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Peter C La Femina, Thesis Advisor", "Peter Christopher Lafemina, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["northern Iceland", "Husavik-Flatey fault", "Gudfinnugja fault", "Tjornes Fracture Zone", "Theistareykir fissure swarm", "ridge-transform intersection", "terrestrial LiDAR", "displacement variation", "GPS", "slip rate", "tensile fractures"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "THE SLOW PERCOLATION OF FORMS: CHARLES PEIRCE\u2019S WRITINGS ON PLATO ", "id": "6652", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1474", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines Charles S.

Peirce claimed that Plato misunderstood himself and was, late in his career, developing an evolutionary, three-level metaphysics and logic that anticipated Peirce\u2019s Pragmaticism.\n\nThe first half of the dissertation deals with Peirce and the history of philosophy.  Chapters address the case for this study, Peirce\u2019s method of studying the history of philosophy and his use of intellectual autobiography, and Peirce\u2019s encounter with Platonism in America.  A running theme throughout the dissertation is Peirce\u2019s engagement with mysticism and American Transcendentalism, and especially with Emerson, Thoreau, and Henry James, Sr. Also discussed here is Peirce\u2019s reception of stylometric analyses of the Platonic dialogues through Wincenty Lutoslawski\u2019s Origin and Growth of Plato\u2019s Logic. The section on stylometrics also briefly discusses Lewis Campbell and contemporary views on stylometrics in Brandwood, Thesleff, and Nails.\n\nThe second half of the dissertation examines Peirce\u2019s writings on particular Platonic dialogues and the consequences of those writings for Peirce\u2019s Pragmaticism.  Chapters cover the development of Peirce\u2019s metaphysics, his ethics of inquiry, etymology and the ethics of terminology, and miracles and their relation to scientific and historical research.  The chapter on miracles also examines the role Plato played in Peirce\u2019s response to Hume on miracles.\n\nIndividual chapters address Peirce\u2019s writings on Plato\u2019s Cratylus and Theaetetus.  The Apology, Parmenides, and Sophist are also discussed. Especial attention is paid to Peirce\u2019s unpublished manuscripts, as well as to his entries on \u201cPlatonic\u201d and \u201cSocratic\u201d in the Century Dictionary, his own account of his debt to Aristotle, his intellectual autobiographies, and his manuscripts entitled \u201cMetaphysical Axioms and Syllogisms,\u201d \u201cA Neglected Argument for the Reality of God,\u201d \u201cPhilosophy and the Conduct of Life,\u201d \u201cOn the Logic of Drawing History from Ancient Documents,\u201d and \u201cThe Law of Mind.\u201d\n\nAppendices include transcripts of Peirce\u2019s unpublished partial translations of Plato\u2019s Cratylus; a transcript of an unpublished letter from Peirce to Lady Welby on the Theaetetus; and a catalog of references to Plato in Peirce\u2019s manuscripts.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1459], "author_name_tesi": "O'Hara, David L", "last_name_ssi": "O'Hara", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Doug Anderson", "Daniel Joseph Conway", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Sanford Ray Schwartz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Doug Anderson, Committee Chair", "Daniel Joseph Conway, Committee Member", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Committee Member", "Sanford Ray Schwartz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Peirce", "Plato", "semiotics", "theaetetus", "cratylus", "metaphysics", "religion", "miracles", "transcendentalism", "Henry James Sr.", "Emerson", "Thoreau", "God", "Neglected Argument", "Autobiography", "Platonism", "Lutoslawski", "unpublished manuscripts", "Hume", "Parmenides", "Sophist", "Apology", "Welby", "Forms", "Ideas", "stylometry"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "COMPUTATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF STEEL-JACKETED BRIDGE PIER COLUMN PERFORMANCE UNDER BLAST LOADS\n\n", "id": "11818", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1885", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Due to recent malicious acts on civil structures, bridge blast resistance has become a subject of extreme interest from both research and design perspectives.

Summarized herein is research focusing on the use of a steel jacket retrofit for circular, reinforced concrete, bridge columns to increase their resistance against blast loads.  A computational parametric study utilizing LS-DYNA was performed to investigate column blast performance to establish critical failure modes and levels of parameters that provide protection against these failures.  \nFinite element models were created using constitutive models for concrete, steel jackets and steel reinforcement that have been evaluated at high strain rates in the literature and have shown favorable results compared to experimental tests.   Elemental constraints were evaluated to correctly represent the interaction between concrete and steel.  Critical parameters including:  aspect ratio, transverse reinforcement ratio, steel jacket thickness ratio and steel jacket gap ratio were varied using a 2k factorial design process evaluated at minimum and maximum limits achieving sixteen parametric models.  The blast load was defined by scaled distance that remained constant throughout the parametric study and was applied using the Conventional Weapons (CONWEP) functions that are imbedded into LS-DYNA.  CONWEP is considered coupled with the structure and is capable of accounting for incident and reflective blast waves.  Models were validated using theoretical and experimental data to ensure proper static and dynamic column behavior.  Direct shear, flexure and transverse shear failure modes were evaluated through selected result parameters.  Results were used to observe if steel jackets can be detailed to improve retrofitted column blast performance and to provide guidance for designers that would choose this as a retrofit option.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1868], "author_name_tesi": "O'Hare, Edward Vincent", "last_name_ssi": "O'Hare", "middle_name_ssi": "Vincent", "first_name_ssi": "Edward", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Daniel G Linzell", "Dr Daniel G Linzell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Daniel G Linzell, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Daniel G Linzell, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Computational", "Bridge Column", "Blast", "Steel Jacket"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Behavior of Concrete-Filled Tube Through-Beam Connections Subjected to Varying Load Rates", "id": "26294", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11391", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " In recent years, hollow structural sections (HSS) have become more widely used in steel construction and design.  This increase in popularity is not only due to the favorable aesthetics of this member in architecturally exposed situations, but also due to the efficiency of the section\u2019s reduced weight and area, and its increased stability compared to equivalent open sections.  However, HSS connections are a major challenge to designers.  In many situations this is due to the local strength limitations of this type of section and the lack of practical connection techniques.    \n One method to overcome local strength limitations is to fill the internal cavity of the closed HSS section with concrete, forming a concrete-filled tube (CFT) member.  However, there is a lack of techniques and guidelines for designing and constructing connections that directly and effectively transfer forces and moments to CFT members.  This research expanded on the current state of knowledge of CFT connections through evaluation of the behavior and performance of a CFT through-beam-to-CFT column connection.  The primary objective of this research was to develop a method to model the behavior of CFT through-beam connections and to expand their use to typical building structures subjected to varying load rates.  The second objective included the development of quasi-static CFT through-beam connection design guidelines through the derivation of force transfer mechanisms and behavioral models that validated the effective transfer of forces and moments to both steel and concrete components in the composite CFT sections.  This was accomplished using a computational parametric approach utilizing Response Surface Methodology (RSM).   \n Finite element (FE) models of the connection were created in LS-DYNA and successfully validated against published quasi-static and dynamic test results.  RSM was then used to identify significant connection parameters and to develop the connection\u2019s behavioral model and design guidelines.  General Factorial Design (GFD) was first used to determine connection failure modes, flexural behavior, and significant shear capacity and applied load contributors.  Next, a Plackett-Burman Design (PBD) was used for connection parameter screening to identify those that most significantly affect each shear strength contributor.  These significant connection parameters were then used in a Central Composite Design (CCD) to determine connection shear strength equations.  RSM results were compiled to develop connection quasi-static design guidelines.  Overall, CFT through-beam connections were shown to be an effective and reliable method in CFT building construction.\n Finally, preliminary analyses were performed to determine CFT through-beam dynamic connection behavior with an emphasis on establishing appropriate connection load rates to model its behavior.  To accomplish this full-frame FE model containing the connection were created in LS-DYNA and subjected to impact and blast loads.  Conservative connection load rates were determined for impact and blast events, which were recommended to be used in RSM models to determine dynamic connection behavior.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10914], "author_name_tesi": "O'Hare, Edward Vincent", "last_name_ssi": "O'Hare", "middle_name_ssi": "Vincent", "first_name_ssi": "Edward", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tong Qiu", "Zoltan Ivan Rado", "Sean Brennan", "Daniel Linzell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tong Qiu, Dissertation Advisor", "Zoltan Ivan Rado, Committee Member", "Sean Brennan, Committee Member", "Daniel Linzell, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Through-beam", "steel", "concrete", "connection", "lateral loads", "blast", "impact", "quasi-static", "concrete-filled tube", "Through-connection"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF WATER IN VARIOUS POROUS MEDIA WITH NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE RELAXATION \n\n", "id": "10171", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "828", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Deuterium NMR relaxation experiments, low temperature deuterium NMR lineshape analysis, and FTIR spectra are consistent with a new model for solid state jump dynamics of water in 2H2O-synthesized kanemite, 2H2O-hydrated Na+-Zeolite A and 2H2O hydrated tricalcium silicate.

Examining both literary and historical materials, I focus on the fictive and actual communities of women that were generated in relation to pivotal life experiences, such as marriage and giving birth. In the interactions within these real and virtual communities, I read a productive activity that was constitutive of specific female identities. By doing so, this thesis contests two powerful models for construing female relationships. First, it shows that because many critics have read depictions of congregating women\u2014such as the gossips\u2019 meeting and the school house of women\u2014as wholly negative, they have failed to recognize that congregating women can serve as potent political or creative agents. Second, it argues for the limitations of friendship discourse, which in its focus on the dyad has failed to note the richness of loyalties present in larger, community-based relationships. Moving away from the dyad and from the critical tradition of dismissing depictions of gathering women as negative or satiric, I consider the collective identities that were socially constructed and distributed among women, fostering stronger communities around the specific life experiences of mourning, marriage, and maternity.\nA study of female camaraderie brings a new dimension to our understanding of birth, death, and marriage in Renaissance England as it foregrounds the status of each as a collective experience and raises questions of intersubjectivity, identity, and agency.  Re-evaluating each of these culturally central phenomena as fertile ground for the invocation of a real or virtual female community, as generative of an identity-producing moment that fosters the social proliferation of particular roles, allows us a fresh look at the medical, political, and religious customs that surround each of these major life events.\n\t\nThe dissertation considers the social expression of three female experiences: mourning, marriage and maternity. An introduction focuses on the (largely male-centered) history of friendship from its classical origins to the early modern period. It provides evidence of a history of female alliance that predates Katherine Phillips, whose poetry in the 1650s and 1660s is often cited as the earliest writing on this topic. In chapter one, which focuses on Beaumont and Fletcher\u2019s The Maid\u2019s Tragedy (c. 1609), I discuss what complaint poetry brings to tragedy and the stage complainant\u2019s practice of social sorrow. In chapter two, on Fletcher\u2019s The Woman\u2019s Prize (1611), I consider how, through communal rebellion, wives seek to redefine marriage, and examine the afterlife of female friendship in marriage. In the third and fourth chapters, on Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream (1594-96) and The Winter\u2019s Tale (1609-11), I argue for maternity as a socially constructed and socially enacted role initiated communally and lived out in relation to other women. \nThis thesis does not argue for a universal model for the expression of female alliance; rather, it seeks to map the territory of different expressions of female relationships.

Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the arteries where inflammation induces a build up of fat- and cholesterol-laden immune cells and hyperproliferative vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC).  Sphingolipids are naturally occurring lipids with important structural and signaling roles and have identified roles in multiple diseases including atherosclerosis, often due to dysfunctional regulation of their metabolism.  The focus of our studies is to better understand the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism and how this may apply to the therapeutic treatment of atherosclerosis.\n\tAn important enzyme in sphingolipid metabolism is neutral ceramidase (nCDase).  NCDase catalyzes the first step in the conversion of apoptotic ceramide into anti-apoptotic/pro-mitogenic sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P).  S-1-P has been reported to induce pro-atherogenic effects on VSMCs. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines involved in the atherogenic process, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta can induce nCDase transcription and protein expression, leading to increased S-1-P levels.  As nCDase could have important ramifications on the progression of atherosclerosis, we chose to study the regulation of nCDase at the level of transcription.  Our studies determined the proximal promoter of the nCDase gene and identified multiple functional transcription response elements within the proximal promoter.  Furthermore, we determined that the growth factor- and cytokine-activated transcription factor, AP-1, regulated nCDase transcription.  These studies have given us an insight into the transcription regulation of nCDase that may be exploited to control its expression. \n\tOur studies of sphingolipid metabolism also focused on the catabolism of ceramide in a vascular system and its applicability to restenosis therapy in animal models of atherosclerosis.  A common treatment for atherosclerosis is angioplasty with, or without, stent implantation, but angioplasty often leads to restenosis, or reclogging of the artery due to hyperproliferation of VSMCs in response to the arterial injury induced by the angioplasty.  This body of work extends previous work and shows that cell-permeable C6-ceramide can limit stenosis in multiple large arterial beds in response to stretch injury.  Furthermore, while the ceramide inhibited VSMC growth in vivo and in vitro, vascular endothelial cells (EC) were not as susceptible to the growth inhibitory effects of ceramide and the endothelium was able to wound heal after angioplasty with C6-ceramide-coated balloon catheters.  The role of ceramide metabolism was explored in the differential response of VSMCs and vascular ECs to ceramide treatment.  Interestingly, vascular ECs, compared to VSMCs, were found to contain higher levels of ceramide kinase, but not nCDase, and had an enhanced capacity to metabolize the administered ceramide in into ceramide-1-phosphate (C-1-P).  In addition, we also demonstrated that C-1-P protected cell apoptosis induced by serum-starvation.  These studies indicate that the differential metabolism of ceramide by arterial cells makes exogenous ceramide a promising therapeutic for the prevention of restenosis.\n\tThe observations described in this dissertation increase our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of an important enzyme, nCDase, in sphingolipid metabolism, which may eventually be used in the design of drugs to regulate nCDase in multiple diseases including atherosclerosis.  Other studies in sphingolipid metabolism reveal that C6-ceramide has strong potential to be an effective therapeutic in the prevention of restenosis.  Collectively, the results of this dissertation emphasize the prospects of exploiting sphingolipids and sphingolipid metabolism in drug design.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5694], "author_name_tesi": "O'Neill, Sean Michael", "last_name_ssi": "O'Neill", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Sean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Kester, Ph D", "Mark Kester", "Jong Kak Yun", "Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Cara Lynne Schengrund", "Bogdan Prokopczyk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Kester, Ph D, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Kester, Committee Chair", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member", "Cara Lynne Schengrund, Committee Member", "Bogdan Prokopczyk, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ceramidase", "restenosis", "atherosclerosis", "transcription", "Ceramide", "sphingolipid"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Fate of Listeria Monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. in Sphagnum Peat-Based Casing Soils and Pre-Harvest Food Safety Interventions to Reduce Contamination of Fresh Mushrooms", "id": "11978", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5248", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Efforts are continually made in the mushroom industry to reduce the risk of contamination with human pathogens.  Numerous random product samplings reveal that Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. are found consistently on whole and sliced fresh mushrooms, which has prompted several recalls over the years.  The purpose of this study was to investigate multiple hurdles at pre-harvest that might prevent microbial contamination and growth of human pathogens on mushrooms.  Two potential hurdles were investigated: natural microbial populations in casing soils and irrigation water supplemented with sanitizers.     \nLight peat casing soil alone exhibited a suppressive effect on L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp., and dark peat casing soils also had a suppressive effect on the pathogens, however, it took approximately 14 days for pathogens to reach the same low levels in the dark peats as they did in the light peat.  Indigenous populations of total aerobic bacteria, Actinomycetes, and yeasts and molds were significantly lower in dark peat, as compared to the light peat, and with less competition in the dark peats, pathogen levels did not decrease as rapidly as in the light peat.         \nCombinations of light and dark peat were used in a model mushroom growing system in ratios of 100:0, 80:20, and 60:40 light:dark and inoculated with L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. for a challenge study.  Pathogen levels were sampled over the course of the growing cycle and emerging mushrooms were tested for presence of pathogens. Pathogen populations were lowest in the 100:0 light:dark peat and were highest in the 60:40 light:dark peat, however, in all three combinations pathogen levels decreased by at least 3.18 logs between inoculation and harvest.  Average frequency of pathogen transfer from soil to mushroom was between 45 and 66 percent for Salmonella spp. and between 53 and 56 percent for L. monocytogenes.\nTo replicate the scenario where mushroom pins are contaminated with Listeria and/or Salmonella spp.,  pins in a model mushroom growing system were spot-inoculated with the pathogens and irrigation water was supplemented with chlorine dioxide, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, and Tsunami 100- a commercial sanitizer containing peroxyacetic acid.

Although in recent years the major steps of the herpesvirus assembly pathway have become clearer, the molecular mechanisms utilized by viral structural proteins to target to the site of final envelopment (a trans-Golgi network (TGN)-derived vesicle) and interact to form a stable virion, remain poorly characterized.  This dissertation focuses on defining the protein-protein interactions and virion incorporation determinants of one specific HSV-1 tegument protein, VP22, and the functional significance of these activities in facilitating packaging of VP22 into assembling virions.\nVP22, one of the most abundant tegument proteins with nearly 2,000 copies present within each virion, associates with cellular membranes and localizes to the TGN where it is packaged into assembling virus particles during final envelopment.  Current evidence suggests that viral glycoprotein tails play a role in the recruitment of tegument-coated capsids to the site of final envelopment.  Initial efforts to identify binding partners of VP22 and elucidate their roles in facilitating virion incorporation of VP22, focused on potential interactions with the cytoplasmic tail of a viral glycoprotein(s).  Using a variety of protein-protein interaction assays, VP22 was demonstrated to bind to the cytoplasmic tail of gE.  Truncation mutagenesis suggests that residues 165-270 of VP22 facilitate interaction with the cytoplasmic tail of gE.  In fact, this region of VP22 is sufficient to bind to gE in the absence of additional viral proteins.  Using a transfection/infection-based virion incorporation assay, residues 165-270 of VP22 fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) competed efficiently with wild-type VP22 for packaging into assembling virus particles.  Interestingly, a domain of the protein similar to the region that facilitates gE binding and virion incorporation has been reported to bind VP16.  Thus, the focus of the next series of experiments was to elucidate the role VP16 plays in virion incorporation of VP22.  \n  Deletion mutagenesis was used to identify the minimal domain of VP22 that is required for interaction with VP16.  Residues 165-225 of VP22 are both necessary and sufficient to facilitate binding to VP16 in the absence of additional virally encoded proteins. However, in order to attain wild-type levels of binding, residues 165-270 of VP22, which are also sufficient to facilitate binding to the cytoplasmic tail of gE are required.  Membrane flotation experiments suggest that this region of VP22 (residues 165-225) has the ability to associate with cellular membranes; however, this activity is not sufficient to facilitate virion incorporation of VP22 and additional protein-protein interactions appear to be necessary.  Primary structural alignment reveals that residues 165-270 of HSV-1 VP22 are highly conserved among VP22 homologues of herpesviruses.  Site-directed point mutagenesis targeting dileucine motifs conserved within this region enabled partition of the VP16 and gE binding activities within VP22.  To ascertain the contribution of these binding activities to VP22 virion incorporation, the point mutants were evaluated in the virion packaging assay, with results indicating that interaction with VP16 is not required for incorporation of VP22 into virus particles.  \nTo determine the contribution of gE binding to virion incorporation of VP22, further mutagenesis of potential protein-protein interaction motifs within VP22 was performed.  Targeting residues which resembled a WW domain, a well characterized protein-protein interaction module, enabled the identification of mutants which abrogated interaction with gE but retained VP16 binding activity.  Upon assessment of these mutants\u2019 ability to incorporate into virus particles, it appeared that failure to bind to gE did not abrogate virus packaging.  This result, combined with the observation that VP16 binding is not required for incorporation of VP22, suggests that gE and VP16 binding act redundantly to facilitate assembly of VP22 into the virus particle.\n\tCuriously, a region of VP22 which binds to both VP16 and gE at efficiencies comparable to full-length VP22, fails to be packaged to wild-type levels, suggesting that additional incorporation determinants exist.  Wild-type levels of incorporation were only attained when residues 43-86 of VP22 were present, despite the fact that removal of these residues had no deleterious effects on the binding efficiency of VP22 to either VP16 or gE.  An acidic cluster of amino acids within this region of VP22, which is required for localization of VP22 at the TGN, was examined for its role in VP22 packaging.  Alanine mutagenesis of the acidic cluster abrogated both binding activities and virion incorporation, suggesting a gross misfolding event.  However, upon deletion of the residues compromising this motif, VP22 packaging was not abrogated but reduced to a degree equivalent to a VP22 construct which binds to both gE and VP16 at wild-type levels.  Deletion of the acidic cluster had no adverse effect on VP22\u2019s interaction with either VP16 or gE, suggesting that the decrease in virion incorporation observed is not due to a loss of binding activity.  These findings indicate that although protein-protein interactions play a crucial (and possibly redundant) role, to attain efficient packaging of VP22, an acidic cluster of amino acids must also be present, ensuring localization of VP22 at the TGN, where interactions with gE and/or VP16 facilitate packaging of the protein into the tegument region of assembling virions.\n\tCollectively, the studies described within this dissertation elucidate the mechanism by which VP22 is incorporated into virus particles, and reveal that in addition to the role protein-protein interactions play, proper trafficking and localization of VP22 also contribute to efficient virion incorporation.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3429], "author_name_tesi": "O'Regan, Kevin Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "O'Regan", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard James Courtney", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "David Joseph Spector", "John Warren Wills", "Kristin Ann Eckert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard James Courtney, Committee Chair", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Herpes simplex virus type 1: HSV-1: VP22: VP16: Gl"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "CONFORMATIONAL DYNAMICS AND LONG-RANGE INTERACTIONS IN TRYPTOPHAN BIOSYNTHETIC ENZYMES", "id": "14690kfo105", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14690", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Enzyme catalysis is an inherently dynamic process. As bonds are broken and formed, enzymes progress through different conformations along the catalytic cycle. The internal motion of these enzymes is an important factor in catalysis and allosteric regulation. Competing interactions can be a way to maintain proper motion in catalytically active regions. In (\u03b2/\u03b1)8-barrel enzymes, the most common protein fold in nature, the flexible active site loops are directly involved in catalysis. Disruption of competing hydrogen bonding interactions of one such loop in indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) resulted in change of the rate-determining step and attenuated motion of the loop. The motions of these loops can be connected to motions of the rest of the enzyme through a network of interacting amino acids.\nTryptophan synthase (TS) is a well-studied model system for intersubunit communication and substrate channeling. The association of the alpha subunit (\u03b1TS) and the beta subunit (\u03b2TS) increases the activities of both enzymes. The communication between the subunits may be carried out through an amino acid interaction network. An NMR-based method was used to map out two clusters of correlated amino acids in \u03b1TS that change based on the ligand-bound state. The conformational exchange events, which are prevalent across the enzyme, are also ligand-dependent. Perturbation of these cluster and dynamic residues resulted in modulation of the \u03b1TS activity and, in some cases, altered communication with \u03b2TS. These results suggest that amino acid interactions and conformational exchange events that may be distal to the active site are important for the function of enzymes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15729], "author_name_tesi": "O'Rourke, Kathleen Faye", "last_name_ssi": "O'Rourke", "middle_name_ssi": "Faye", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David D Boehr", "David D Boehr", "Philip C.

With myriad socio-economic forces at play, the role of design is often marginalized.

As public opinion towards residents and social programs shift, isolating design features of projects become physical manifestations of stigmatization, leaving socio-economic and cultural scars not only on the residents of projects, but of entire neighborhoods and cities. How does the spatial design of housing projects ameliorate or exacerbate the social stigma and physical isolation endemic to urban poverty in America?  This paper analyzes the connections between public housing design standards, housing policy, and architectural ideologies that contributed to the predominant design typologies found in public housing.  In order to determine how the design of past housing projects has contributed to successes or failures, case studies are analyzed by using past literature to create a framework of factors essential to successful urban and housing design. This framework consists of four main physical characteristics of successful urban design: urban density, security, legibility, and diversity.  Applied to multiple case studies, this framework allows for comparison across different iterations of public housing design.

Aberrant and chronic activation of myofibroblasts can contribute to the development of pathological conditions including cancer, fibrosis, and the foreign-body response to implanted biomaterials. Myofibroblasts can develop from epithelial cells through an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which can be mediated by a combination of the chemical signal transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and mechanical stimuli. During EMT, epithelial cells detach from adjacent cells and acquire an elongated, mesenchymal-like morphology. These phenotypic changes are accompanied by changes in the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers including up-regulation of a variety of cytoskeletal associated proteins such as alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA). A better understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of how cell and tissue level physical properties contribute to EMT in pathological settings is needed.
