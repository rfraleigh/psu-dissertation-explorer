One of the major cell biological differences between axons and dendrites is the arrangement of microtubules. In Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons, which are multipolar neurons with a single axon and many dendrites, dendritic microtubules are minus-end-out and axonal microtubules are plus-end-out (Stone 2008). While microtubule polarity is likely to play a key role in maintaining neuronal polarity, it is not known how a single cell can establish two compartments with completely different arrangements of microtubules. \nIn a screen to identify regulators of microtubule polarity in da neurons, we identified kinesin-13s, which are known to be important for spindle organization in mitosis, as regulators of neuronal microtubules. Kinesin-13s are a family of non-canonical microtubule-based motors that are known to be microtubule depolymerases in mitotic and interphase cells (Mennella 2005); however, there have been very few studies of their roles in neurons. \nIn Drosophila, there are three kinesin-13s. We found that two of these, Klp59C and Klp10A, play important roles in da neurons. Reduction of Klp59C caused severe mixing of microtubule polarity in dendrites as well as dendrite branching defects. No non-microtubule functions were observed. Reduction of Klp10A had a comparably mild effect in dendrites, and instead showed the greatest phenotype in axons, changing both microtubule orientation and overall number of polymerizing microtubule plus ends. \nWe therefore conclude that Klp59C and Klp10A act differentially on dendritic and axonal microtubules; Klp59C is a major regulator of dendritic microtubules and Klp10A is a major regulator of axonal microtubules. Their localized function may be one mechanism that allows neurons to establish different arrangements of microtubules within axons and dendrites.\nInterestingly, neurons were observed to be especially sensitive to early developmental loss of Klp59C. With genomic deletion of the kinesin-13, microtubule polarity is restored but the number of dynamic plus ends are disrupted. We suggest that, upon loss of Klp59C, neurons use a kinesin-13 independent \u201cbypass pathway\u201d to maintain normal polarized microtubule growth. JNK signaling may play a key role in this bypass pathway. Additional factors, such as microtubule minus end regulators, may also play a role. In the future, we seek to elucidate the molecular players that help to control microtubule polarity in the kinesin-13 bypass pathway.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10388], "author_name_tesi": "Long, Melissa Katherine", "last_name_ssi": "Long", "middle_name_ssi": "Katherine", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Rolls", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "William O Hancock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Rolls, Thesis Advisor", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Thesis Advisor", "William O Hancock, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["kinesin-13", "Klp59C", "Klp10A", "neuronal development", "microtubules", "cell polarity"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Dynamic and Asymmetric Protein Microcompartmentation in Aqueous Two-Phase Vesicles\n\n", "id": "6801", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4357", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Macromolecular crowding and microcompartmentation are fundamental features of the cell cytoplasm.

In pursuit of this goal, this thesis elicits two central questions: What are the underlying social structures that necessitate the construction of a building, and once it is built, how does the building affect society in return? In exploration of these questions, this thesis hypothesizes the idea that we are what we build, and to a degree, we become what we inhabit. In this way, the built environment innately develops as a historical archive that is reflective of cultural values and developments in technology and industry as an embodiment of collective thought. As values, industry, technology and paradigms change, the built environment changes as well. \n\nHowever, given the longevity of architecture, what is the relationship between the created built environment of one generation with the architecture and thought of subsequent generations? While all architecture chronicles cultural development at the moment of its construction, there are cases where architecture, through its longevity, also perpetuates the underlying social structures that necessitated its creation in the first place. Changes in the built environment resonate for generations, and If we are what we build, what is the affect of this architecture as a physical manifestation, and consequently a perpetuation, of antiquated collective thought? \n\nThough this analysis may also hold true for other artistic disciplines of music, painting or sculpture, architecture is a composition to which society is inescapably subjected. In this context, architecture can be regarded as an institution - an influential body that implicitly affects individual and collective thought and behavior. Such institutionalization of the built environment in the United States, its impact on the nation\u2019s social spaces, is the primary area of investigation for this thesis. Specifically, the architecture that evolved in the context of mass media and other mass-minded processes of mass production, mass dissemination, and mass marketing from their origination in the Renaissance Period to their current condition in the United States today, and the disparity between this architecture and emerging changes in media and collective thought.\n\nWhile positive characteristics of affordability and accessibility can be attributed to these mass-minded processes, which the built environment would embody, there came also unintended, unforeseeable negative social consequences that built space would inevitably concretize as well. Mass media, as a by-product of these mass-minded processes, was selected as the area of investigation for analyzing the unintentional social consequences of these processes resulting from mass media\u2019s underlying and candid influence on individual and collective social behavior. The unfavorable social attributes of mass media are grounded in social isolation, encompassing qualities of segregation, homogeneity, and exclusivity - societal qualities that were recorded in architecture and are present in the current built environment.\n\nAn understanding of the social consequences of these mass-minded processes is possible only with the benefit of reflection on the evolution of these systems. A thorough analysis of their development provides a backdrop for understanding emerging changes in processes to become sustainably-minded, changes in media systems to become social media, and hypothesizing the underlying social influences these structures will create. The positive qualities of social media are grounded in integration - human interaction, heterogeneity, and ritual - social qualities that are in contrast to the characteristics associated with mass media. In time, when the virtual environment of social media inevitably translates into the physical environment of architecture, the architectural embodiments of these media systems will conflict as well. This discordance is suggestive of the onset of a paradigm shift from isolation to integration, which provides an opportunity to explore the perpetuation of antiquated thought through the architecture of one generation as it lags the social progress of future generations. This exploration articulates the relationship between architecture and cultural for the purpose of conceptualizing an inevitable social-media architecture and anticipating abundantly-social built spaces in the future. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [168], "author_name_tesi": "Longenbach, Adam John", "last_name_ssi": "Longenbach", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darla V Lindberg", "Darla V Lindberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darla V Lindberg, Thesis Advisor", "Darla V Lindberg, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Facebook", "Mass Marketing", "Mass Production", "American Architecture", "Social Media", "Mass Media", "Twitter", "Periodization"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Pennsylvania's Private Forest Landowners: Exploring Motivations, Management Activities and Sources of Information", "id": "15245", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7624", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nearly three-quarters of Eastern forests are owned by private forest landowners (PFLs); the combined decisions made by PFLs have important implications on forest resources. We all benefit from the economic, aesthetic, recreational, and ecological services private forests provide. However, America\u2019s forested landscape is changing. Forests are becoming more physically disconnected as their surrounding land uses become increasingly urban in nature. In addition, the number of forest owners is increasing, while average forest parcel size is decreasing. The movement from large ownerships toward a more diverse range of owners has resulted in a multiplicity of management approaches, land tenure, and landowner characteristics.

Carbon nanostructured materials, such as functionalized graphene sheets (FGS) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), with high surface area and transport properties could facilitate selective enhancement of fuels through doping or catalytic action.  Additionally, high optical adsorption provides the possibility of lower energy, higher reliability ignition methods over point ignition found in most combustion systems.  FGS and SWCNTs are examined both in dry state and in solution.  Dry material characterization is performed via scanning and transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, surface area measure, and absorptance evaluation.  Solutions are examined for dispersability, absorptance, droplet burning characteristics, and photo-sensitivity.\nOptical absorptance testing for both materials in solution revealed blackbody behavior throughout the visible regime with no particular wavelength sensitivity.  This poses opportunity for selective heating of the nanostructured materials by choosing an incident wavelength outside of the absorptance capability of the base fuel.  In solution, SWCNTs exhibit agglomeration and structure alteration with light exposure, making bulk characteristics difficult to determine in applications requiring moderately strong light.  \nDroplet burning tests of nitromethane and Jet-A solutions at 500\u00b0C showed a two stage burning rate behavior in nitromethane based mixtures when ambient temperature was near the FGS sample\u2019s onset of oxidation temperature (determined by TGA/DSC).  Overall burning rate enhancement of nominally 30% was observed for nitromethane dispersed with small quantities of FGS that were highly functionalized (carbon to oxygen ratio of 19).  This trend is consistent with the higher temperature oxidation onset of less functionalized (more reduced) FGS (carbon to oxygen ratio of 50).  For example, at 600\u00b0C, a two stage burning profile was found for nitromethane dispersed with FGS (carbon to oxygen ratio of 50).  The first stage burning rate was reduced from the pure nitromethane case by 49%, while the second stage was enhanced by 17%.  As ambient temperature is increased the two stage burning appears to be no longer evident.  SWCNTs exhibited little effect on solution burning rates, though there was a great degree of variance, particularly in the Jet-A sample (35% standard deviation).  \nLaser induced photo-ignition attempts of solutions proved that inclusion of carbon nanostructured materials can enhance energy absorption, and offers validation of capability to selectively heat nanostructured materials in solution.  This is the first such examination of FGS for photo-ignition behavior in solution.  Repeatable internal nucleation was observed in both SWCNTs and FGS in nitromethane; the reaction decayed with each successive light pulse in SWCNTs.  This is likely indicative of high energy absorption, and subsequent vaporization of surrounding fuel.  The fact that no decay is evident for FGS samples indicates that nucleation is not likely a result of chemical reaction, suggesting decay in SWCNTs can be attributed to agglomeration with exposure as previously observed.  This provides clues as to the source of nanostructure photo-ignition in air.\nMaterials characterization provides thermal oxidation temperatures, relative structure, and material content of each sample to facilitate the analysis of the properties exhibited by bulk samples.  FGS is found to possess many contaminants, which may influence bulk properties, and has varying agglomeration tendency between samples.  SWCNTs vary in micron scale structure and composition based upon production method.  Acid washes, used in production of FGS and purification of SWCNTs for later functionalization is proven to introduce significant quantities of contaminants (residue of oxidizers).  Particularly in SWCNTs, differing ambient exposure conditions over the lifetime of the material is believed to greatly influence properties.  This variability poses an inhibiting challenge to large scale use of carbon nanostructured materials, as material behavior cannot be considered reproducible from batch to batch.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4289], "author_name_tesi": "Loomis, Matthew Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Loomis", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter", "Richard A Yetter", "Dr Jongguen Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter, Thesis Advisor", "Richard A Yetter, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Jongguen Lee, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Carbon Nanotubes", "graphene", "fuel additives", "photo-ignition"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Shallow water redox conditions from Permian-triassic boundary microbialites:  the rare earth element and iodine geochemistry of carbonates from Turkey and South China\n", "id": "15674", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7994", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rare earths and yittrium (REY), iodine, and major elements are determined in two carbonate sections spanning the Permian-Triassic transition in Demirtas, Turkey and Cili, South China.

Additionally, we employ Y/Ho ratio, La anomaly, and light rare earth element depletion to identify which samples preserve a seawater-like REY distribution.  Despite siliciclastic input, we find the Permian-Triassic boundary microbialites in both sections contain a negative Ce anomaly (average Pr/Pr*=1.07) indicative of deposition in an oxic environment.  These boundary microbialites have their base at the extinction horizon and are widespread within the Tethyan region.  In the Cili section, the underlying Permian limestone also preserves a seawater-like REY signature with a negative Ce anomaly.  This indicates that the water column was oxygenated both before and after the extinction event.  The Permian limestone in the Demirtas section does not preserve a seawater-like REY distribution, so the absence of a Ce anomaly cannot be used to distinguish prevailing redox conditions during deposition.  However, in these samples, we find the presence of a diverse Permian benthic community sufficient to identify deposition in an oxic environment.  The geochemical evidence for a continuously oxic environment during the deposition of the boundary microbialite presented in this study strongly supports work done using ostracods as redox indicators within the boundary microbialite in South China.  These microbialites have been proposed as a disaster facies caused by the exclusion of grazers.  Although anoxia is one of the suggested mechanisms for the exclusion of grazers, we find that it is not supported by geochemical evidence.

Fourier electron difference syntheses revealed that the changes in the configuration of the interlayer species, and the charge, size, and hydration of the substituting cations, serve as the primary controls on changes in unit-cell parameters.  Further TEM, SEM, and EDS analyses of batch Cs-exchange samples suggests that Na-birnessite and Cs-birnessite may co-exist in individual grains of birnessite, with both Na+ and Cs+ homogeneously distributed throughout individual incompletely exchanged grains.  This suggests that the Cs-exchange reaction pathway likely occurred as part of a diffusion process, possibly aided by partial delamination of the Mn-O octahedral layers.\nCation exchange rates for K-, Cs-, and Ba-exchange in birnessite were calculated for the first time from the time-resolved XRD results.  The exchange rates for Na in birnessite decreased in the order: Cs >> K > Ba.  These results are likely a function of hydration energy differences of the cations and the preference of the solution phase for the more readily hydrated cation.  The kinetic modeling supports a two-stage reaction pathway for cation exchange, and these kinetic steps correlate with changes in crystal structure.  Upon variation of solution pH, the K-exchange results quantitatively demonstrate that decreasing pH leads to faster cation exchange reaction kinetics.

LGMAP is used to predict the noise of an isolated or installed landing gear geometry.  The predictions include several techniques to approximate the aeroacoustic and aerodynamic interactions of landing gear noise generation.  These include 1) a method for approximating the shielding of noise caused by the landing gear geometry, 2) accounting for local flow variations due to the wing geometry, 3) the interaction of the landing gear wake with high-lift devices, and 4) a method for estimating the effect of gross landing gear design changes on local flow and acoustic radiation.\n\nThe LGMAP aeroacoustic prediction system has been created to predict the noise generated by a given landing gear. The landing gear is modeled as a set of simple components that represent individual parts of the structure. Each component, ranging from large to small, is represented by a simple geometric shape and the unsteady flow on the component is modeled based on an individual characteristic length, local flow velocity, and the turbulent flow environment. A small set of universal models is developed and applied to a large range of similar components. These universal models, combined with the actual component geometry and local environment, give a unique loading spectrum and acoustic field for each component. Then, the sum of all the individual components in the complete configuration is used to model the high level of geometric complexity typical of current aircraft undercarriage designs.\n\nA line of sight shielding algorithm based on scattering by a two-dimensional cylinder approximates the effect of acoustic shielding caused by the landing gear. Using the scattering from a cylinder in two-dimensions at an observer position directly behind the cylinder, LGMAP is able to estimate the reduction in noise due to shielding by the landing gear geometry. This thesis compares predictions with data from a recent wind tunnel experiment conducted at NASA Langley Research Center, and demonstrates that including the acoustic scattering can improve the predictions by LGMAP at all observer positions.  In this way, LGMAP provides more information about the actual noise propagation than simple empirical schemes.\n\nTwo-dimensional FLUENT calculations of approximate wing cross-sections are used by LGMAP to compute the change in noise due to the change in local flow velocity in the vicinity of the landing gear due to circulation around the wing. By varying angle of attack and flap deflection angle in the CFD calculations, LGMAP is able to predict the noise level change due to the change in local flow velocity in the landing gear vicinity.  A brief trade study is performed on the angle of attack of the wing and flap deflection angle of the flap system.  It is shown that increasing the angle of attack or flap deflection angle reduces the flow velocity in the vicinity of the landing gear, and therefore the predicted noise.  Predictions demonstrate the ability of the prediction system to quickly estimate the change in landing gear noise caused by a change in wing configuration.\n\nA three-dimensional immersed boundary CFD calculation of simplified landing gear geometries provides relatively quick estimates of the mean flow around the landing gear.  The mean flow calculation provides the landing gear wake geometry for the prediction of trailing edge noise associated with the interaction of the landing gear wake with the high lift devices.  Using wind tunnel experiments that relate turbulent intensity to wake size and the Ffowcs Williams and Hall trailing edge noise equation for the acoustic calculation, LGMAP is able to predict the landing gear wake generated trailing edge noise.  In this manner, LGMAP includes the effect of the interaction of the landing gear's wake with the wing/flap system on the radiated noise.\n\nThe final prediction technique implemented includes local flow calculations of a landing gear with various truck angles using the immersed boundary scheme.  Using the mean flow calculation, LGMAP is able to predict noise changes caused by gross changes in landing gear design. Calculations of the mean flow around the landing gear show that the rear wheels of a six-wheel bogie experience significantly reduced mean flow velocity when the truck is placed in a toe-down configuration.  This reduction in the mean flow results is a lower noise signature from the rear wheel.

This demonstrated a need to study differences between people from multiple cultures and the impact those differences may have on the work environment. While a review of the research literature showed cultural differences in motivation, there was no evidence of extant studies on how career motivation might vary among people from different cultures. Using a London\u2019s Career Motivation Inventory as a theoretical framework and a web-based version of a research-validated instrument, this study sought to identify the relationship between a student\u2019s nationality, age, and gender with career motivation. \n\nA review of the literature detailed past studies that identified weak relationships between age and gender and the three dimensions of career motivation: career resilience, career insight, and career identity. Literature regarding cultural differences in motivation seemed to indicate there would be some differences in career motivation, career resilience and career identity in particular, between the two groups. There are, however, individualist people in collectivist cultures and collectivist people in individualist cultures.\n\nOver the course of three weeks, more than 1,400 graduate students originating from 51 nations responded to the survey. Multivariate multiple regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses that no relationship existed between student nationality, age and gender and the career motivation dimensions. Although there were some significant differences between age groups while accounting for gender and student nationality, there was no evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there was no difference in career motivation dimensions between domestic and international students at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nAlthough the conclusions about career motivation and its relationships to student nationality, age, and gender from this study are limited, the power of the conclusions was very high due to the number of respondents. The first question of this study dealt with student nationality and its relationship to career resilience, career insight, and career identity. The analysis showed that no relationship existed. Differences between the cultures could have been masked by the diversity of cultures that made up the international respondents. \n\nThe results of the present study indicate relationships between age and the three dimensions of career motivation did exist. Women showed an increase in career resilience levels throughout their entire career life. For men there was an increase in career resilience from trial- to mid-career. There was not a significant difference between late-career men and the other two male age groups.\n\nIn the case of career insight and career identity, the results were virtually identical. Older women had higher levels of both insight and identity than trial-career men and women. Mid-career men also showed higher levels of career insight and career identity than trial-career men. For women career identity increased over their entire career although the difference between the two older groups was marginally insignificant. These results provided support for the existence of the relationship between age and career motivation dimensions and provided further clarity on the relationship between age and career motivation.\n\nThe last question of the study regarded gender\u2019s relationship to career motivation. The results of this study supported those previous findings of no existent significant relationship. \n\nSeveral recommendations for future research are made. A significant limitation of this study was treating the international students as a homogeneous group. By partitioning out the international students into their respective nations, researchers can come to a greater understanding of cultural influences on career motivation. In order to be able to generalize further than populations at large public American universities future research should address students at different types of universities and colleges. Researchers should also study students in different countries who attend schools or universities with similar factors such as student population, endowment, and degrees offered. This would offer an opportunity to study whether or not career motivation varies from culture-to-culture instead of from person-to-person living in the city but from different countries/cultures. Another interesting question for future study examines whether international students\u2019 motivation changes over time, specifically, over their first four to five years in the United States. The instrument used in this study is a self-report instrument. This lends the measures from the instrument open to respondent bias. Successful development of an assessment based on multiple sources would be an asset to the future of career motivation research.

In many places, floods are the most recurrent natural hazard and are responsible for the greatest property and economic losses.  Despite this, there are few studies that address the factors that influence adaptive capacity and resilience to floods and consequently there are few proposals for practical adaptation.  This thesis seeks to understand the processes underpinning adaptive capacity and resilience in two flood-prone communities in northeastern Puerto Rico in order to propose practical strategies to enhance adaptive capacity.  To accomplish this goal, first the thesis determines how everyday risks in people\u2019s lives influence their adaptive capacity, then it assesses the factors that facilitate adaptation and analyzes how these factors might affect future adaptive capacities, and finally it investigates the elements that support community resilience to floods and proposes ways to enhance that resilience.  The thesis employs participatory methods and techniques (listing, ranking and scoring, conceptual mapping, participatory mapping, and semi-structured interviews) with community members and emergency managers from the northeastern municipality of Fajardo, Puerto Rico.  The findings suggest that enhancing community member\u2019s adaptive capacity and resilience to floods requires attending to both everyday risks and hazard-specific risks.  The findings further indicate a need for tackling the factors that influence adaptive capacity: access to material, economic, institutional, and social resources.  Cognitive factors also appear to be important determinants of adaptive capacity in these two communities, particularly because past adaptations and the potential implementation of a flood control project are reducing flood-risk perceptions.  Thus, developing ways to increase risk perceptions and awareness about future flood potential is imperative.  In this sense, there is a need to continue employing adaptive strategies \u2013 even after implementing structural flood control projects \u2013 and to make clear the need for complementary non-structural strategies.  Finally, promoting effective linkages and collaborations between community members and emergency managers to encourage collective flood management promises to increase flood resilience in these two communities.  For this to happen, however, mutual distrust, lack of confidence, and other obstacles must be overcome. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6151], "author_name_tesi": "Lopez - Marrero, Tania del Mar", "last_name_ssi": "Lopez - Marrero", "middle_name_ssi": "del Mar", "first_name_ssi": "Tania", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brenton Yarnal", "Petra Tschakert", "Cynthia Ann Brewer", "Richard Stedman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brenton Yarnal, Committee Chair", "Petra Tschakert, Committee Chair", "Cynthia Ann Brewer, Committee Member", "Richard Stedman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["participatory methods", "floods", "adaptive capacity", "vulnerability", "Puerto Rico"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Crop Subsistence Yield Variability within Late Postclassic (1325-1521 A.D.) and Early Colonial (16th Century) Indigenous Communities in the Tepeaca Region, M\u00e9xico\n\n", "id": "12013", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "420", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study analyzes the impact of climate variability and human management strategies on the Late Postclassic (1325-1521 A.D.) and Early Colonial (16th century A.D.) agricultural systems in the Tepeaca Region, Puebla, Mexico.  This work seeks to model agricultural productivity at the household and regional levels and identify the buffering strategies developed by Tepeaca\u2019s populations against cyclical food shortfalls.  A dualistic model for the agricultural and economic structure of the Tepeaca altepetl or state-level polity is proposed.  Two independent forms of agriculture ran side by side in Tepeaca.  One was subsistence agriculture carried out by macehualli tributary populations and characterized by a low-level production capacity geared towards food production for auto-consumption needs.  The other was institutional agriculture, which dealt largely with the management and organization of agricultural systems destined for the support and finance of political institutions including the nobility and bureaucratic sectors of the community.  \nBoth subsistence and institutional agriculture depended mainly on local rainfall agriculture systems for food production.  Scholars acknowledge the unpredictable nature of rainfall agriculture.  Inter-annual food supply is highly unstable due to environmental effects on cultivars (e.g., climatic variability, localized rain patterns and pests), and differential managerial strategies (timing of sowing, construction of features, planting patterns, weeding, crop nourishing).  Such conditions produce variations in food production levels within households at the local and regional levels.  In spite of this, archaeological research has given more attention to average agricultural production values when reconstructing socio-demographic processes and the development of complex agricultural systems over time.  Little attention has been placed on understanding the divergences from the mean values when analyzing procurement strategies in subsistence and institutional agriculture.  By applying mean values to overall agricultural production within a settlement or a region, the natural characteristics of agricultural production are obscured.  Standardization can lead to an oversimplified view that a good or bad year\u2019s harvest will affect equally every sector of the community.  In fact, each year a sector of the agricultural population obtains good yields while others do badly.  At the institutional level, standardization of production is used in models that prefer a \u201ctop-down\u201d view in order to estimate surplus extraction via the tributary systems.  In such cases, food production is taken as being homogeneous for all sectors of the community and does not consider the dualistic nature of agricultural production.  The instability of agricultural production had important repercussions on the Tepeaca indigenous agrarian structure and the prevailing land tenure systems.  This affected the tributary demands that political entities could levy on the peasant majority.  Demands on agricultural production were usually not placed on the food resource base of households.  Rather, tributary demands focused on the labor force of peasants and the production of wealth items.  This was possible by a sharp land tenure polarization in which the local nobility controlled vast territories.  Commoner populations of macehualli where either smallholders under the auspices of a local tlahtoani ruler or landless peasants living in a noble\u2019s estate that in colonial times were known as terrazgueros.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [414], "author_name_tesi": "Lopez Corral, Aurelio ", "last_name_ssi": "Lopez Corral", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aurelio", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Lee Ann Newsom", "David Lee Webster", "Matthew Bennett Restall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Chair", "Lee Ann Newsom, Committee Member", "David Lee Webster, Committee Member", "Matthew Bennett Restall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Households", "terrazgueros", "peasants", "indigenous agriculture and climate variability", "Mesoamerica", "Early Colonial", "ancient maize production", "Late Postclassic", "Ethnohistory", "can\u00edcula."]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "EVOLVING PARTICLE TRAJECTORIES PERTURBATIVELY AROUND ROTATING BLACK HOLES IN THE TIME DOMAIN", "id": "5862", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5403", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-05-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Treating the Teukolsky perturbation equation numerically as a 2+1 PDE and smearing the singularities in the particle source term by the use of narrow gaussian distributions we have been able to reproduce earlier results for equatorial circular orbits and radial infall trajectories that were done using the more complex and computationally intensive frequency domain formalism using the Teukolsky or the Sasaki-Nakamura equations.\n\nA time domain prescription for a more general evolution of circular orbits inclined with respect to the equatorial plane of the black hole\nsimulating the orbital decay past the ISCO and the final plunge into the black hole will be presented.

However, high-cost noble-metal catalysts (typically platinum) hinder their widespread commercialization. Anion exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cells employ cationic moieties tethered to polymer chains and do not require expensive noble-metal catalysts due to their high internal device pH. Thus, AEMs are considered a next generation of fuel cells for stationary and transportation applications. To date, AEMs have their own set of challenges that need to be understood, including inferior conductivity and stability compared to PEMs. Water interactions within the cationic polymer membranes remain unexplored and are important for understanding and improving the ion conductivity of these materials. The main goal of thesis was to measure the hydration of cationic polymers with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy using the azide anion as a vibrational probe. Using azide (N3-) as a probe has the advantage of being a small molecule, is soluble in water, and has a strong IR absorption band. \nWith the objective of understanding hydration in AEMs, this thesis work was subdivided into two parts. The first part of the work focused on understanding the interaction of the azide (as TBAN3) in different solvent mixture environments as a foundation for its use as a vibrational probe. Studies were conducted on four sets of mixtures: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-H2O, tetrahydrofuran (THF)-H2O, chloroform-methanol (MeOH), and DMSO-chloroform. The FTIR spectra for these four sets of mixtures were analyzed, fitted using the appropriate number of mixed Lorentzian/Gaussian functions, and used to interpret the polymer spectra. Overall, it was observed that hydrogen bonding played a more dominant role for the peak position of the azide asymmetric stretch band, rather than the dielectric constant of the solvents and mixtures. The azide asymmetric stretch band blueshifted to a higher frequency contingent on each solvent\u2019s ability to form hydrogen bonds with the azide. Based on these findings, polar protic solvents, such as H2O and MeOH, which are strong hydrogen bond donors, were able to interact strongly with the azide, which is a hydrogen bond acceptor. Also, the polar aprotic solvents, such as DMSO and THF, interacted weakly with the azide. Interestingly, chloroform showed an intermediate interaction because of its ability to form a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the azide.\nThe second part of the work focused on studying a series of quaternary ammonium containing poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (QA-PPO) cationic polymers, as a model of an AEM experimental system, to measure their hydration behavior. Three comb-shaped QA-PPO polymers were synthesized with a pendant n-alkyl side chain of six, ten and sixteen carbons; respectively, benzyldimethylhexyl ammonium, benzyldimethyldecyl ammonium, and benzyldimethylcetyl ammonium; or C6, C10, and C16, in short. A control polymer was also synthesized with the same degree of bromination (0.4 bromomethyl groups per PPO repeat unit) but without a pendant alkyl side chain, referred to as benzyltrimethyl ammonium (BTMA). Thin films of the QA-PPO polymer samples were saturated with sodium azide (NaN3) and measured in-situ by attenuated total reflectance (ATR) FTIR, during hydration from 0 to 90% relative humidity (RH). All RH data was calculated to their respected hydration number (\u03bb), taking into consideration their ionic exchange capacity (IEC). All recorded FTIR spectra of the azide asymmetric stretch bands for the different QA-PPOs were presented, with the frequency of the azide band expressed as a function of \u03bb. QA-PPO BTMA, C6, C10, and C16 had different interactions with the azide and sodium azide species as evidenced by the position and intensity of their characteristic FTIR bands. For BTMA the wavenumber of the azide group was at ~2000 cm-1 and 2026 cm-1 at 0% RH (\u03bb=0) and 90% RH (\u03bb=4.3), respectively. For C16, the azide absorbance band was observed at approximately 2000 cm-1 and 2020 cm-1 at 0% RH and 90% RH, respectively. The frequency of the azide band for the other comb-shaped polymers (C6 and C10) fell in-between the two parameters discussed above.\nOverall, these results indicate that the interaction of the QA-PPOs with water becomes stronger as the alkyl pendant becomes shorter; as evidenced by the observation that BTMA had more bulk-like water values at each \u03bb (or % RH), and possibly indicative of higher water mobility within BTMA than within the comb-shaped polymers. When the fitted spectra data for BTMA and C16 (representing the two limits) at their respective RH was presented, the results better illustrated the behavior of the QA-PPOs. With the dry samples, the bands for the \u201cfree\u201d azides (at 2000 cm-1) were most prominent; but with increasing \u03bb, the bands for the \u201cfree\u201d azides and the azides interacting with the QA groups (at ~2007 cm-1) decreased while the azides interacting with water increased. Upon comparison between BTMA and C16, it was noted that for C16 a higher hydration level (>25% RH) was required to eliminate the \u201cfree\u201d azide band. It is assumed that the presence of alkyl side chains in C16 made it more difficult for the mobility of the water molecules within the membrane, and to promptly access all \u201cfree\u201d azides in the system.\nIn conclusion, the azide anion was successfully employed as a vibrational probe to measure the changes in water and polymer interactions and was effectively measured by ATR-FTIR. Further expansion of research in this area will lead to a better understanding of the ionic transportation and conductivity properties of cationic polymer membranes, such as the QA-PPOs. Understanding these properties is one of many steps needed to be taken in order to improve AEM technology and develop useful applications, such as energy and water purification systems.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15296], "author_name_tesi": "Lopez-Hallman, Raymond John", "last_name_ssi": "Lopez-Hallman", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Raymond", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "James Patrick Runt", "Robert John Hickey III"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Thesis Advisor", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Robert John Hickey III, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Anion Exchange Membrane", "Azide", "Hydration", "FTIR", "Hydration Probe", "Polymer Membrane"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Assessing the diverstiy of the monomorphic subspecies Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ", "id": "19249", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9275", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis is a widely consumed probiotic microorganism commonly added to fermented dairy products such as yogurt.  Health benefits associated with this subspecies are considered to be strain-specific, thus proper identification of these strains is critical.  However, the identification and differentiation of strains has remained difficult using both phenotypic and molecular methods.  Prior to this work very little genomic sequence existed for strains of this subspecies and no completed genomes were publically available.  To develop a better understanding of the subspecies B. animalis subsp. lactis, the genome of a commercial strain Bl-04 and the Type strain DSM 10140 were sequenced and compared.    \n    Comparison of the DSM 10140 and Bl-04 genome sequences (99.975% identical) revealed a high degree of identity and synteny as well as a total of 47 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 4 insertion/deletions (INDELs).  One non-synonymous SNP was identified in a putative glucose uptake protein (glcU).  The two strains were shown to have differential ability to grow on glucose as the sole carbohydrate source.  The high degree of similarity observed between these two strains explains the difficulties encountered in differentiation of strains of this subspecies.  \n    A collection of 24 strains of B. animalis subsp. lactis were screened using the SNPs/INDELs identified between DSM 10140 and Bl-04 as possible targets.  Results obtained from this analysis revealed a combination of nine SNPs/INDELs could be used to differentiate strains into 14 distinct genotypic groups.  The method reported here is the first available for B. animalis subsp. lactis and can be used in clinical, regulatory, and commercial applications requiring identification of B. animalis subsp. lactis at the strain level.\n    The genome of the closely related B. animalis subsp. animalis ATCC 25527 was sequenced in an effort to understand what genomic features differentiate the two subspecies.  Comparative genomic analysis revealed 156 and 182 genes that were unique to and absent in the B. animalis subsp. animalis genome when compared to B. animalis subsp. lactis genome, respectively. Among the differential content was a set of unique clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated genes and a novel CRISPR locus containing 30 spacers in the genome of B. animalis subsp. animalis.  Although, previous research had suggested the ability to grow in milk was a differential phenotype between these two subspecies.  Analysis revealed there is no significant difference between the subspecies in their ability to grow in milk and no differential gene content that would lead to such a result.  Supplementation with a protein hydrolysate allowed growth in milk by both subspecies suggesting lack of the ability to utilize milk proteins as the factor limiting growth in milk. \n    Subsequent to publication of the complete genome of B. animalis subsp. lactis DSM 10140 and Bl-04, seven additional strains of the subspecies have been reported and deposited in GenBank.  These genomes reveal remarkably little diversity leading to the term \u201cmonomorphic\u201d being applied to this group.  B. animalis subsp. lactis ATCC 27673 was selected for sequencing based on the report of a unique MLST profile when compared to other strains of the subspecies.  \nThe complete genome of ATCC 27673 was 1,963,012 bp and contained 1,616 genes, 4 rRNA operons, and had a G+C content of 61.55%.  Comparative analyses of the typical B. animalis subsp. lactis revealed the genome of ATCC 27673 contained six distinct genomic islands, encoding 83 ORFs that are absent from other strains of the same subspecies.  Phage or mobile genetic elements were identified in four of these genomic islands.  In island 6, the largest island, a novel type I-E CRISPR-cas system was identified, which contains 81 novel spacers. It is noteworthy that all other sequenced strains of this subspecies contain type I-C systems.  This study revealed ATCC 27673 is a strain of B. animalis subsp. lactis with novel genetic content, suggesting the lack of genetic variability observed to date is potentially due to the repeated sequencing of a limited number of widely distributed commercial strains.\n    In conclusion, the 47 SNPs and 4 INDELs identified between the sequenced strains DSM 10140 and Bl-04 separated the collection into 14 distinct genomic clusters.  B. animalis subsp. animalis ATCC 25527 was sequenced and compared to sequenced strains of B. animalis subsp. lactis and the previously identified defining phenotype that separates the two subspecies was examined and no differences were observed when both subspecies were grown in milk.  B. animalis subsp. lactis ATCC 27673 was identified as a potentially novel strain of the subspecies and was sequenced.  Six genomic islands containing novel lactis genomic sequence were identified.  The identification of this unique strain suggests more unique strains exist and the full diversity of the subspecies has not yet been explored.   \u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9082], "author_name_tesi": "Loquasto, Joseph Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Loquasto", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert F Roberts", "Edward G Dudley", "Rodolphe Barrangou", "Eric Thomas Harvill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert F Roberts, Committee Chair", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member", "Rodolphe Barrangou, Committee Member", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bifidobacteria", "probiotics", "genomics", "dairy products"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Improving Multiplication Fact Fluency Among High School Students With Learning Disabilities \n\n\n", "id": "10312", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2180", "abstract_tesi": "Before students are able to solve complex mathematic problems, they must be fluent with their facts.

Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) was used as the analytical framework that informed data analysis. \n\nThe following research questions guide this study; 1) What shapes and informs front-line supervisors learning? 2) What do front-line supervisors draw upon to develop and use supervisory skill? 3) How can informal instances of learning be empirically described in light of the full, complex range of artifacts, interactions, and shop-floor situations?\n\nCultural Historical Activity Theory provided the comprehensive and exhaustive framework allowing for analyzing both the manifest and latent shop-floor processes. The structure provided by the triangular diagrams and the associated diagrams detailing multiple ones provided the opportunity to maintain a conscious effort regarding all the data.  Analyzing how front-line supervisors addressed and resolved permitted me to empirically describe how they experienced learning. It permitted investigating the hidden world of front-line supervisors learning lives in respect to their accessing and grasping the latent aspects related to the division of labor, the unspoken rules, and the development and use of mediating instruments\n\nFront-line supervisors drew upon their ability to convert primary contradictions into peripheral ones and for generating mediating instruments for future use through addressing the present contradictions. They also drew upon their ability to use the artifacts in the three way of mediation. They were using an artifact as designed, using an artifact through appropriation of an existing one, and by creating new mediating artifacts. The specific mediation employed rises from their access to and grasp of the underlying conditions as well as the latent shop-floor aspects.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5174], "author_name_tesi": "Lord, Ramo Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Lord", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Ramo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Michael Schied", "Fred Michael Schied", "Dr Peter H Sawchuk", "Gary Kuhne", "Ian E Baptiste", "Steve L Thorne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Michael Schied, Dissertation Advisor", "Fred Michael Schied, Committee Chair", "Dr Peter H Sawchuk, Committee Chair", "Gary Kuhne, Committee Member", "Ian E Baptiste, Committee Member", "Steve L Thorne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CHAT", "cultural historical activity theory", "work and learning", "supervising"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Travel and Translatio:itinerant Writing Across Ottoman Worlds \n", "id": "21273", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "9707", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation analyzes travel and translation in nineteenth-century Ottoman writing. Conjoining novel and travel writing in unique ways, I aim to show that travel and translation were recurring themes during the Ottoman Tanzimat (Reformation) Period (1839-1876). I argue that novels and travel books served as vessels of translatio, in other words, as media of transmitting knowledge and power between the Ottoman Empire and the rest of the world. For this reason, travel and translation simultaneously epitomized and informed the Ottoman reformation. I see the literary works I examine in this dissertation as a part of a broader translation and communication movement that accelerated during the Ottoman Tanzimat era. I use the translatio studii et imperii theory with its various meanings in order to track this transmission of knowledge and power during this pivotal period in the Ottoman Empire. In my examination of al-Baghdadi\u2019s Terc\u00fcme-i Seyahatname-i Brezilya (1871) [Translation of the Travel Book of Brazil], I take translatio as a transmission of power and knowledge between continents. In \u00dcmit Burnu Seyahatnamesi (1876) [The Travel Book of the Cape of Good Hope] by \u00d6mer L\u00fctfi, translatio emerges as an imperial civilizing mission in an allegorical, but geographically actual, setting. In my analysis of Acayip-i Alem [Wonders of the world] (1882) by Ahmet Midhat, I take translatio as love, domination, and pursuit of desire. As a whole, this project seeks to contribute to scholarship on travel writing, world literature, Turkish literature, translation studies, the Ottoman Empire, and critical discourses on imperialism. It aims to expand the study of world literature and Turkish literature beyond the study of the novel and the national canon model, to a more comprehensive understanding of literary genres and geographies.

The assemblage of fishes inhabiting the mainstem of the Allegheny River in Pennsylvania is not well known.  There were large sections of the river that had never been sampled, and those sections that were sampled contained a large portion of available habitat unable to be sampled with historic techniques.  The overall assemblage of fishes inhabiting the river may have been misrepresented in historical accounts.  Additionally, poor water quality in the Ohio River system acted as a blockage to fish migration in this system.\n\tTo gain a better understanding of the ichthyofauna in the Allegheny River, I sampled 306 km of the river from Kinzua Dam to the lower limits of pool 2, just upriver of Pittsburgh, PA.  I used a benthic trawl, electrified benthic trawl, and gill nets and collected 11,102 fish representing 64 species from June to September, 2008.  I sampled 68 trawl sites (286 trawls) and 35 gill net sites (84 gill net sets).  Included in my collections were 10 species of special concern in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  I made distributional maps for all species encountered.  Small benthic fishes were more common and widely distributed than once thought and that large river fishes are dispersing throughout the Ohio River system as water quality improves.  By examining historic accounts and my collections, I compiled a list of 106 species of fish reported from the Allegheny River drainage and five more that I expect to be present.\n  The origins of Allegheny River fish populations have been hypothesized based on the best geological understanding of the watershed and the biological and ecological constraints of the species involved.  I examined the morphology of three species to determine possible routes of dispersal to and from the Allegheny River.  My morphological analysis of Campostoma anomalum (Rafinesque), Etheostoma blennioides (Rafinesque), and Etheostoma flabellare (Rafinesque) showed that these fishes may have utilized different routes of dispersal.  The similarity of the populations among drainages varied among the three species.

Common bean genotypes tolerant to drought or low phosphorus conditions have been identified, and root traits associated with tolerance to such stress have been examined.  The utility of these root traits in tolerant genotypes is usually tested using seed from a well-watered and high-nutrient parental environment.  However, many farmers in developing nations collect seed for the next year\u2019s crop from parent plants grown in low phosphorus and/or drought conditions.  Thus, it is important to understand how progeny from a stressed parental environment perform under similar stressful conditions.  \n\nThis study investigates the impact of a low phosphorus and/or drought parental environment on progeny seed and root traits.  To test whether differences in progeny seed and root traits from stressed parental environments could be explained by differences in parental provisioning of seeds during seed development, we also examined seed and root traits in seeds from different pod positions (stylar versus peduncular) and pod developmental times on the parent plant.  Greenhouse, field, and seedling experiments were used to evaluate seed, seedling, and mature root traits in progeny from stressed and non-stressed parental conditions.  \n\nIn parental drought studies, progeny from drought stressed parents had lower individual seed weight, lower basal root number (BRN) in both seedlings and plants at growth stage R2, and lighter total seedling dry weight, shorter seedling basal roots, shorter lateral roots borne on seedling tap roots.  The length and density of root hairs borne on seedling tap and basal roots also differed between progeny from parental drought and well-watered environments. At growth stage R2 progeny from parental drought had a smaller basal root diameter, lighter shoot dry weight, fewer shoot-borne roots, and fewer dominant shoot-borne roots. In parental phosphorus (P) studies, progeny from a low P parental environment had lower individual seed P content, fewer shoot-borne roots at R2, and greater BRWN at R2.  In studies comparing root traits between seeds from the peduncular (closest to the petiole) versus stylar (farthest from the petiole) positions in the pod, and between seeds from early versus late developing pods, seeds from the peduncular position in the pod at growth stage R2 had lower individual seed weight, lower BRN, lighter root dry weight, smaller tap root diameter, and fewer lateral roots borne on basal roots.  In all studies, responses to parental effects varied across genotypes. Seed and seedling root traits had greater consistency across genotypes compared to mature root traits, whereas stronger genotypic effects were seen in mature root traits.  Seeds and seedlings showed more consistency in parental effects across genotypes likely due to the exposure to fewer environmental factors, resulting in less variability among measured traits.  \n\nOverall, progeny from drought stressed parents, progeny from a low P parental environment, and seeds from the peduncular position within the pod had root traits that were lighter, shorter, smaller in diameter, or fewer in number.  Parent plants grown under stressful conditions such as low P and drought during seed fill may have had less resources available to allocate into seeds during seed fill, relative to parent plants in well-watered and high fertility environments. Seeds from the peduncular position may have had root traits that were lighter, shorter, or smaller in diameter due to later fertilization within the pod compared to seeds from the stylar position. Thus, most differences in root traits from stressed parents or seeds from the peduncular position were likely explained by lower parental provisioning of seeds during seed fill.  In addition to parental effects that suggest lower parental provisioning, possible adaptive parental effects were found in both parental drought and parental low P studies.  Greater BRWN in progeny from P stressed parents may be adaptive to low P conditions by increasing the area of soil explored, assisting in potentially greater acquisition of P in low P soils.  Longer basal roots in seedlings from parental drought may assist in greater exploration of deeper soil where water is more available under drought conditions. \n\nResults from this study may be used to help improve food security in developing nations by assisting the selection of genotypes that thrive in nutrient and water deprived soils in current and subsequent generations.  This thesis demonstrated profound differences in root phenotypes in response to parental stress, seed position in the pod, and pod developmental time, depending on the genotype. Thus, the parental environment in which seeds are collected must be a factor that is considered in breeding programs and phenotyping initiatives. Genotypes displaying potential adaptations to stress in response to the previous generation should be considered in breeding programs, but genotypes displaying relatively greater reduction in provisioning of progeny in response to parental stress should be avoided. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12640], "author_name_tesi": "Lorts, Claire Madeline", "last_name_ssi": "Lorts", "middle_name_ssi": "Madeline", "first_name_ssi": "Claire", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Marie Brown", "Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Dawn S Luthe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Marie Brown, Thesis Advisor", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Parental effects", "Common bean", "Phaseolus vulgaris", "Drought stress", "Phosphorus stress", "Root traits", "Seed position within the pod", "Pod developmental time", "Seedling", "Greenhouse", "Field"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Aerosol Acidity on the Morphology and Ice Nucleation of Aerosol Particles", "id": "14735djl301", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14735", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "          Aerosol particle morphology can influence the water uptake, heterogeneous chemistry, and optical properties of the particle. This morphology is known to be dependent on the composition of the particle as well as relative humidity. Recent studies have pointed out the importance of pH in aerosol particles. The pH of systems being investigated during phase transition studies have not investigated the role of pH, which could lead to the deprotonation of the organic component and would affect phase transitions. To investigate the influence of high pH and therefore deprotonation on the phase transitions of 3-methylglutaric acid:ammonium sulfate, sodium hydroxide was used to make solutions with pHs below the pKa1, between the pKa1 and pKa2, and above pKa2 of 3-methylglutaric acid. Using optical microscopy and an environmental chamber, the separation relative humidity (SRH), mixing relative humidity (MRH), efflorescence relative humidity (ERH) and deliquescence relative humidity (DRH) were recorded for each system. As the pH of the system was increased, the SRH decreased. This was attributed to the increased solubility of the organic component in water when it was deprotonated. The ERH also changed to higher values with added sodium hydroxide. The MRH and DRH values, however, remained constant over all pH. A previously unobserved hysteresis was found between SRH and MRH and the atmospheric implications are discussed. The influence of low pH was also explored in a similar manner, but through addition of concentrated sulfuric acid. Stoichiometric amounts of sulfuric acid was added to six different organic:ammonium sulfate systems to change the salt identity to letovicite, (NH4)3H(SO4)2, and ammonium bisulfate, NH4HSO4. An experiment at low pH was also conducted for each system. In every case, the addition of sulfuric acid led to an overall decrease in SRH, as expected with changing salt identity. Furthermore, at the lowest pH studied the SRH of four of the six systems were so low that phase separation would not occur in atmospherically relevant conditions. Also, phase separation could occur with no inorganic salt present at all. The ERH and DRH for each system also were affected. These results could affect mass transfer and water uptake for systems at low pH, and can be further explored by investigating the role of pH in particle viscosity and submicron aerosol morphology.\n          Fly ash can undergo aging in the atmosphere through interactions with sulfuric acid and water. These reactions can lead to physical and chemical changes caused by reaction products or chemical leaching. These changes could influence the amount of soluble material on the particle as well as the ability of the particle to nucleate ice. Both of these affect the fly ash particle\u2019s ability to serve as a cloud nucleus. The extent of these changes is expected to be linked to the chemical composition of the fly ash so three fly ash types were investigated. The effect of water- and acid-treatment were assessed using X-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy with selected area electron diffraction and energy dispersive spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis, and immersion freezing. The results show the presence of soluble material on fly ash and indicate that sulfuric-acid treatment has major physical and chemical effects on fly ash. These effects are dependent on composition of the fly ash. Acid-treatment results in gypsum being created and a variety of metals to be leached, and these changes did affect the immersion ice nucleation activity of the samples.

Vibration control\nis categorized as: active, passive, semi-active or hybrid, based on the power consumption\nof the control system and feedback or feedforward based on whether sensing is used to\ncontrol vibration. In this thesis, we study input shaping control of Distributed Parame-\nter Systems (DPS) and passive and semi-active vibration control using Fluidic Flexible\nMatrix Composites (F2MC).\nFirst, we extend input shaping control to one dimensional continua. Unlike discrete\nsystems where the input is shaped only in the temporal domain, temporal and spatial\ninput shaping can produce zero residual vibration in setpoint position control of distrib-\nuted strings and beams. For collocated and noncollocated boundary control of strings\nand domain control of strings and pinned beams, the response to step inputs is solved\nin closed form using delays. For a clamped beam model, a closed form in\u2026nite modal\nseries is used. The boundary controlled string can be setpoint regulated using two-pulse\nZero Vibration (ZV) and three-pulse Zero Vibration and Derivative (ZVD) shapers but\nZVD is not more robust to parameter variations than ZV, a unique characteristic of\nsecond-order PDE systems. Noncollocated ZV and ZVD boundary control enables rigid\nbody translation of a string with zero residual vibration. Domain controlled strings and\npinned beams with spatial input distributions that satisfy certain orthogonality condi-\ntions (e.g. midspan point load or uniformly distributed load) can be setpoint regulated\nwith shaped inputs. For the cantilevered beam, modal shaping of the input distribution\nand ZV or ZVD temporal shaping drives the tip to the desired position with zero residual\nvibration.\nA command shaping approach in vibration control using F2MC tubes as variable\nsti\u00a4ness structures is studied in the third chapter. The apparent sti\u00a4ness of F2MC tubes can be changed using a variable ori\u2026ce valve. With \u2026ber reinforcement, the volume inside\nthe tube may change with external load. With an open valve, the liquid is free to move\nin or out of the tube, so the apparent sti\u00a4ness does not change. When the valve is closed,\nthe high bulk modulus liquid is con\u2026ned, which resists the volume change and causes the\napparent sti\u00a4ness of the tube to increase. The equations of motion of an F2MC-mass\nsystem is derived using a 3-D elasticity model and the energy method. A reduced order\nmodel is then developed for fully-open and fully-closed valves. A Skyhook control that\ncycles the valve between open and closed, asymptotically decays the vibration. A Zero\nVibration (ZV) Sti\u00a4ness Shaping technique is introduced to suppress the vibration in\n\u2026nite time. A sensitivity analysis of the ZV Sti\u00a4ness Shaper studies the robustness to\nparametric uncertainties.\nWe also investigate passive and semi-active vibration control using F2MC tubes.\nF2MC tubes \u2026lled with \u2021uid and connected to an accumulator through a \u2026xed ori\u2026ce\ncan provide damping forces in response to axial strain. If the ori\u2026ce is actively con-\ntrolled, the sti\u00a4ness of F2MC tubes can be dynamically switched from soft to sti\u00a4. The\nstability of the unforced dynamic system is proven using a Lyapunov approach. The\nreduced-order model for operation with either a fully-open or fully-closed valve moti-\nvates the development of a ZV feedback control law, that suppresses vibration in \u2026nite\ntime. Coupling of a \u2021uid-\u2026lled F2MC tube to a pressurized accumulator through a \u2026xed\nori\u2026ce is shown to provide signi\u2026cant passive damping. The open valve ori\u2026ce size is op-\ntimized for optimal passive, Skyhook, and ZV controllers by minimizing the ITAE cost\nfunction. Simulation results show that the optimal open valve ori\u2026ce provides a damping\nratio of 0:35 compared to no damping in closed valve case. The optimal ZV controller\noutperforms optimal passive and Skyhook controllers by 32:9% and 34:2% for impulse\nand 34:7% and 60% for step response, respectively. Theoretical results are con\u2026rmed\nby experiments that demonstrate the improved damping provided by optimal passive\ncontrol F2MC and fast transient response provided by semi-active ZV control.\nFinally, we develop a novel Tuned Vibration Absorber (TVA) using F2MC. Coupling\nof a \u2021uid-\u2026lled F2MC tube through a \u2021uid port to a pressurized air accumulator can\nsuppress primary mass forced vibration at the tuned absorber frequency. A 3-D elasticity\nmodel for the tube and a lumped \u2021uid mass produces a 4th order model of an F2MC-\nmass system. The model provides a closed-form isolation frequency that depends mainly\non the port inertance, ori\u2026ce \u2021ow coe\u00a2 cient, and the tube parameters. A small viscous\ndamping in the ori\u2026ce increases the isolation bandwidth. With a fully closed ori\u2026ce, the\nzero disappears, and the system has a single resonant peak. Variations in the primary\nmass do not change the isolation frequency, making the F2MC TVA robust to mass\nvariations. Experimental results validate the theoretical predictions in showing a tunable\nisolation frequency that is insensitive to primary mass variations, and a 94% reduction\nin forced vibration response relative to the closed valve case.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [413], "author_name_tesi": "Lotfi Gaskarimahalle, Amir ", "last_name_ssi": "Lotfi Gaskarimahalle", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amir", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn", "Christopher Rahn", "Alok Sinha", "Qian Wang", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Chair", "Alok Sinha, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Semi-active Control", "Tuned Vibration Absorbers", "Variable Stiffness Systems", "Input Shaping", "Vibration Control"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Colloidal Thermal Fluids", "id": "25108", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11127", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fluids have very low thermal conductivity in compare to solid material. Improving heat transfer properties in many heating/cooling industrial process where common fluids such as water are used has been a great concern . Adding solid particles even at low volume fraction to a fluid, increases thermal conductivity of the fluid significantly. Maxwell's mean field theory is the basic theory evaluating conduction in such complex suspensions. However, there is a discrepancy between the theory and many experimental measurements and also a large variability among experimental measurements themselves. Larger thermal enhancement, beyond Maxwell prediction, has questioned the accuracy of the classical models to describe conduction in colloidal suspensions. However, it has been proposed that uncontrolled aggregation, which nearly exists in all the experimental systems could be responsible of this inconstancy. This hypothesis originates from Maxwell's theory because in fact, the theory has two limiting bounds depending on the configuration of the phases, providing a range where thermal conductivity may fall.  However no experiment has yet directly shown the effect of aggregation on thermal properties of colloidal suspensions. This is mainly because controlling the degree of aggregation in colloidal suspensions is quite a challenge: once an aggregate forms, it grows unbeatably until precipitates out the solution or reaches a large size where further aggregation becomes very slow. \n\nIn this dissertation, a reversible system with well controlled degree of aggregation of the particles was developed. By surface modification of colloidal silica with aminosilanes, interactions among the particles were tuned in a controlled way to produce stable sized clusters at different pH values ranges from well disposed to a colloidal gel. N-[3-(tri-methoxy-silyl)-propyl]-ethylene-diamine (TMPE) monolayer on particle surface not only removes all the reactive sites to prevent chemical aggregation, also provides steric stabilization in the absence of any repulsion. After surface modification, electrokinetic behavior of silica particles were changed to that of amino groups, positive in acidic pH and neutral at basic pH values. By tuning the pH, the balance between electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic interactions was reversibly controlled. As a result, clusters with different sizes were developed. \n\nThe effect of clustering on the thermal conductivity of colloidal dispersions was quantified using silane-treated silica, a system engineered to exhibit reversible clustering under well-controlled conditions. Thermal conductivity of this system was measured by transient hot wire, the standard method of thermal conductivity measurements in liquids.  We show that the thermal conductivity increases monotonically with cluster size and spans the entire range between the two limits of Maxwell's theory. The results, corroborated by numerical simulation, demonstrate that large increases of the thermal conductivity of colloidal dispersions are possible, yet fully within the predictions of classical theory. \n\nNumerical calculations were performed to evaluate the importance of structural properties of particles/aggregates on thermal conduction in colloidal particles.\nThermal conductivity of non-spherical particles including hollow particles, cubic particles and rods was studied using a Monte Carlo algorithm. We show that anisotropic shapes, increase conductivity above that of isotropic particles where Maxwell's theory is reliable. This method also provides an accurate tool for evaluation of conductivity in colloidal suspensions between Maxwell's limits where theory is inadequate and experiments are limited due to colloidal difficulties.  The effect of cluster configuration and degree of aggregation was investigated and showed that clusters of about the same size, but with different structures increases conductivity by different degree. We also showed that even small structural details such as the size of the neck that particles form during aggregation, can change the enhancement significantly.\n\nColloidal clusters conduct heat more efficiently compared to fully dispersed particles at the same volume fraction. We present a predictive model to calculate the thermal conductivity of clusters by extending Maxwell's theory to non-spherical particles. We treat the clusters as spheres with effective thermal conductivity kc and volume fraction \u03d5c. We calculate conductivity of the cluster from the upper bound of Maxwell's theory, and the conductivity of a dispersion of such clusters from the lower limit of the theory.  We show that structural effects can be represented by a single parameter and a method was provided to obtain this parameter from numerical simulations. We test the theory against simulations as well as dispersions of colloidal cluster and find it to be in very good agreement with both. The results suggest that the variability of literature data and the unusually high values of thermal conductivity that have been reported in the literature can be fully accounted by the presence of clusters.   \n\nGelation occurs at the isoelectric point of silane-treated silica where no repulsion among the particles exists and hydrophobic interactions push the system into gelation. We experimentally studied the kinetics of both aggregation and deadggregation rate. At the isoelectric point, gelation time can be varied from seconds to months by controlling the silane concentration, particle concentration and temperature. Small increase in the silane concentration at constant volume fraction of the particles, causes disproportional decrease in aggregation rate. Temperature also has a significant effect: particles aggregate much faster at higher temperatures. However, regardless of different aggregation rates all the samples will eventually gel. We show that the unattached silanes swimming freely in the solution are responsible for the observed behavior. Particles are just physically bonded and this weak attraction can be broken either by lowering the pH of the suspension to induce repulsion among the particles or with sonication. Stable clusters form by pH deaggregation but sonication only produces unstable clusters.\nAt constant pH, the rate of deaggregation can be controlled by particle/silane concentration in the same way that aggregation rate was controlled. Higher silane concentration well dispersed suspension in in favor and higher degaggregation rates are observed.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10692], "author_name_tesi": "Lotfizadeh, Saba ", "last_name_ssi": "Lotfizadeh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Saba", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Themis Matsoukas", "Darrell Velegol", "James Hansell Adair", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Themis Matsoukas, Dissertation Advisor", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thermal Conductivity", "Aggregation", "Maxwell's Theory", "Reversible Gels", "Nanoclusters", "Continuum Model", "Controlled Cluster Formation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Game Features and Trust Belief Formation: A Study in an MMORPG\n", "id": "27254", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12035", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Today\u2019s video games are not simply isolated entertainment to be consumed, but designed human experiences that provide for a rich set of behaviors in naturalistic settings.

One particularly interesting element of social behavior that could be applied to game design is trust. But, as part of a complex social process, trust has been difficult to both design and study. This research considered and extended a cognitive model of trust and used it to explore and evaluate how features in the massively multiplayer role playing games (MMORPG) World of Warcraft (WoW) effected the formation of trust beliefs. \n\nQualitative analytic induction was used to evaluate data and assess changes in the trust theory. The research illustrated a significant correlation between game features and how players develop trust towards each other. During analysis, an additional factor \u2013 trust belief formation delegation \u2013 was discovered in the form of reputation, group identity, and telepresence. Additionally, the analysis contributed to extensions in the use and understanding of adaptive structuration theory, temporal motivation theory, and swift trust.\n\nThis new knowledge bridges the areas of game design and other social science research, emphasizing the use of games as a research medium for socially complex behavior. Additionally, it has the potential to provide industry with a predictive mechanism that can be considered while designing game features and additionally facilitates player discussion with developers to address perceived negligence in design. These results were used to create design guidelines for video game designers to support trust formation using game features. Two examples of game features that follow these guidelines were provided \u2013 the first as an alteration of an existing game feature in WoW, and the second as the design of a new feature for role playing games.

Taking quite seriously the now common suggestion that universities are corporate entities, this dissertation examines the ways in which trends affecting the majority of employers (and their employees) have become manifest in one branch of higher education: composition studies. Of course, each composition subfield relates to economic conditions in complex, individualized fashion. Process methods of writing pedagogy decentralize classroom authority; force students to write innovative, unique, personalized accounts rather than replicating conventional forms; and remove standard measures of excellent, thereby forcing students to improve their work indefinitely.  In all of these ways, Process approaches mimic shifts in post-industrial managerial logic.  Given that critical pedagogies often act in direct resistance to capitalist, instrumental logics, they tend to become out-dated rather quickly. But, since capitalist systems tend to incorporate the demands of those who oppose them, resistance movements encounter an ambiguous form of success/failure.  Surveying the history of expressivism along that of cultural studies composition, one witnesses a surprising, though largely unremarked, set of similarities.

With the development of technology, it is crucial to identify a small subset of covariates that exhibits the strongest relationship with the response. Researchers have made much effort on developing variable selection methodologies, such as regularized techniques, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO, Tibshirani, 1996) and penalized least squares estimate with smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty (SCAD, FanLi, 2001).\n\nDifferent from those regularization methods for variable selection in linear models, Buhlmann(2010) proposed the PC-simple algorithm to select significant variables. As they showed, under some conditions and proper choice of the significance level, the PC-simple algorithm can consistently identify the true active set with probability approaching $1$ when the response and covariates are jointly normally distributed.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we study the performance of the PC-simple algorithm under a non-normal distribution. The PC-simple algorithm develops the variable selection based on the fact that the asymptotic distributions of Fisher's z-transform of the sample marginal and partial correlations follow standard normal distribution. This fact is invalid when the samples are from non-normal distributions. This is the drawback of the PC-simple algorithm. Thus, we derive the asymptotic distribution of Fisher's z-transform of the sample marginal correlations and partial correlations under elliptical distributions, and we find that the asymptotic distributions depend on the kurtosis. According to the threshold we develop, the PC-simple algorithm would result in over-fitting a model with positive kurtosis, and under-fitting a model with negative kurtosis.\n\n\nThe results from the extensive simulation studies with elliptical distributions, including normal distributions and mixture normal distributions, are consistent with our understanding. With normal samples, the PC-simple algorithm and our proposal have similar performance as both of them utilize similar asymptotic distributions of the sample marginal and partial correlations. However, with mixture normal distributions, the PC-simple algorithm overfits the data as the kurtosis of the mixture normal distributions are greater than 0. Our proposal outperforms PC-simple algorithm in terms of the correct fitting percentage. That implies adjusting the variance is urgent. Moreover, the application of our proposal to the cardiomyopathy microarray data suggests that our proposal is comparable to the regularization approach with the SCAD penalty, and outperforms the LASSO penalty. Furthermore, by imposing some conditions on the partial correlations, we show that the proposed approach can consistently identify the true active set. \n\n\nIn Chapter 4, we study how to apply the thresholded partial correlation approach to select significant variables in partially linear models. First, we transform the partially linear model to a linear model approximately by the partial residuals technique. Then we apply the thresholded partial correlation approach to the resulting linear model to obtain the estimated active set. After that, we apply the least squares approach to get the estimates of the coefficients in the linear part. The estimation of the nonparametric function is obtained via substituting the estimation of the linear part into the original model. We call this approach the thresholded partial correlation on partial residuals (TPC-PR) approach. Similarly, we can utilize the PC-simple algorithm on the partial residuals, pretending the samples are from normal distributions, and we call the resulting algorithm the PC-simple algorithm on partial residuals (PC-PR). We establish the asymptotic consistency of variable selection in the linear part, and the asymptotic normality of the nonparametric function. Simulation studies show that our proposal performs as well as the penalized approach on partial residuals with the SCAD penalty (FanLi, 2004), and outperforms the LASSO penalty. The real data analysis also demonstrates that our proposal can yield a parsimonious model.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9181], "author_name_tesi": "Lou, Lejia ", "last_name_ssi": "Lou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lejia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Runze Li", "Runze Li", "David Russell Hunter", "Bing Li", "Rongling Wu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Runze Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Runze Li, Committee Chair", "David Russell Hunter, Committee Member", "Bing Li, Committee Member", "Rongling Wu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Variable Selection", "Linear Model", "Partially Linear Model", "Nonparametric Regression"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Nonlinear propagation of high-frequency energy from blast waves as it pertains to bat hearing", "id": "7420", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "562", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Close exposure to blast noise from military weapons training can adversely affect the hearing of both humans and wildlife.  One concern is the effect of high-frequency noise from Army weapons training on the hearing of endangered bats.  Blast wave propagation measurements were conducted to investigate nonlinear effects on the development of blast waveforms as they propagate from the source. Measurements were made at ranges of 25, 50, and 100 m from the blast. Particular emphasis was placed on observation of rise time variation with distance. Resolving the fine shock structure of blast waves requires robust transducers with high-frequency capability beyond 100 kHz, hence the limitations of traditional microphones and the effect of microphone orientation were investigated. Measurements were made with a wide-bandwidth capacitor microphone for comparison with conventional 3.175-mm (1/8-in.) microphones with and without baffles. The 3.175-mm microphone\noriented at 90 degrees to the propagation direction did not have sufficient high-frequency response to capture the actual rise times at a range of 50 m. Microphone baffles eliminate diffraction artifacts on the rise portion of the measured waveform and therefore allow for a more accurate measurement of the blast rise time.  The\nwide-band microphone has an extended high-frequency response and can resolve shorter rise times than conventional microphones.  For a\nsource of 0.57 kg (1.25 lb) of C-4 plastic explosive, it was observed that nonlinear effects steepened the waveform, thereby decreasing the shock rise time, from 25 to 50 m.  At 100 m, the\nrise times had increased slightly.\n\nFor comparison to the measured blast waveforms, several models of nonlinear propagation are applied to the problem of finite-amplitude blast wave propagation.

The models successfully predict blast wave rise times at medium distances in a homogeneous atmosphere, although rise time predictions are shorter than what was measured in an inhomogeneous atmosphere. Atmospheric turbulence, absent in the models, may be the primary cause of this difference in rise times at longer distances.

Although these coals are of great economic importance, their behavior has not been well studied. This study compares the devolatilization and subsequent combustion behavior of an inertinite-rich (87.7% dmmf) and a vitrinite-rich (91.8% dmmf) South African coal, wet-screened to a narrow particle size distribution of 200 x 400 mesh. Pyrolysis chars were generated under rapid-heating conditions (104\u2212105 \u00b0C/s) in a drop-tube reactor to closely resemble chars generated in pulverized combustion conditions. The inertinite-rich coal took 400ms to devolatilize in the drop-tube, compared to only 240ms for the vitrinite-rich sample. The combustion reactivities of the chars were correlated to a range of chemical, physical, and optical characteristics including the maceral differences and high ash yields. To evaluate the combustion reactivity, isothermal and non-isothermal thermogravimetrical analyses (TGA) were utilized. The vitrinite-rich char had on average 20% higher reaction rates than the inertinite-rich char under the various combustion conditions. To verify these results, temperature programmed oxidation was used and confirmed the higher reactivity of the vitrinite-rich char, where the vitrinite-rich char reached a higher maximum carbon dioxide signal at 590\u00baC compared to 650\u00baC for the inertinite-rich char. The char samples were de-ashed with HCl and HF acid which resulted in an increase in combustion reactivity. The maximum reaction rate of the high-ash (36%) inertinite-rich char increased with 80% after de-ashing. This suggested that the ash acted as a barrier, and the removal of ash most likely increased the access to reactive surface area. While the vitrinite-rich char was slightly more reactive than the inertinite-rich char the similar char reactivities once de-ashed are consistent with the emerging recognition that these interitite-chars are far more reactive than N. American inertinite chars\n\n \nThe chemical and physical structures of the chars were characterized through a range of different analytical techniques to quantify the factors contributing to reactivity differences. The morphologies of the chars were characterized with SEM and optical microscopy, while quantitative information on the ordered nature of chars was obtained through XRD on de-ashed chars. The inertinite-rich coal experienced limited fluidity during heat-treatment, resulting in slower devolatilization, limited growth in crystallite height (11.8 to 12.6\u00c5), only rounding of particle edges, and over 40% of mixed-dense type chars. The vitrinite-char showed more significant structural transformations; producing mostly (80%) extensively swollen crassisphere, tenuisphere, and network-type chars, and XRD showed a large increase in crystallite height (4.3 to 11.7\u00c5). Nitrogen adsorption and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) were utilized to compare the nitrogen surface areas and pore size distributions of the two chars. Both chars were mostly mesoporous but the inertinite-rich char had double the average pore size, which also resulted in a larger nitrogen surface area since nitrogen can only access surface areas in larger micropores. The BET surface area was 3.9 and 2.7m2/g (dry basis) for the inertinite- and vitrinite-rich chars respectively. SAXS data showed that the vitrinite-rich char had 60% higher frequencies of pores in the micropore range. Helium porosimetry indicated that the inertinite-rich coal and resultant char had higher densities than the vitrinite coal and char; 1.6 and 2.0 g/cm3, compared to 1.3 and 1.9g/cm3(dry basis). \n\nTo further explore structural influences on reactivity HRTEM analysis of the chars was performed. It allows the direct observation of the distribution of structural features (layer size and stacking) of the chars. A new semi-automated approach for HRTEM image analysis and a new technique for quantifying distributions were developed in Photoshop and Matlab respectively, which enabled the quantitative characterization of the crystalline char structure. Distributions of layer size, interlayer spacing, stacking number, and layer orientation were obtained. By developing this computerized approach for image processing and statistical analysis, it is now possible to analyze more micrographs (larger sample size) in a shorter period of time with less user bias. Therefore, the usefulness of HRTEM to analyze carbonaceous structures is greatly improved.\n\nThe shrinking core and random pore models were fitted to the reactivity data. These mathematical models, used for predicting the effect of process variables on the reaction rates of chars and carbons in various environments, are not able to predict behavior at conditions higher than 550\u2070C. Consequently, there is a need for improved reactivity modeling approaches which would enable the incorporation of the multiple competing structural factors. Current molecular modeling tools and approaches do not allow testing of our understanding of char structure-behavior relationship since most of the above-mentioned structural features cannot be incorporated. Here, a new tool for the construction of molecular models was developed which enables the construction of large scale atomistic representations based on the distribution of structural features such as stacking. This novel approach was able to generate structures which capture some of the structural differences seen in experimental data between the inertinite-rich and vitrinite-rich coal chars. \n\nTo explore reactivity differences between these two char models, a rules-based simulation approach was developed utilizing Material Studio and Matlab. Oxygen atoms were diffused through the char structure, and if an oxygen atom was within a critical distance of an edge carbon atom, it was assumed that they will react and consequently the carbon atom was deleted. These steps were repeated 15 and 18 times for the vitirinite-rich and inertinite-rich char structures, respectively. After these steps, 80% of the initial char structure was \u2018combusted\u2019.  Although a simplified approach, the models correctly captured the relative reactivity differences for ash-free models, where the vitrinite-rich char combusted slightly faster than the inertinite-rich char. Given the similarties in the structure the presence of larger micropores (small mesopores) were likely the cause of the greater reactivity at zone I conditions. Increased automation and further enhancements to this approach would enable us to explore structure-reactivity relationship relationships rapidly while adjusting contributing parameters.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8100], "author_name_tesi": "Louw, Enette ", "last_name_ssi": "Louw", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Enette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan P Mathews", "Jonathan P Mathews", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Semih Eser"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan P Mathews, Dissertation Advisor", "Jonathan P Mathews, Committee Chair", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member", "Semih Eser, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coal", "char", "reactivity", "structure", "molecular modeling", "South Africa"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "GUIDED WAVE STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING FOR LARGE DIAMETER STORAGE TANK FLOORS", "id": "13807rgl5002", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13807", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this research is to develop a structural health monitoring (SHM) technique for inspecting large diameter storage tank floors. Current inspection techniques for storage tank floors require tank shutdown and the tank to be drained of its product and cleaned prior to inspection. Prior to shutting down the tank and conducting an inspection, little information is available about the tank floor condition. In some cases, corrosion or other damage causes leaks in the floor which are not detected until the product is observed on the ground outside the tank. Therefore, there is a great need for developing a real time SHM system that can detect damage while the tank is in service. To achieve this, a tomography based SHM approach that achieves full tank floor coverage was developed. A 37 ft. diameter tank floor mock-up was designed and fabricated. The floor was constructed from 4\u2019 x 8\u2019 x 5/16\u201d steel plates that were lap welded together. The mock-up included a 6\u201d chime plate that was welded near the outside of the floor. Guided wave actuators/receivers were mounted around the outside of the plate in a circular pattern. Excellent penetration power and signal-to-noise ratios were achieved through all of the sensor array paths. Defects were introduced to the mock-up starting with a simulated 6\u201d x 12\u201d corrosion patch. Tomographic images were generated which easily detected the small corrosion patch. Several different features and signal gating options were explored to optimize the detectability of the damage. The defect sizes were increased incrementally to explore the defect sizing capabilities.

In such applications, the reliability of the converter is paramount.  Thus, a method of detecting incipient failures would be of significant value. \nIn this thesis, a method for detecting incipient failures in the CSPPPRI is developed.  This method uses least-squares parameter estimation (LSE) to detect changes in circuit parameter values by analyzing time series data for converter input and output variables collected by a data acquisition system.  The time series data is used in conjunction with circuit models for each of the major sub-circuits of the CSPPPRI to estimate the internal circuit parameter values, which may change due to aging or stress.  As part of the parameter estimation process, a virtualized ac waveform is created by determining the internal switch states.  \nA commercial CSPPPRI was subjected to three test conditions: nominal output capacitance and load, reduced output capacitance (to simulate degradation of circuit components) and nominal load, and nominal output capacitance and increased load (to test for load dependence of the algorithm).  For each test condition, key circuit parameters were estimated.  The estimated parameters indicated changes in the underlying component values, but unfortunately the indicated changes were dependent on the loading of the inverter.  \nAlternative susceptance (originally thought to be reactance) calculations made using the switching frequency were added to identify whether changes of estimated circuit parameters were due to seeded faults (reduced output capacitance) or loading effects (increased load).  Changes due to loads affect the calculated susceptances equally, while changes due to circuit parameter variation would not.  Thus the divergence of the susceptance values can be used to determine whether a change in estimated circuit parameter was to the result of a fault or loading.

In this dissertation, a piezoelectric actuation concept is presented that uses a new feed-screw motion accumulation technique. The feed-screw concept involves accumulating high frequency actuation strokes of a piezoelectric stack (driving element) by intermittently rotating nuts on an output feed-screw. Compared to existing piezoelectric actuator technology, significant features of the feed-screw concept include reversible and robust actuation capability, simple power electronics, and a rigid power-off self-locking state.\n\nA prototype feed-screw actuator (developed for a morphing aircraft structure project) demonstrated a 1235 lb blocked force, 29 W peak power output, and 6.1 W/kg specific power. To improve upon the prototype actuator\u2019s 6.1 W/kg specific power, a mathematical model was developed as a design optimization tool. The model is significant because it accounts for nonlinear, nut-screw contact stiffness, and both pre-sliding stiffness and rate-dependent friction behavior. Design optimization results indicate that the feed-screw actuator could potentially achieve a 195 W/kg specific power\u2014a level that is more than double that of a similar size electromagnetic actuator (100% duty cycle).\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3241], "author_name_tesi": "Loverich, Jacob Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Loverich", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Jacob", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Hugo Koopmann", "George A Lesieutre", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Hugo Koopmann, Committee Chair", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Chair", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["piezoelectric", "actuator", "active material", "feed screw", "motion accumulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Organizational Features and Student Experiences on Spiritual Development during the First Year of College", "id": "10275", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1767", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of organizational features and\nstudent experiences on spiritual development among first-year students attending fouryear\ninstitutions in the United States.

We utilized this differentiation process to study the roles of exogenous factors acting through multiple signaling pathways with the overall goal of understanding how photoreceptors develop from multipotential anterior neural tissue and to improve the generation of cells suitable for photoreceptor replacement.\nESCs can reproducibly generate several cell types, including retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). However, the subsequent derivation of photoreceptor precursors is variable and relatively inefficient. We compared the effects of exogenous signaling factors and physical culture conditions on the derivation of retinal cells from ESCs and propose a relatively simple protocol that is optimized for guiding ESCs through stages that correspond to the sequence of in vivo retinal development and also optimized for studying the sequence of steps spanning the time between eye field formation and photoreceptor precursor generation in the embryonic retina. \nWe demonstrated the usefulness of this ESC-retinal induction protocol in screening for factors that improve photoreceptor precursor yield by evaluating responses to Activin signaling. Application of Activin A during a time that corresponds to early embryonic retinogenesis increased generation of CRX+ photoreceptor precursors and decreased PAX6+ RPCs. Following treatment, Activin signaling through SMAD2/3 in RPCs regulated expression of transcription factors involved in cell type determination to promote photoreceptor lineage specification.\nFurthermore, we tested the ability of ESCs to model developmental stages before and after the transition of RPCs into photoreceptor precursors. ESC-retinal induction appeared to mimic in vivo effects of altering factors implicated in development at these stages. Specifically, Ikaros might govern the determination of retinal cell types by acting as a switch between early versus late RPC subpopulations, which have different propensities for generating lineage-specific daughter cells. Preliminary studies also suggested that terminal differentiation of ESC-derived photoreceptor precursors is affected by alterations in STAT3 and PDK1 signaling.\nOur findings demonstrate that ESC differentiation follows the temporal sequence of in vivo retinal development and this progression can be manipulated with exogenous factors. By optimizing the activities of signal pathways during this process, post-mitotic photoreceptors precursors can be efficiently generated. Further investigation into post-transplant outcomes of ESC-derived photoreceptor precursors will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of these precursors in rescuing visual function and lead to optimization of the transplant protocol and post-transplant environmental requirements. Thus, ESC-retinal differentiation can be used both as a way to screen to factors that improve target cell yield and as source of starting material for optimizing transplant outcomes after cell replacement.

This thesis covers the design and analysis of these devices in both the microwave and optical frequency regions. \n\n  First, we will present a compact methodology for the design of periodic leaky wave antennas. These antennas enable spoof plasmon type surface waves to radiate at microwave frequencies. This approach is based on structurally modifying a corrugated reactance surface. In particular, a properly engineered periodic perturbation is introduced to enable the excitation of the n = -1 spatial Floquet mode. This mode is characterized by a complex wavenumber, the real part of which is less than that of free space. As a result, the guided spoof plasmons are efficiently coupled to the radiating modes. Numerical simulation software (HFSS) has been used to validate the proposed design methodology.\n\n  Second, we will present closed form expressions for the radiated fields, directivity and gain for a single nanoloop antenna. In the terahertz, infrared and optical regimes nanoloops show great promise for a variety of applications, such as solar cells and optical sensors. However, due to the complex behavior of metals at these frequencies, prior studies had not yet completed a theoretical derivation for the radiation parameters of a nanoloop. We propose a solution based on the extension of the formulation for a thin-wire Perfect-Electric Conductor (PEC) loop to include the effects of loss and dispersion. These proposed expressions contain integrals of Bessel and Lommel-Weber functions as well as Q-type integrals. Various series representations for these integrals will be presented along with guidelines for solving them. We will validate these equations through the comparison of results from full-wave solvers. These simulations typically require hours of processing time, whereas our analytical expressions can be evaluated within seconds.\n\n  Finally, we will present an extended study on the derivation of coupling between nanoloops. Due to their properties of highly directive transmission and reception, nanoloop arrays have many practical applications, such as energy harvesting. Specific equations involving numerical integrals are proposed in Chapter 4. More importantly, far-zone approximations are employed to generate simplified closed form analytical solutions. The induced current on a passive loop has been derived for the general case, where the passive loop can be located anywhere with respect to the active loop. The induced current equations have also been derived for two special cases, where the passive loop is coplanar to the active loop and where the passive loop is stacked above the active loop. Both the numerical and closed form analytical results were verified with FEKO (a full-wave Method of Moments solver). A significant reduction in computing time was observed.

The thesis work presented here is aimed at understanding the fundamentals of molecular depth profiling and improving the performance of ToF-SIMS with C60+ projectiles on 3-dimensional (3-D) characterization of organic and biological materials.  Ionization effects in depth profiling of trehalose films are investigated to elucidate the influence of water and salt contents on the formation of molecular ions under C60+ bombardment.  An Irganox standard obtained from NPL with delta layers is used to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of depth profiling through organic samples.  A new delta layer system constructed with lipids and fatty acids is formed via the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique.  This sample is used to optimize depth profiling parameters, such as, sample temperature, primary ion beam energy and incident angles, as well as, determine the depth resolution of biological molecules.  The results indicate that the depth resolution is predominately influenced by ion beam induced mixing at the organic-organic interfaces and not an artifact of topography.  Overall, the optimal experimental parameters for biological depth profiling and 3-D imaging are at cryogenic temperature with a low kinetic energy C60+ beam at a glancing angle.  A different experimental strategy is tested on a ~400 nm LB multilayer thin film using both Au+ and C60+ beams.  Bombardment by Au+ projectiles results in significant damage and extremely low sputter efficiency on the LB film.

Members of PRAME gene family encode leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins that provide a versatile structural framework for the formation of protein-protein interactions. The function of PRAME during testicular development and spermatogenesis remains unknown, although PRAME has been extensively studied in cancer biology and is believed to play a regulatory role in cancer cells. To explore the function of the PRAME gene in spermatogenesis, the subcellular localization of the PRAME and PRAMEL1 protein in mouse spermatogenic cells was characterized by immunoelectron microscopy. The results revealed that both PRAME and PRAMEL1 localized in various organelles in spermatogenic cells during spermatogenesis, including the nucleus, flagellum, intermitochondrial cement (IMC), and chromatoid body (CB). Apart from that, the PRAME protein was also detected in mitochondria while PRAMEL1 was observed in manchette. To further explore the function of the PRAME gene during spermatogenesis, we applied a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model with PRAME gene mutated 3 days after birth.  Compared with control mice, the cKO mice have smaller testes and less epididymis sperm at 4-month old (4M). When examining the first wave of spermatogenesis, a degradation of seminiferous tubules (with a dramatically reduce of germ cells) was detected in the testes of cKO mice at postnatal day (P) 21 and P35, although degradation of seminiferous tubules was hardly detected in P14 and P7 testes. Apoptosis was also increased in cKO mice at P7, P14 and P21. Ultrastructure analysis detected heterogeneous chromatin condensing with small and large vacuoles in the elongated spermatids of cKO mice, which was not observed in the control mice. Despite the observed disruptions in seminiferous tubules and spermatogenic cells, the cKO mice exhibited normal fertility as indicated by the pregnancy rate and litter size in mating tests. The results indicate that PRAME is involved in spermatogenesis, and the knockout of PRAME gene 3 days after birth in the mouse could lead to certain testis abnormality without a significant impact on male fertility. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15679], "author_name_tesi": "Lu, Chen ", "last_name_ssi": "Lu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wansheng Liuf", "Francisco Javier Diaz", "Troy Ott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wansheng Liuf, Thesis Advisor", "Francisco Javier Diaz, Committee Member", "Troy Ott, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PRAME/PRAMEL1", "immunoelectron microscopy", "conditional knockout mice model", "spermatogenesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Palladium-catalyzed Halogenation Of Ortho-c-h Bonds Of Benzylamine Picolinamides And Arylethylamine Picolinamides", "id": "21598", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10020", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new Pd-catalyzed picolinamide-directed halogenation reaction of ortho-C(sp2)-H bonds is discussed.

Numerous studies have revealed many important genes for different aspects of plant development. Most of these genes encode regulatory proteins, which are involved in various biological processes including gene transcription and signal transduction. The mutations of many of these genes cause defects in morphological or physiological phenotypes. However, the molecular functions of many of them remain poorly understood. Arabidopsis thaliana has been used as the model organism in my projects to investigate the regulatory mechanisms controlling flower and anther development at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. \nA number of transcription factor genes have been characterized to be essential for male fertility by regulating anther development at various stages. The DYSFUNCTIONAL TAPETUM 1 (DYT1) and MYB35 genes were reported to regulate the tapetum function and pollen development based on genetic and morphological evidence. The molecular regulatory functions of DYT1 and MYB35 proteins were investigated in one of my research projects and the results suggested that they probably function as transcriptional activators. Transient induction of DYT1 activated the MYB35 transcription rapidly, suggesting that MYB35 may be immediately downstream of DYT1. The DNA binding specificity of the DYT1 protein was investigated using gel-shift assays, and the results revealed that DYT1 binds to a specialized G-box motif TCACGTGA. Combined with the transcriptomic information of dyt1 mutant anthers from our lab, this study consolidated the function of DYT1 in controlling a large number of anther genes, which may explain its importance in tapetum and pollen development. \nThe ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is involved in almost every biological process. Arabidopsis E3 ubiquitin ligases have been demonstrated to regulate various plant physiological and developmental processes. The ARABIDOPSIS SKP1-LIKE 1 (ASK1) gene, which encodes a key subunit of Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF)-type E3 ubiquitin ligases, has been shown to be involved in plant development and reproduction, especially in flower development and meiosis. Despite many lines of genetic evidence, the role of ASK1 in regulating the proteome and transcriptome is still not clear. In my second project, the flower bud proteomes and transcriptomes were compared between an ask1 mutant and wild-type to identify proteins that are putative substrates of the ASK1-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases (ASK1-E3s). Proteins that accumulate to higher levels in the flower bud proteome of the ask1 mutant than that of wild-type, and whose cognate RNA levels are not significantly different between the two genotypes, may be regulated by ASK1-E3s at the post-translational level. The putative substrates include transcription regulators, kinases, peptidases, and interestingly ribosomal proteins, suggesting that regulatory proteins are more likely to be regulated by the UPS and that the ribosomal proteins, which are usually believed to be only involved in protein synthesis, may also be regulated by selective proteolysis mechanisms. Another project investigated the impact of ask1 mutation on the anther transcriptome, and the results suggested that ASK1-E3s may regulate the destabilization of transcription factors to modulate the expression of genes involved in multiple signaling pathways. Therefore, the regulations at the transcriptional and post-translational levels may be coordinated by the ubiquitin system. \nThese studies not only provided large-scale proteomics and transcriptomics information for further investigations, but also revealed specific functions of certain transcription factors that regulate anther development. Further studies may lead to discoveries of novel functions of the regulatory proteins and the overall properties of the regulatory networks underlying flower development. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8393], "author_name_tesi": "Lu, Dihong ", "last_name_ssi": "Lu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dihong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Ma", "Teh Hui Kao", "Surinder Chopra", "Timothy W Mcnellis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Ma, Dissertation Advisor", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Arabidopsis thaliana", "flower", "anther", "meiosis", "transcription factor", "E3 ubiquitin ligase", "SKP1", "proteomics", "transcriptomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Heavy Traffic Limits for Fork-Join Networks with Synchronization Constraints", "id": "27133", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12051", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fork-join networks are a class of queueing networks, where each arriving job forks into multiple parallel tasks, to be served sequentially and simultaneously in separate service stations and then joined for further processing under some synchronization constraints. Such networks have broad applications in manufacturing and telecommunications, patient flow analysis in healthcare, parallel computing, MapReduce scheduling, military deployment operations and law enforcement systems.\n\nIn the dissertation, we analyze the performance of fork-join networks with a single class of jobs under non-exchangeable synchronizations (NES). NES requires that parallel tasks are only synchronized if all the tasks associated with the same job are completed. We first study a fork-join network of stations with infinite servers and NES in heavy traffic. Jobs are forked into a fixed number of parallel tasks upon arrival and processed at the corresponding parallel service stations. Service times of parallel tasks of each job can be correlated. We consider the number of tasks in each waiting buffer for synchronization, jointly with the number of tasks in each parallel service station and the number of synchronized jobs. We develop a new approach to show a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) for these processes, under general assumptions on the arrival and service processes. Specifically, we represent these processes as functionals of a sequential empirical process driven by the sequence of service vectors for each job\u2019s parallel tasks. All the limiting processes are functionals of two independent processes - the limiting arrival process and a generalized Kiefer process driven by the service vector of each job. We characterize the transient and stationary distributions of the limiting processes.\n\nIn the second work, we consider fork-join networks with NES in a renewal random environment. The system is operating in a renewal random environment with alternating up and down periods. In each up period, the system operates normally as our first model, but in each down period, jobs continue to enter the system, while all the servers will stop working, and services received will be conserved and resume at the beginning of the next up period. Service times of the parallel tasks of each job can be correlated, having a general continuous joint distribution function, and moreover, the service vectors of consecutive jobs form a stationary and weakly dependent sequence satisfying the phi-mixing condition. We study the impact of these down times upon the service dynamics, the unsynchronized queueing dynamics and the synchronized process, assuming that the down times are asymptotically negligible. We prove a functional weak law of large numbers (FWLLNs) and an FCLT for these processes, where the limit processes in the FCLT possess a stochastic decomposition property and the convergence requires the Skorohod M1 topology.\n\nIn the third work, we study a fork-join network with NES, where each service station has finite statistically identical parallel servers. Service times of the parallel tasks of each job can be correlated and form a sequence of i.i.d. random vectors with a general continuous joint distribution function. We consider the system in the Halfin-Whitt (Quality-and-Efficiency- Driven, QED) regime, in which the arrival rate of jobs and the number of servers in each station get large appropriately so that all service stations become critically loaded asymp- totically. We study the joint dynamics of the queueing and service processes at all stations and the associated unsynchronized queueing processes. We show FWLLNs and FCLT for these processes.

This group of polymers has diverse applications ranging from commercial packaging to battery electrolytes. The dielectric constant of the polymer distinguishes purely structural ionomeric materials from those that are used to transport ions. In this dissertation, we apply physical modeling to describe self-assembly and ion transport in ionomeric systems. The physical modeling is supported by atomistically-informed, coarse-grained simulations that expand the useful time and length scales accessible through molecular simulations, at the cost of short-time details. The statistical description of ion aggregate populations and ion/charge transport in this dissertation complement the earlier atomistic and bead-spring simulations that provide more localized details of ion aggregate conformations and PEO-driven transport mechanisms.\nThe majority of the dissertation focuses on self-assembly and ion transport the ionomeric electrolyte, sodium-neutralized poly(PEO-co-sulfoisophthalate). Despite the PEO backbone, which is a stronger dielectric than polyethylene or polystyrene, the ions are still aggregated in this material. The packing constraints associated with the PEO backbone drives ion aggregates to be stringlike in morphology. We find that a worm-like micelle equilibrium well describes the size-distribution of ion aggregates in simulations of the ionomer. The ion strings are composed of ions alternating in charge, and can be viewed as a series of dipoles in which the end groups have energetic costs relative to the center because of uncompensated dipoles. On occasion, free ions will coordinate to the sides of stringlike chains, creating excess charge. These charges are more likely to be positive, and result in ion aggregates becoming progressively more positive with size. We find that excess charges are participating in an ion-aggregate mediated transport mechanism through consecutive coordination with ion pairs and higher order clusters. This mechanism is highly efficient and allows positive charged to be \u201crelayed\u201d through a series of ion aggregate nodes faster than any individual cation. The extent to which charge transport is expedited relative to cation transport is quantified through the recovery of the f factor, a metric of collective motion, at longer timescales.\nIn studies of partially sulfonated PEO ionomers, we found isophthalate groups are highly ordered. The isophthalate groups in the unsulfonated ionomer self-assemble in the absence of any ionic groups. In partially sulfonated PEO ionomers, sulfonated and unsulfonated isophthalate groups also attract each other. Electrostatic and hydrophobic forces drive ions and isophthalate groups, respectively, to self-assemble in partially-neutralized systems. We modeled aggregates of ions and of isophthalate groups (sulfonated and unsulfonated) with a two-component wormlike micelle model. In two- component systems, the species with the more costly endcap is concentrated in larger aggregates, reducing the fraction of their population acting as endcaps. This results in aggregate compositions that are size dependent when the endcap energies of the two species are not equal. Evaluating trends of the endcap energies from both types of aggregates in tandem reveals why ion aggregates become increasingly positive in charge with increasing mass.\nThe wormlike micelle description of ion aggregates breaks down at sufficiently low background dielectric constants. In systems in which the dielectric constant of the backbone PEO is artificially lowered, we find that ion aggregates undergo a transformation from stringlike to sheetlike morphologies. The large, sheetlike aggregates in our low dielectric constant systems further self-assemble into ordered, lamellar structures because of depletion attraction generated by the smaller aggregates. Even though our simulation is in a cubic box of edge length 30 nm, the self-assembled lamellar structures still span more than half the box size, suggesting even larger simulations may be needed. We believe depletion forces will eventually produce spherical structures composed of lamellar sheets, which could reconcile the large, spherical ion structures observed in electron microscopy with the chain-packing costs associated with such large structures, if the ions were randomly packed.\nIn summary, we have found that electrostatic, hydrophobic, and depletion attractions could all potentially play an important role in the self-assembly of ionomeric systems.

Central to the lung cancer diagnosis and staging process is the assessment of the central chest lymph nodes. This assessment typically requires two major stages: (1) location of the lymph nodes in a three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution volumetric multi-detector computed-tomography (MDCT) chest image; (2) subsequent nodal sampling using trans-\nbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA).\n\nLymph-node segmentation is a preliminary but vital step for lymph-node-related process. However, segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs), such as lymph nodes and suspect cancer nodules, is often di\u00b1cult because of the complexity of the phenomena that give rise to them. Manual slice tracing has been used widely for years for such problems, because it is easy to implement and guaranteed to work. But manual slice tracing is extremely time consuming, subject to operator biases, and does not enable reproducible results. Numerous automated 3D image-segmentation methods have also been developed. But automatic segmentation is generally strongly application dependent, and even the most robust methods have di\u00b1culty in de\u00afning complex anatomical ROIs. To address these issues, asemi-automatic interactive paradigm, referred to as \"live wire,\" has been proposed by researchers. In live-wire segmentation, the human operator interactively defines an ROI's boundary, guided by an active automated method. 2D and 3D live-wire methods, which improve upon previously proposed techniques, are discussed in this dissertation. The 2D method incorporates an improved cost function to increase robustness and a search region to improve computational efficiency. For the new 3D method, the operator need only consider a few 2D image sections to begin with and then an automated procedure defines the remainder of a 3D ROI's boundary. Furthermore, a computer-based tool incorporating the methods has been built for 3D MDCT-based planning and follow-on live guidance of bronchoscopy. The experimental results and the clinical applications clearly show the robustness\nand efficiency of the proposed live-wire methods.\n\nTo facilitate further lymph-node-related MDCT image analysis, surgery planning, and lymph-node sampling, two paradigms have been established: (1) the Mountain system gives the nominal anatomical locations of pulmonary lymph nodes; and (2)Wang's bronchoscopy-based map of possible biopsy sites. Both the Mountains and Wang systems were well established internationally for use in mediastinal lymph-node staging and play critical roles in the clinical studies of pulmonary disease. However, little work has been done on CT-based lymph-node analysis and in relating to these two systems. In this dissertation, acomputer-based system is presented for automatic definition of lymph-node stations, nodal station visualization and interaction, and lymph-node detection, classification, and segmentation. This system connects anatomical definitions of the lymph-node stations, based on the Mountain and Wang systems, with MDCT chest data. The defined nodal stations can then be used to guide the user into the 3D locations where lymph nodes are expected to be\nfound. Supplemented with the robust live-wire-based semi-automatic segmentation tools\nand other utilities, this computer-based system would conceivably speed up lymph-node detection, segmentation, and classification by avoiding unnecessary 2D-slice navigation and enabling the user to concentrate on specific stations. In addition, prior to this dissertation a link between the Mountain and Wang systems has never been formulated. Such a link can strengthen the utility of both systems. The anatomy-based Mountain system is better for CT-only study, while the airway-based Wang system is better for bronchoscopy. By linking these two systems, one can exploit their strengths better and also more fully use the available CT and bronchoscopic video data during live TBNA. Results derived from a set\nof human 3D MDCT chest images illustrate the usage and efficacy of the proposed system, and show its potential to decrease the examination time of a patient's MDCT scan and facilitate treatment planning.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3576], "author_name_tesi": "Lu, Kongkuo ", "last_name_ssi": "Lu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kongkuo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Evan Higgins", "William Evan Higgins", "James Gordon Brasseur", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano", "Shizhuo Yin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Evan Higgins, Dissertation Advisor", "William Evan Higgins, Committee Chair", "James Gordon Brasseur, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano, Committee Member", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pulmonary Medicine", "Lung Cancer", "Medical Imaging", "Semi-automatic Segmentation", "Live Wire", "Image Segmentation", "CT", "MDCT", "Lymph Nodes", "Computer-Aided Diagnosis/Detection", "Chest Imaging."]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF HIGHLY SENSITIVE MAGNETOELECTRIC SENSORS FOR BIO-MAGNETIC SIGNAL DETECTION", "id": "14381mul253", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14381", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Magnetic sensors of high sensitivity, compact size, and low cost are of great interest for biomedical applications. Magnetoelectric (ME) composites enable the use of piezoelectric materials, through magnetoelectric coupling between constituents, for magnetic sensing applications.  The goal of this dissertation is to explore novel approaches which have potential to enhance the sensitivity of magnetoelectric composite sensors and their biomedical applications. \n\nME composite sensors based on tensile piezoelectric effects have been extensively investigated in the past. Substantial research efforts in the past decade have resulted in composite materials with a strong ME response. On the other hand, shear piezoelectric effect is in fact is the highest among the known piezoelectric effects. In this thesis, I investigate an ME composite sensor with enhanced sensitivity using shear mode effect. Moreover, I investigate further enhancing the sensitivity by operating at resonance. Here, we develop an ME laminate heterostructure consisting of magnetostrictive Tb0.3Dy0.7Fe1.92 (Terfenol-D) alloy and piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) layers, both operated in shear mode. We show that the shear mode ME sensor exhibits a markedly improved ME effect compared with traditional ME composites operated in longitudinal and transverse piezoelectric and magnetostrictive modes using the same materials. A strong ME coefficient of 7.93 V/(cm Oe) is obtained under a dc magnetic bias of 2300 Oe. We also show that a single-crystal lithium niobate/Metglas thickness shear-mode ME sensor demonstrates the simulation results of a sensitivity of 177,620 V/Oe\u2219cm and peak signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 4.49\u00d71012 \u221aHz/Oe for the 1MHz resonance frequency sample.\n\nIron plays a vital role in the human body; however, absorbing and storing too much iron in the body organs can cause damage to or even destroy an organ [1][2][3][4][5]. Clinically, liver biopsy is used to assess liver ion concentration (LIC), though this process is invasive, has risks, and cannot be used repeatedly. Non-invasive methods have been developed. BLS is effective in quantifying LIC at levels from normal (0.05 LIC < 0.5 mg Fe/gliver) to overload [6][7][8][9][10][11]. However, BLS requires to detect weak biomagnetic signal in the presence of a strong dc magnetic field that can currently only be achieved by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The high cost (> $ 1 million) and complicated operation and maintenance of SQUIDs have restricted general clinical adoption of the SQUID BLS technology. BLS detects weak biomagnetic signals in the presence of a dc magnetic field more than six orders of magnitude stronger. \n\nIn this thesis, I explore the unique capabilities of high-sensitivity ME sensors and investigate the application of ME sensors for iron level detection in human tissues. The compact size and room-temperature operation of ME sensors allow the development of a magnetic sensor array for biomagnetic liver susceptometry (BLS) for iron profiling. For ME sensors, by properly designing the magnetostrictive and piezoelectric composite layer structure and thickness ratio, a very high sensitivity for detecting ac biomagnetic signals (~ 1 nT) could be achieved in the presence of a strong dc magnetic field (~ 0.1 Tesla). We design and fabricate ME sensor systems in first-order gradiometer configurations in order to significantly reduce environmental magnetic noise so that the minute biomagnetic signals can be detected and demonstrate their high sensitivity and high signal to noise ratio (SNR) performance. The results successfully show the output signals from 0.05 mg Fe/g liver phantom (normal liver iron concentration (LIC) level) to 5 mg Fe/g liver phantom (100X overdose) to be linearly responsive to liver iron concentrations. \n\nFor the next step, we develop a prototype for a multi-ME sensor array BLS system. The introduction of the dual-sensor self-calibrating technique shows the potential of the automatic cancellation of the background signal and the signal of overlying tissue, enabling a higher sensitivity and providing the capability of adaptive auto-calibration to significantly improve the accuracy of LIC and reduce data scan time. With these improvements, it is possible to get improved signal distribution mapping potential and characterization flexibility via signal processing from the multiple sensors in the system. Our ME-sensor BLS will achieve sensitivity close to that of the SQUID-based BLS with only a fraction of its cost. Thus, our research could broadly impact the clinical practice in iron overload treatment and significantly reduce the cost of care of those patients.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14683], "author_name_tesi": "Lu, Meng Chien", "last_name_ssi": "Lu", "middle_name_ssi": "Chien", "first_name_ssi": "Meng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Magneto electric", "Piezoelectric", "Magnetostrictive", "Magnetic sensor", "Biomagnetic liver susceptometry", "liver iron concentration", "Shear mode effect", "ME laminate composite", "ME sensor"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Microfluidics Meets Nanomaterials Synthesis", "id": "21747", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9793", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nanomaterials and their applications have attracted great research interest in recent years. As the sizes of materials decrease to sub-micrometers, the intrinsic properties of the nanomaterials become different from those of bulk materials. Since the intrinsic properties of nanomaterials are strongly influenced by the elemental composition, size and shape, it is of great importance to synthesize nanomaterials with controlled reaction conditions (e.g., pressure, temperature, reagent ratio) to achieve high uniformity and reproducibility of the synthesized nanomaterials. \nIt is difficult to achieve homogeneous chemical environment during the conventional chemical synthesis process, where the reagents are mixed at millimeter- or centimeter-scale. Microfluidic reactors, which confine the reaction volume to nanoliter or even picoliter size, have attracted a lot of research interests due to their potential in high-quality nanomaterials synthesis. However, broad distributions of the size and composition of the synthesized nanomaterials still exist within simple microfluidic reactors. \nIn this dissertation, the hypothesis is that diffusion-limit reactions occur within microfluidic reactors, and by improving the mixing efficiency within microfluidic reactors, the quality (e.g., uniformity and performance) of the synthesized nanomaterials can be improved significantly. Furthermore, by controlling the mixing process precisely, the properties (e.g., shape and size) of the synthesized nanomaterials can be finely tuned. To prove this hypothesis, I used microfluidic reactors with designs to improve mixing performance to synthesize polymer-DNA nanocomplexes (polyplexes) and organic-metal hybrid nanomaterials. One design is the acoustic-assisted bubble based microfluidic reactor, which can enhance the mixing performance by random advection within the whole microfluidic channel. The other design used here is the acoustic-assisted three-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing reactor, which can enhance mixing by reducing the diffusion distance. Both of the designs can synthesize polyplexes with improved uniformity and biological performance compared to bulk mixing samples. Moreover, the three-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing method also shows ability to control over the local chemical ratio within the reaction zone. This property is demonstrated by the shape tunable synthesis of organic-metal hybrid nanomaterials. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9540], "author_name_tesi": "Lu, Mengqian ", "last_name_ssi": "Lu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mengqian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Huang", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia", "Jian Xu", "Iam Choon Khoo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member", "Iam Choon Khoo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanomaterials synthesis", "microfluidic reactor", "DNA-polymer nanocomplexes (polyplexes)"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "An Application of Cross-docking Theory to Solve the \u201clast-mile Logistics\u201d Problem at the Pennsylvania State University\u2019s Food Delivery Department", "id": "22612", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9858", "abstract_tesi": "The Pennsylvania State University is one of the largest universities in the United States, with huge demands of food to serve the students from all its 24 campuses. As the orders for food are large, the school uses a bulk buying strategy to purchase from the producers, whose prices are 20% to 40% lower than the wholesalers\u2019. The most frequently consumed products are the meat products and the fresh produce (vegetables and fruits). Because the meat products can be frozen to extend their shelf life, the school consolidates orders from all its campuses, and stores the products in the central warehouse located on the University Park (UP) campus. The school\u2019s delivery team then redistributes the products to 15dining halls and stores on the UP campus as well as all the dining halls on 11 other campuses (the other 12 campuses purchase independently). To save on transportation costs, deliveries are as infrequent as once every two weeks to some campuses. On the other hand, because of the short shelf life of vegetables and fruits, dining halls on campuses outside the UP campus buy from local wholesalers, although the prices are higher. Also, to save time, the suppliers deliver to the dining halls directly (instead of to the warehouse). The transportation costs are high for them because transporting to crowded campuses is very time consuming. This is known as the \u201clast-mile logistics\u201d problem. The handling costs are also high, since the truck from each supplier needs to be unloaded at each dining hall (compare to unloading once at the warehouse).\nA cross-docking strategy can be helpful to reduce the costs and by reducing the fuel consumption, it is also helpful to keep the air cleaner. It requires the incoming products being loaded to the outbound trucks directly, to save delivery time and to increase the delivery frequency. By applying this strategy, the school can deliver more frequently to the campuses other than the UP campus to satisfy their demands, consolidating orders to cut out the wholesalers and lowering the purchasing costs. What\u2019s more, the school\u2019s own delivery team can perform the \u201clast-mile logistics\u201d instead of the suppliers, with smaller trucks to save delivery time and costs. There are several ways to apply a cross-docking strategy. Other than the current strategy, three possible alternatives are considered, including pre-allocate cross-docking strategy, post-allocate cross-docking strategy and hybrid cross-docking strategy. The aim of this research is to compare the total costs under different strategies, and find the one with the lowest cost. A cost comparison model is built in this research that includes three parts: 1) purchasing cost, 2) delivery cost and 3) inventory carrying cost. To optimize the delivery routes with the shortest traveling distances, a vehicle routing problem model is built for the alternative strategies, and the problem is solved by the software LINGO.  \n By calculating total cost from each strategy, the results show that a hybrid cross-docking strategy is the most suitable strategy, which can save approximately $50,000 annually from the current strategy.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9593], "author_name_tesi": "Lu, Miao ", "last_name_ssi": "Lu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Miao", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Ventura"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Ventura, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cross-docking", "Last-mile-logistics", "Food delivery"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Low-Density Parity-Check Codes: Asymptotic Behavior and Zeta Functions", "id": "10088", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4512", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A LDPC code is binary linear code equipped with a sparse parity-check matrix.

Due to the their quasi-one-dimensional nature and high aspect ratio, semiconducting nanowires exhibit distinct phonon and electrical properties compared to the bulk. This thesis collects three original studies focusing on both computational and experimental results of light scattering from semiconducting nanowires.\n\nThe first study focuses on Raman scattering results on Si1-xGex nanowires (0<x<1) grown by the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth mechanism using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the morphology growth axis and lattice constant of these materials. Typical wire diameters were in the range 80-130 nm. Based on Raman scattering studies of the bulk, three Raman bands are expected that can be identified as a perturbed Si-Si (~500 cm-1) mode, a Ge-Ge (~280 cm-1) mode and a new mode (~390 cm-1) assigned to Si-Ge or Ge-Si clusters. Peaks in this region are also observed in the case of our nanowires, although the frequencies are a few cm-1 lower than observed in the bulk. We also observe that the compositional (x) dependence of the Si-Ge band in nanowires is somewhat different than that in the bulk.\n\nThe second research project studies the Rayleigh and Raman scattering from GaP semiconducting nanowires with different polarized incident excitations. GaP nanowires were grown using pulsed laser vaporization (PLV). The diameters of the nanowires range from 50 nm to 500 nm. Rayleigh and Raman spectra were obtained from single GaP nanowires suspended over TEM grid holes. Experiments show that the plots of the scattering intensity vs. the polarization of the incident laser depend on the diameters of the nanowires. Mie theory, the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) and the finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods were used to explain this dependence.\n\nThe third study focuses on the internal electric field\u2019s dependence on the position of the laser spot relative to the nanowire. About 60% of the Raman scattering spectra from the tips of GaP nanowires were greater than the scattering intensities from the center of the same nanowire. This enhancement factor (ratio of the TO mode intensity at a tip to the TO mode intensity at the center) is around 3~5 for GaP nanowires measured on Si substrates and about 1~2 for GaP nanowires suspended over TEM grid holes. The effect of polarization and energy of the incident excitation on the enhancement factor was studied experimentally with GaP nanowires over TEM grid holes. Further, the FDTD method was applied to compute the theoretical enhancement factor. We carried out a statistical exploration to understand the deviation of the enhancement factor from its computed value.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5043], "author_name_tesi": "Lu, Qiujie ", "last_name_ssi": "Lu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qiujie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth", "Nitin Samarth", "Gerald Dennis Mahan", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "John V Badding", "Jayanth R Banavar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth, Dissertation Advisor", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Chair", "Gerald Dennis Mahan, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Jayanth R Banavar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Raman", "Rayleigh", "Antenna Effect", "Hot Tip Effect", "FDTD simulation", "Semiconducting Nanowire"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "IMAGE ANALYSIS AND METADATA EXTRACTION FOR DOCUMENT SEARCH\n", "id": "9219", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6677", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis work is mainly focused on two problems related to document search.

Current digital libraries do not provide users tools to retrieve documents based on the information available within the images. This thesis proposes an integrated document retrieval schema utilizing both text and image information. As the initial step in enabling integrated document search, images are categorized into a set of pre-defined types. Several categories of images have been defined based on their functionalities in scholarly articles. A machine-learning-based approach has been proposed to categorize images using both global features and part features extracted from content of images. After categorization of images, algorithms have been designed to analyze two common types of images in documents: 2-D plots and diagrams. A thin line analysis based algorithm has been designed for extracting numerical data from 2-D plot images. An integrated algorithm has been designed for symbol recognition in diagrams. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a test bed document set collected from the CiteSeer scientific literature digital library and other sources. Experimental evaluation has demonstrated that our algorithms can produce acceptable results for real world use.\n Large scale digitization projects have been conducted at digital libraries to preserve cultural artifacts and to provide permanent access.

In this dissertation, investigations of visual characteristics that evoke human emotion and aesthetic feelings are presented. First, shape features were studied in natural images in terms of how they influence emotions aroused in human beings. Shapes and their characteristics-such as roundness, angularity, simplicity, and complexity-have been found to evoke emotions in human perceivers, with evidence from psychological studies of facial expressions, dancing poses, and even simple synthetic visual patterns. Capturing these characteristics algorithmically to incorporate in computational studies, however, has proven difficult. Moreover, little prior research has modeled the dimensionality of emotions aroused by roundness and angularity. In this study, a collection of shape features was developed, which encoded the visual characteristics of roundness, angularity, and complexity using edge, corner, and contour distributions. Evaluation of those features were performed on the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) dataset, where evidence was provided regarding the significance of roundness-angularity and simplicity-complexity on predicting emotional content in images. Second, an investigation into three visual characteristics, i.e., roundness, angularity, and simplicity, of complex scenes that evoke human emotion was performed. Built upon the high-dimensional shape features, novel computational methods were developed to map visual content to the scales of roundness, angularity, and simplicity as three new constructs. The scope of the previous psychological hypothesis was, therefore, expanded by examining these three visual characteristics in computer analysis of complex scenes. The results produced by the three new constructs were compared to the hundreds of visual qualities examined by previous studies. The three constructs were completely interpretable and could be used in other applications involving roundness, angularity, and simplicity of visual scenes. Meanwhile, a large collection of ecologically valid stimuli (i.e., photographs humans regularly encounter on the Web), containing more than 40K images crawled from web albums, was generated using crowdsourcing and was subjected to human subject emotion ratings. Critically, these three new visual constructs achieved classification accuracy comparable to the hundreds of shape, texture, composition, and facial feature characteristics previously examined. This reduces the number of features required for classification by about two orders of magnitude. In addition, our experimental results showed that the three constructs showed consistent capacity in classifying both dimensions of emotions. Finally, a novel deep learning algorithm was developed to automatically learn effective visual characteristics for image aesthetics assessment.

Each bracket fit within 75mm L x 66 mm W x 36mm H envelope. Geometric measurements taken from these parts revealed local size errors ranging from 0.01 mm to 0.15 mm, form errors ranging from 0.02 mm to 0.09 mm, and datum related profile errors ranging from 0.14 mm to 0.48 mm.  All of these measurements were taken from surfaces that were not inclined toward the build plate.  For surfaces that were, form errors ranged from 0.11 mm to 0.32 mm, and datum related profile errors ranged from 0.28 mm to 0.94 mm.\nThis geometric variation is undoubtedly due to the interaction of the many components of the error budget of this process. These components include the starting digital model, the Z-axis table movement, the laser system, powder bed recoater as well as the physics in play during the melting and solidification of the powder and post processing of the build. Just as with other manufacturing processes, it is important for the user to flush out the relative contribution of each component and potential interactions among components of the error budget to the overall quality of the output. It is for that purpose that this thesis undertakes the experimental sampling of the quality of two important hardware components of this process: The Z-Axis table movement and the laser beam positioning system. The Z-Axis characterization process used a Renishaw Laser Interferometer and a pair of Mahr Federal Electronic Levels. Geometric error components including linear scale error, angular pitch and yaw error, and straightness error along the X-Axis were measured for the Z-Axis table. \nThe laser positioning system was investigated using laser-etched patterns measured under an optical CMM from Optical Gaging Product (OGP) Inc. Two designs of the pattern were developed to evaluate the positioning accuracy and achievable geometric tolerance values. Pattern specifications were configured to eliminate the effects of thermal expansion. One of the patterns consisted of a circle matrix, which provided sufficient data points to fit a polynomial response surface. The other pattern included circles, lines, free form curves, and symmetric rectangles. These features were used to evaluate circularity, concentricity, straightness, angularity, perpendicularity, symmetry, composite profile tolerance, and composite position tolerance. \nFor the Z-Axis table performance, results showed that the linear scale error of the table was quite low (4.5 microns), straightness, yaw and pitch errors were significantly higher and may contribute from 20-30 microns of form and orientation tolerances over a large size build. \nLaser position performance of the machine was much worse and showed a positioning system that was short by a significant amount of about 160 microns at the edges of the workspace. The largest scatter of values was observed on the position of small circular features located over the working area while the largest tolerance magnitude (239 microns) was calculated as the combined effect of location, orientation, size and form errors in the trace of a large quadrifolium etched over the working area of the laser.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14343], "author_name_tesi": "Lu, Yang ", "last_name_ssi": "Lu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yang", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yang Lu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yang Lu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Additive Manufacturing", "GD&T", "Metrology", "Powder Bed Fusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development and analysis of an ice crystal scattering database for remote sensing applications and cloud model evaluation", "id": "19299", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9272", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An ice crystal (ice dendrites, plates and columns) scattering database at radar wavelengths (W-, Ka-, Ku- and X-bands) is created to facilitate radar retrievals and cloud model evaluations of ice cloud properties. The ice crystals in the database are modeled as clusters of closely-packed tiny spheres and their scattering properties calculated with the Generalized Multi-particle Mie-method (GMM). Radar observables, such as effective radar reflectivity factor at hh- and vv-polarizations (Zhh and Zvv), differential reflectivity (Zdr), specific differential phase (KDP) and specific attenuation at h- and v-polarizations (Ah and Av), are created from the database  using gamma size distributions with various parameters. For the four radar wavelengths considered, ice water content retrievals based purely on radar backscattering cross sections are highly uncertain while KDP shows greater promise.\nUsing the concepts of resonance and internal electric field strength across an ice crystal, a modified Rayleigh-Gans (MRG) theory is developed that captures most of the variability in the single ice crystal scattering properties within the database. Radar observables are also estimated using the MRG theory and compared to GMM results. Zhh, Zvv, Zdr and KDP estimated using the MRG theory show good agreement with GMM results. The errors for Ah and Av are large but not important because attenuation at radar wavelengths is generally small for ice crystals. As such, this MRG theory may be useful in radar applications.\nIn the representing ice crystals as clusters of tiny spheres with air gaps between them, the dielectric constant of the tiny spheres/air gaps mixtures is smaller than that of solid ice. To make the mixture electromagnetically equivalent to solid ice, the dielectric constant of the tiny spheres in the clusters is artificially increased by an amount dictated by the Maxwell-Garnett approximation.

Little is known, however, about the decisions that lead to these unhealthy behaviors. This dissertation aimed to conduct a formative research as the first step to develop a smoking intervention program for this population. The research consists of two phases. \nFirst, a qualitative, grounded theory study was conducted through fifty-four individual interviews and three focus groups with Chinese Americans of different smoking statuses in Atlanta, Georgia. Many Chinese Americans reported changing their smoking behaviors after immigration, with their social environment after immigration playing a key role. The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) emerged as the theoretical framework to describe various smoking decisions. The participants were thus categorized into seven groups (six stages of change and never smokers) and perceptions of smoking risks and emotions associated with smoking were identified as the key factors that differentiate these varied smoking decisions. \n\tStudy Two collected survey data to further validate the qualitative findings. The goal of the study was to first, test if TTM stages apply with Chinese American population, second, test the effects of covariates on the class memberships, and third, test a mediation model of nonsmokers\u2019 responses to secondhand smoke. Latent class analysis with 111 ever smokers identified four subgroups of ever smokers: non-quitter, planner, actor, and maintainer. Perceived smoking harms, risk perception, worry, fear, social norms, acculturation, and communication frequency were found to be significant covariates. Next, a structural equation model was tested with 296 nonsmokers to identify factors that affect their responses to secondhand smoke. It was found that perceived risk and disgust mediated the effects of perceived smoking harms and social norms on the decision to confront a smoker for secondhand smoke. Worry and fear, on the other hand, mediated the effects of perceived smoking harms and social norms on the decision to avoid a secondhand smoke situation. Overall, the findings provide one explanation for the diverse smoking behaviors observed of Chinese Americans and have important theoretical and practical implications.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10708], "author_name_tesi": "Lu, Yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Lu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael L Hecht", "Michael L Hecht", "Roxanne Louise Parrott", "Rachel Annette Smith", "Pui Wa Lei"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael L Hecht, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael L Hecht, Committee Chair", "Roxanne Louise Parrott, Committee Member", "Rachel Annette Smith, Committee Member", "Pui Wa Lei, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chinese Americans", "Smoking Decisions", "Communication", "Risk Perceptions", "Emotions"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Socio-demographic Change and Age-Crime Patterns in Taiwan and the United States, 1976-2015", "id": "15187yul201", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15187", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Age and its relationship with crime has been discussed in sociology and criminology for two hundred years. In 1983, Hirschi and Gottfredson (HG hereafter) proposed one of the most influential and controversial projections about the age-crime relationship. They argued: (1) crime is always and everywhere heavily concentrated among teenagers and young adults; (2) crime always declines after reaching the adolescent peak. They further asserted that the reverted J-shaped age-crime curve is universal across social contexts. In criminological writings over the past few decades, HG\u2019s invariance thesis is often viewed as \u201cuncontested.\u201d. \nOne of the most prominent challenges to the age-crime invariance thesis is the recent publication in Criminology (Steffensmeier, Zhong, and Lu 2017) that revealed substantial divergence in the age-crime patterns of Taiwan as compared to the U.S. from 2008 to 2010. However, the study only covers three years of data and does not take into account the impact of period and cohort on the age-crime patterns. Another study conducted by Zhong (2005) also revealed some variation in the age-crime patterns of Taiwan during the period of 1970s to 1990s, but it also failed to tease out age effects from both cohort and period influences. Besides these two studies, most of the age-crime analyses are based on crime data from the U.S. and a few prototypical western countries. Notably, very little is known about the age-crime relationship in non-western societies, especially the age-crime patterns of these societies across various historical periods. Therefore, the first objective of the current project is to build on the research conducted by Steffensmeier and colleagues in 2017 and provide a systematic assessment to the age-specific crime data from both Taiwan and the U.S. over the past four decades. Through comparing the age-crime patterns between the two societies, across different historical periods, and across offense types, the current project provides a multi-faceted evaluation of the HG invariance thesis. \nThe age distribution of crime observed in a particular period is not only shaped by age effects but also by social change and cohort-specific experiences. Prior sociological perspectives (e.g. modernization theory) suggest that social transformations, such as economic development, may lead to disproportionate increases in youth crime and shifts toward more adolescent-peaked age-crime distributions as a society becomes more industrialized. Theoretical perspectives in demography also highlight the importance of cohort replacement in understanding the impact of social change on age-specific outcomes across time. Specifically, Easterlin\u2019s (1987) cohort-size hypothesis proposed that large cohorts are more likely to be economically disadvantaged and have higher propensity to engage in crime than other cohorts. Existing sociological research on age and crime based on cross-sectional data that did not differentiate the age effect on crime from the influence of social change and cohort experience. Thus, the second objective of the project is to investigate the impact of cohort-specific experiences resulted from social changes (e.g. economic development, westernization and demographic transformation) on the age-specific crime rates in Taiwan as compared to the United States. \nTo meet these objectives, my dissertation draws on mainstream theoretical and methodological frameworks in sociology, criminology and demography. Theoretically, the study emerges from sociological theorizing about age effects on crime, the relationship between social change and crime, the demographic conceptualization of cohort replacement and cohort size effects on crime. Empirically, I address the above objectives using census-based population age-specific data and official age-specific crime statistics of Taiwan and U.S. from 1976 to 2015. Crime data from each society covers seven different offense types, including three summary categories of total, property, and violent offenses. The first part of the analysis tests the invariance thesis through comparing various measures of the age-crime curves developed by criminologists. The second part of the analysis applies age-period-cohort models and age-period-cohort-size models developed by demographers and criminologists, examining the impact of social change and cohort experience on the age-crime curve. \nTwo important sets of findings emerge from my analysis. First,  I found that the age-crime distributions in Taiwan demonstrate considerable divergence across time and across different offense types, which is in contrast to the robust concentration of crime among young people observed in the U.S. across time. These findings suggest that strong claims about the invariance of the age-crime relationship should be abated and cast doubt on the biological approaches that attribute teenage crime to neurobiological changes. \nThe age-period-cohort analysis also reveals two important findings. First, age-crime curves in both countries are shaped by period and cohort effects, but period and cohort effects are more prominent in predicting Taiwan\u2019s age-period-specific arrest curves than those of the U.S. Moreover, young cohorts who were born in the 1980s and 1990s are less crime prone than the older cohorts, at least during the teenager and young adult periods. I conclude that cohort replacement, which is often ignored in the age-crime literature, plays a role in shaping the age-crime curves, especially in Taiwan and for property offenses. Second, relative cohort size, which is considered a mechanism of cohort effect, has significant positive effects on age-specific crime rates in Taiwan and the effect is greater and more robust for property crime than violent crime. These findings are consistent with the U.S. findings of the past two decades and provide new evidence to support Easterlin\u2019s cohort size thesis. \nThe current project offers three contributions to criminology and allied social science fields. First, the project contributes to the longstanding debate on the age-crime relationship by bringing in new evidence from a non-Western country across multiple decades and with multiple analytical techniques. Second, since age is an important variable and status marker in sociology, criminology, and demography, the current study helps researchers further understand the puzzling effects of age on social outcomes. If we are interested in the universality of age effects on certain outcomes, we may need to adopt the comparative approach used in the current study to test the universal claims. Third, the current project underscores the importance of the cross-fertilization benefits of applying the methods and theories of one substantive area to another substantive area: in this case, applying the methods and theories of demography to criminology. Through incorporating the concept of cohort and the age-period-cohort modeling developed by demographers, the current project provides a new assessment of the age effects on crime by taking into account the impacts of social changes and cohort experiences. This kind of assessment is rarely seen in the age-crime analysis of a non-Western country. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16805], "author_name_tesi": "Lu, Yunmei ", "last_name_ssi": "Lu", "first_name_ssi": "Yunmei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier", "Darrell J Steffensmeier", "Jeremy Staff", "Liying Luo", "Guangqing Chi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier, Dissertation Advisor", "Darrell J Steffensmeier, Committee Chair", "Jeremy Staff, Committee Member", "Liying Luo, Committee Member", "Guangqing Chi, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Age-crime Relations", "Cross-cultural Comparison", "Age-period-cohort Analysis", "Social Change", "Life Course", "Asian Criminology"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Factors Affecting the Behavior of Unburned Carbon upon Steam Activation\n", "id": "6987", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6961", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe main objective of this study is to investigate the factors that could affect the behavior of unburned carbon samples upon steam activation. Through this work, the relationships among the factors that could influence the carbon-steam reaction with the surface area of the produced activated carbon were explored. Statistical analysis was used to relate the chemical and physical properties of the unburned carbon to the surface area of the activated carbon.  \n\nSix unburned carbons were selected as feedstocks for activated carbon, and marked as UCA through UCF. The unburned carbons were activated using steam at 850oC for 90 minutes, and the surface areas of their activated counterparts were measured using N2 adsorption isotherms at 77K. For all the unburned carbons investigated in this study, the surface areas of their activated counterparts increased with carbon burn-off levels, and reached a maximum, as a result of the development of porosity by burning out of active carbon structure and opening of the blocked pores, and then decreased as the burn-off level increased due to the pore widening and the destruction and merging of the pore walls between the micropores. The activated carbons produced from different unburned carbon precursors presented different surface areas at similar carbon burn-off levels. Moreover, in different carbon burn-off regions, the sequences for surface area of activated carbons from different unburned carbon samples were different. \n\nThe factors that may affect the carbon-steam gasification reactions, including the concentration of carbon active sites, the crystallite size of the carbon, the intrinsic porous structure of carbon, and the inorganic impurities, were investigated. All unburned carbons investigated in this study were similar in that they showed the very broad (002) and (10) carbon peaks, which are characteristic of highly disordered carbonaceous materials. \n\nUnburned carbons were predominantly mesoporous except for sample UCD, which was mainly microporous. It seems that the rapid devolatilization that coals underwent in the combustor promoted the generation of meso- and macropores.  \n\nIn this study, the unburned carbon samples contained about 17-48% of inorganic impurities. Compared to coals, the unburned carbon samples contain a larger amount of inorganic impurities as a result of the burn-off, or at lease part, of the carbon during the combustion process. These inorganic particles were divided into two groups in terms of the way they are associated with carbon particles: free single particles, and particles combined with carbon particles.\n \nThe analytical data for these factors, as well as those obtained from the author\u2019s previous M.S. work, such as the results of proximate, ultimate, and optical texture analyses, were used for statistical analysis using the main effect plot and fitting line plot methods in this study.\n\nThe results of the statistical analyses showed that the surface areas of the activated carbons increased with the concentration of active sites, which was measured as the O2 uptakes, the concentration of C-O species, and crystallite diameters, in all carbon burn-off zones for samples UCA, UCD, UCE, and UCF. This indicated that these parameters of unburned carbons played the most significant role on the development of surface areas of the activated carbons. A good correlation was observed between the surface areas of activated carbons and the burn-off levels of the unburned carbons, except for samples UCB and UCC in the burn-off levels of 10-45%, and 45-60%, and this correlation was good for all unburned carbons when the burn-off was >60%. This could be attributed to the fact that samples UCB and UCC had the highest concentration of Na+K combined with carbon particles, which can facilitate the development of the surface areas of activated carbons. Moreover, the highest content of isotropic carbon composition that sample UCB had could also lead to the highest increase in surface areas of activated UCB. Furthermore, the regression equations given by fitted line plot method can be used to predict the surface area of activated carbon from the concentration of active sites of the unburned carbon precursors, where high R2 of >90% was obtained, and R2 value increased with carbon burn-off levels.\n\nAs indicated from the present work, unburned carbons with one of the following properties will produce activated carbons with high surface areas. These properties include: (a) large amount of O2 chemisorption capacity; (b) high concentration of surface C-O complex; and (c) small crystallite diameter; (d) high concentration of Na+K particles that are combined with carbon; (e) high concentration of isotropic carbon. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6958], "author_name_tesi": "Lu, Zhe ", "last_name_ssi": "Lu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhe", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["M Mercedes Maroto Valer", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Semih Eser", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Mark Stephen Klima"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["M Mercedes Maroto Valer, Committee Chair", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Chair", "Semih Eser, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member", "Mark Stephen Klima, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["steam activation", "unburned carbon"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "An Optimal Replenishment Policy And Pricing Strategy For Two-periods Deteriorating Inventory", "id": "13865", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7326", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, a single-product two-period deteriorating inventory model is developed.

The amount of this water increases with water content, but reaches a constant value at higher water contents. The microwave DRS measurements showed a relaxation time of about 30 ps for this type of water; 3) the free water, locating at the center of the ion cluster regions where the ion-water interaction is negligible, is present when &#61548; &#61619; 6. The free water, with relaxation time &#61556; &#61627; 8 ps at 25oC, shows the characteristic dynamics of bulk water; and 4) finally, as water content increases further, water molecules start to be associated with the perfluorinated side chains and even with the fluorocarbon backbone. A much longer relaxation time, &#61556; &#61627; 90 ps, is observed for this part of water due to the hydrophobic confinement by the polymer. Microwave DRS measurements showed markedly different dynamics, i.e., negligible activation enthalpy and large negative activation entropy, for the dielectric relaxation of this type of water. The presence of the hydrophobically confined water is found to correspond to the clustering of water and to the appearance of the freezing water in these membranes.\nThe equivalent weight (EW) of the PSA membrane has been found to have considerable influence on the dielectric response of the membranes. Flemion SH150, which has an EW value of 909, shows higher static permittivity than Nafion 117, which has an EW of 1100. This is consistent with the higher water sorption by Flemion SH150 at the same water activity. The \u201cfree\u201d and \u201chydrophobically confined\u201d water are found to start to appear at lower water content in Flemion than in Nafion. These results may suggest that Flemion SH150 membrane is likely to form larger and/or more numerous ionic cluster regions.\nThe free water provides a pathway to the fast proton conduction in the membranes. Optimization of the proton conductivity requires maximization of the free water content. Dimethyl sulfoxide was found to increase the fraction of \u201cfree water\u201d in PSA membranes due to its strong ability to form hydrogen bonding with water molecules. This increase leads to increasing conductivity of Nafion/DMSO at lower water content. However, the Nafion/DMSO membrane showed lower conductivity at high water contents. This can be explained by the longer relaxation times for the solvent mixture, compared to pure water. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6972], "author_name_tesi": "Lu, Zijie ", "last_name_ssi": "Lu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zijie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald", "Evangelos Manias", "Harry R Allcock", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald, Committee Chair", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Chair", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["proton exchange membranes", "Microwave dielectric relaxation spectroscopy", "Water state", "fuel cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Concurrent Assemblies: A Model for Concurrent Program Execution", "id": "15407", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7465", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We present Concurrent Assemblies, an abstract model for modeling shared memory parallel programs. In particular  Concurrent Assemblies is targeted to irregular parallel applications such as those manipulating mutable pointer-based data structures. Typically in these applications, there is no a priori bound on the available parallelism.\n\nThe Concurrent Assemblies abstract execution model addresses dynamism and locality through the unifying abstraction of a concurrent assembly: a local region in a shared data structure equipped with a short-lived, speculative thread of control. The thread of control in an assembly  can only access objects within the assembly. While objects can migrate from assembly to assembly, such migration is local---i.e., objects only move from one assembly to a neighboring one---and does not lead to  aliasing. Programming primitives include a  merge operation, by which an assembly merges with an adjacent assembly, and a split operation, which splits an assembly into smaller ones. Our abstractions are race-free and inherently data-centric.\n\nIn addition to the formal definition of the Concurrent Assemblies abstract model, we show the usefulness of such an abstract model by presenting two different programming languages that can be modeled as instances of the Concurrent Assemblies abstract model. The first one is JChorus, a  high-level parallel programming language built on top of the sequential subset of Java,  suitable for irregular, heap-manipulating applications like mesh refinement and epidemic simulations. \nOne goal of JChorus is to express the dynamic and instance-dependent patterns of memory access that are common in typical irregular applications. Its other focus is locality of effects: the property that in many of the same applications, typical imperative commands only affect small, local regions in the shared heap.\n\nThe second is Habanero-Chorus, a parallel subset of the Habanero-Java programming language. Here concurrency is expressed as asynchronous software transactions. \n\nWe present implementation of JChorus and Habanero-Chorus as well as report on the performance numbers. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7409, 7410, 7411], "author_name_tesi": "Lublinerman, Roberto Elias", "last_name_ssi": "Lublinerman", "middle_name_ssi": "Elias", "first_name_ssi": "Roberto", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Swarat Chaudhuri", "Swarat Chaudhuri", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "John Joseph Hannan", "Patrick M Reed"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Swarat Chaudhuri, Dissertation Advisor", "Swarat Chaudhuri, Committee Chair", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Member", "John Joseph Hannan, Committee Member", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Parallel programming", "Programming abstractions", "Irregular parallelism", "Data-parallelism", "Ownership"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Direct Solar Hydrogen Production From Photosynthetic Nanoconstructs\n", "id": "11700", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "971", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Described here is the development and refinement of a hybrid biological/organic photo-electrochemical half-cell that couples a photochemical module, Photosystem I (PS I), which captures and stores energy derived from sunlight, with a catalytic module, hydrogenase (H2ase), which catalyzes H2 evolution with an input of two electrons and two protons. The design philosophy is based on the biological paradigm in which two independent photochemical half-cells function in series to generate O2 and NADPH. The work described in this dissertation focuses on the optimization of the half-cell reaction: 2H+ + 2e\u2013 + 2h&#957; &#8594; H2. The challenge is to deliver electrons from PS I to H2ase rapidly and at high quantum yield, thereby overcoming diffusion-based limits on electron transfer. To accomplish this, a technology has been devised that is based on a molecular wire, which serves to tether the photochemical module to the catalytic module at a fixed distance so that an electron can quantum mechanically tunnel between the FB cluster of PS I and the distal [4Fe-4S] cluster of a H2ase enzyme at a rate faster than the charge recombination between P700+ and FB\u2013. To link the photochemical and catalytic modules of the half-cell, a short aliphatic or aromatic dithiol molecule forms a coordination bond with an exposed Fe of the FB cluster of a PS I variant and with an exposed Fe of the distal [4Fe-4S] cluster of a H2ase variant. This is practically achieved by changing a ligating Cys residue of the surface-located [4Fe-4S] cluster of each protein to a Gly, thereby exposing the Fe atom for chemical rescue by the added dithiolate-containing molecular wire.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [963], "author_name_tesi": "Lubner, Carolyn E", "last_name_ssi": "Lubner", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Carolyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John H Golbeck", "John H Golbeck", "Philip C.

College-aged individuals, highly at-risk for unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, often face this situation. Since the decision concerning whether or not to participate in risky sexual behaviors can be difficult to make in isolation, college-aged individuals may turn to their friends for assistance. Previous research validates the potential influence of friends on one\u2019s sexual behavior. Because friends are valued candidates for consultation when making difficult decisions, it is critical to understand how the role of friendship communication may influence sexual behavior. \n\nThis dissertation had three goals all focused on analyzing the ways in which sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies can be prevented among college-aged individuals. The first was to apply the regret regulation theory to interpersonal college-aged friendships. The regret regulation theory proposes that individuals will evaluate the possibility of experiencing regret, often with significant others, when decisions are important. The second goal was to test the parts of the theory relating to the anticipation of regret. The theory suggests that individuals will regulate regret according to levels of anticipated regret. Finally, the third goal was to acquire information concerning social support among friends during conversations involving sexual decision-making.  \n\nTwo foundational studies and one main study contributed to the pursuit of these goals. Study 1 was an investigation of the sexual decision-making conversation of college-aged individuals with their friends as well as the types of social support provided during these conversations. The data were used to generate twenty-four scenarios based on the contextual details provided by the participants in conjunction with varying levels of anticipated regret and social support. Study 2 was a survey involving six scenarios in which a sample of participants rated events for typicality and relational importance to their friendships. Study 3 entailed use of a 2 (anticipated regret: low and high) x 2 (social support: positive and negative) design with participants completing measures of friendship quality, as well as sexual disclosures and behavior. In addition, the participants reviewed, rated, and responded to the hypothetical scenario identified as the most typical - one depicting a conversation among friends about whether or not to engage in a hook-up. The participants\u2019 intentions to engage in the hook-up and to seek friend\u2019s input in the future were also matters of interest.\n\nThe results of the studies indicated that college-aged individuals make sexual decisions both with and without the assistance of their same-sex friends. Participants rated the hypothetical scenarios detailing sexual decision conversations as typical, although not highly important to their friendships. The initial test of regret regulation theory revealed that anticipated regret was a strong predictor of intentions to engage in sexual behavior. The interaction effects were not significant; however, which indicated issues with its utility for the sexual decision-making process as related to emerging adulthood friendship consultation and support. The analyses showed positive social support to be a strong predictor for participants who reported strong intentions to seek a friend\u2019s advice in the future. Open-ended data reinforced this finding with esteem (ego) support reported being communicated most frequently during sexual decision conversations. Sex differences indicated that male college-aged individuals had greater expressed inclinations to engage in the behavior; females had greater intentions to seek the friend\u2019s advice in the future and also reported higher levels of anticipated regret than males.\n\nThe findings of each study are discussed with a particular focus on how the studies contribute to the existing research in the sexuality and communication fields. Theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions of this dissertation are outlined while also noting the importance of studying the role of friendship especially during a time period critical to the development of one\u2019s sexual identity and skills necessary for later romantic relationships. Finally, the limitations of this dissertation are acknowledged, and future directions for research involving sexual decision-making are proposed. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11], "author_name_tesi": "Lucas, Alysa Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Lucas", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Alysa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum", "Jon F Nussbaum", "Dennis Stephen Gouran", "Denise Haunani Solomon", "Mary Beth Oliver"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum, Dissertation Advisor", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Chair", "Dennis Stephen Gouran, Committee Member", "Denise Haunani Solomon, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Oliver, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["regret regulation theory", "support", "friendship", "sexual decision-making"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Comparison of Two Acid Mine Drainage Sites in Central Pennsylvania: Field Site Characterizations and Batch Reactor Experiments\n", "id": "8414", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4484", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Biological oxidation of iron(II) in acid mine drainage (AMD) and the subsequent precipitation of iron(III) occurs unaided at Gum Boot Mine in McKean County, Pennsylvania but it is not observed at a large number of AMD sites across the state.  To improve passive AMD treatment methods through a better understanding of biological iron(II) oxidation, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) selected this and a similar AMD site (Fridays-2 Mine in Clearfield County, PA) for chemical, microbial, and kinetic characterization of the observed abiotic and biological oxidation processes.  \nSampling transects were established to identify any spatial trends over the iron mounds at each mine.  Water chemistry measurements were conducted on mine drainage waters during several sampling events at each mine site.  Solids were collected for subsequent SEM and molecular analyses.  Iron sediments collected from the sampling locations of highest and lowest activities of iron(II) oxidation (Gum Boot \u201cfastest\u201d, Fridays-2 \u201cslowest\u201d, and Fridays-2 \u201cfastest\u201d) were incubated in batch reactors under different gas mix compositions of O2, CO2, and N2.  The batch reactor results were then used to calculate the abiotic and biological iron(II) oxidation rates of the sediments to determine if field trends were observed in controlled laboratory conditions.  These results were also used to examine the effects of pO2 and pCO2 on iron(II) oxidation rates.  Lastly, the results of the batch reactor experiments were used to model the iron(II) oxidation kinetics of the sediments with STELLA computer program and the combined model for abiotic and biological iron(II) oxidation proposed by Kirby et al. (1999).\nWater chemistry results indicate similarities between the emergent AMD at Gum Boot and Fridays-2 Mines, with no observed seasonal trends in iron(II) concentrations, pH, temperature, and DO at either mine site.  Iron(II) was quickly removed in the first 10 meters of flow over the iron mound at Gum Boot Mine; however, most iron(II) was still present in solution at Fridays-2 Mine immediately before the AMD mixed with Fridays Run.  Given the distance of AMD flow and measured rates of AMD emergence, the residence time over the iron mound at Fridays-2 Mine was much shorter than the residence time at Gum Boot.  No nutrient limitations were observed at either Gum Boot or Fridays-2 Mine.\nMicrobial characterization of the mine sites included SEM images of sediments, population counts of iron(II) oxidizing bacteria (IOB), and phylogenetic analyses of IOB communities, in addition to batch reactor experiments with glucose additions to examine the contribution of heterotrophic vs. autotrophic IOB at Gum Boot and Fridays-2 Mines.  SEM images and phylogenetic analysis reveal greater morphological and genetic diversity in sediments collected from Gum Boot AMD emergence than from Fridays-2 AMD emergence.  Additionally, sediments at each mine site from the sampling locations with the largest numbers of IOB and the largest rates of iron(II) oxidation had the greatest phylum-level similarities.  Lastly, though batch reactor experiments with glucose additions did not show any change in observed iron(II) oxidation rates, phylogenetic analyses indicated heterotrophs were the dominant IOB present at the sampling locations with the highest levels of iron(II) oxidation activity.\nBatch reactor iron(II) oxidation rates were observed to increase with O2 concentrations of 21%.  However, IOB numbers increased during each batch reactor experiment, with the largest increases observed at O2 concentrations > 10%.  There were no noticeable effects of CO2 concentration on abiotic or biological iron(II) oxidation rates.  Fridays-2 reactors generally had higher abiotic rates of iron(II) oxidation and were capable of achieving biological iron(II) oxidation rates that equaled or exceeded the rates observed in the Gum Boot reactors.\nThe Kirby et al. (1999) iron(II) oxidation model was successfully modified in STELLA for application to the batch reactor results of this study.  Observed iron(II) oxidation rates were less than the rates predicted by the default STELLA model as well as rates published by other previous studies.  Additionally, the pO2 of the gas mix did affect the model performance and fit to the batch reactor data.  Lastly, the biological rate constant, kbio, for iron(II) oxidation may be dependent on the bacterial communities composition and certain environmental factors of an AMD site.\nThe results of this study indicate that both Gum Boot and Fridays-2 Mines are equally capable of efficient oxidative precipitation of iron(II) from acid mine drainage.  Biological iron(II) oxidation was observed at both mine sites and with both batch reactor sediments.  However, the shorter residence time at Fridays-2 Mine did not allow enough time for the hydrolysis and precipitation of iron(III) before the AMD mixed with Fridays Run.  In conclusion, future remediation strategies at Fridays-2 Mine should focus on increasing the AMD residence time to encourage optimal conditions for biological iron(II) oxidation promote iron(III) precipitation.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4454], "author_name_tesi": "Lucas, Melanie Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Lucas", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Melanie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William D Burgos"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William D Burgos, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["iron oxidation kinetics", "coal mines", "acid mine drainage", "batch reactors"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Be Near to Me: An Articulation of a Nearness Pedagogy\n\n", "id": "9129", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2976", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "How do we learn learning?

The direct coal liquefaction process raises the hydrogen content of the hydrocarbon solid to that of a hydrocarbon liquid which can be upgraded to resemble refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel.  A difference, however, is that coal contains a wider range and a higher concentration of inorganic material and in direct coal liquefaction processes these inorganic constituents must be accounted for.  The objective of this thesis is to determine the partitioning of major, minor and trace inorganic elements during direct coal liquefaction and their effect on conversion.  The inorganic constituent partitioning was studied because of potential health effects and operational impacts on equipment.  These health effects include contamination to the atmosphere and water by Hg, As, and Se constituents.  Important operational impacts include corrosion, fouling, and catalyst poisoning by alkali and alkaline earth metals Ca, K, Mg, and Na.  High mineral matter concentrations in the coal liquefaction residues also pose challenges in post-processing.\n\nTwo coals, an Illinois No. 6 seam high volatile bituminous coal and a Montana Dietz seam subbituminous coal, were used in direct coal liquefaction experiments while varying temperature (450&#61616;C and 375&#61616;C), pressure (6.9MPa and 7.9MPa of hydrogen), coal preparation procedures (as-received and float-sink cleaning) and catalyst addition (with and without an FeS catalyst).  The reaction conditions were varied to analyze any correlations with inorganic elements.  Major, minor, and trace inorganic element concentrations were measured in the feed coals and their tetrahydrofuran (THF) soluble (liquid) and THF-non-soluble (residue) products.  The partitioning of an element was determined by measuring the total mass of the individual inorganic element fed into the system and their mass measured in the solid and liquid products.  A total of 16 major, minor and trace elements was studied: Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, S, Ti, As, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, V, and Zn.  Elemental concentrations were measured by atomic adsorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry.\n\nThe highest direct coal liquefaction conversions resulted from tests using the Illinois No. 6 as-received coal.  This coal not only had the highest sulfur, iron, and pyrite concentrations, but also contained the smallest particle size distribution of pyrite as determined by computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy.  It was found that the majority of the inorganic constituents concentrated in the residue.  Commonly the concentrations of inorganic elements were two to six times higher in the residue compared to the feed coal and this could result in operational and environmental concerns.  The elements Mg, Na, S, Hg, Mo, V, and Zn often measured more than 5% (averaging about 20%) of their initial weight reporting to the liquids.  In the liquid products, the alkali and alkaline earth metal concentrations were higher than those of crude oil.  Direct coal liquefaction liquids had Hg, As and Se concentrations similar to that of crude oils.  Additionally, the feed coals were chemically fractionated and analyzed to determine if any relationship existed between the element\u2019s mode of occurrence and its partitioning to the solid or liquid product.  No trends could be concluded in regard to the relation of an element\u2019s mode of occurrence and its partitioning in direct coal liquefaction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5478], "author_name_tesi": "Luchner, Sarah Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Luchner", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sharon Falcone Miller", "Sharon Falcone Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sharon Falcone Miller, Thesis Advisor", "Sharon Falcone Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["coal liquefaction", "trace elements", "inorganic elements"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Arcuate Nucleus Injection of an Anti-insulin Affibody Prevents the Sympathetic Response to Circulating Insulin", "id": "13839", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7279", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Insulin contributes to cardiovascular dysfunction by central actions to increase sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) as presented in several diseases, notably obesity and hypertension.  The arcuate nucleus (ARC) in the mediobasal hypothalamus highly expresses insulin receptors, and direct ARC injection of insulin elevates lumbar SNA.  However, the area of the brain which senses circulating insulin to mediate these sympathoexcitatory effects is unknown.  Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to demonstrate that peripheral insulin acts directly on ARC neurons to increase lumbar SNA and this was tested utilizing an anti-insulin affibody to neutralize insulin.  First, to verify the efficacy of the anti-insulin affibody, anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with bilateral ARC injection (40nL) of either an anti-insulin (1\u00b5g) or control (1\u00b5g) affibody 10 minutes before ARC injection of insulin (4\u00b5U).  The anti-insulin vs. control affibody abolished the increased lumbar SNA.  Second, to determine the ability of ARC neurons to detect peripheral insulin, animals received identical pretreatments with either affibody 10 minutes prior to the start of an intravenous (IV) infusion of insulin (7.5mU/kg/min) while maintaining euglycemia with 50% dextrose.  ARC injection of the anti-insulin vs. control affibody prevented the increased lumbar SNA and attenuated splanchnic SNA.  In marked contrast, renal SNA did not show significant changes between groups.  In a third set of animals, ARC injection of the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine (1mM, 20nL) elicited increases in lumbar, renal, and splanchnic SNA in both anti-insulin vs. control affibody pretreated animals suggesting the anti-insulin affibody specifically neutralizes insulin within ARC, rather than creating a general inhibition of neuronal activity.  Anti-insulin affibody injection into the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) did not eliminate the lumbar sympathoexcitatory response to hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia.

Chronic HBV infection can lead to advanced liver diseases like cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, causing one million deaths annually. HBV belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family, pararetroviruses that replicate their relaxed-circular DNA (RC DNA) genome via reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). Viral capsids assemble in the cytoplasm when multiple copies of a single protein, the core protein, encapsidate the pgRNA complexed with the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. Reverse transcription takes place within cytoplasmic nucleocapsids and is regulated by the dynamic phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the core protein. Using the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) model, it was determined that phosphorylation of the core protein CTD was required for minus strand DNA synthesis while subsequent dephosphorylation was required for the synthesis of mature RC DNA. In addition, CTD phosphorylation is also suggested to regulate pgRNA packaging and nuclear localization of the core protein. \n\nThe core protein CTD phosphorylation sites are found in conserved S/T-P motifs, consensus sequences known to be phosphorylated by proline-directed serine/ threonine kinases. However, the cellular kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of the core protein CTD in cells has not yet been identified. Additionally, the viral capsid displays endogenous protein kinase activity, suggesting that a host kinase is captured and packaged within assembling capsids. The identity of this kinase is also unknown.  Moreover, additional host factors may interact with the CTD in a manner dependent on its phosphorylation state. Therefore, not only must host factors interact with the core protein in order to bring about these dynamic modifications, but host factors that specifically recognize the core phosphorylation state may also control viral reverse transcription. \n\nWe observed that the DHBV core protein expressed in a cell-free translation lysate, the rabbit reticulocyte lysate or RL, was hyperphosphorylated by cellular kinase(s) in the lysate. Furthermore, the same core S/T-P sites were phosphorylated in this cell-free system as in the cell. Using a large panel of kinase inhibitors, we found that only inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), a major family of proline-directed serine/ threonine kinases, could block the phosphorylation of DHBV core protein expressed in this cell-free system. Moreover, purified CDKs could phosphorylate E. coli-derived HBV capsids at the CTD and also GST-fusion proteins containing the DHBV core CTD in vitro. CDK inhibitor treatment also decreased the phosphorylation of both DHBV and HBV core CTDs in cells. Finally, inhibitors of CDKs, CDK2 in particular, could block the endogenous kinase activity of HBV capsids purified from HepG2 cells. Thus, both in vitro and in vivo results strongly support the role for a CDK(s) in mediating viral core CTD phosphorylation that is critical for viral replication. \n\nIn further studies to identity host factors that could interact differentially with the core protein depending on its state of phosphorylation, we used GST-fusion proteins containing the DHBV CTD, either with wild type (WT) sequences or with alanine or aspartic acid substitutions to mimic the unphosphorylated or phosphorylated states of the CTD in a protein-protein interaction search. We first showed that the fusion proteins with WT CTD sequences were phosphorylated in cells similar to the full-length core protein. We used the GST fusion proteins in pulldown experiments and found two host proteins, B23 and I2PP2A, which interacted preferentially with the unphosphorylated CTD. We further mapped the binding site on the CTD for both B23 and I2PP2A to a region upstream of the phosphorylation sites, yet B23 or I2PP2A binding to this site was clearly modulated by the phosphorylation state of the downstream sequences. We also provide evidence that B23 can affect hepadnaviral replication. Together, these studies provide further insights into virus-host interactions that can influence the hepadnaviral core protein function and viral replication.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3901], "author_name_tesi": "Ludgate, Laurie ", "last_name_ssi": "Ludgate", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Laurie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jianming Hu", "Jianming Hu", "Rebecca C Craven", "David Joseph Spector", "Harriet C Isom", "Laura Carrel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jianming Hu, Dissertation Advisor", "Jianming Hu, Committee Chair", "Rebecca C Craven, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Harriet C Isom, Committee Member", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HBV", "DHBV", "core protein", "phosphorylation", "kinase"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PROTON\u2013COUPLED ELECTRON TRANSFER REACTIONS:                    THEORETICAL INSIGHT INTO EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "id": "10982", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4218", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A theoretical formulation for vibronically nonadiabatic proton\u2013coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions is applied to several PCET systems.

Analysis of the results indicates that electron donating groups enhance the vibronic coupling, while electron withdrawing groups attenuate the vibronic coupling.  Therefore, the electron donating groups will increase the rate, while electron withdrawing groups will decrease the rate for the phenoxyl/phenol self-exchange reaction.  \n\nTheoretical calculations are performed on model systems for the quinol oxidation of ubiquinol and plastoquinol to provide an explanation for the differences in magnitudes and temperature dependences of the KIEs and an explanation for the inverse temperature dependence of the KIE for the ubiquinol. The physical properties of the system that enable the inverse temperature dependence of the KIE are a stiff hydrogen bond and small reorganization energy.  The inverse temperature dependence of the KIE is observed when the (0/0) pair of reactant/product vibronic states is in the inverted Marcus region, while the (0/1) pair is in the normal Marcus region and is the dominant contributor to the overall rate.  For ubiquinol, the (0/1) pair is the dominant contributor to the overall rate, while for plastoquinol other pairs of vibronic states contribute significantly to the overall rate, leading to qualitatively different temperature dependences of the KIEs for the two system.\n\nElectrochemical PCET of an osmium aquo complex attached to a self-assembled monolayer on a gold electrode is studied.

This concept is ideal for use in underwater vehicles, where the presence of molecular oxygen negates the use of standard combustion reactions for power and energy generation. A significant technical challenge associated with the use of aluminum powder as a fuel is that powders of fine particle size are cohesive and have poor flow properties due to attractive inter-particulate interactions. Reducing the inter-particulate cohesion through particle surface modification enables successful fuel delivery. This dissertation uses hydrophobic, siloxane based surface treatments to reduce the inter-particulate cohesion of aluminum particles and thus improve the flowability. Chapter 3 focuses on the bulk property enhancement of solution phase methyltriethoxysilane surface modified particles, which was revealed to improve bulk density, reduce cohesion, and improve aeration properties, even at fine particle size. Chapter 4 describes the design of a gas phase deposition process using volatized polydimethylsiloxane in a fluidized bed, which also subsequently improved the flowability of the treated powder.

The disease etiology remains unknown and the initial diagnosis of MS is difficult.  Currently, the diagnostic criteria for MS rely heavily on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as there is no reliable set of serum factors and no requirement for a blood test. A biomarker specific for MS that is also responsive to disease progression that could be easily obtained and quantified facilitate prognostic testing between MRI scans, supplement the initial diagnosis, and possibly serve as an indicator for therapeutic efficacy. One potential biomarker is Opioid Growth Factor (OGF, chemically termed [Met5]-enkephalin). Previous research on this endogenous pentapeptide demonstrates that OGF inhibits DNA synthesis of normal and neoplastic cells in a receptor-mediated manner by OGFr. Exogenous OGF is an effective treatment for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse models of MS. Treatment initiated at the time of visible clinical disease reversed the progression of behavioral defects, restored sensitivity to normal, and decreased associated neuropathology. Low doses of naltrexone (LDN) a general opioid antagonist, also has an anti-proliferative effect through increasing endogenous OGF, and currently is a popular and well tolerated treatment for the fatigue associated with MS, as well as an alternative, stand-alone therapy for MS.  Based on the research that both exogenous OGF, as well as the endogenous stimulation of OGF following LDN therapy, reverse the course of relapsing-remitting EAE, chronic progressive EAE, and the positive effects noted by MS patients receiving LDN therapy, the overall hypothesis for this research was developed such that  that the OGF-OGFr axis becomes dysregulated during the onset and development of MS and EAE, and one or more components of this pathway may serve as specific biomarker(s) for the progression of disease and response to therapy. \nTo assess OGF\u2019s potential as a biomarker for MS, the following specific aims were completed using the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Ch-EAE) model of MS and MS subjects at Penn State Hershey Neurology Clinic. Specific Aim 1: to determine the serum enkephalin levels in Ch-EAE mice, both untreated and treated with either OGF or LDN and correlate those levels with disease severity, motor activity, and sensitivity.  Specific Aim 2: to determine the serum enkephalin levels in MS patients receiving either conventional disease modifying therapies (DMTs) and/or LDN. Specific Aim 3:  to determine the inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum of Ch-EAE mice treated with OGF or LDN, over the course of 20 days. Specific Aim 4: to utilize MRI to observe pathological changes in Ch-EAE mice, and determine the effect of OGF treatment on pathology, as seen by MRI. Serum enkephalin levels were analyzed by ELISA. Ch-EAE mice were treated with either exogenous OGF (10mg/kg) or low doses of naltrexone (LDN, 0.1mg/kg), whereas MS patients received glatiramer acetate (Copaxone\u00ae) and/or LDN. \nIn the first study, mice immunized with MOG35-55 to induce Ch-EAE were shown at the onset of disease symptoms (day 9 post immunization) to have significantly reduced serum OGF concentrations. By the peak of Ch-EAE disease (day 18), mice had further declines in serum OGF concentrations. The reductions in the serum OGF levels were inversely correlated with disease severity as measured by behavior such that an increase in disease severity correlated with a decrease in the serum enkephalin levels. Treatment of mice with Ch-EAE with exogenous OGF restored serum OGF levels to normal levels within 6 days of treatment. \n\tIn the second study, the effect of LDN on serum enkephalin levels was investigated. Within 7 days of MOG immunization, prior to the onset of disease symptoms, OGF levels in serum were reduced. However, daily LDN treatment of Ch-EAE mice restored serum OGF levels to normal. . LDN treatment had no significant effect on serum \u03b2-endorphin levels in Ch-EAE mice or on OGF levels in non-immunized, normal mice. In our clinical studies, LDN was also shown to increase serum OGF levels in MS when compared to MS subjects receiving Copaxone\u00ae therapy.\n\tIn the third study, the inflammatory cytokine profile of the Ch-EAE mouse model, both untreated and treated with LDN or OGF, was investigated at 10 and 20 days following induction of EAE and treatment. Based on a multiplex analysis of inflammatory cytokines, within ten days of disease, cytokines in the serum of Ch-EAE mice were increased in comparison to those measured in normal mice. Compared to cytokine levels in Ch-EAE mice receiving saline, mice treated with LDN and OGF had reduced levels of IL-10, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3. IL-6 expression was increased over the disease state after ten days of treatment with OGF and LDN. The multiplex data were validated with serum samples collected at six days of disease in addition to human serum samples. In the Ch-EAE mice at six days of disease, IL-10 was increased over the normal, but was not increased in LDN and OGF treated mice. In the MS subjects, cytokine levels were comparable between the Copaxone\u00ae treated and LDN treated subjects. \n\tIn the final study, MRI was evaluated as a disease monitoring protocol for Ch-EAE. T2 and DTI scans were performed longitudinally across a 40-day disease time course, in order to track the progression of the disease damage. Upon visual inspection, T2 scans showed intensities that increased throughout the disease progression. At day 40, Ch-EAE mice were humanely euthanized and spinal columns were removed for ex-vivo scanning.  The increased resolution in the ex vivo scans allowed for more accurate localization of the T2 intensities. Upon visual inspection, these intensities were localized to the lumbar regions of the spinal cord, comparable to those areas of demyelination measured by Luxol Fast Blue staining. These pilot- methodological studies warrant further research on the Ch-EAE mouse model utilizing MRI.\n\tIn summary, these studies provide evidence for the potential use of OGF, along with inflammatory cytokines, as a biomarker panel for MS and EAE, paving the way for future, more clinically relevant or more mechanistic research.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15621], "author_name_tesi": "Ludwig, Michael Dale", "last_name_ssi": "Ludwig", "middle_name_ssi": "Dale", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Mclaughlin", "Patricia Mclaughlin", "Colin James Barnstable", "Yongsoo Kim", "Mark David Meadowcroft", "Ian Stuart Zagon", "Gary A Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Mclaughlin, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Mclaughlin, Committee Chair", "Colin James Barnstable, Committee Member", "Yongsoo Kim, Committee Member", "Mark David Meadowcroft, Outside Member", "Ian Stuart Zagon, Committee Member", "Gary A Thomas, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multiple Sclerosis", "EAE", "Biomarker", "OGF", "LDN", "Cytokines"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Peripheral Blood Biomarkers and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE)", "id": "24932", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11274", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating autoimmune disease.

Drawing primarily from the works of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Gilles Deleuze, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, I show (1) that sense constitutes the ontologically most basic dimension of our worldly being and (2) that the way in which this sense happens is determinative for our experience of the ethical imperative.  By originary sense I mean to name something that is neither sensible sense (sensation) nor intelligible sense (meaning), but rather a complex and ambiguous unity of these that is ontologically anterior to their separation.\n\tIn the first chapter I follow Merleau-Ponty\u2019s argument in Phenomenology of Perception that sensible sense and intelligible sense belong originarily together at the level of the lived body.  We are able to intend the meaning of worldly situations (Husserl\u2019s Sinngebung) only insofar as we are responsive in an embodied way to the imperatives that are given in the sensible itself.  The intelligible lawfulness so characteristic of the Kantian imperative is thus shown to be grounded in a more fundamental unity of intelligible and sensible sense.  The second chapter follows Merleau-Ponty\u2019s later works, especially The Prose of the World and The Visible and the Invisible, showing how the sensibility that is inseparable from the imperative introduces important limitations to the universalizing tendencies of Kant\u2019s moral philosophy, drawing us back to the irreducible situatedness of real-life ethical reasoning.\n\tIn the third chapter I turn to the very different articulation of sense given by Gilles Deleuze, primarily in his Logic of Sense.  I show there that Merleau-Ponty\u2019s phenomenological conception of sense does not allow us to think the singularity of the imperative, the fact that the ethical command weighs on a me that cannot be grasped in terms of the generalities of my public identity.  This singularity corresponds broadly to the idea of dignity in Kant\u2019s moral philosophy.  I argue that Deleuze, who conceptualizes sense as an event, gives us the resources to think singularity and to understand what it entails for our ethical practice.\n\tFinally, I attempt in the fourth chapter to think these two sides of the imperative\u2014its demand for universality and its emphasis on singularity and dignity\u2014together in the idea of libidinal sense.  Calling on Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard\u2019s Libidinal Economy and, to a lesser extent, on Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s Anti-Oedipus, I show that these two apparently incompatible requirements of the imperative have a common source in the event of libidinal investment (cathexis).  In thus locating the source of the imperative in originary, libidinal sense, I hope both to shed some light on the irreducible complexity of our ethical being and to present a more humane, less moralizing version of the imperative than is typically articulated in moral philosophy.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [715], "author_name_tesi": "Lueck, Bryan ", "last_name_ssi": "Lueck", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Schmidt", "Charles Edward Scott", "Vincent M Colapietro", "Nancy A Tuana", "Jeffrey Nealon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Schmidt, Committee Chair", "Charles Edward Scott, Committee Chair", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Member", "Nancy A Tuana, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Nealon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["imperative", "sense", "Merleau-Ponty", "Deleuze", "Lyotard"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "AN ASSESSMENT OF DEMOCRATIC DELIBERATION IN UGANDA: A CASE STUDY OF THE FRAMING OF KEY POLITICAL ISSUES IN THE PRESS\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7407", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2121", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In public deliberation about Uganda\u2019s democratic future, citizens were engaged in animated debates concerning the type of political system and the mode of presidential succession that the country should embrace.

The poliovirus system has suggested that the fidelity of a viral RdRp can be targeted for viral attenuation and vaccine development. Most studies of Dengue non-structural protein 5 (DV NS5) have focused on cis-acting elements or qualitative determinants of polymerase function. The goal of this study was to acquire the first quantitative perspective of DV NS5 structure-function relationships.

Using Sin Nombre hantavirus (SNV) in deer mice as a model system and a combination of mark-recapture analysis and mathematical models, I explore how infectious diseases can affect individuals, populations and communities, and analyze population, community, and ecosystem level patterns in disease dynamics. I also explore the effect of infectious disease on evolutionary histories, specifically, how bacterial infection may have shaped mammalian hibernation patterns. I use a combination of statistical analysis of longterm data and mathematical models to understand observed ecological patterns and improve our ability to forecast dynamics. \n     Microparasites can have a number of effects on individuals, populations, and communities. I explore the effect of SNV on the deer mouse host and what effect this may have on the host population dynamics and persistence of the disease in the population. I find that SNV decreases survival of antibody positive male deer mice by 15.4\\%. This can affect both the host population dynamics, by leading to regulation of the host population, as well as the population-level patterns seen in SNV infection, by increasing the critical host density and making the chain of transmission more likely to be broken.\n     Since the host population dynamics can be affected by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as environmental forcing, disturbance, availability of resources, competition, and other food web interactions, these can all have strong influences on the persistence and spread of a pathogen in the host population. I quantitatively evaluate the proposed bottom-up trophic cascade hypothesis to explain the original SNV outbreak, using 15 years of data from Montana. I show that mouse population dynamics in Montana are strongly correlated to precipitation and temperature with a 0 to 5 month lag. These changing environmental conditions alter the carrying capacity of the environment, which can lead to delayed density dependence in prevalence of the virus (with a lag of up to 16 months or more) in the mouse population and intermittent crossing of the critical host density necessary for hantavirus endemicity. My work helps shed some light on the notoriously difficult to understand dynamics of the virus, such as seemingly inverse density dependence in prevalence and sporadic disappearance of the virus from local populations. Since there is no effective treatment or vaccine for HPS, the most effective strategy is to take preventative measures. This quantitative understanding of the lags between environmental conditions and prevalence of the virus may allow us advance warning (up to 20 months or more) of increased risk to humans.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [72], "author_name_tesi": "Luis, Angela D.", "last_name_ssi": "Luis", "middle_name_ssi": "D.", "first_name_ssi": "Angela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ottar N Bjornstad", "Ottar N Bjornstad", "Peter John Hudson", "Bryan Grenfell", "John Fricks", "Richard Douglass"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ottar N Bjornstad, Dissertation Advisor", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Chair", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Chair", "Bryan Grenfell, Committee Member", "John Fricks, Committee Member", "Richard Douglass, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sin Nombre virus", "hantavirus", "Peromyscus", "deer mice", "hibernation", "ecological cascade hypothesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Interpersonal Perception of Pathological Narcissism and Interpersonal Problems: A Social Relations Analysis", "id": "12162", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4336", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current study aimed to gain a better understanding of interpersonal perception associated with personality pathology.

Many studies have tried to identify changes in gene expression that are associated cocaine abuse (Chapter 1A); however, the goal of this dissertation research was to identify molecules that may play a role not only in cocaine abuse, but also in relapse-associated behaviors.  The central hypothesis of this research was that increases in drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior, which occur during periods of abstinence from cocaine self-administration, produce (or are caused by) differential regulation of the proteomic and gene expression profiles in brain regions associated with drug abuse.  Identification of these changes may help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of abstinence-induced behaviors and provide targets for therapeutic intervention.\n\nSpecific Aims:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Testing the hypothesis that enforced abstinence from cocaine self-administration is accompanied by protein expression changes in the mesolimbic system (Chapter 2). A large-scale discovery experiment was conducted using 2-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), to elucidate protein expression changes that occur during abstinence from cocaine self-administration in the medial prefrontal cortex.\n\nSpecific Aim 2:  Modify existing methods to isolate high-quality synaptosomes from brain tissue and examine the idea that changes occur in the expression of proteins associated with exocytosis and endocytosis at the synapse during periods of abstinence from cocaine self-administration (Chapter 3).  A directed study of protein expression was conducted on isolated synaptosomes to directly look at the effect of enforced abstinence on this sub-cellular compartment.  \n\nSpecific Aim 3: Testing the hypothesis that enforced abstinence from cocaine self-administration is accompanied by gene expression changes in the mesolimbic system (Chapter 4).  A whole-genome microarray analysis of the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens was conducted to identify changes in mRNA expression that result from cocaine self-administration followed by increasing periods of abstinence.\n\nOriginal Breakthroughs and Findings: Identified in these studies was a panel of changes that occur following cocaine self-administration and increasing periods of enforced abstinence.  Using a systems biology approach, the combined analysis of these changes reveals possible mechanisms by which relapse-associated behaviors incubate over periods of abstinence from cocaine.  Such mechanisms include changes in neuronal structure and synaptic plasticity, signal transduction (specifically MAPK, TNF, and calcium signaling), and changes in glial cell function.   Additionally, preliminary epigenetic analysis of identified changes in mRNA expression (Appendix) illuminates a possible mechanism by which persistent changes in gene and protein expression may occur.  Together, these data open the door for future examination of the functional effect of these changes, as well as providing possible targets for therapeutic intervention.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4072], "author_name_tesi": "Lull, Melinda Elaine", "last_name_ssi": "Lull", "middle_name_ssi": "Elaine", "first_name_ssi": "Melinda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kent Eugene Vrana", "Kent Eugene Vrana", "John Ellis", "Willard M Freeman, Ph D", "Andras Hajnal", "Bruce A Stanley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kent Eugene Vrana, Dissertation Advisor", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Chair", "John Ellis, Committee Member", "Willard M Freeman, Ph D, Committee Member", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member", "Bruce A Stanley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["systems biology", "self-administration", "abstinence", "cocaine", "proteomics", "microarray"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "miRNAs AS THERAPEUTICS TO TARGET CELL CYCLE PROGRESSION AND PROMOTE CELL DEATH IN CANCER CELLS ", "id": "15216arl189", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15216", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mature MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22 nt endogenous, non-coding RNA sequences that bind to the 3\u2019UTR of target genes and inhibit their translation.  miRNA expression is dysregulated in cancer, with their expression often being lost. Mutant p53 can modulate its oncogenic activities through miRNAs. miR-128-2 and miR-155 are examples of mutant p53 induced miRNAs that enable chemoresistance and metastasis respectively. On the other hand, miR-223, miR-130b, miR-27a and miR-205 are examples of tumor suppressor miRNAs inhibited by mutant p53 to promote various tumorigenic pathways. Restoring expression of tumor suppressor miRNAs such as let-7i, miR-34 and miR-16 has shown promising anti-tumor effects in preclinical models of cancer. In this study we hypothesized that a similar approach of restoring tumor suppressor miRNAs could be used to abrogate the oncogenic pathways activated by mutant p53, also known as p53 gain of function (GOF). Mutant p53 has been an attractive and promising therapeutic target for advanced stages of tumors. Yet, its tetrameric structure and multiple protein-protein interactions have made it a mostly undruggable target. Thus, there is continued interest in designing novel strategies to target mutant p53 and/or key GOF pathways. \nWe approached this study by designing and performing a cell-based high-throughput screen (HTS) to identify miRNAs that would selectively reduce proliferation of mutant p53 cells. Using isogenic HCT-116 cells differing in p53 status (p53+/+, p53-/- and mutant R175H) we screened a library of 2,754 miRNA mimics and identified 56 miRNAs that selectively reduced viability in R175H mutant p53 cells. Subsequent secondary assays performed to identify top candidates indicated miR-6883-5p and miR-3132 as the most promising miRNAs for further characterization. \nDetailed studies of miR-6883-5p led us to discover that the miRNA is part of a novel, uncharacterized family of four miRNAs whose expression is lost in CRC. Out of the four miRNAs in this family, we characterized the phenotypes and targets of miR-6883-5p and miR-149*. Both miRNAs were direct negative regulators of CDK4, CDK6, FOXM1, XIAP and BCLXL, proteins associated with control of proliferation and apoptosis in CRC cell lines. Combination studies of both miR-6883-5p and miR-149* with either irinotecan or 5-fluorouracil, showed promising synergy between miRNA and drug. Further mechanistic studies showed that downregulation of both the CDK4/6-FOXM1 axis and anti-apoptotic proteins BCLXL and XIAP are involved in the efficacy of the miRNA-drug combinations.\nThe second miRNA that we characterized was miR-3132. miR-3132 is a novel and potent miRNA with a broad therapeutic index.  It has shown anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in a diverse panel of cancer cell lines. Notably, miR-3132 induced expression of surface TRAIL and subsequent TRAIL-dependent apoptosis in all cancer lines tested. Treating cells with TRAIL sequestering antibody RIK2 completely blocked miR-3132-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Our study is the first evidence of a miRNA upregulating surface TRAIL and inducing TRAIL-dependent cell death. miR-3132-induced Type I interferon (IFN) signaling is a putative upstream mechanism of TRAIL upregulation as indicated by microarray analysis. Our ongoing studies are involved in characterizing the miR-3132 induced IFN response and the putative IFN-mediated TRAIL upregulation. We hypothesize that the direct binding of miR-3132 to Toll Like Receptors (likely, TLR6) is upstream of type I Interferon signaling and subsequent TRAIL induction observed in our system.\nWe are still working to establish the role of p53 (both p53+/+ and mutants) in studies for both miR-6883-5p and miR-3132. Our preliminary data indicate that p53 status could be important in miR-6883-5p-FOXM1 signaling axis. For miR-3132, initial studies show that p53 status could play a role in the processing of miR-3132 from its primary to mature form. \nIn summary, we have described a detailed approach to screen and identify potent miRNAs to target cell cycle proliferation and/or promote cell death in cancer cells. Our detailed studies on novel miRs -6883-5p and -3132 show that miRNA therapeutics are promising alternates to small molecules. Our discovery of miR-6883-5p has opened up a novel link to study cell cycle and circadian rhythm genes, which is demonstrating itself to be an important direction for treating cancer. Our seminal work on miR-3132 demonstrates a non-canonical role of miRNAs; the putative binding to Toll-like receptor, which in this case results in TRAIL-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16864], "author_name_tesi": "Lulla, Amriti R", "last_name_ssi": "Lulla", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Amriti", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Wafik S.

Cupola \u201cheat zone\u201d pyrolytic temperatures of 300-1550\u00b0C were appraised, with the focus on 900\u00b0C.  Briquettes with favorable strength were made with 86-92% anthracite fines, 2.3-8.6% lignin, 4.5% silicon metal powder, and 0.9% hydrolyzed collagen (gelatin) by mass.  Briquettes were pyrolyzed under a nitrogen atmosphere or a starved air condition to simulate a cupola pyrolytic heat zone, and then crushed after this pyrolysis so as to discern their unconfined compressive (UC) strength.  These tests mimicked key features of the crushing load that coke endures in a cupola.  After 30 minutes of 900\u00b0C pyrolysis, UC strength reached 2,200-3,000 kPa (320 to 440 psi), when these briquettes contained 4.5% softwood lignin or 2.3% hardwood lignin.  With \u2265 6.5% hardwood lignin, the UC strength after 900\u00b0C pyrolysis reached 6,000-6,500 kPa.  When no lignin was incorporated to the briquette, the UC strength after 900\u00b0C pyrolysis was 200 kPa.  Gelatin  quantity affected lignin heat zone strength, despite by itself losing strength around 300\u00b0C: 1.8% gelatin doubled the strength of 0.45% gelatin briquettes.  Lignin provided strength up to 1400\u00b0C. Moreover above 1100\u00b0C, silicon carbide nanowires greatly enhanced UC strength relative to lignin alone.  Briquettes gained strength from lignin fusing reactions that increased in rate with increasing temperature.  For example, at 900\u00b0C, maximum UC strength occurred within 2-3 minutes of pyrolysis.  From the UC strength vs. pyrolysis temperature/time, an Arrhenius plot was constructed, which exhibited activation energies of 26-28 kJ/mol.  Both the softwood and hardwood lignin briquettes exhibited the same activation energy, with the hardwood Arrhenius plot higher but parallel to that for softwood.  A manufacturing rationale for using bindered anthracite fines rather than large chunks of anthracite is to obtain a fast burning rate.  The results herein showed that the bindered briquettes burned at an equal rate as did coke when these were burned at 1100\u00b0C in air.  The briquettes also contained an energy density that was 38% higher by volume than that of coke.  FTIR characterizations of pyrolyzed lignin showed that as temperature increased, oxygen-containing functionality decreased.  Further, Raman spectra of 900\u00b0C lignin and ambient coke (commercially pyrolyzed bituminous coal) showed almost identical responses to one another, with each exhibiting both the graphitic, G, and first disorder, D, bands.  Harnessing these high temperature pyrolytic lignin fusing reactions creates a valuable foundry coke substitute for the future, as well as large scale applications for otherwise underutilized industrial streams of lignin.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7014], "author_name_tesi": "Lumadue, Matthew Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Lumadue", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lignin", "Coke", "Pyrolysis", "Binder", "Strength", "Cupola"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE HUMAN POTENTIAL:\n\nTHE CAREER OF AN IDEA IN THE UNITED STATES\n\nDURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\n", "id": "10451", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4463", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Human Potential Movement of the 1960s and 1970s was an expression of a broad cultural trend within American middle-class of the mid-late twentieth century. This broad cultural trend, containing both secular and religious dimensions, represented an effort to promote greater human autonomy and personal authenticity in a wide variety of social relations.  It developed in response to prevalent concerns over the supposed \u201cdiminishment of the self\u201d within the American middle-class during the Cold War.\n\nThose who gave voice to such concerns in the 1950s included influential social critics and cultural critics.  Those who recommended solutions included humanistic psychologists and alternative religious theorists.  The social critics, such as William H. Whyte, Jr., David Riesman, and C. Wright Mills, argued that the rise of dominating institutions of power, such as large American corporations and universities, created environments that crushed, or warped, human individuality and personal potential. The cultural critics, such as Dwight McDonald and Theodore Adorno, suggested that mass corporate cultural productions, such as movies, sports, and popular television shows, furthered this unfortunate trend by undermining western culture with the dissemination of cultural trash, or kitsch. These criticisms, furthermore, were disseminated to the public in a string of articles found in large-circulation, popular magazines, such as Life, Look, and Time, and were part of America\u2019s Cold War dialogue with itself. The humanistic psychologists, such as Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, and Rollo May therefore promoted methods, such as participatory business management techniques and encounter-group therapy, designed to free Americans from their social-psychological malaise.\n\nIn the early 1960s, entrepreneur Andrew Kay, of Non-Linear Systems, Inc., hired Abraham Maslow to help reorganize his company along lines consistent with the theories of participatory management; theories that would promote greater worker autonomy, while turning a profit for the company.  Such techniques, along with encounter-group therapy, became a trend in American business throughout the 1960s. The alternative religious theorizers, such as Alan Watts and Aldous Huxley, suggested that organized religious institutions were also at fault.  The dominant American churches, they charged, buried the spiritual potential of their supporters and they therefore promoted Asian religious practices, such as sitting-meditation and yoga, as practicable solutions.\n\nIn the early 1950s, entrepreneur Louis P. Gainesborough funded the American Academy of Asian Studies (AAAS) in San Francisco, which he created to foster East/West inter-cultural appreciation following World War II.  Under the direction of Alan Watts, Haridas Chaudhuri, and Friedrich Spiegelberg, however, the organization also sought to help their students out of the alleged spiritual quagmire which they believed typified American religious sensibilities. Two students of the AAAS, Michael Murphy and Richard Price, went on to create the Esalen Institute of Big Sur, CA, in 1962.  Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Esalen Institute became a sort-of clearinghouse for all things countercultural and it was here that psychology wed religion in the form of the Human Potential Movement.\n\nThe psycho-spiritual theorizers associated with Esalen Institute represent a veritable who\u2019s-who of the Human Potential Movement, which even came to influence the Episcopal Church in California during the 1960s.   From an intellectual historical standpoint, the strands of social influences derived from post-World War II social critics, cultural critics, humanistic psychologists, and alternative religious thinkers had far-reaching consequences for American lives toward the middle-end of the twentieth century.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4433], "author_name_tesi": "Lumish, Michael William", "last_name_ssi": "Lumish", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Greg Eghigian", "Gary Scott Cross", "William Pencak", "Mark Stewart Morrisson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Greg Eghigian, Committee Chair", "Gary Scott Cross, Committee Member", "William Pencak, Committee Member", "Mark Stewart Morrisson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["American History", "Cultural History", "the Human Potential Movement"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Evaluating the Success of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program: Refugee Resettlement Experiences in Chicago", "id": "15118axl209", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15118", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To be considered a refugee by international definition, one must be living outside of one\u2019s home country and unable or unwilling to return home. Having lost their citizenship, homes, rights, and livelihood, many refugees live in limbo for years following displacement in second (host) nations. There they have few legal rights and no pathway to citizenship. Acceptance for third country resettlement offers refugees a pathway out of this liminality. However, refugees are assigned to third country resettlement sites with limited input over location. Refugees selected for resettlement through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program  are brought to the U.S. and placed in housing and jobs by refugee resettlement agencies whose goal is to help them \u2018integrate\u2019 and achieve economic self-sufficiency. Though a fundamentally humanitarian act, resettlement is a difficult and challenging process for refugees who often arrive lacking language or employment skills, knowledge of their new communities, or support structures. \nIn this study, I examine the outcomes of refugees brought to Chicago through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, with particular attention to their spatial and economic trajectories. To do so, I employ a mixed methods, multiscalar, multidimensional approach. I conducted interviews with 62 refugees, predominately Bhutanese, Burmese, and Iraqi, and 55 stakeholders. I combined the findings from those interviews with analysis of individual level address (n=725) and employment data (n=865) for refugees resettled between 2008 and 2012 within Chicago.  Additionally, I employ a form of extended case study, incorporating my experiences as a case manager and program director.\nI observe significant differences in refugee resettlement trajectories by population. These differences can largely be explained by the interaction of pre-arrival characteristics and experiences of displacement, with the local context of resettlement. However, these factors do not fully explain divergent outcomes. I find that groups work to re-configure aspects of their previous lives, intentionally or otherwise through the prioritization of particular values, goals, and desires.

Based on findings, I propose a new model of the refugee resettlement process which incorporates the institutional, temporal and physical aspects of resettlement as well as the central factors which explain individual resettlement pathways and outcomes. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16782], "author_name_tesi": "Lumley-Sapanski, Audrey Jane", "last_name_ssi": "Lumley-Sapanski", "middle_name_ssi": "Jane", "first_name_ssi": "Audrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Stiles Fowler", "Christopher Stiles Fowler", "Roger Michael Downs", "Stephen Augustus Matthews", "Barrett Alan Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Stiles Fowler, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Stiles Fowler, Committee Chair", "Roger Michael Downs, Committee Member", "Stephen Augustus Matthews, Committee Member", "Barrett Alan Lee, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Refugees", "Urban Studies", "Integration", "Forced Migration", "Race and ethnicity"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "BLACK EAST ST.

This investigation adds to the literature the border region concept, black people\u2019s pivotal relation to real estate politician-businessmen whose politics and economic policies proved disastrous to city residents, and the importance of patronage and black machine politics.  It examines the African American urban experience in context of continuous waves of black migrations, urbanization, industrialization, progressive era politics, the Great Depression, and the World Wars.  Though black East St. Louisans, between the 1890s and the 1920s, encountered increasing segregation, discrimination, and racial violence, they experienced, not a nadir, but much ferment, building a rich institutional culture, entering the urban industrial economy in significant numbers, undergoing class differentiation, and engaging in a wide range of political and social actions, including electoral politics to secure patronage and win political seats in city and county governments.  Black townspeople saw their nascent independent black political machine, but not their community, destroyed during the infamous 1917 \u201crace riots,\u201d which until this dissertation had been the sole topic of black history in pre-World War II East St. Louis.  Black residents continued with their political and social actions after the riots, but in a more sharply segregated environment.  Black East St. Louisans reentered city affairs, but only as junior partners when shifts in the national economy and politics occurred during the Great Depression and the Second World War.  Research employs primary source materials in local, regional, and national archives and libraries and, to a lesser extent, secondary literature and oral history.  This study concludes that black politics became acceptable to local white power holders when it no longer advanced independence from white political machines.

For those with moderate to severe acne the choice of treatments is limited. The most effective agent for the treatment of acne is isotretinoin (Accutane\u00ae, 13-cis Retinoic Acid (RA)). 13-cis RA has teratogenic effects and its use is highly regulated.   Although this drug has been used for over 25 years for acne, until recently little was known about its mechanism of action. Recent data indicate that the beneficial effect of isotretinoin in reducing sebum production is mediated by neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). NGAL is a 25 kDa secreted protein with antimicrobial properties which has been reported to affect cell survival. Patients treated with isotretinoin have increased expression of NGAL in their sebaceous glands where it is induces apoptosis leading to reduced production of sebum and improvement in acne. This protein may be an important target for the development of alternate therapies to 13-cis RA. \nThe studies in this thesis indicate that NGAL is an important innate immune protein in the resolution of acne. NGAL\u2019s increase on the skin surface of acne patients compared to the skin from normal volunteers has been identified through IHC and ELISA assays. Sebocytes treated with P. acnes have increased NGAL expression and secretion through a TLR-2 dependent mechanism. This increase in NGAL in acne skin and in sebocytes treated with P. acnes is much smaller than the increase observed with 13-cis RA treatment in patient skin and in cultured sebocytes. It has been determined that NGAL has antibacterial activity against P. acnes. The hypothesis is that the skin secretes NGAL as a response to the acne milieu but the levels are not sufficient to resolve acne. On the contary 13-cis RA increases NGAL to therapeutic levels that contribute to acne resolution. The current in vivo studies have revealed that significantly increased levels of NGAL can be recovered from patient skin as early as 1 week after beginning treatment with 13-cis RA and this increase correlates with a decrease in sebum and P. acnes levels on the skin. It has also been shown that NGAL and sebum levels plateau at approximately 8 weeks of treatment.  These data indicate that NGAL is an important early response protein for 13-cis RA mediated acne resolution and may represent a target for the design of therapeutic alternatives to 13-cis RA. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3532], "author_name_tesi": "Lumsden, Kimberly Ruth", "last_name_ssi": "Lumsden", "middle_name_ssi": "Ruth", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Diane M Thiboutot", "Diane M Thiboutot", "Judith S Bond", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Gary Alan Clawson", "James Robert Connor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Diane M Thiboutot, Dissertation Advisor", "Diane M Thiboutot, Committee Chair", "Judith S Bond, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Member", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Neutrophil Gelasinase-Associated Lipocalin", "Propionibacterium acnes", "Acne"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "MODELING THE AZTEC AGRICULTURAL WATERSCAPE OF LAKE\nXOCHIMILCO: A GIS ANALYSIS OF LAKEBED CHINAMPAS AND SETTLEMENT", "id": "22670", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10138", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation presents the first large, detailed spatial reconstruction of Aztec lakebed chinampas for a 1,010 hectare area of the former Lake Xochimilco lakebed. A general five stage model is proposed for the development and decline of the raised field socio-natural system in the southern Basin of Mexico. Widespread chinampas in the 18,000 ha Lake Chalco-Xochimilco were restricted to the relatively short-lived Aztec empire period especially between the mid-15th and early 16th centuries and were the result of top-down imperial planning, construction oversight, and hydraulic and facility management. Previous archaeological survey in 1969 and 1972 overwhelmingly dated lakebed occupation to the Late Aztec and Early Colonial periods (Aztec III-IV ceramics). The rapid inundation of Aztec drained fields after the Spanish conquest submerged most lakebed chinampas below the marshy southern lake surface. The relic fields were exposed for a short period in the 20th century after lake drainage completion and before post-WWII mechanized farming and urbanization obliterated the relic fields. By incorporating 1936-1941 air photos into a GIS, 23,094 relic beds and 400 mounds were manually digitized (traced) for the 1,010 ha study area. The built beds and mounds in the lake also defined complex canal networks and open pools within the system. The long, narrow beds averaged 3.75 meters wide and had an average length of 49.4 meters. The system land to water ratio was 1.07:1. Raised field experiments on the Andean high plain of Lake Titicaca and elsewhere demonstrate that narrow agricultural beds in 1:1 land to water systems benefit from both frost protection and intra-system nutrient replacement. Additionally, every plant on the narrow beds could have been irrigated by splash or scoop techniques from canoe bound farmers \u2013 an important benefit in the Basin of Mexico characterized by a long dry season, variable (temporal and spatial) summer monsoon rains, and summer droughts (can\u00edcula). In addition to many small lakebed habitation sites, larger lakebed wharves comprised of multiple mounds and platforms, open pools, and wider\niv\ncanals were identified in the air photos. These village-wharves probably formed the economic and social hub for the lakebed tenant farmers who were comprised of free peasants (macehualtin), serfs (mayeque), and slaves (tlacotin). Aztec chinampas built through land reclamation existed outside traditional corporate land holding capolli system and tenant farmers obtained rights of cultivation in return for approximately 50% of their agricultural production in rent payment to land grantees residing in Tenochtitlan (Calnek 1975). I estimate that approximately 2,525 farmers, administrators, dockworkers, merchants, and canoeists resided in the 1,010 ha study area (2.5 persons/ha) which included 2,000 full-time tenant farmers. Extrapolating these figures after adjusting for possible larger open pools within a 13,435 ha Chalco-Xochimilco Aztec drained field system, I calculate that after the consumption needs (dietary and non-dietary) of 30,000 lakebed residents were met, an annual 10,000,000 kg maize equivalent agricultural surplus, enough to feed 50,000 persons for a year, reached the storehouses and markets of Tlatelolco-Tenochtitlan. Also, this dissertation describes the temporal changes in agricultural bed width and land to water ratios resulting from a falling water table and canal in-filling accompanying Mexico City\u2019s growth and constant water demand. The land to water ratios increased from 1.07:1 (Aztec) to 2.75:1 in 1941 to 10.11 in 2012. Average bed area in the desiccating system has risen from 221m2 (Aztec) to 2,054m2 in 1941 to 62,799m2 in 2012. Modern chinampas are no longer self-sustaining systems as plastic tarps (invernaderos) provide frost protection, gas-powered pumps deliver reclaimed urban water (transferred to the system) to the plants on the large fields, and external organic and chemical inputs introduce nutrients and contaminants to the soils. The Xochimilco lakebed chinampas, while still highly productive, have transformed from an Aztec period waterscape to a desiccating farmscape with a wetland agriculture ancestry.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9829], "author_name_tesi": "Luna Golya, Gregory G", "last_name_ssi": "Luna Golya", "middle_name_ssi": "G", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Kenneth Gale Hirth", "David Lee Webster", "Matthew Bennett Restall", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Kirk Dow French"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Chair", "David Lee Webster, Committee Member", "Matthew Bennett Restall, Committee Member", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Member", "Kirk Dow French, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chinampas", "Lake Xochimilco", "raised fields", "GIS", "landscape archaeology", "Basin of Mexico"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Democracy and the Hacker Movement: Information Technologies and Political Action\n", "id": "7253", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "723", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In order to understand how technology may influence democratic practice, it is necessary to understand the values of those who are creating and shaping technology because those who create technology instill within those technologies particular values. Hackers comprise one group that has a significant role in the creation and shaping of technology. As the United States moves closer toward becoming an information society, the hacker is a figure that embodies both peril and promise. If technology is to revolutionize democratic practice, citizens must begin to use technology in revolutionary ways. Hackers, through acts of \u201chacktivism\u201d (politically motivated hacking), are using technology in inventive ways for political ends.\n\nLiving in an information society places constraints upon democratic practice. Because hackers are actively creating and shaping these constraints, they are likely to successfully negotiate these constraints.

These politically motivated hacks provide clues concerning the prospects for a technologically enhanced democratic society.   \n\nCore tenets of hacker collective identity are embedded within hacker texts, manifestoes, and hacked Web pages. \u201cThe Conscience of a Hacker,\u201d also known as the hacker manifesto, provided a rallying cry for the nascent movement and began to articulate a collective identity for hackers. Instances of hacktivism demonstrate how this collective identity is enacted. An examination of a politically motivated hack of the New York Times website reveals that the action served more to reinforce hacker collective identity and to confirm in/out group distinctions between hackers and the rest of society than to incite political action or foster support for their cause, fulfilling what Richard Gregg calls the \u201cego function of protest rhetoric.\u201d\n\nBecause hacker collective identity is at odds with essential attributes of democracy, hackers are not likely to create a more democratic society. This conclusion casts doubt on the potential for new technologies to revolutionize democratic practice but there is still hope for a technologically enhanced form of democracy through citizens using technology in unintended and inventive ways.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [717], "author_name_tesi": "Lunceford, Brett Lance", "last_name_ssi": "Lunceford", "middle_name_ssi": "Lance", "first_name_ssi": "Brett", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Walter Benson", "James Hogan", "Stephen Howard Browne", "Jorge Reina Schement"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Walter Benson, Committee Chair", "James Hogan, Committee Member", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Member", "Jorge Reina Schement, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["information society studies", "social movements", "computer hackers", "rhetorical criticism", "democratic practice", "protest action"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "TAXONOMIC STUDY OF THE GENUS PETROTILAPIA TREWAVAS 1935 (TELEOSTEI: CICHLIDAE) FROM LAKE MALA&#372;I, AFRICA\n\n", "id": "10045", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4425", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lake Mala&#373;i is the southernmost of the East African Rift Lakes and harbors about 850 cichlid species of which less than 500 have been scientifically described. One of the genera of cichlid fishes is Petrotilapia, which contains the largest mbuna (rock-dwelling cichlids) of Lake Mala&#373;i. Petrotilapia species are characterized by broad fleshy lips that are densely covered with slender teeth that are visible even when the mouth is closed. The members of the genus Petrotilapia have been divided into three groups namely the P. tridentiger, the P. genalutea, and the P. nigra group. The members of the P. tridentiger group are mainly found in the wave-washed upper rocky habitats, while those of the P. genalutea group inhabit the sediment-rich and intermediate habitats. The P. nigra group contains the largest number of species that inhabit the deeper rocky environments; this group prefers sediment-free rocky habitats. The three Petrotilapia groups are also distinguished by female melanin pattern. The pattern in females of the P. tridentiger group consists of indistinct vertical bars. Females of the P. genalutea group are characterized by two rows of spots on the flank, with the lower row consisting of a few large blotches. Females of P. nigra group often have a yellow or golden background color and a pattern consisting of two horizontal rows of dots of about the same size, with the ones of the mid-lateral row slightly larger. A pattern of, sometimes indistinct, vertical bars is superimposed on the two horizontal rows of dots.\nFive hundred and sixty newly collected Petrotilapia specimens were evaluated. New species of Petrotilapia were diagnosed and described by investigating morphological and meristic differences among populations. Petrotilapia populations were compared on the basis of locality, species complex (Petrotilapia tridentiger, Petrotilapia genalutea, or Petrotilapia nigra group), and markings (presence or absence of a black band in the dorsal fin). Differences in morphology were analyzed using sheared principal component analysis (SPCA) of the morphometric data and principal component analysis of the meristic data. Differences among species were illustrated by plotting the second sheared components of the morphometric data against the first principal component of the meristic data to maximize the amount of separation. If the mean multivariate scores of the clusters formed by the plots were significantly different along one axis independent of the other, a Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT) (p<0.05) was used to determine which clusters differed from each other. If the clusters were not significantly different along either axis, then a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), in conjunction with a Hottelling-Lawley trace was used (p<0.05). \nFive populations of Petrotilapia were found to be different from all other populations as well as from described species and were described as new species. Newly described species include Petrotilapia xanthos from Gallireya Reef, Petrotilapia mumboensis from Mumbo and Thumbi West islands, Petrotilapia pyroscelos from Mkanila Bay, Chizumulu Island, Petrotilapia flaviventris from Same Bay, Chizumulu Island, and Petrotilapia palingnathos from Mkanila Bay, Chizumulu Island; this brings the total to 10 described Petrotilapia species. I determined Petrotilapia \u2018ruarwe\u2019 from Kakusa and Mbowe Island as conspecifics with Petrotilapia microgalana from Nkhata Bay. There was no morphological difference between Petrotilapia sp. \u2018mumbo yellow\u2019 from Mumbo Island and P. nigra from neighboring Thumbi West Island. I, therefore, considered P. sp. \u2018mumbo yellow\u2019 a geographical variant of P. nigra.

However, few have addressed the relevance of such connections to the study of rhetorical and cultural history. The relationships between these three terms have great capacity to enrich rhetorical history. Given that language is important in shaping and expressing identities, it follows that historical attempts to form or control language use reveal much more than disagreements over linguistic matters: they reveal disagreements over cultural and political issues that language use affects. \n\nIn this dissertation, I use the triangulation between language, education, and national identity to examine the ways these issues affected each other during the extreme cultural upheavals of sixteenth-century England. Specifically, I ask: how did sixteenth-century English rhetoric interact with the development of English national identity? \n\nBy analyzing a series of English-language rhetorical treatises published in the sixteenth century, I construct three overall arguments about such interactions. First, that sixteenth-century rhetorical texts could be, and were, regarded as politically and culturally important by their contemporaries. The influence of rhetorical texts was seen to stretch far beyond the narrow educational boundaries of schoolrooms, and understanding that fact is crucial to understanding the texts themselves. Second, viewing a rhetoric text in its larger cultural context can reveal how what may appear to be simple instructions on writing actually guide readers toward specific behaviors. Ultimately, this guidance and shaping of readers encourages them to adopt and perform a specific national identity, embodying Englishness through their language and behavior. And third, the complex interrelationship between various facets of education and culture in the early modern period means that attempts to analyze one must necessarily take the others into account.\n\nUltimately, I encourage scholars of rhetoric (and of sixteenth-century rhetoric in particular) to become more deeply attuned to the important influences rhetorical education could have on the national identity of English speakers.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5073], "author_name_tesi": "Lundin, Rebecca Wilson", "last_name_ssi": "Lundin", "middle_name_ssi": "Wilson", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheryl Jean Glenn", "Cheryl Jean Glenn", "Stuart Selber", "Linda Woodbridge", "Dan Beaver"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheryl Jean Glenn, Dissertation Advisor", "Cheryl Jean Glenn, Committee Chair", "Stuart Selber, Committee Member", "Linda Woodbridge, Committee Member", "Dan Beaver, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thomas Wilson", "English language", "nationalism", "Renaissance", "rhetoric", "Angel Day"]}]
