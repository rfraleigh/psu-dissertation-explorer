Various studies have been conducted on the influence of meteorological initial and boundary conditions, PBL scheme, and emissions inventory, but there is no published comparative study. To address this need, we ran seven simulations of WRF-Chem, a regional online atmospheric chemistry model, with different emissions inventories, PBL parameterizations, and emissions inventories over the eastern United States within the Mid-Atlantic region.  The simulations were run for June 2016, which had multiple occurrences of high mixing ratios of observed ozone within the Mid-Atlantic region, particularly along the urbanized Interstate-95 Corridor. Special attention was paid to the 20% of days with the highest observed ozone.  Our analysis of the average standard deviation of 8-hour average ozone showed that ground-level ozone was most sensitive to the uncertainty in the initial and boundary conditions, with peaks in average standard deviation of 6 to 7 ppbv, while the emissions inventory uncertainty was of secondary importance with peaks in the average standard deviation of 4 to 5 ppbv. We compared the temporal average of the ensemble members and showed that the emissions inventory has the greatest influence on the average ozone mixing ratio. The ERA-interim generated more ozone than the other initial and boundary conditions ensembles, with ground-level peaks of 70 to 75 ppbv 8-hour averaged ozone. In comparison to the emissions inventory and the meteorological initial and boundary conditions, tropospheric ozone was less sensitive to the PBL scheme. The modeled sensitivity was enhanced aloft over Interstate 95, a source of ozone precursor emissions from mobile sources. Based on our data, we estimated that updating the emissions inventory yields an average decrease of 0.6 ppbv yr-1 in the mean absolute error, and an average decrease of 0.8 ppbv yr-1 in mean daily eight-hour ozone. There are many avenues for further research, including expanding the ensemble size. Our results suggest that the choice of initial and boundary conditions may affect other air quality studies.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15842], "author_name_tesi": "Thomas, Andrew M", "last_name_ssi": "Thomas", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amy Kathleen Huff", "Fuqing Zhang", "William Henry Brune"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Amy Kathleen Huff, Thesis Advisor", "Fuqing Zhang, Thesis Advisor", "William Henry Brune, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ozone", "air quality", "numerical modeling", "air quality model", "emission"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ARTFUL AWARENESS: SEEING WITH INTENTION\n\n", "id": "9108", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1458", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "What kind of abilities does one need to have in order to make art?

Many of these studies looked at traditional forest fragmentation where patches of mature forest are isolated by surrounding agricultural or suburban development. The development of shallow oil and gas resources in the Mid-Atlantic region causes a different type of fragmentation, where small well pads and access roads perforate a mature forest landscape. I looked at the effects of shallow oil and gas development on songbird abundance at both the local scale of individual wells and the landscape scale at differing well densities. I used fixed-radius point counts to survey songbirds at both scales. At the local scale I compared active well sites and paired control sites. At the landscape scale I compared 25 hectare sites with various levels of oil and gas development: control (0 wells/site), low well density (1-5 wells/site), and high well density (10-15 wells/site). I also took vegetation measurements within each site to determine if any habitat characteristics varied with the presence of wells. Closed canopy nesters, black-throated green warblers (Dendroica virens), blackburnian warblers (Dendroica fusca), ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla), and dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) were more abundant at control sites than at well sites at the local scale, and small-gap canopy nesters, understory nesters, American robins (Turdus migratorius), veerys (Catharus fuscescens), chestnut-sided warblers (Dendroica pensylvanica), and chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina) were more abundant at well sites than at control sites. At the landscape scale, cavity/snag nesters, small-gap canopy nesters, yellow-bellied sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus varius), and chipping sparrows increased with increasing well density. No nesting guild showed a negative response to wells at the landscape scale; however, red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus) abundance decreased with increasing well density. Species richness was higher at well sites than at control sites and increased with increasing well density. Avian communities differed between northern hardwood and oak forest types at control sites but were not significantly different when wells were present at both the local and landscape scale. Canopy cover and basal area were lowest 20 m from well sites at the local scale and decreased with increasing well density at the landscape scale. My results suggest that shallow oil and gas development altered mature forest habitat enough to significantly affect the abundance of species in all four nesting guilds examined in this study. The development creates small-gaps, regeneration and snags along roads and well pads which benefit many species; however, closed canopy nesting species lose essential core forest habitat. Also, shallow oil and gas well development in a mature forest landscape shifted the songbird community structure from unique to more similar regardless of forest type, suggesting biotic homogenization of songbird communities in areas of shallow oil and gas well development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1759], "author_name_tesi": "Thomas, Emily Hope", "last_name_ssi": "Thomas", "middle_name_ssi": "Hope", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham And Walter Tzilkowski", "Margaret Brittingham", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham And Walter Tzilkowski, Thesis Advisor", "Margaret Brittingham, Thesis Advisor", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fragmentation", "wells", "abundance", "songbirds", "Pennsylvania"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Water Stable Isotope Compositions at the Susquehanna-shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory", "id": "18718", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8853", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Patterns of water flow paths and time scales are important for nearly all environmental processes within in the Critical Zone.  To better understand these hydrological processes, a water stable isotope network was established at the Susquehanna-Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory to determine spatial and temporal dynamics of the hydrologic pools (precipitation, soil water, groundwater, and stream water) within the catchment.  Precipitation samples were collected automatically on an event basis in a clearing at the ridge top.  Soil water was collected every two weeks from four distinct transects at varying depths using suction cup lysimeters.  Groundwater at two locations in the stream riparian and stream water at the outlet were collected daily using automatic samplers.  Groundwater was also sampled every two weeks at 18 spatially distributed wells throughout the catchment.  Isotopic analysis was performed using LGR Isotope Analyzer following IAEA guidelines.  Results demonstrated the strong seasonality of precipitation isotope compositions and relative stationarity of groundwater isotopic compositions around the annual amount weighted isotope composition of precipitation suggesting groundwater is recharged by precipitation from each season, but that recharge mechanisms appear to differ during the year.  Results strongly demonstrate the ability of the soil profile to attenuate the seasonal isotopic composition of the input to a constant composition at a depth of 1.5 m suggesting the importance of hydrodynamic mixing of precipitation from different seasons.  Spatial patterns of soil water isotope profiles showed asymmetric snow melt dynamics between the north and south slopes.  Investigations of standard deviations of seasonal isotope profiles provided evidence of lateral preferential flow along soil horizon and soil-bedrock interfaces during the cold season and vertically through macropores during the warm season. \nInvestigation of the temporal dynamics of isotopic composition of precipitation yielded interesting results with respect to the influence of precipitation amounts and type on expected frequencies as well as the local meteoric water line.   A test case of a small subset of the precipitation record showed that incorporation of precipitation amounts to one-dimensional and two-dimensional kernel density estimates shifted the distribution substantially.  Full record unweighted and weighted kernel density estimates revealed that isotope compositions of precipitation were not symmetrical but skewed towards more depleted values for the four year monitoring period.  Monthly weighted kernel density estimates showed the importance of snow and tropical storm isotopic composition imposing a seasonal variation to the precipitation record.  Time integration of precipitation isotope compositions using an amount weighing procedure from event to seasonally amount weighted isotope compositions reduced the variability within the record yet preserved the seasonal cycle.  Construction of local meteoric water lines using event, daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonally amount weighted isotope composition time series demonstrated the significance of incorporation of precipitation amounts and averaging, with event and daily local meteoric water lines being statistically different from a local meteoric water line based on a precipitation amount weighted least squares regression.  These differences in local meteoric water lines become important when investigations of hydrologic pool interactions or other moderate to long-term hydrologic processes are in question.\nUtilizing the knowledge of earlier investigations, a robust comparison of two isotope incorporated atmospheric general circulation models against SSHCZO observations was performed with the goal of developing a fully distributed high-resolution data product predicting isotope compositions of precipitation for the Chesapeake Bay.  Comparisons were performed on daily, weekly, and monthly amount weighted values as well as monthly values from the Online Isotopes in Precipitation Calculator.  Linear regression results showed the best agreement between the monthly amount weighted values yet Nashe-Sutcliffe coefficients were only 0.2807 and 0.5792 for the global GCM and regional GCM respectively.  To determine the temporal structure of the time series, singular spectrum analysis (SSA) was performed on both GCM models and observations from SSHCZO.  SSA results demonstrated the importance of the annual cycle and its harmonics.  Reconstruction of weekly amount weighted isotope compositions for the regional model and SSHCZO recovered 43.44% and 51.78% amounts of the variance respectively suggesting much of the records contain inherent noise.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8699], "author_name_tesi": "Thomas, Evan Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Thomas", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Evan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["stable isotopes", "deuterium", "oxygen-18", "hydrology"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A MOLECULAR AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY ANALYSIS OF PLEIOTROPIC VERTEBRATE PHENOTYPES\n\n", "id": "10457", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2063", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mutations can contribute to the tissue overgrowth, disorganization and cellular atypia characteristic of cancer. This has guided current research in the direction of discovering new mutations in genes that govern the transformation of normal human cells into malignant ones. A mutagenesis screen in zebrafish recovered the mutant huli hutu (hht), whose pleiotropic, histological phenotype included the kind of tissue disorganization and nuclear atypia that can be seen with precancers and cancer. Identification of such mutations may contribute to our understanding of cytologic cancer phenotypes, and possibly produce additional models for aspects of human disease, including diseases of the eye and gastrointestinal tract. \nHigh resolution recombinant mapping using simple sequence repeat markers, generated five candidate genes: dimt1l, pola2, mier3, mrsp36, and cenph. Morpholino antisense knockdown, transcript analysis, and direct sequencing of complementary and genomic DNA revealed a nonsynonymous substitution in the C-terminal domain of Pola2, the B subunit of DNA polymerase alpha-primase. Immunohistochemical staining with cell proliferation markers BrdU and pH3 and TUNEL analysis suggests defects in proliferation, resulting in tissue-specific apoptosis. Ultrastructural analysis reveals a heterochromatin distribution consistent with cells responding to DNA damage. \nThe multiple-organ phenotype seen with hht inspired a genome-wide analysis of pleiotropic phenotypes observed in a collection of zebrafish insertional mutants. Knowledge of pleiotropic phenotypes caused by single gene deficiencies requires characterization extending beyond single organs. However, the proportion of vertebrate genes that function across tissue boundaries is unknown due to the paucity of sensitive and systematic studies in whole model organisms. To address this combinations of anatomical and histological phenotypes were evaluated in 97 zebrafish insertional mutants with known single gene deficiencies. Eleven mutants exhibited defects in a single organ. Eighty-three had a detectable phenotype in two or more organs, and 72 in three or more. The results suggest that a majority of developmental genes in vertebrates function in multiple tissues, and that phenotypic analyses that cross tissue boundaries are required for more comprehensive understanding of gene function. This type of analysis can be applied across other model systems to make functional annotation of metazoan genes more complete, and may be extended to drug discovery and assessment of environmental toxicity.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2045], "author_name_tesi": "Thomas, Georgia K", "last_name_ssi": "Thomas", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Georgia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Keith C Cheng", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Victor Alan Canfield", "Kent Eugene Vrana", "Keith C Cheng", "Sarah Bronson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Keith C Cheng, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Member", "Victor Alan Canfield, Committee Member", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Member", "Keith C Cheng, Committee Chair", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cancer", "gene identification", "mutagenesis screens", "pleiotropy", "zebrafish"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Don't Stop Till You Get Enough: Rebel Group War Aims and Conflict Resolution in Civil Wars", "id": "15203", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7593", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines whether government concessions to rebel group demands have an effect on conflict resolution in civil wars. This dissertation also examines whether the credibility of the rebel group being conceded to moderates the effect of these concessions on bargaining outcomes. Previous literature suggests rebel group demands, in general, are not credible. These arguments lead to the expectation that granting concessions to rebels will have no positive effect on the probability that a dyad will reach a peaceful settlement. From existing arguments we should expect, instead, that concessions to rebels will be followed by additional, escalated demands as rebels will attempt to gain as many concessions from their government opponents as possible. If all rebel demands are incredible and all rebels act on the same incentives to gain the greatest number of concessions in bargaining, concessions to these demands should always be negatively related to measures of conflict resolution such as the signing of peace agreements and the cessation of hostilities. Existing literature, however, does not consider that rebels, or some types of rebels, are actually responsive to government concessions. Absent from existing literature is any explanation as to why some rebel groups end their conflicts when their demands are met while others do not. I offer these explanations here.\n\nIn this project, I argue that such variation in settlement exists and can be explained by rebel group credibility. Specifically, more credible rebel groups are more likely to stick to their demands and stop fighting when they are offered concessions that address their aims. Non-credible groups, however, will not be responsive to concessions as their demands are not credible indicators of their requirements for conflict termination. Empirically, this means that rebel groups that follow through with their threats to continue fighting until their aims are met should sign agreements and stop fighting when governments offer them significant concessions on their demands. Groups whose aims are not credible should not be any more likely to agree to settlements when they are granted concessions addressing their demands.  I argue that the variation in the credibility of rebel groups (and their demands) can be explained by the presence of an internal mechanism binding these groups to their publicly announced demands. The argument in this dissertation explains why a civilian support base is this credibility mechanism for groups that have them. Variation in rebel credibility, then, can be attributed to the fact that not all rebel groups rely on a civilian support base to operate. \nIn Chapters 5 and 6, using original data on rebel group demands and government concessions in a sample of 108 African rebel-state dyads involved in civil conflicts from 1989-2009, I test this argument and find that rebel groups operating with support bases are in fact more likely to sign formal agreements and terminate their conflicts when their demands are met than are groups that do not rely on civilian supporters to mobilize resources. These results demonstrate that credibility is variable across types of rebel groups and furthermore that a key characteristic distinguishing credible rebels from non-credible rebels is readily discernible to governments. This dissertation is important because it demonstrates that for groups with support bases, publicly made demands represent credible information that can help dyads negotiate peace deals. Substantial concessions to these groups, then, should lead to conflicts with successful peaceful terminations.\n\nIn addition to examining how concessions to demands affect conflict settlement, this project also examines the types of rebel groups to which governments tend to offer concessions during negotiations. The results here show that although groups with support bases are more credible negotiating partners, governments are significantly more likely to negotiate with groups that do not have support bases. Together, these findings suggest a convincing alternative explanation for why civil conflict tends to be so difficult to settle. Overall, this project offers new arguments about the importance of demands, concessions and rebel credibility in intrastate conflict bargaining.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7528], "author_name_tesi": "Thomas, Jakana L", "last_name_ssi": "Thomas", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Jakana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas William Lemke", "Douglas William Lemke", "Glenn Hunter Palmer", "John Horgan", "Philip A Schrodt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas William Lemke, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas William Lemke, Committee Chair", "Glenn Hunter Palmer, Committee Member", "John Horgan, Committee Member", "Philip A Schrodt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["civil war", "intrastate war", "conflict resolution", "rebel war aims", "rebel demands", "government concessions"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Awe in Awesome:  A Multidisciplinary Approach Sheds Light on Education Abroad", "id": "13746klt16", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13746", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The connection between travel and tourism (T&T) and education/learning is presumed to be intuitive, yet the formal research and practical relationships have been shallow, leading to gaps in the literature and practice in the tourism industry and education abroad (EA).

Thus, the overall purpose of this dissertation was to examine interrelationships between T&T and education/learning in the EA context with the intent of contributing to theory and practice. \nThree separate studies, which built on the questions raised in each preceding study, addressed the study purpose. In Study 1 a survey was used to ascertain students\u2019 travel- and education-based motivations and expectations for their EA experience and to document students\u2019 motivation-expectation profiles. A principle axis factor analysis resulted in three motivation factors (i.e., \u201cLearn a Language,\u201d \u201cNew and Exciting Experiences,\u201d \u201cAcademic Stimulation and Achievement\u201d) and three expectation factors (\u201cTravel to Experience the Local,\u201d \u201cFree Time and Social Weekends,\u201d \u201cInstructor and Classroom Experience\u201d). A K-means analysis presented a 3-cluster solution, i.e. three types of EA students. Follow-up ANOVAs indicated that significant differences existed between students who were motivated by and expected differing levels of fun, excitement, travel and educational aspects of EA. In Study 2 a constructivist grounded theory design was implemented to examine students\u2019 meaning making while on EA. Results demonstrated that students interpreted their EA experience through four meaning making structures: Novelty, Actually Being, Blending or Securing, and Living in a State of Awe. The Awe-in-Awesome Framework was proposed based on the results. Lastly, how students perceived and negotiated their student-tourist identity during EA was examined in study 3. Results indicated that students were either ambivalent or discomfited when faced with the denotative meanings of the word \u201ctourist.\u201d Students also invoked a form of reappropriation to navigate the student-tourist identity. \nIn summary, the results reinforced the notion that important and viable relationships exist between T&T and formal educational travel.

Research is needed to determine whether these patterns are population-specific; if populations vary in the ages of AS formation that are negatively and positively related to current or subsequent risk of dying, future comparisons of AS across populations will need to take this into account.  The implications that these findings have for future enamel defect research and for interpreting health in medieval Denmark are discussed. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5169], "author_name_tesi": "Thomas, Rebecca Ferrell", "last_name_ssi": "Thomas", "middle_name_ssi": "Ferrell", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James William Wood", "George Robert Milner", "Robert Schoen", "Alan Walker", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James William Wood, Committee Chair", "George Robert Milner, Committee Chair", "Robert Schoen, Committee Member", "Alan Walker, Committee Member", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["paleopathology", "microstructure", "Denmark", "dental anthropology", "enamel defects", "paleodemography", "paleoepidemiology", "survival analysis", "maximum likelihood estimation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "FROM RENEWABLE TO ALTERNATIVE: WASTE COAL AND\nTHE PENNSYLVANIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PORTFOLIO STANDARD\n\n\n", "id": "8571", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5313", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, state legislatures have begun to apply green classifications to energy sources in efforts to promote renewable energy.  As such, they must conduct environmental boundary work in order to draw lines (or establish borders) between those sources to promote and those sources to exclude.  The conceptual opposition between fossil and renewable fuels has typically driven these sorting activities.  Pennsylvania\u2019s Renewable Portfolio Standard is unusual in this regard.  Called the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS), this policy promotes at least three energy sources that are typically thought of as non-renewable: waste coal, coal mine methane, and coal gasification.  Since the public readily identifies these energy sources as \u2018fossil fuels\u2019, we can reasonably ask how policy makers overcame this categorical opposition.  \n\nThis thesis answers this question by examining how Pennsylvania lawmakers inserted waste coal into this renewable energy policy.  Analysis first assembles testifiers into discourse coalitions based on their asserted assumptions (or \u2018first principles\u2019) regarding the economy and the environment.  Next it demonstrates how stakeholders characterized the concrete situation at hand, namely the production of energy in Pennsylvania, and how they selectively problematized different domains of Pennsylvania\u2019s economy and the environment.  Third, it shows how stakeholders portrayed waste coal energy production and argued for its inclusion or exclusion in the policy.  Finally, the study examines how preexisting linguistic structures offered opportunities to stakeholders as they worked to ascribe meaning and significance to their representations of waste coal.\n\nIn doing so, this study shows how waste coal supporters successfully sidestepped the opposition between renewable and fossil fuels by splitting the domain of \u2018green\u2019 energy into two categories, \u2018clean\u2019 and \u2018renewable\u2019.  It also discusses the rhetorical border work that advocates enacted to justify this splitting.  Namely, they drew upon the ambiguous terms \u2018alternative\u2019 and \u2018clean\u2019 to argue that waste coal plants \u2018clean up\u2019 abandoned gob piles and produce \u2018cleaner\u2019 energy \u2018than\u2019 traditional coal plants. \n\nThe results of this thesis are relevant beyond Pennsylvania\u2019s borders.  The study discusses how arguments used to justify the promotion of waste coal may be used to justify the promotion of other energy sources, and how the label \u2018clean energy\u2019 can be applied to fossil fuels.  Further, the study shows how metaphors are effective rhetorical devices to justify the redefinition of categories and the reshaping of boundaries.  Also, analysis demonstrates how publicly salient notions like \u2018clean\u2019 and \u2018renewable\u2019 can place limits on lawmakers as they work to associate themselves with environmental initiatives.  Lastly this research demonstrates how the rhetoric of ecological modernization can be adopted to justify the promotion of fossil fuels with the context of green energy policies.  \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5290], "author_name_tesi": "Thomas, Robert Roy", "last_name_ssi": "Thomas", "middle_name_ssi": "Roy", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leland Luther Glenna"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leland Luther Glenna, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["classifications", "categories", "naming", "rhetoric", "renewable portfolio standard", "metaphor", "ecological modernization", "clean energy", "waste coal", "coal", "alternative energy", "renewable energy", "discourse analysis", "boundaries"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Exploring the Relationships between High School Racial Composition and Long-Term Educational Outcomes", "id": "13502tlt215", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13502", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Prior work has suggested that attending predominately White high schools rather than predominately minority high schools is advantageous for one\u2019s educational aspirations and attainment, especially for racial/ethnic minority students. Cited reasons for this include predominately White schools having stable faculties and providing prerequisite classes for selective college acceptance and an environment where students are pushed to develop realistic educational goals. However, there is a smaller body of literature that emphasizes that because racial/ethnic minority students often have higher pro-school attitudes and college aspirations relative to Whites, attending predominately minority high schools can be advantageous for all high school students\u2019 college aspirations, especially racial/ethnic minority students. However, there are two, broad limitations with previous research. First, there is no study that has examined the association between high school racial composition (proportion of White or non-White students) and educational aspirations and attainment for the same cohort from the time they are in high school to possible college completion as young adults. Second, because most previous work often dichotomizes high school racial composition into predominately White schools or predominately minority schools, there is little knowledge of how attending more diverse schools with either predominate White or non-White student bodies may be associated with high school students\u2019 educational aspirations and attainment. Therefore, the first objective of this study is to examine the association between attending racially isolated White, diverse White, diverse minority, or racially isolated minority high schools and students\u2019 educational aspirations and attainment. The second objective is to examine how these associations vary by students\u2019 racial/ethnic backgrounds. To do this, this study uses the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N=4474) to estimate a series of OLS and logistic regression models predicting educational aspirations, high school completion, college attendance and college completion.

Over the last few decades RIAs have increased in size, number, as well as degree of integration.  One of the results of this expansion is that a majority of world trade is now structured by these institutional arrangements making the analysis of compliance and disputes within RIAs both timely and pertinent.  Studies that have empirically evaluated the dispute record of actors within RIAs have focused primarily on disputes in the European Union (EU).  While insightful the findings of these studies cannot be extended to all RIAs given the variations that exist across RIAs and the depth of integration unique to the EU.  Given that, in this dissertation I expand the analysis of noncompliance by assessing the factors that influence disputes in three distinct RIAs: the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Andean Community (AC), and the European Union (EU).  \n     With respect to NAFTA I show how perceptions about legal strength influences an industries decision to initiate a dispute through NAFTA Chapter 19 appealing the ruling made against them in a member state.  As it relates to the AC I show how domestic political incentives to renege on international commitment as well as institutional constraints influences a leaders decision to challenge the General Secretariat and take a case before the Andean Court of Justice (ACJ) for final review.  And finally in the EU I go beyond past studies and use an original data set to show how directive specific attributes influences the likelihood of dispute.  \n     In general, the argument and findings throughout this dissertation document an important link between domestic politics and the international political economy.  Across all RIAs domestic constraints play some role in the decision making concerning dispute. Furthermore this dissertation offers important lessons concerning international cooperation in general and noncompliance in particular.  It shows that the decision to pursue an international dispute is non random.  These decisions are actually systematic and well thought out indicating that leaders and industries think and behave like rational actors when contemplating noncompliance with international expectations.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4342], "author_name_tesi": "Thomas , Martha Salome", "last_name_ssi": "Thomas ", "middle_name_ssi": "Salome", "first_name_ssi": "Martha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas William Lemke", "Douglas William Lemke", "Quan Li", "Lee Ann Banaszak", "David Scott Bennett Jr.", "Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Clare"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas William Lemke, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas William Lemke, Committee Chair", "Quan Li, Committee Member", "Lee Ann Banaszak, Committee Member", "David Scott Bennett Jr., Committee Member", "Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Clare, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Trade Disputes", "Trade", "Regional Integration Agreements", "Domestic Politics"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Intramolecular Isotopic Variation in Acetate from Soils and Sediments", "id": "8978", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5123", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The stable isotopes of carbon are heterogeneously distributed within natural organic compounds.  This heterogeneity presents an opportunity to probe natural processes because intramolecular isotopic distributions may contain evidence related to the natural formation and fate of organic matter.  This thesis concerns the measurement and interpretation of intramolecular isotopic variation in acetate, a key intermediate in anaerobic metabolism, from soils and sediments.  \nThe first chapter in this thesis introduces the processes that convert organic matter into gaseous products, methane and carbon dioxide.  It also introduces the use of stable isotopic analyses to follow carbon flow in anaerobic sediments and soils.  This chapter outlines the differences between organic matter burial in soils and sediments to frame the consequential nature of carbon cycling in both terrestrial and marine systems.  Since two of the largest reservoirs of potentially labile carbon today are found in the deep organic rich soils of northern peatlands and the vast marine reservoir of dissolved organic carbon.  The isotopic tools we will apply in subsequent chapters relate specifically to understanding and interpreting the isotopic content of dissolved compounds in these two important reservoirs.\nThe second chapter presents an amended method for the intramolecular analysis of acetate.  Following on the heels of work by Dias et al., (2002) at Penn State, we have adapted their pyrolytic conditions for use with direct aqueous injection of acidified samples.  This work also presents the use of a lyophilization preconcentration technique for dilute porewater samples.  It represents a novel advance because it eliminates the need for extraction and significantly reduces sample volume requirements of prior techniques.  \n\tThe third chapter presents the results from an incubation experiment with an acetoclastic methanogen in which the exchange of the acetate carboxyl carbon with DIC is evident.  The exchange is rapid and may also be associated with an equilibrium isotopic effect at stationary phase growth of the methanogen.  Furthermore, we believe this exchange is analogous to the exchange observed by other authors for the phenol carboxylic acid carboxyl group and DIC.  The existence of carboxyl-DIC exchange in nature would have important consequences and one of those might be the alteration of DOC isotopic content via exchange processes.  We hypothesize about the role of this process in nature and outline a case for the exchange process as one piece that may help explain the current paradoxically old age of deep marine DOC.\n\tThe fourth chapter presents the application of a reverse tracer technique for the estimation of the time to peeper equilibrium in sediments and soils.  We have designed and constructed a peeper apparatus that allows for the repeated deployment and sampling in reproducible locations.  Furthermore, we present the use of a conservative tracer in peeper cell deployments as a means to both estimate the rate of diffusion and to correct all measured values for the extent of equilibrium.  \n\tThe fifth chapter is devoted to the use of the peepers described in chapter four along with isotopic analyses of gases and acetate.  This chapter presents a time-series of pH and isotopic measurements from Bear Meadows, and acidic wetland in central Pennsylvania.  The intramolecular acetate isotopic analyses support the role of autotrophic acetogens in producing as much as 30% of the acetate in porewaters.  These analyses also present the possibility that isotopic estimates of the pathway of methane formation may be unable to distinguish between acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis.  The observation that as much as 1/3 of the acetate could be derived from carbon dioxide means that nearly every carbon atom product of fermentation must go through the acetate pool.  We hypothesize about the fate of the acetate production in acidic wetlands as an electron donor for the reduction of fulvic and humic acids in the peat catotelm.  The potential ecological consequence of acetate production in acidic wetlands may be to reduce DOC to an amorphous particulate peat matrix that is relatively hydrophobic and helps produce a uniquely hydrophobic peat associated with sphagnum moss.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5096], "author_name_tesi": "Thomas IV, Randal  Burton", "last_name_ssi": "Thomas IV", "middle_name_ssi": "Burton", "first_name_ssi": "Randal ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Allan Arthur", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Christopher Howard House", "Katherine Haines Freeman", "Jennifer Macalady", "Robert David Shannon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Allan Arthur, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Chair", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Chair", "Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Member", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member", "Robert David Shannon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["intramolecular isotopic analysis", "wetland biogeochemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Mazzini's 'filosofia della musica': An Early Nineteenth-century Vision of Operatic Reform", "id": "14104", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7264", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although he is better known for his political writings and for heading a series of failed revolutions in mid-nineteenth century Italy, Giuseppe Mazzini also delved into the realm of music aesthetics with his treatise Filosofia della Musica. Ignoring technical considerations, Mazzini concerned himself with the broader social implications of opera, calling for operatic reform to combat Italian opera\u2019s materialism, its lack of unifying characteristics, and its privileging of melody over all other considerations. Mazzini frames his argument for the transformation of opera into a social art within the context of a larger Hegelian dialectic, which pits Italian music (which Mazzini associates with melody and the individual) against German music (which Mazzini associates with harmony and society). The resulting synthesis, according to Mazzini, would be a moral operatic drama, situating individuals within a greater society, and manifesting itself in a cosmopolitan or pan-European style of music. This thesis explores Mazzini\u2019s treatise, including the context of its creation, the biases it demonstrates, the philosophical issues it raises about the nature and role of music, and the individual details of Mazzini\u2019s vision of reform.\n\tMazzini held up Gaetano Donizetti as a model for his desired reforms, but made only vague allusions to moments that support his arguments. I have supplemented these with my own case studies drawn from Donizetti operas to illustrate Mazzini\u2019s ideas more clearly. Finally, I have reconsidered the content and implications of the addendum made to Filosofia in 1867, in which Mazzini replaced Donizetti with Meyerbeer as the model for opera as a social art. The investigation of this treatise sheds light on nineteenth-century operatic aesthetics, and presents a clearer picture of issues with which composers such as Verdi and Wagner wrestled when creating their masterworks.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7246], "author_name_tesi": "Thompson, Claire Allison", "last_name_ssi": "Thompson", "middle_name_ssi": "Allison", "first_name_ssi": "Claire", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Musicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Dowell Youmans"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Dowell Youmans, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Giuseppe Mazzini", "Gaetano Donizetti", "Gioachino Rossini", "opera", "nineteenth-century", "Italy"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "BUILDING EFFECTIVENESS IN MULTI-STATE DISASTER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: THE CASE OF THE CARIBBEAN DISASTER & EMERGENCY RESPONSE AGENCY\n\n", "id": "10473", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1364", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Each year thousands of people die in natural and man-made disasters because organizations in charge of mitigating the disasters are unable to effectively handle them. Building effective disaster management organizations is a complicated and challenging undertaking.  A good understanding of the multiple dimensions of disaster response and mitigation and their interrelationships is needed to build effective systems. This is particularly true in the case of the Caribbean region\u2019s Caribbean Disaster and Emergency Response Agency (CDERA).  CDERA is a network organization of the disaster management organizations multiple independent developing island nations with economies that are not diverse and a geography that predisposes them to natural hazards. \nThis dissertation presents the results of an empirical research on the effects of organizational form, organizational capacity, and organizational learning on the effectiveness of CDERA in its responses to disasters. The case study methodology was used to collect and interpret the information about CDERA\u2019s response and the factors affecting its effectiveness in two recent natural disasters: Hurricanes Ivan and Dean. The data were collected from twenty six interviews and archival information to answer the questions about organizational form, organizational capacity, and organizational learning. The model applied in this research project was developed on the basis of the general literature on disaster management and the literature on the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. This holistic approach utilized in this dissertation, is an important contribution to the literature on disaster management. This conceptualization differs from other approaches used to examine disaster management agencies and their deficiencies. Other approaches have examined the input variables in isolation and that resulted in a thwarted view of the organizational complexities of disaster management systems thereby limiting our understanding of how to fix the problems encountered in such systems.  The dissertation adds to the knowledge base on how to build organizational effectiveness. The analyses of interviews and archival information show that the complexities usually faced by disaster management organizations are further compounded in the CDERA environment. It is known that disaster response and mitigation require complex organizations. Hybrids of network and bureaucratic forms are necessary to properly plan for and respond to disasters. In addition, The CDERA case shows that the positions of its national affiliates in government bureaucracies are very important for them to have proper access to resources. It is known that organizational capacity is an important prerequisite for effectiveness in disaster management entities.  The findings of this study show that some specific capacity variables, such as technology, human resources, and technical expertise, are more important than others. The findings indicate that a set of organizational capacity variables that were not anticipated in the original model of this dissertation are also important. These variables are managing for results, integration and alignment of mission, vision and practice, transportation management, and business continuity (including succession management).  Organizational learning constitutes an important feedback loop. It helps to regulate the system by highlighting the gaps in capacity in particular. \nThe findings of the case study reaffirms that disaster management systems operate in complex environments, that the events these systems handle are unpredictable and complex, and that the systems must be equipped with proper resources and expertise to prevent these disasters from escalating rapidly.\nFurther studies are needed to determine whether each variable investigated and found to be important in this study is also important for other disaster management organizations. . This would involve an examination of other disaster management systems around the globe to uncover whether the same variables are significant predictors of effectiveness, or if there are other variables of importance.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1353], "author_name_tesi": "Thompson, Denise D.P.", "last_name_ssi": "Thompson", "middle_name_ssi": "D.P.", "first_name_ssi": "Denise", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Goktug Morcol", "Goktug Morcol", "Jeremy Plant", "Steven Ames Peterson", "Refik Culpan", "Dr Gary L Wamsley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Goktug Morcol, Dissertation Advisor", "Goktug Morcol, Committee Chair", "Jeremy Plant, Committee Member", "Steven Ames Peterson, Committee Member", "Refik Culpan, Committee Member", "Dr Gary L Wamsley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["emergency management", "organization theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "No More a Stranger: The Development of Academic Literacy in Adult English Language Learners in Community College\n", "id": "12066", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1578", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This purpose of this study was to identify how adult ELL community college students perceive their experience in the development of academic literacy, specifically academic writing, and to explore their perceptions of the factors, attitudes, and experiences that have facilitated their development of that level of academic literacy.  To address this purpose, a research study was developed using the Academic Literacies Model (Lea and Street, 1998) as the conceptual framework and situated cognition and Communities of Practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991) as the theoretical framework.   The research was conducted among adult ELLs at an urban community college in central Pennsylvania using a sequential explanatory mixed method research design.  This involved distributing 385 surveys in a range of college-level curricular classes and from the 385 surveys, capturing survey data from 30 adult ELLs.   Based on the findings of these 30 surveys, 11 adult ELLs were recruited to participate in two interviews of approximately one hour.

The findings also suggest that many participants had only a limited sense of what was expected in academic writing, referencing primarily Standard English and surface rhetorical features.  However, participants who had experience with discipline-specific writing genres and contexts had a well-defined sense of the nature of academic writing, to include skills and enculturation in the academic community but also the development of an identity in relationship to the discourse community\u2014all three of the perspectives posited by Lea and Street (1998).

The severity of this injury is often dismissed and is euphemized as a bell-ringer or \u201cding\u201d.  This lack of recognition leads to a gross under-reporting of MTBI in both the general population and in the sporting arena.  Mild brain injuries present as a difficult diagnosis for practitioners to manage.  The impairments that result subsequent to a concussion are due to a variety of neuropathological processes triggered by damage caused when the brain matter collides with the rough, ridged edges of the skull or due to the rapid acceleration/deceleration and/or rotation of the brain.  A lack of objective pathognomic signs of concussion means that a physician\u2019s diagnosis often rests on an athlete\u2019s honest report of subjective symptoms (e.g., headache, irritability, fatigue) that are also common in the non-concussed population and known to vary day to day.  As a result of the varying symptoms of concussions, currently employed tests used in concussion assessment and return to play decisions often give conflicting diagnoses and lack consistent results between testing methods.  This has led to skepticism about the utility of these methods.  At present, there are no evidence-based medical treatments for concussion that increase the speed or extent of recovery.  Therefore, the best approach to concussion management emphasizes early recognition of symptoms, removal from sports and cognitively demanding activities, and prevention of additional concussive injuries.  The underlying problem in concussion diagnosis is the application of current assessment methods; one-dimensional testing protocols have the potential to miss diagnosing a concussion if the tests are not sensitive to an individual\u2019s symptoms or pathology.  More advanced testing paradigms are needed that use a combination of testing modalities that are complementary to each other.  The aim of this research was to examine the pathological mechanisms of concussion from a multimodal perspective. The pathological mechanisms refer to the disorders in behavior and responses to stimuli that result following concussion. The multimodal perspective combined three testing methods (neuropsychological, postural and electroencephalographic) to ensure a global assessment; neuropsychological, postural under virtual reality conditions and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures.  \n\tFour main conclusions are drawn from our results.  First, neuropsychological symptoms resolve themselves more quickly than do postural or EEG changes.  Second, there is a clear mismatch between subjects\u2019 injury classifications when neuropsychological, postural and EEG testing paradigms are compared.  Third, the use of a testing paradigm that combines the most sensitive tests from each modality appears to provide a more effective system for diagnostic and return to play measurements than does any one method alone.   Lastly, applying low resolution electromagnetic tomographic assessment (LORETA) emerges as an effective tool for localizing cortical areas that have been negatively affected by the concussive injury.  The findings are discussed in relation to neural plasticity underlying functional changes and with respect to their clinical implications.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3130], "author_name_tesi": "Thompson, James Wylie Gaius", "last_name_ssi": "Thompson", "middle_name_ssi": "Wylie Gaius", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Semyon Slobounov", "Wayne Joseph Sebastianelli", "David E Conroy", "Danielle Symons Downs", "William Ray", "Robert Thatcher", "Karl Maxim Newell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Semyon Slobounov, Committee Chair", "Wayne Joseph Sebastianelli, Committee Member", "David E Conroy, Committee Member", "Danielle Symons Downs, Committee Member", "William Ray, Committee Member", "Robert Thatcher, Committee Member", "Karl Maxim Newell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["concussion", "posture", "MTBI", "brain injury", "EEG", "electroencephalography", "neuropsychology"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Victim-offender Characteristics on Sexual Assault Crimes", "id": "17394", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8691", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The proposed study hopes to establish typologies of sexual offenders and victims by examining variables that measure criminal histories, lifestyle, and circumstances surrounding each incident.

The air column is driven sinusoidally at a frequency of approximately 310 Hz, and the resultant acoustic-velocity amplitudes are less than 1.3 m/s at the velocity antinodes.  The axial component of fluid velocity is measured along the resonator axis, across the diameter, and as a function of acoustic amplitude.  The velocity signals are post-processed using the Fourier averaging method [Sonnenberger et al., Exp. Fluids 28, 217\u2013224 (2000)].  Equations are derived for determining the uncertainties in the resultant Fourier coefficients.  The time-averaged velocity-signal components are seen to be contaminated by significant errors due to the LDA/BSA system.  In order to avoid these errors, the Lagrangian streaming velocities are determined using the time-harmonic signal components and the arrival times of the velocity samples.  The observed Lagrangian streaming velocities are consistent with Rott\u2019s theory [N. Rott, J. Appl. Math. Phys.

Measurements are repeated with the resonator either wrapped in foam insulation, surrounded by a water jacket, or suspended within an air-filled tank, in order to vary the magnitude of the axial temperature gradient.  A significant correlation is observed between the temperature gradient and the behavior of the streaming: as the magnitude of the temperature gradient increases, the magnitude of the streaming decreases and the shape of the streaming cell becomes increasingly distorted.

The cooperation between these vehicles can facilitate achievement of objectives. Formation control is described here as controlling the position alignment among a group of autonomous vehicles. Formation control of multiple autonomous vehicles is particularly useful for environment searching, exploring, and mapping. Vehicles can search a given environment and adapt the formation as more information becomes available about the objectives and the environment. Further, the vehicles can explore potentially hazardous or remote areas to develop a map of the area. The vehicles can improve their total search area by aligning themselves in certain formations based on sensor limitations.\n     This thesis shows that a collection of fuzzy controllers, or fuzzy inference systems (FIS), can provide formation control of multiple homogeneous autonomous vehicles. A leader-follower approach is presented wherein the leader represents the reference vehicle for the formation, and the followers comprise the other vehicles in the group. Each vehicle is given an arbitrary initial direction and position in two dimensional spaces. A leader selection FIS determines the leader vehicle based on its direction and location relative to the desired formation line-of-travel. Once the leader vehicle is chosen, the objective is for each follower vehicle to converge to a desired position relative to the leader.\n     Under the assumption that the follower vehicles can perfectly sense the states (i.e. velocity, position for the scope of this problem) of the leader vehicle and that the leader has been selected, the fuzzy controller generates velocity commands for each follower while the leader traverses an arbitrary path. The advantage of this approach is that fuzzy controllers can be tuned for any set of possible vehicle states. Thus only the set of possible vehicle states are required to develop a comprehensive formation controller.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [674], "author_name_tesi": "Thomson, Brian Francis", "last_name_ssi": "Thomson", "middle_name_ssi": "Francis", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Randy Young"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Thesis Advisor", "Randy Young, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["autonomous vehicles", "leader selection", "fuzzy logic", "formation control"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Estimation and Reduction of Temporal Magnetic Field Fluctuations in Powered Magnets using Inductive and NMR Feedback Control", "id": "19934", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9023", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Powered magnets provide high magnetic fields that promise to significantly improve nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).  Higher fields increase NMR chemical shift resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while decreasing quadrupolar line broadening in solids. High resolution NMR is typically performed using superconducting magnets, which are currently limited to 24 Tesla.  Powered magnets can provide continuous fields up to 45 Tesla, significantly larger than that achievable by superconducting magnets.  This will dramatically expand opportunities in the areas of material science, chemistry, and biology.  However, temporal magnetic field fluctuations due to both the power supply and cooling water system currently render these magnets unsuitable for high resolution NMR.\n\nThe focus of this dissertation is to design, synthesize, and verify a feedback control system that reduces temporal field fluctuations so that powered magnets can be used for high resolution NMR.  Earlier studies have shown that feedback control using inductive measurements significantly reduces higher frequency field fluctuations associated with power supply ripple, but are limited in\ntheir ability to reduce lower frequency field fluctuations associated with variations in the cooling water system.  Conversely, feedback control using NMR measurements are more conducive to reducing lower frequency field fluctuations and less successful at higher frequencies.  Feedback control systems which use NMR measurements are often referred to as field-frequency locks (FFLs).  Earlier studies have shown that FFLs can estimate and reduce lower frequency field fluctuations in superconducting magnets, but have limited ability to do the same in powered magnets.  This dissertation investigates why such FFLs are limited in powered magnets, and\ndemonstrates some alternative methods for estimating lower frequency field fluctuations using NMR measurements in powered magnets.  A digital sampled-data feedback control design using field fluctuation estimates from NMR measurements is combined with feedback control using inductive measurements, forming a cascade feedback control design that reduces both lower and higher frequency field fluctuations.

Proper formation of skeletal muscle is a complex process involving specification of mesodermal progenitors to a muscle lineage, proliferation of myoblasts, and subsequent differentiation of the myoblasts into myofibers that produce the proteins required for muscle contraction.  Initiation of intracellular signaling cascades by growth factor binding to cell surface receptors precisely controls myogenesis.  Many factors are capable of disrupting muscle formation by interfering with various components involved in the process.  Ras is a membrane localized GTPase activated by many growth factors that is capable of inducing multiple signaling pathways, one of which is the conventional Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway.  Constitutively activated forms of Raf-kinase induce morphological transformation and are inhibitory to terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle cells in vitro.  The activation of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) by this kinase appears to be responsible for the cellular changes in phenotype.  However, the mechanism behind the block to differentiation is independent of this phenomenon and remains unidentified.  \nRaf-kinase exerts its effects by altering the expression of genes that may positively or negatively affect muscle fiber formation.  Several putative Raf-regulated genes were identified in a subtractive library screen of Raf-transduced myoblasts.  One of these genes was slightly downregulated in Raf-transformed avian myoblasts and was found to be highly homologous to a human Tax Responsive Element Binding Protein 107 (TaxREB107).  We pursued the possibility that chick TaxREB107 (cTaxREB107) may be involved in transcriptional regulation during myogenesis.  Our findings suggest a positive role for cTaxREB107 in the regulation of muscle gene expression during development of skeletal muscle.  Therefore, expression of cTaxREB107 may be impeded by Raf-kinase in order to negatively affect myogenesis.\nTo further extend our understanding of the block to myogenesis that is imposed by activated Raf-kinase, a stable myogenic cell line expressing an estrogen receptor-Raf chimeric protein was created.  Induction of high levels of Raf-activity was found to prevent fiber formation.  Interestingly, conditioned media from the Raf-inducible cell line inhibited fiber formation in the parental cell line, which suggests the possibility that a secreted factor is responsible for the block to differentiation of skeletal muscle cells.  Gene expression and activity of transforming growth factor b1 (TGFb1), which is a well-known inhibitor of the myogenic program, was found to be elevated in cells expressing high levels of activated Raf-kinase.  However, addition of a TGFb1 inhibitor did not restore muscle fiber formation in these cells.  These results suggest that although TGFb1 expression and activity is increased, the induction of this growth factor is not solely responsible for the block to myogenesis that is imposed by activated Raf-kinase.  \nAlthough cellular secretion of TGFb1 is not necessarily the cause of the Raf-imposed block to muscle formation, a TGFb-like factor is probably responsible for these effects.  Treatment of myoblasts with exogenous TGFb has been shown to suppress the accumulation of MEF2 to the nucleus.  MEF2 retention in the cytoplasm also occurs in muscle cells overexpressing activated Raf-kinase, thereby providing a link between TGFb-induced and Raf-induced myogenic inhibition.   Therefore, we chose to study the interaction of the TGFb and Raf-kinase pathways during myogenesis.  Our results indicate that Raf-kinase and TGFb similarly induce transcriptional activity of activator protein (AP-1).  Fra-2 and c-Jun were found to be the primary AP-1 DNA binding components in Raf-expressing myoblasts as well as those treated with TGFb.  However, Western blot analysis of both TGFb-treated and Raf-expressing myoblasts revealed that Fra-1 protein levels were elevated.  AP-1 tether proteins were used in order to analyze the effects of specific subunit composition of AP-1 on myogenesis.  c-Jun~Fra-1 and c-Jun~Fra-2 both suppressed muscle-specific reporter gene activity and were inhibitory to myofiber formation.  Furthermore, c-Jun~Fra~1 was found to directly affect MEF2 function, while c-Jun~Fra-2 was shown to be inhibitory to MRF activity.  This data provides evidence for specificity of AP-1 components in the regulation of subsets of genes during skeletal myogenesis.  \n\tIn conclusion, the data provided here suggests that Raf-kinase controls a complex pattern of gene expression.  While the exact mechanism behind the Raf-imposed block to myogenesis has not been completely elucidated, the results of this study indicate that Raf regulates expression of cTaxREB107, members of the TGFb superfamily and specific AP-1 subunits.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5753], "author_name_tesi": "Thomson, Season R.", "last_name_ssi": "Thomson", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Season", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sally E Johnson", "Avery August", "Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Roland M Leach", "Lorraine M Sordillo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sally E Johnson, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member", "Roland M Leach, Committee Member", "Lorraine M Sordillo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["skeletal myogenesis", "Raf-kinase", "TGF-beta", "AP-1", "transformation", "MAPK"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "FACTORS THAT RELATE TO THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF ISO 9000 IN EDUCATION: A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE US AND ENGLAND", "id": "6528", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6214", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Quality schooling has often been a subject of international concern. In all nation-states, government bodies and concerned communities are pressuring educational institutions to be more efficient as they prepare students for life and the labor market. In an effort to meet new government standards for federal funding, improve their performance, and obtain public trust, schools of all levels and in many countries are implementing the market-based ISO 9000 quality management system. ISO 9000 is an international quality management system created by the non-governmental organization International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nThe current literature surrounding ISO 9000 implementation in education indicates that the application of this quality management system to education is debatable, the implementation process is time consuming and difficult, and that the subject is understudied.

Instead of debating if ISO 9000 is appropriate for schools, this study identified which type of schools are appropriate for ISO 9000. Building on previous qualitative research, this study used quantitative survey research methods to identify factors that lead to a successful ISO 9000 implementation in educational institutions. Arguing from the perspective of world-polity theory and institutional isomorphism, since ISO 9000 is an international issue, the research was conducted as a comparative education study in two different countries, the US and England. The findings indicated that US and English institutions are very much the same with regard to ISO 9000, for example, they have a similar time to ISO 9000 registration, and are implementing ISO 9000 for similar reasons. In addition, several factors were identified that are related to a successful ISO 9000 registration, such as, the previous existence of an unwritten/unspoken quality management practice, and a highly regarded management representative.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6205], "author_name_tesi": "Thonhauser, Theresa Leaette", "last_name_ssi": "Thonhauser", "middle_name_ssi": "Leaette", "first_name_ssi": "Theresa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Lynn Passmore", "Ladislaus M Semali", "Cynthia Pellock", "Marie Gillette Speicher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Lynn Passmore, Committee Chair", "Ladislaus M Semali, Committee Chair", "Cynthia Pellock, Committee Member", "Marie Gillette Speicher, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ISO 9000", "education quality", "quality", "education", "comparative education", "USA", "England"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Pennsylvania Agricultural Producers' Perceptions, Barriers and Beliefs on Climate Change", "id": "14455kvt5218", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14455", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The change in climate can be felt through warmer temperatures, increased pests and more extreme precipitation.

Fundamental maneuvers are a class of maneuvers with design significance that are useful for testing and tuning flight control systems along with uncovering control law deficiencies. Aerobatic maneuvers are a class of aggressive and complex maneuvers with more operational significance. The process culminating in a unified approach to flight control includes various control allocation studies for redundant controls in trim and maneuvering flight, an efficient methodology to simulate non-piloted maneuvers with varying degrees of complexity, and the setup of an unconventional control inceptor configuration along with the use of a flight simulator to gather pilot feedback in order to improve the unified control architecture.\n        A flight path generation algorithm was developed to calculate control inceptor commands required for a rotorcraft in aerobatic maneuvers. This generalized algorithm was tailored to generate flight paths through optimization methods in order to satisfy target terminal position coordinates or to minimize the total time of a particular maneuver. Six aerobatic maneuvers were developed drawing inspiration from air combat maneuvers of fighter jet aircraft: Pitch-Back Turn (PBT), Combat Ascent Turn (CAT), Combat Descent Turn (CDT), Weaving Pull-up (WPU), Combat Break Turn (CBT), and Zoom and Boom (ZAB). These aerobatic maneuvers were simulated at moderate to high advance ratios while fundamental maneuvers of the compound including level accelerations/decelerations, climbs, descents, and turns were investigated across the entire flight envelope to evaluate controller performance. \n\tThe unified control system was developed to allow controls to seamlessly transition between manual and automatic allocations while ensuring that the axis of control for a particular inceptor remained constant with flight regime. An energy management system was developed in order to manage performance limits (namely power required) to promote carefree maneuvering and alleviate pilot workload. This system features limits on pilot commands and has additional logic for preserving control margins and limiting maximum speed in a dive. Nonlinear dynamic inversion (NLDI) is the framework of the unified controller, which incorporates primary and redundant controls. The inner loop of the NLDI controller regulates bank angle, pitch attitude, and yaw rate, while the outer loop command structure is varied (three modes).  One version uses an outer loop that commands velocities in the longitudinal and vertical axes (velocity mode), another commands longitudinal acceleration and vertical speed (acceleration mode), and the third commands longitudinal acceleration and transitions from velocity to acceleration command in the vertical axis (aerobatic mode). The flight envelope is discretized into low, cruise, and high speed flight regimes. The unified outer loop primary control effectors for the longitudinal and vertical axes (collective pitch, pitch attitude, and propeller pitch) vary depending on flight regime. A weighted pseudoinverse is used to phase either the collective or propeller pitch in/out of a redundant control role. The controllers were evaluated in Penn State\u2019s Rotorcraft Flight Simulator retaining the cyclic stick for vertical and lateral axis control along with pedal inceptors for yaw axis control. A throttle inceptor was used in place of the pilot\u2019s traditional left hand inceptor for longitudinal axis control. \n\tUltimately, a simple rigid body model of the aircraft was sufficient enough to design a controller with favorable performance and stability characteristics. This unified flight control system promoted a low enough pilot workload so that an untrained pilot (the author) was able to pilot maneuvers of varying complexity with ease. The framework of this unified system is generalized enough to be able to be applied to any rotorcraft with redundant controls. Minimum power propeller thrust shares ranged from 50% - 90% in high speed flight, while lift shares at high speeds tended towards 60% wing and 40% main rotor.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13553], "author_name_tesi": "Thorsen, Adam Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Thorsen", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Francis Horn", "Joseph Francis Horn", "Edward Smith", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Francis Horn, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Francis Horn, Committee Chair", "Edward Smith, Committee Member", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["compound", "rotorcraft", "aerobatic", "maneuvers", "unified control", "flight control", "redundant controls", "flight path generation", "trajectory optimization", "energy management"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Robust Optimization Models for Inventory Control Under Demand and Lead Time Uncertainty", "id": "22386", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10087", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Calculating optimal inventory ordering policies for systems under supply and demand uncertainty is essential in supply chain management in order to reduce the costs of holding inventory and backlogging orders while maintaining customer satisfaction.

We present a robust optimization model of this problem where the uncertainty is in the recourse matrix and is of column-wise nature.

In order to produce solutions which are not overly conservative, we investigate the performance of several types of uncertainty sets: budget uncertainty sets, central limit theorem-based uncertainty sets, and statistical hypothesis test-based uncertainty sets. Our numerical results indicate that our robust approach performs well compared to a sample average approximation approach in terms of stability\nmeasured by average cost, variance, and maximum cost.\nFinally, we develop models for inventory control under demand uncertainty where limited distributional information is available.

Secondary flows reduce the effectiveness of coolant injected along the vane endwalls as well as increase endwall heat transfer. Endwall contouring and strategic coolant injection can alter secondary flows to allow for improved endwall cooling, ultimately allowing for higher engine efficiencies. \nThis research initially focused on understanding the flow physics and subsequent cooling characteristics of an axisymmetric contoured vane passage. Results indicated that coolant injected from discrete holes provided lower effectiveness values on the contoured endwall in comparison to the flat endwalls of the planar and contoured passages. Coolant coverage from the upstream interface slot, however, was spread over a larger area of the contoured endwall in comparison to the flat endwalls as the interface slot was oriented closer to the plane of the contoured endwall. Seeking a fundamental understanding of interface slot coolant injection, further investigation into the effects of orientation and position of slot injection on secondary flows and the net heat flux experienced by a vane endwall was conducted. Results indicated that cooling effectiveness levels can be improved and the horseshoe vortex reduced in size by moving the interface slot closer to the passage inlet.  At large injection rates, reducing the slot orientation resulted in the removal of the horseshoe vortex and a subsequent reduction in passage secondary flows leading to a reduction in the average heat load experienced by the endwall.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [19], "author_name_tesi": "Thrift, Alan Albright", "last_name_ssi": "Thrift", "middle_name_ssi": "Albright", "first_name_ssi": "Alan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole", "Cengiz Camci", "Dr Eric Paterson", "Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole, Dissertation Advisor", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Member", "Dr Eric Paterson, Committee Member", "Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gas Turbine Cooling", "Endwall Contouring", "Film Cooling", "First Stage Vane"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING SOLVERS FOR HYBRID FINITE ELEMENT", "id": "14733pvt5141", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14733", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The focus of this work is on analyzing and developing nonlinear solvers for performing nonlinear structural analysis for large displacements in both elastic and inelastic cases.

Traditionally, Newton\u2019s method is employed for solving the system of nonlinear equations but it comes with certain challenges. The response determination becomes difficult when stiffness matrix becomes singular at turning point. It also requires the calculation of the inverse of a Hessian matrix, which is costly.

In North America, indigenous strains of SbDV are commonly infecting clover, but have not emerged as a threat to soybean production. Failure of SbDV to spread from clover to soybean was believed due to the fact that SbDV was poorly vectored by Aphis glycines, the only aphid that colonizes soybeans. However, there are multiple isolates of SbDV in the United States that are A. glycines-transmissible. In order to evaluate the risk of SbDV as an emerging plant pathogen capable of threatening soybean production, the clover isolate SbDV-MD6 was serially transmitted from clover to pea or soybean by different aphid vectors, Acrythosipon pisum, Nearctaphis bakeri, and A. glycines. Virus titer, symptom severity, and transmission efficiency were evaluated for each passage. Sequence analyses of SbDV-MD6 from both pea and soybean passages identified 6 non-synonymous consistent mutations in pea, compared to 11 and 16 mutations in soybean when transmitted by N. bakeri and A. glycines, respectively. The dN/dS analysis indicated that SbDV was under strong selective pressures in soybean, but not in pea. Significantly increasing virus titers with each sequential transmission supports this analysis. However, aphid transmission efficiency on soybean decreased with each passage from 53% to 0%, until the virus was no longer aphid transmissible. Although virus titers increased, serial transmission by A. glycines ceased after only one or two passages in soybean. Results indicated that the clover strain of SbDV-MD6 adapted readily to soybean by improved replication and/or movement, but selection for host adaptation created tradeoff factors decreasing host-to-host transmissibility by aphid vectors. This may explain the reason SbDV-MD6 could not be sequentially transmitted by certain aphid vectors. In addition, to explain the cellular regulation mechanism of the aphid vector transmission, two isolates, SbDV-MD16 and SbDV-MD6, were used in the transmission assays. Virus titers in different aphids were examined by RT-qPCR during each passage. All aphids are able to acquire the virus even after 2 days of non-host feeding. Virus titers in aphids that fed on infected soybeans decreased with each sequential transmission suggesting that the interaction between the virus and the aphid is a major bottleneck for the spread of SbDV-MD6. It is suggested that the most probable site is at the accessory saliva gland that is known for specific interaction between aphid and luteovirus in many systems. The selection on SbDV in soybean is probably leading to loss of specificity in this interaction. This may explain why clover strains of SbDV have not yet caused a severe epidemic in soybeans in N. America. Finally, SbDV-MD6 population diversity was examined in different host species. The diversity of SbDV populations increased slightly when at the beginning of shifting to a new host, and was relatively constant over serial passages. It also provided evidences that SbDV has the potential of expanding into a new niche and thus poses a threat of emerging as a new crop pathogen.

Mechanically remove trichomes significantly increase insect damage and growth development.\nSince trichomes contribute to plant resistance against herbivory by physical and chemical deterrents. To understand the role of different type trichome function in insect defense, the tomato trichome mutants were used to dissect trichome function in the defense. Study showed that hairless mutants had reduced number of twisted glandular trichomes (type I, IV, VI and VII) on leaf and stem, while woolly mutants had high density of non-glandular trichomes (type II, III and V) but only on the leaf. In both mutants, trichome densities were induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA), but the types of trichomes present were not affected by MeJA treatment.  Glandular trichomes contained high levels of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes.  High density of non-glandular trichome on leaves negatively influenced Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Colorado potato beetle, CPB) feeding behavior and growth, it stimulated H. zea growth.  High glandular trichome density impaired H. zea growth, but had no effect on CPB. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that glandular trichomes highly express protein inhibitors (PIN2), polyphenol oxidase (PPOF) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) when compared to non-glandular trichomes.  PIN2 in trichomes was highly induced by insect feeding in both mutant and wild type plants. \nAs defense signaling cascade is mediated by the synthesis, movement, and perception of jasmonate (JA) and its interaction with other plant hormones. In order to understand the interaction of ethylene and JA in regulating plant defense, the never ripe (Nr) mutant with a partial block of ethylene perception and the defenseless (def1) mutant with deficient in biosynthesis of JA were used to compare ethylene and JA interactions on tomato induced systemic defense. Proteinase inhibitor (PIN2) was used as marker gene to compare the plant response. Exogenous application of MeJA increased plants resistance to Helicoverpa zea and induced tomato defense gene expression and glandular trichome density on systemic leaves. Exogenous application of ethephon, an elicitor that releases ethylene, increased insect growth and interfere the tomato wounding response. Hormone assay showed ethephon treatment increase salicylic acid (SA) on the systemic leaves. These results showed that JA plays the main important role on systemic induced defense. Ethylene negatively regulated tomato systemic defense. This study also found that insect herbivory or MeJA treatment of the maternal generation induces transgenerational tomato defense in the offspring by increasing glandular trichome density and by priming defense genes that are regulated by plant phytohormone signals.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7634], "author_name_tesi": "Tian, Donglan ", "last_name_ssi": "Tian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Donglan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Felton", "Edwin George Rajotte", "John Frazier Tooker", "Yinong Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Felton, Dissertation Advisor", "Edwin George Rajotte, Committee Member", "John Frazier Tooker, Committee Member", "Yinong Yang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Helicoverpa zea", "Saliva", "Glucose oxidase", "Solanum lycopersicum", "Induced defense", "trichome"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Active Energy Harvesting on Piezoelectric Materials: Experimental Demonstration and Standalone Circuit Implementation\n", "id": "8664", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2146", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The need for wireless remote sensors is a fast increasing trend in many industries.\nThe sensors need to survive without maintenance for long periods of time or indefinitely,\nespecially for those placed in inaccessible locations.

In many cases, this variation has manifested in jumps in energy prices that were characterized by some persistence. From another perspective, energy price volatility has historically been noted and its effects on real economy debated. Historically, the importance of the shocks to the real economy has led them to be labeled as energy crises, as they were argued to have resulted in substantial changes in real prices that induced changes in behavior on the demand and supply sides of the many markets. The first chapter re-examines evidence of such a linkage by considering the transmission of energy prices into soft commodity prices. This nexus lies within the core of any real effects as softs include food-related commodities. The paper contributes to the literature by re-examining this linkage with a close eye on the role played by structural breaks within a time series and by considering the question of causality within a nonlinear framework. We find that functional form is a critical specification that conditions inference. Using linear forms, we find no cointegration between energy and food in the full sample under the maintained hypothesis that there are no structural breaks. Using linear nonparametric methods, we examine the series for structural breaks and find evidence of their importance. Based on subdivisions of the sample period as suggested by the structural break examination, within the structural break intervals identified we find evidence of cointegration. We next reconsider the issue within the context of nonlinear functional forms posing the question of whether evidence of structural breaks based on linear methods follow from underlying nonlinearity. Our results confirm the importance of functional form specification and we find evidence of nonlinear causality between energy and soft commodity prices. Empirical studies of transmission of energy prices into the real economy have been challenged by a number of significant specification issues that have resulted in substantial variation in inference drawn from results. Among these issues is the question of completeness of model specification. Chapter 2 examines the question of whether such models need to incorporate macroeconomic indicators. Clearly, macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and exchange rates play a role in the determination of energy and commodity prices, however, considerable specification uncertainty characterizes the question of which macro metrics to incorporate. We examine this issue from the perspective of weak exogeneity and find evidence that the parameter estimates associated with time series models that exclude consideration of macro indicators are not compromised by their exclusion. We examine this issue using Italian, U.S. grain, and Brent crude oil prices. While structural break, threshold and asymmetric cointegration models can allow us to characterize the linear and nonlinear dynamics in price transmission in level,it is of equal interest to differentiate across the type of price change to consider what might be thought of as typical price changes versus extreme price changes associated with either temporary structural change or mean reverting change as in what we call price jumps. In particular, while a \u201cstructural break\u201d is a permanent and long-run structural shift in DGM, a \u201cjump\u201d in a series represents a sudden temporary change in the pattern of the observations generated. Such change is temporary in a sense that its effect usually diminishes rather quickly (usually in relatively few periods). That means, intuitively, in relatively short time span after a jump, the price series will revert to its \u201cmean\u201d or its long-run smooth pattern which we call the trend of the series. In Chapter 3, we present a detailed discussion of the proper representation of such price jumps and show that there are price jumps in the real-world economic price series. The last chapter is concerned with the micro-structure specification to identify origins of price jumps that can not be generally characterized by the competitive market models. In particular we propose a rather general model of procurement process where imperfectly informed buyers search for and place bids to suppliers to fulfill procurement demand. We show that in this process, search cost, market structure and market condition are crucial factors in generating price jumps. Later in the simulation part we show that the model proposed in this paper can generate jumps that resemble those in the observed economic price series. We also integrate buyers\u2019 risk aversion in market conditions (though they are risk neutral in payoffs) through their personal belief and search costs. We show that buyers\u2019 risk aversion increases their sensitivity to market conditions,which exaggerates price movements with presence of supply shocks.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13124], "author_name_tesi": "Tian, Jiachuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Tian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiachuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert D.

To achieve high productivity, enzyme expression levels often need to be fine-tuned by engineering their ribosome binding sites (RBS) to efficiently catalyze biosynthesis process. However, when genes are expressed in an operon, their protein expression levels are strongly dependent on each other. While the current RBS engineering strategies often underestimate such dependency among gene expressions, we developed a context-dependent biophysical model to predict protein expression and to better design RBSs for multi-cistronic operons. We designed 120 bi-cistronic and tri-cistronic operons to experimentally validate our model. Our model has significantly improved the accuracy in predicting protein expression level and enabled us to design RBS sequence to coordinate protein production. After we have achieved high productivity by efficiently tuning enzyme expression, we found that the productivity and cell growth rate are often inversely correlated, due to competition for metabolic precursors and limited cellular resources. To solve this challenge, we engineered a sensor-circuit device that autonomously regulates the expression of a metabolic pathway in response to its load to balance cell growth and pathway productivity. Specifically, we utilized a newly discovered intracellular stress sensor that detects imbalances in glycolytic flux, and down-regulate gene expression. We show that this sensor increased the degradation rate of a targeted protein by 5-fold whenever a heterologous pathway over-consumes glycolytic metabolites. We then combined this sensor with a 2-regulator genetic circuit to create a modular sensor-circuit controller. We applied the sensor-circuit device to regulate the expression of a 3-enzyme terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. We found that the sensor-circuit device\u2019s control dynamics exhibited classic overshoot behavior; pathway expression increased 14-fold before settling at an optimal set-point. By perturbing the strength of the negative feedback loop, we showed that the sensor-circuit\u2019s output activity changed by 24-fold.

The essential trace metal zinc has been recently recognized as an important factor that is necessary for completion of progression trhough meiosis I. However, the role of zinc in controlling cumulus cell function, promoting oocyte quality and developmental potential is not known. Using in vitro and in vivo (dietary) zinc deficiency models, current study uncovers effects and mechanisms how zinc is involved in ovarian function and embryonic development. In granulosa cells, TPEN treatment altered cumulus transcripts, blocked cumulus expansion and suppressed expansion-related transcripts Has2, Ptx3, Ptgs2, and Tnfaip6 mRNA, by inhibiting SMAD2/3 signaling. In oocytes, a chelator N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine (TPEN) caused premature germinal vesicle breakdown and associated spindle defects even with the presence of a phosphodiesterase 3A inhibitor. Acute dietary zinc deficiency model confirmed the in vitro observations that oocytes failed to maintain meiotic arrest in the absence of zinc. Longer zinc depletion (10 days) completely blocked ovulation and compromised cumulus expansion. Additionally, preconception dietary zinc depletion (3-5 days) dramatically disrupted histone H3K4 trimethylation and global DNA methylation in oocytes and fertilized eggs, resulting in aberrant gene expression of repetitive elements and oocyte transcripts. Supplementation with the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine partially rescued the fertilization capability in zinc deficient oocytes by restoring histone methylation. Epigenetic defects in zinc deficient oocytes further impaired fertilization and preimplantation embryonic development.  Embryo transfer experiments further confirmed the impact of preconception zinc deficiency on implantation rate, placental and postimplantation development by excluding the effects of zinc deficiency on uterus function. Collectively, these studies show that zinc is an important factor required for regulating ovarian function and promoting oocyte quality and developmental potential, and also provides new insights to better understand the physiological aspects of zinc on female fertility. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8706], "author_name_tesi": "Tian, Xi ", "last_name_ssi": "Tian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Francisco Javier Diaz", "Francisco Javier Diaz", "Alan Leslie Johnson", "Paul Allen Bartell", "Robert Paulson", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Francisco Javier Diaz, Dissertation Advisor", "Francisco Javier Diaz, Committee Chair", "Alan Leslie Johnson, Committee Member", "Paul Allen Bartell, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["zinc", "ovary", "follicular development", "oocyte", "embryonic development", "mouse"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "COOPERATION AND INTERFERENCE IN WIRELESS NETWORKS", "id": "16924", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8359", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-01-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cooperation and interference are two distinct outcomes of the broadcast nature of the wireless medium. This dissertation investigates the interaction between cooperation and interference in wireless networks by studying information theoretical capacity limits of several simple wireless system models that characterizes the co-existence of cooperation and interference, to obtain design insights for future wireless networks. \n\nTo study optimal transmission schemes in a network where cooperation and interference co-exist, the fully connected Gaussian interference relay channel is first investigated. Achievable rates are obtained by designing a generalized compress-and-forward scheme and using nested lattice codes to accommodate the multi-user nature of the channel. A new sum-capacity outerbound is also derived using the concept of a potent relay. Numerical results demonstrate that upperbounds are tighter than the cut-set bound, and coincide with known achievable sum rates for many scenarios of interests. \n\nTo obtain further insights regarding the interaction between cooperation and interference, the Gaussian interference channel with an out-of-band relay is studied. Achievable strategies and outerbounds are investigated, and a constant gap capacity result is established. Insights regarding the design of transmission strategies for different interference level are obtained. An important observation from the constant gap result is that strong interference can be beneficial with the presence of an out-of-band relay. \n\nThe relaying schemes in the above models require the codebook information at the transmitters, which may not be accessible in large heterogeneous networks. Relay assisted multi-user network when the relay has no access to the codebooks used by the transmitters is then investigated. The relay is called oblivious for this reason. New capacity outerbounds are derived for the multiple-access relay channel and interference relay channel, and the optimality of the generalized compress-and-forward scheme is established. \n\nIn order to further understand cooperation and interference in multi-antenna systems and large wireless networks, the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) interference channel and X channel with relays are investigated. It is shown that with the help of relays, no channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter (CSIT) is required to achieve the optimal DoF, and the optimal DoF can be achieved in finite channel uses. It is shown that relays with full CSI are useful to steer the directions of the transmitted signals such that interference alignment can be achieved without CSIT.\n\nAnother important class of wireless networks where cooperation and interference co-exist is the multi-way relay channel, which also characterizes multi-cast communication in wireless networks. A new DoF upper bound for the general model is derived and is shown to be achievable using signal space alignment, multiple-access transmission or a combination of both. The DoF upper bound we have derived is the first tight upper bound for multi-way relay channel, and can be used to prove the optimality of several achievable DoF results obtained in previous works.

The second part (chapters 4 and 5) focuses on the synthesis of several organic/inorganic hybrid polymeric structures, such as diblock, star, brush and palm tree copolymers using living cationic polymerization and atom transfer radical polymerization techniques. The last part (chapters 6 and 7) is about exploratory synthesis of new polymeric structures with fluorinated side groups or cycloaliphatic side groups, and the study of new structure property relationships.\nChapter 1 is an outline of the fundamental concepts for polymeric materials, as such the history, important definitions, and some introductory material for to polymer chemistry and physics. The chemistry and applications of phopshazenes is also briefly described.\nChapter 2 is a description of the design, synthesis, and characterization of development of a new class of polymer drug conjugate materials based on biodegradable polyphosphazenes and antibiotics. Poly(dichlorophosphazene), synthesized by a thermal ring opening polymerization, was reacted with up to 25 mol% of ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin and three different amino acid esters (glycine, alanine, or phenylalanine) as cosubstituents via macromolecular substitutions. Nano/microfibers of several selected polymers were prepared by an electrospinning technique. The hydrolysis rate and the antibiotic release profile can be well tuned by either the polymer compositions, or the surface area monitored by a six week in vitro hydrolysis experiment. All the polymers gave a near-neutral hydrolysis environment with the pH ranging from 5.9\u20136.8. In an in vitro antibacterial test against E.coli, the antibacterial activity of the hydrolysis media was maintained as long as the polymer hydrolysis continued.\nChapter 3 is concerned with the development of a class of injectable and biodegradable hydrogels based on water-soluble poly(organophosphazenes) containing oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ethers and glycine ethyl esters. The hydrogels can be obtained by mixing \u03b1-cyclodextrin aqueous solution and poly(organophosphazenes) aqueous solution in various gelation rates depending on the polymer structures and the concentrations. The rheological measurements of the supramolecular hydrogels indicate a fast gelation process and flowable character under a large stain. The hydrogel system also exhibits structure-related reversible gel-sol transition properties at a certain temperature. The formation of a channel-type inclusion complex induced gelation mechanism was studied by DSC, TGA, 13C CP/MAS NMR and X-ray diffraction techniques. In vitro bovine serum albumin release of the hydrogel system was explored and the biodegradability of poly(organophosphazenes) was studied.\nChapter 4 outlines the preparation of a number of amphiphilic diblock copolymers based on poly[bis(trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene] (TFE) as the hydrophobic block and poly(dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate) (PDMAEMA) as the hydrophilic block. The TFE block was synthesized first by the controlled living cationic polymerization of a phosphoranimine, followed by replacement of all the chlorine atoms using sodium trifluoroethoxide. To allow for the growth of the PDMAEMA block, 3-azidopropyl-2-bromo-2-methylpropanoate, an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiator, was grafted onto the endcap of the TFE block via the \u2018click\u2019 reaction followed by the ATRP of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA). Once synthesized, micelles were formed by a standard method and their characteristics were examined using fluorescence techniques, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. The critical micelle concentrations of the diblock copolymers as determined by fluorescence techniques using pyrene as a hydrophobic probe were between 3.47 and 9.55mg/L, with the partition equilibrium constant of pyrene in these micelles ranging from 0.12\u00d7105-1.52\u00d7105. The diameters measured by dynamic light scattering were 100-142nm at 25oC with a narrow distribution, which were also confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.  \nChapter 5 is a report on the design and assembly of polyphosphazene materials based on the non-covalent \u201chost\u2013guest\u201d interactions either at the terminus of the polymeric main-chains or the pendant side-chains. The supramolecular interaction at the main chain terminus was used to produce amphiphilic palm-tree like pseudo-block copolymers via host-guest interactions between an adamantane end-functionalized polyphosphazene and a 4-armed \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD) initiated poly[poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacylate] branched-star type polymer. The formation of micelles of the obtained amphiphiles was analyzed by fluorescence technique, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The supramolecular interactions involving polymer side-chains were achieved between polyphosphazenes with \u03b2-CD pendant units and other polyphosphazene molecules with adamantyl moieties on the side-chains. These interactions worked as physical crosslinks which were responsible for the formation of a supramolecular hydrogel. The results of this work demonstrated the synthetic possibilities for these novel polymeric structures. These materials show potential for applications as smart drug delivery micro-vehicles, responsive hydrogels, and self-healing materials.\nChapter 6 is an investigation of the influence of bulky fluoroalkoxy side groups on the properties of polyphosphazenes. A new series of mixed-substituent high polymeric poly(fluoroalkoxyphosphazenes) containing trifluoroethoxy and branched fluoroalkoxy side groups was synthesized and characterized by NMR and GPC methods. These polymers contained 19\u201329 mol% of di-branched hexafluoropropoxy groups or 4mol% of tri-branched tert-perfluorobutoxy groups, which serve as regio-irregularities to reduce the macromolecular microcrystallinity. The structure\u2013property correlations of the polymers were then analyzed and interpreted by several techniques: specifically by the thermal behavior by DSC and TGA methods, the crystallinity by wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and the surface hydrophobicity/oleophobicity by contact angle measurements. Ultraviolet crosslinkable elastomers were prepared from the new polymers through the incorporation of 3mol% of 2-allylphenoxy and photo-irradiation. The mechanical properties and the elastomeric deformation\u2013recovery behavior were then monitored by varying the time of ultraviolet irradiation. Side reactions detected during the synthesis of the high polymers, such as side group exchange reactions and alpha-carbon attack, were analyzed via use of a cyclic trimer model system.\nChapter 7 is an outline of the exploratory synthesis of a new series of phosphazene model cyclic trimers and single- and mixed- substituent high polymers containing cyclic aliphatic rings, \u2013CnH2n-1 (where n = 4\u20138). The cylco-aliphatic side group containing phosphazenes expand the structural and property boundaries of phosphazene chemistry, and suggest additional approaches for studying slow macromolecular substitution reactions and substituent exchange reactions. Polymer structure\u2013property relationships are interpreted and correlated to glass transition temperatures, thermal decomposition temperatures, hydrophobicity, and membrane mechanical properties.  Films prepared from these polymers are low cost, tough and non-adhesive. They can be used in variety of applications especially where transparency is important.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10948], "author_name_tesi": "Tian, Zhicheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Tian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhicheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock", "Mike Hickner", "John V Badding", "Benjamin James Lear"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock, Dissertation Advisor", "Mike Hickner, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polymer Chemistry", "Organic Synthesis", "Polyphosphazenes", "Structure Property Correlations", "Biomaterials", "Elastomers"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Parallel Multivariate Slice Sampling\n\n\n", "id": "9151", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4290", "abstract_tesi": "Slice sampling provides an easily implemented method for constructing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm.

As the complexity of statistical models has increased and datasets have grown in size, it is critical to design computationally efficient MCMC sampling algorithms. Further, as MCMC algorithms are, by design, serial in nature, the efficient use of modern, parallel computing hardware is non-trivial. It is also important to develop 'off-the-shelf' or automated MCMC algorithms that require minimal user intervention to allow a more general user access to these methods without extensive knowledge of the optimal tuning parameters for either the MCMC algorithm or its implementation within a parallelized environment. These driving forces necessitate the development of efficient MCMC sampling techniques which can be decomposed and distributed across parallel architectures irrespective of the statistical model in question. Methods for parallelizing MCMC algorithms tend to focus on either parallelizing the evolution of a single Markov chain, or when these computations are not easily decomposed, employ multiple chains in a cooperative fashion. In this dissertation, we investigate three parallel sampling approaches. The first is an extension to the parallel multivariate slice sampler where sampling occurs in a transformed space to simultaneously reduce posterior autocorrelation in successive draws and facilitate an automated tuning procedure. The second approach is a parallelized single-chain Langevin-Hastings sampler where the gradient vector and Hessian matrix are simultaneously approximated when analytically intractable. The third approach is a parallelized multi-chain method of constructing an efficient interpolator for an expensive likelihood computation which can then be efficiently sampled using a single chain.

For each type of activity, youth were labeled as (a) non-participants, (b) amotivated and/or bored participants, or (c) motivated/interested participants at the beginning and end of eighth grade. Latent transition analysis was used to determine profiles of motivation and engagement within and across the four types of leisure activities. Five profiles were found for males, whereas six profiles were found for females.

For each activity, participants were labeled based on their level of participation (i.e., low; moderate; high), level of interest (i.e., low; moderate; high), and type of motivation (i.e., amotivation; extrinsic motivation; identified/intrinsic motivation). Engagement profiles then were determined separately for youth who participated in active leisure and youth who participated in social leisure. Males\u2019 active leisure was characterized by one engagement profile (Moderate Active: Engaged) whereas females\u2019 active leisure was characterized by three engagement profiles (Low Active: Mixed; Low Active: Engaged; Moderate Active: Engaged). All male active leisure participants and most female active leisure participants experienced identified/intrinsic motivation and interest. Compared to non-participants, active leisure participants had higher prevalence of lifetime and past-month cigarette use and lifetime sexual activity. Further, females who belonged to the  Low Active: Mixed profile had a higher probability of alcohol use, tobacco use, and sexual activity than females who belonged to the  other two profiles.  \nMales and females\u2019 social leisure was characterized by two engagement profiles (Moderate-Low Social: Mixed; Moderate High Social: Mixed). In contrast to active leisure, all youth who spent time in social leisure were amotivated but interested. Compared to non-participants, social leisure participants had higher prevalence of alcohol use, tobacco use, and sexual activity. There were not significant differences between the two social leisure profiles in terms of substance use, but youth who reported sexual activity were more likely to belong to the Moderate-Low Social: Mixed profile.  \n   These studies suggest that experiences within leisure activities such as level of engagement may moderate the relationship between leisure activity participation and health risk behaviors.

There are plays that fuse comedy and tragedy, or laughter and tears, but adaptation allows us to see how comedy can be transformed from tragedy, through changing perspectives and the distance or detachment created by time and culture. The adaptation and translation of bawdy humor represents a site of implicit censorship. New constraints, however, also bring new comic creativity and encourage different ways of thinking and speaking about what is supposed to be \u201cforbidden.\u201d The employment of specific local and provincial dialects has also become an important marker of the comic imaginary. Different dialectal strands that make up literary texts and film or stage productions offer a new perspective from which to look into the formation of identity at various levels. Further, when the translation of a comedy is adapted to be performed, what is involved is the intersection and collaboration of verbal and visual humor, as well as the dynamic between the character in a text and the role actualized by an actor on stage.

Determination of reaction pathways\nbetween organic surfaces and deposited metal/inorganic oxides has proven to be very\ndifficult in past years due to the inexact knowledge of the structure and nature of the\norganic surfaces. For this reason, self assembled monolayers (SAMs), which have a\nknown surface density, and can be functionalized with a variety of terminal groups, have\nbeen used as models for more difficult organic thin films. These layers are not only useful\nas models but are being developed as electronic devices themselves.\nThe work in this thesis is concentrated in two areas. In the first, a variety of\nmetals, including Ag, Au, Cu, Al, Ti, Ca, and Mg have been deposited onto a selfassembled\nmonolayer (SAM) with a methoxy terminal group, HS(CH2)16OCH3. These\nmetals were chosen because they are commonly used as metallic contacts in\nmicroelectronics and polymer light emitting diodes. Recent work has shown that the\ninteraction of deposited Al with a methoxy-terminated SAM is intermediate between the\n\u00a8CCH3 case, where Al penetrates to the Au/S interface, and the -COOH, -CO2CH3 and -\nOH cases, where Al interacts with the terminus. Thus, a methoxy terminated SAM is an\nideal monolayer in which to study how the nature of the metal\u00a8Corganic interaction can be\nchanged, and ultimately controlled, by the reactivity of the deposited metal atoms. In the\nsecond, the interaction of a molecular wire, 4-[4\u00a1\u00af-(phenylethynyl)-phenylethynyl]-\nbenzenethiol, which consists of three phenyl rings separated by C\u00a1\u00d4C bonds, with two common electronic contacts, Ti and Au, was studied. Studies of this kind are crucial\nsince a serious problem in molecular electronic technology is variation in device\nperformance which is believed to be caused by issues with metal contact formation.\nChapter 1 is an introductory chapter and is intended to give the reader an idea of\nthe importance of the research preformed in later chapters.

A collimated-beam batch UV (254 nm) apparatus was used.  The effects of added ascorbic acid (AA), tannic acid, and suspended solids on patulin degradation in 0.5% malic acid buffer were studied using Box-Behnken design. Results showed a first order degradation kinetics for patulin. The degradation rate constant (cm2/J) was not significantly affected by incident intensity (0.8-1.8 mJ/cm2) (p>0.05), buffer pH (3.0-3.6) (p>0.05) and initial concentration of patulin (0-1000 ppb) (p>0.05). Presence of tannic acid, (0-1 g/L) and suspended particles (0-100 NTU) significantly reduced the patulin degradation rate constant (p<0.05), while AA (0-100 mg/L) did not affect the reaction rate constant (p>0.05). \nThe second objective was to study the UV induced degradation of AA in 0.5% malic acid buffer (apple juice model system) and in apple juice. AA degradation occurred more rapidly in juice compared to 0.5% malic acid. Further studies demonstrated that UV degradation of AA in 0.5% malic acid was more rapid at higher UV dose levels and that reaction deviated from zero order. AA degradation did not change significantly (p>0.05) between pH 2.4 and 3.3, but increased as the pH of the buffer was raised from 3.3 to 5.5 (p<0.05). Increasing malic acid concentration between 0.1 and 1%, at a constant pH of 3.3, increased AA degradation (p<0.05) although there was no difference between 0.5 and 1.0 % (p>0.05). With increasing concentration of tannic acid in buffer, AA degradation rate decreased significantly (p<0.05), possibly due to competitive absorption of UV light. Addition of 10% sucrose to buffer showed no significant effects (p>0.05), but addition of 10% glucose decreased AA degradation (p<0.05). However, addition of 10% fructose increased AA degradation significantly (p<0.05), perhaps due to breakdown products of this sugars reacting with AA.  AA degradation in malic acid and in apple juice continued during storage in the absence of light. Post UV treatment degradation was more rapid at higher initial UV dose levels and at higher storage temperature. \nThe third objective was to understand the mechanism of UV induced AA degradation. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy studies demonstrated that ascorbate radicals formed in AA solutions in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and in malic acid buffer between pH 3.3 and 6.0. Lesser amounts of ascorbate radicals formed at lower pH levels and only trace amounts were detected at pH 3.3. Ascorbate radicals in UV treated AA solutions continued to form at higher rates than that for identically stored untreated AA solution. High pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS) analysis of UV treated samples demonstrated that as AA levels decreased, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) and 2, 3-diketogulonic acid (DKGA) levels increased. We propose that UV processing of AA leads to formation of ascorbate radical that leads to the formation of DHA, which further degrades into DKGA.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5364], "author_name_tesi": "Tikekar, Rohan Vijay", "last_name_ssi": "Tikekar", "middle_name_ssi": "Vijay", "first_name_ssi": "Rohan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luke F.

My corpus offers ways to create a more inclusive and just community so that queer and transgender individuals\u2019 identities and bodies are no longer violated by forced gender conformity and/or harassment. When supposedly sexed bodies are accepted as socially assigned constructs, people can present themselves through self-actualized and self-determined identities.

This dissertation is a study of how a cultural interface approach to digital new media was introduced, implemented, and understood by teachers, with a range of technology backgrounds, and their students in the real-world environments of three public high-school art education classes. Participants in this study examined digital new media artworks (art and technology), culture (values, beliefs, and assumptions), and everyday experiences (lives of students and teachers) as they converge in digitally mediated environments. The cultural interface approach through the convergence of new media art, culture and lived experience with new technologies offers opportunities for conversations that explore how new media technologies reconfigure culture as well as how culture creates the environment for the creation of new technologies. As technological change continues to occur, this approach offers art education an opportunity to be informed and take action both critically and responsibly in exploring the reconfiguration of education in empowering ways.\nFor this research, new media digital art is characterized as a cultural interface involving technology-experiences situated in communication processes, rather than in objects. This research [re]positioned new digital media art as a cultural interface. The term \u201ccultural interface,\u201d described by Lev Manovich (2001a) as \u201chuman-computer-cultural-interface\u201d (p. 70), has implications for how art education can conceptualize technology. [Re]framing new media art in art education as a cultural interface facilitates an approach that considers digital media as a portal to cultural conversations.\nA cultural interface approach facilitates the generation and sharing of multiple perspectives, analyses, and interpretations among artists, teachers, and students as producers and consumers (prosumers) of digital experiences (e.g., software applications, Internet interactions, and social and immersive digital environments) that situate emotions, feelings, memory, and knowledge into our understanding. Ultimately, the examination of these experiences as artistic praxis where identity, community, and culture is affected by new media technologies offers insight into how learning is impacted.\nThis research involves my engagement in an inquiry process with a diverse set of participants and sites. The research design explores emergent theory instead of predictive theory and engages in a critical, reflexive analysis involving a cultural perspective of technology. The analysis is conducted through an Actor-Network Theory (ANT) lens and examines the interfacing of expressions, experiences, and inscriptions of technology as empowering translations. Through this lens, translation takes on a specialized meaning where a relationship provokes entities into coexisting. The analysis is presented in a narrative fashion, describing the settings, characters, unfolding plots, and analysis of the data. The multilayered, metastory that I create consists of what I observed and interpreted from Actor-Network Theory and social theory art education perspectives and grounded in participants\u2019 expressed perceptions. The narratives consist of orientations, complicating actions, evaluations, resolutions, and coda.\nThis dissertation shows how a cultural interface approach can assist educators and students in understanding issues related to digital learning environments. The approach challenges cultural assumptions for understanding technology; engages critical thinking to expose complicated digital technology practices in culture; interrogates simultaneously natural, social, and discursive practices; and explores connections to the lived experiences of students. The field experience suggests that this approach promotes critical inquiry, self-directed acquisition, and multiple interpretations. The study reveals several examples of adaptations that art educators made and the subsequent strategies used to integrate new media art within their environments.\nThis study shows how Actor-Network Theory (ANT) can be used to recognize stages (inscription, translation, and framing) in the process of introducing change in practical educational environments. Further, the study reveals patterns of social orchestration and resistances that surfaced\u2014unique to each site\u2014and provides key points in the translation process that shaped the learning/teaching strategies for each site.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4043], "author_name_tesi": "Tillander, Michelle D.", "last_name_ssi": "Tillander", "middle_name_ssi": "D.", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Treat Keifer Boyd", "Patricia Marie Amburgy", "David Ebitz", "Sarah K Rich", "Carlos Rosas Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Treat Keifer Boyd, Committee Chair", "Patricia Marie Amburgy, Committee Member", "David Ebitz, Committee Member", "Sarah K Rich, Committee Member", "Carlos Rosas Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["qualitative research", "narrative", "actor-network theory", "culture", "new media", "technology", "art education", "action research"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "TRACTOR OPERATOR ROLL ANGLE ASSESSMENT AND VISUAL SLOPE INDICATOR EFFECTIVENESS\n", "id": "9865", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2557", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Production agriculture is one of the most dangerous professions.  According to a 2004 NIOSH report, approximately 250 to 350 fatalities occur per year due to incidents involving agricultural tractors.  About 150 to 200 of these deaths result from tractor overturns.  Overturns are often the result of improper tractor operation by inexperienced or careless operators.  Side hill overturn incidents could be reduced if the tractor operator was better able to identify dangerous slope angle and take action to reduce risk.\n     Tractor operators must be aware of current field terrain and slope steepness in order to work safely.  Presenting real-time stability information in dangerous situations would help enable the operator to avoid overturns.  A previous research project designed and tested an electronic device that monitored the stability of a tractor.  When installed on a full size remote control tractor that was intentionally overturned, the electronic monitor accurately predicted potential and actual overturn events.  Developing a device to effectively deliver stability information to a tractor operator was the aim of this research project, as well as the study of tractor operators\u2019 understanding of tractor roll angles.  This project required the design and construction of a full scale tractor cab roll simulator.  The simulator was used to study two main topics.  First, test subjects were tested in the simulator to determine angles at which they felt uncomfortable, as well as the angles at which they would no longer operate a tractor.  Second, the test subjects were asked to perform a series of tasks in order to assess the functionality of a visual slope indicator installed in the simulator.  \n     This project tested 236 tractor operators\u2019 perceptions of safe tractor operation on side slopes, and 130 participants\u2019 interactions with a visual display that was designed to help them estimate slope angles.  Testing of the visual slope indicator showed that the device could potentially influence novice participants\u2019 estimates.  With the participation of human subjects, this project was the initial step to design and test a stability monitor that could provide continuous feedback to tractor operators.  Providing tractor stability information to operators could potentially lead to safer tractor operation and fewer fatalities resulting from tractor overturns.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2537], "author_name_tesi": "Tillapaugh, James Adam", "last_name_ssi": "Tillapaugh", "middle_name_ssi": "Adam", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Dennis Murphy", "Dennis J Murphy", "Henry Joseph Sommer Iii", "Jude Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Dennis Murphy, Thesis Advisor", "Dennis J Murphy, Thesis Advisor", "Henry Joseph Sommer Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Jude Liu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["slope angle perception", "visual slope indicator", "tractor overturn", "farm safety", "tractor cab roll simulator"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Electrocoagulation Pretreatment Prior to Ultrafiltration", "id": "9383", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6149", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this research was to determine the feasibility of using electrocoagulation (EC) as a pretreatment prior to ultrafiltration (UF).  Wastewater, seawater, and natural waters were investigated as source waters.  A continuous flow bench-sale EC reactor was configured, calibrated, and operated under constant current conditions to deliver aluminum or iron coagulant doses.  The efficiency of the in-line EC pretreatment step, the UF membrane performance, and the UF permeate quality were compared to pretreatment results obtained using an equivalent molar dose of aluminum or iron from a chemical coagulant (aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride, respectively).  A novel, neutral-pH natural organic material (NOM) fractionation system provided insight as to the effectiveness of the electrocoagulation pretreatment to target the hydrophobic/hydrophilic (HPO/HPI) acid fraction of organic matter suspected to be the dominant foulant of ultrafilters.\n\tFor pretreatment of wastewater effluent organic materials (EfOM), in-line EC (aluminum) pretreatment better removed the HPO/HPI acid fraction of EfOM under all coagulation conditions.  For this wastewater effluent, EC pretreatment was better for removal of total organic carbon (TOC) and UV254 adsorbance, while alum pretreatment resulted in a comparatively lower rate of transmembrane pressure (TMP) increase and better flux recoveries after both hydraulic and chemical cleaning.  At sub-critical fluxes, variations in the rate of TMP increase between the comparative EC and alum pretreatment conditions are slight and essentially equivalent.\n\tFor pretreatment of modified Atlantic Ocean seawater, optimal doses from EC (iron) and ferric chloride provided statistically similar reductions in TMP and hydraulic resistance during constant sub-critical flux ultrafiltration compared to the baseline condition (no coagulant).  At super-critical fluxes, the EC generated cake layer remained comparatively more porous (and less compressible) under increasing TMP.  It was also more efficiently removed by hydraulic and chemical cleaning than the ferric chloride-based cake layer, which resulted in higher pure water flux recoveries.  In related pilot-scale studies using Pacific Ocean seawater, EC (iron) pretreatment resulted in slightly higher TMP than observed following ferric chloride pretreatment during long-term sub-critical flux ultrafiltration.  In this study, substantial accumulation of precipitates developed on the iron electrodes and were identified by X-ray diffraction as magnetite, maghemite, lepidocrocite, and akaganeite phases.\n\tFor pretreatment of a surface water mixture, an underdosing condition using either dosing platform increased the TMP and hydraulic resistance during ultrafiltration and resulted in poorer flux recoveries after hydraulic and chemical cleanings.  Pretreatment doses resulting in a visible floc (despite a low zeta potential and streaming current) lowered TMP and hydraulic resistance for all flux conditions.  At this dose, EC (iron) pretreatment offered improved flux recovery following hydraulic cleaning, but ferric chloride pretreatment achieved a greater flux recovery after chemical cleaning.  These findings were confirmed during longer-term constant sub-critical flux ultrafiltration using polysulfone hollow-fibers.  Anoxic conditions (dissolved oxygen <0.5 mg/L) during in-line iron electrocoagulation and ultrafiltration yielded poor flux recovery after chemical cleaning, but adverse effects were not observed during sub- and super-critical flux experiments.  This research indicates that EC offers a potential feasible and effective pretreatment strategy for mobile drinking water production facilities.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6142], "author_name_tesi": "Timmes, Thomas  Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Timmes", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey", "Brian Dempsey", "Fred Scott Cannon", "Jack Vincent Matson", "Herschel Adams Elliott", "Steven Robert Richards"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey, Dissertation Advisor", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Chair", "Fred Scott Cannon, Committee Member", "Jack Vincent Matson, Committee Member", "Herschel Adams Elliott, Committee Member", "Steven Robert Richards, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electrocoagulation", "Pretreatment", "Ultrafiltration", "Membrane", "Fractionation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "\u201c Pricking the Conscience of the Nation \u201d: An In-depth Analysis of Media Coverage of the 1961 Friendship Nine Movement and Jail, No Bail Strategy", "id": "22129", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10122", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "On January 31, 1961, the lives of nine students at the now defunct Friendship College in Rock Hill, South Carolina were forever changed as they sat in at a downtown lunch counter at McCrory\u2019s to protest racial segregation.

Although the \u201cJail, no bail\u201d strategy had been previously used by students at sit-ins in across the country, the \u201cFriendship Nine\u201d were the first group of students to carry out their entire sentence. \n \tThe students were arrested, tried, and found guilty. Two days later they began to serve their 30-day sentences on the York County Prison Farm. The reasons for what became known as the \u201cJail, no bail\u201d strategy were two fold. First, the students wanted to place the financial burden onto the city, which would be responsible for feeding and clothing the demonstrators once jailed. Second, the students wanted to draw attention to the desegregation efforts in Rock Hill. The students wanted to effectively spread their message and raise awareness about the discriminatory practices evident in Rock Hill.

So how do bilinguals successfully perform in one language without the other language intruding, and how do bilinguals seamlessly switch between their two languages when required? What control mechanism can explain how a bilingual manages to select what language they are speaking in? Is this mechanism specific to the practiced domain of language or does it also extend to more general, non-linguistic tasks requiring cognitive control?\nThe present study examines the cognitive correlates employed by bilinguals and monolinguals in both linguistic and non-linguistic contexts, and provides further insight into psycholinguistic models, such as the Inhibitory Control model (Green, 1998). Given that bilinguals have a unique experience with cognitive control as a result of managing the pervasive parallel activation of their two languages, I investigate whether bilinguals and monolinguals recruit the same cognitive mechanisms in linguistic and non-linguistic contexts.\nCognitive control in linguistic and non-linguistic contexts is examined in English-Spanish bilinguals, Spanish-English bilinguals, and English monolinguals. Bilinguals and monolinguals are presented with interlingual and intralingual homographs and controls in a language-specific (English) lexical decision task and in a generalized lexical decision task (linguistic context) and complete a non-verbal task switching task (non-linguistic context). In the English lexical decision task, bilinguals tested in their first language recognized interlingual homographs more quickly than matched controls, whereas bilinguals tested in their second language did not recognize interlingual homographs differently than the matched controls. Meanwhile, both groups of bilinguals and the monolinguals recognized intralingual homographs more quickly than matched the controls. In the generalized lexical decision task, only the Spanish-English bilinguals\nrecognized interlingual homographs differently than the matched controls. In particular, Spanish-English bilinguals recognized these homographs more quickly than the controls. Moreover, both bilingual groups recognized intralingual homographs more quickly than the matched controls. In the cued color-shape task, bilinguals and monolinguals experienced a switch cost, where participants were slower and less accurate to respond to switch trials as compared to non-switch trials. The magnitude of the switch cost was not different for bilinguals and monolinguals.\nResponse latency data from the lexical decision tasks suggest that lexical ambiguity within and across languages does not require suppression of one lexical candidate. Instead, it appears that a speaker is able to respond as soon as a homograph\u2019s representations are recognized and before an alternate lexical candidate is considered, eliminating semantic competition from occurring. Moreover, this study complements recent behavioral studies that have begun to examine how the role of executive control in linguistic tasks relates to bilingual performance in non-linguistic tasks by investigating differences between bilinguals and monolinguals in their use of executive control in linguistic and non-linguistic contexts. In particular, the findings from this study suggest that bilinguals do not differ from monolinguals in how they employ cognitive control in linguistic contexts. Moreover, it appears that bilinguals\u2019 practice with executive control in linguistic tasks does not extend to their performance on non-linguistic tasks, because both bilinguals and monolinguals experience switch costs, where they respond less quickly and less accurate to switch trials as compared to non-switch trials, and the magnitude of these switch costs were not different.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9265], "author_name_tesi": "Ting, Caitlin Yeh-Shan", "last_name_ssi": "Ting", "middle_name_ssi": "Yeh-Shan", "first_name_ssi": "Caitlin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adriana Van Hell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adriana Van Hell, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["bilingualism", "cognitive control", "homograph processing", "lexical ambiguity", "psycholinguistics", "word recognition"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Syntactic processing in language and music: Behavioral and electrophysiological studies", "id": "13416cyt5016", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13416", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Language and music are multi-modal sensory systems which humans are exposed to on a daily basis. Both of these systems are characterized as possessing syntax, or a set of principles that dictate how the smallest discrete syntactic units (e.g., words or musical notes) can be combined to form larger elements (e.g., sentences or chord progressions). According to the Shared Syntactic Integration Resource Hypothesis (Patel, 2003; 2008), these syntactic units in language and music are stored in distinct neural regions from one another, whereas the resources used to process syntax in language are the same as those used to process syntax in music. \nIn the present dissertation, I used behavioral and electrophysiological (event-related potentials) methodologies to test the Shared Syntactic Integration Resource Hypothesis (SSIRH) and examine whether cognitive control is used to process syntax in music, and whether intensive prior experience with syntactic management (Experiments 1A and 1B) and auditory processing (Experiment 2) in language and music can influence how cognitive control is engaged during syntactic processing in music. Moreover, I examined whether different syntactic structures within and across language and music engage similar cognitive resources, as well as whether the time course of syntactic processing is similar or different for these structures in language and music (Experiment 3).\nThe three experiments in the present dissertation did not find evidence to conclusively support the Shared Syntactic Integration Resource Hypothesis. It appears that cognitive control, as measured by the adapted Stroop task, was not engaged during syntactic processing in music. Furthermore, it appears that different syntactic structures within and across language and music engage different processing resources. In sum, the present behavioral and electrophysiological findings add to the growing body of literature suggesting that the Shared Syntactic Integration Resource Hypothesis needs to be updated to better be able to predict the nuances of syntactic processing in language and music.

Through the unique heat treatment - austempering, the \u201causferrite\u201d microstructure of ferrite and carbon-stabilized austenite along with graphite nodules is formed. Multiple strength levels can be produced by varying the austempering temperature or time. In general, ADI has a high strength-weight ratio, good toughness, and very high wear resistance compared to other ductile iron grades. In addition, the density of ADI is lower than steel but with approximately the same strength. These unique properties make ADI as an ideal material for manufacturing products requiring light weight but with high strength and toughness. On the other hand, ADI is difficult to machine because of its high hardness. This has impeded the application and the growth of market applications of ADI.   \nThe primary objective of this study was to evaluate the machinability of different grades of ADI (GR900, GR1050, GR1200) during high speed turning with coolant. Comprehensive turning experiments were conducted under a range of different machining conditions. The influence of cutting speed on tool life, surface roughness, and chip formation were analyzed during turning with coated carbide tools. The turning experiments were conducted on large diameter commercially produced, pre-machined cylinder castings at a constant feed rate of 0.012 ipr and depth of cut of 0.06 inches. The cutting speed was varied for the different grades of ADI, from 250-1000 fpm and tool wear was measured at various time intervals. A Taylor tool life model was developed by measuring the tool life for a range of cutting speeds. This model was then used to generate general turning guidelines for the various grades of ADI based on tool life. Lastly, in order to benchmark the turning of ADI with other materials, turning studies with conventional Ductile Iron grade 100-70-03 were also investigated under similar cutting conditions.  \nThe chip formation for all grades of ADI and DI 100-70-03 were discovered in the form of discontinuous c-shaped chips. As expected increasing cutting speeds accelerated the rate of tool wear.

Distributive justice, fairness of the outcome, was measured using departures above the guidelines, departures below the guidelines, and the \u2018going rate,\u2019 or average sentence of a court.        \nResults indicated significant differences with respect to the reduction in the severity and the number of charges for burglary and robbery cases.  A majority of burglary and robbery cases received some type of charge reduction.  For burglary cases, 63% of the sample received a charge reduction: 57% received a reduction in the number of charges and 6% received a reduction in the severity of charges.  For robbery cases, 61% of the sample received a charge reduction: 42% received a reduction in the number of charges and 19% received a reduction in the severity of charges.\nConsistent with most sentencing research, the strongest predictors of charge reductions were two legal variables: offense severity and prior criminal history.  But also consistent with much sentencing research, extra-legal variables including gender, race, and age had some effect on the likelihood of a reduction in charges.  For burglary only, males were less likely than females to receive a reduction in the severity and the number of charges, and Blacks were less likely than Whites to receive a reduction in the severity of charges.  Age had a significant effect for robbery, but not for burglary.  Younger offenders were less likely to receive a charge reduction than older offenders.   \nAlthough there were significant county-level contextual variables, these variables did not explain a significant portion of the variance across counties in the reduction of charges for either burglary or robbery cases.  However, county- and court-level measures of procedural justice did explain a significant proportion of the variance across counties in the reduction of charges for burglary.  Specifically, measures of procedural justice for burglary were better at explaining this variance across counties than were measures of distributive justice.  These results suggest that efforts to decrease disparity in distributive justice by limiting judicial discretion through sentencing guidelines has been relatively successful, but there is still disparity in procedural justice.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3698], "author_name_tesi": "Tinik, Leigh ", "last_name_ssi": "Tinik", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Leigh", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback", "Richard Barry Ruback"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback, Thesis Advisor", "Richard Barry Ruback, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Plea bargaining", "procedural justice", "distributive justice"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Essays on International Trade and Multinational Firms", "id": "17347", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8698", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Most international commerce is carried out by multinational firms, which use their foreign affiliates for the majority of their foreign sales. In Chapter 1, I examine the determinants of multinational firms' location and production decisions and the welfare implications of multinational production. The few existing quantitative general equilibrium models that incorporate multinational firms achieve tractability by assuming away export platforms -- i.e. they do not allow foreign affiliates of multinationals to export -- or by ignoring fixed costs associated with foreign investment. I develop a quantifiable multi-country general equilibrium model, which tractably handles multinational firms that engage in export platform sales and that face fixed costs of foreign investment. I first estimate the model using German firm-level data to uncover the size and nature of costs of multinational enterprise and show that fixed costs of foreign investment are large. Second, I calibrate the model to data on trade and multinational production for twelve European and North American countries. Counterfactual results reveal that multinationals play an important role in transmitting technological improvements to foreign countries as they can jump the barriers to international trade; I find that a twenty percent increase in the productivity of US firms leads to welfare gains in foreign countries an order of magnitude larger than in a world in which multinational production is disallowed. I demonstrate the usefulness of the model for current policy analysis by studying the pending Canada-EU trade and investment agreement; I find that a twenty percent drop in the barriers to foreign production between the signatories would divert about seven percent of the production of EU multinationals from the US to Canada.\n\nChapter 2, which is joint work with Kerem Cosar and Paul Grieco, studies the implications of national borders on economic activity.  \nUsing a micro-level dataset of wind turbine installations in Denmark and Germany, we estimate a structural oligopoly model with cross-border trade and heterogeneous firms. Our approach separately identifies border-related from distance-related variable costs and bounds the fixed cost of exporting for each firm. Variable border costs are large: equivalent to roughly 400 kilometers (250 miles) in distance costs, which represents 40 to 50 percent of the average exporter's total delivery costs. Fixed costs are also important; removing them would increase German firms' market share in Denmark by 10 percentage points. Counterfactual analysis indicates that completely eliminating border frictions would increase total welfare in the wind turbine industry by 5 percent in Denmark and 10 percent in Germany.  Finally, an experiment using our structural model shows that commonly used price difference regressions produce misleadingly high estimates of the impact of national boundaries.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8567], "author_name_tesi": "Tintelnot, Felix ", "last_name_ssi": "Tintelnot", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Felix", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan W Eaton", "Stephen Ross Yeaple", "James R.

An attempt has been made to model the experimental set up for the compression test of a concrete cylinder confined with FRP sheet in AbaqusCAE. The results so obtained have been compared and analyzed against the experimental test results & the results obtained from a chosen mathematical model (Modified Lam & Teng). An attempt was made to create a new material model in Opensees that follows the chosen mathematical model. However, this was not achieved due to the reasons that will be explained in the later sections.\nReinforced concrete confined with steel is typically designed by considering the Manders model (Mander et al., 1988), which assumes a constant confining pressure. This is true with the case of steel as it is a ductile material and one assumes the steel to be yielded. However with the case of FRP jackets, this is not true. FRP is a linear elastic and brittle material and does not yield, which makes the Manders model inaccurate for its analysis. Many models have been proposed which take into account the increasing confining pressure due to the FRP wrap. A comparative study of the constitutive models proposed for FRP confined reinforced concrete has been done in this study.\nFinally after a series of numerical interpretations of different specimens and their comparison with the experimental data, the utility and accuracy of the new modified Lam & Teng\u2019s model was validated.

Primarily, this research involved two major activities: model and method developments and analyses and validations of the developed models and methods. \nThe starting point of this research was the utilization of the earlier developed fuel management tool, TRIGSIM, to create the Monte Carlo model of core loading 51 (end of the core loading). It was found when comparing the normalized power results of the Monte Carlo model to those of the current fuel management system (using HELIOS/ADMARC-H) that they agreed reasonably well (within 2% \u2013 3 % differences on average). Moreover, the reactivity of some fuel elements was calculated by the Monte Carlo model and it was compared with measured data. It was also found that the fuel element reactivity results of the Monte Carlo model were in good agreement with the measured data. However, the subsequent task of analyzing the conversion from the core loading 51 to the core loading 52 using TRIGSIM showed quite significant difference of each control rod worth between the Monte Carlo model and the current methodology model. The differences were mainly caused by inconsistent absorber atomic number densities between the two models. Hence, the model of the first operating core (core loading 2) was revised in light of new information about the absorber atomic densities to validate the Monte Carlo model with the measured data. With the revised Monte Carlo model, the results agreed better to the measured data. \nAlthough TRIGSIM showed good modeling and capabilities, the accuracy of TRIGSIM could be further improved by adopting more advanced algorithms. Therefore, TRIGSIM was planned to be upgraded. The first task of upgrading TRIGSIM involved the improvement of the temperature modeling capability. The new TRIGSIM was upgraded to be able to model various temperatures across different materials of the fuel element in the reactor core. The analysis of the temperature modeling capability demonstrated expected reactivity loss as a function of temperature. Secondly, the depletion capability of TRIGSIM was tremendously improved. The upgrade of the depletion capability involved the replacement of the simple predictor depletion algorithm used in the original TRIGSIM with the more advanced predictor-corrector depletion algorithm. Moreover, the methodology of combining the online burnup cross section generation from the Monte Carlo for \u201cimportant\u201d isotopes and the use of pre-generated TRIGA burnup cross section library for \u201cnon-important\u201d isotopes was implemented in the new TRIGSIM as well. For the last part of the improvements of depletion capability, TRIGSIM was modified to be able to perform depletion calculations in several axial nodes which reflects better burnup gradient along the axial direction. Thirdly, the possibility to speed up the Monte Carlo calculation was studied and implemented. In this research, the speedup of the Monte Carlo calculation was performed by utilizing the fast nodal diffusion calculation to provide initial source distribution for the Monte Carlo method. The results showed that the some computational time was saved by eliminating the typical guess of large number of inactive cycles. Along with this speedup methodology, the algorithm to generate the consistent diffusion cross section from the Monte Carlo was also developed. In addition, the speed of the new fuel management system was also possible by the utilization of parallel computing as it was illustrated that parallel computing had a great potential for reducing clock time.\nFinally, the upgraded TRIGSIM was renamed as TRIGSIMS to reflect these major improvements. Subsequently, the new TRIGSIMS was validated by performing several core loading configurations starting from the first operating core loading (core loading 2). It was found that the new TRIGSIMS produced good agreements with the measured data when taking into account all uncertainties. With all improved features and advanced methodologies, TRIGSIMS is currently a state-of-art and powerful tool for PSBR fuel management analysis.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1181], "author_name_tesi": "Tippayakul, Chanatip ", "last_name_ssi": "Tippayakul", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chanatip", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "C Frederick Sears", "Yousry Azmy", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Chair", "C Frederick Sears, Committee Member", "Yousry Azmy, Committee Member", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PSBR", "Monte Carlo coupled depletion", "Research reactor modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Starch Spherulite Production via High Temperature Spray Drying\n\n", "id": "9618", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "628", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project was undertaken to investigate the  production of starch spherulites via high temperature spray drying. High temperature spray drying is a variation of spray drying in which the operating feed temperature is above the normal boiling point of the solution. High temperature spray drying is necessary for starch spherulite production because a starch dispersion must be heated to at least 160\u00b0C, but preferably 180\u00b0C, and then cooled at a moderate rate, 10\u00b0C/min to 500\u00b0C/min. This allows the starch dispersion to gelatinize on heating and experience a phase separation into a polymer-rich phase and a solvent-rich phase on cooling. The polymer-rich phase can then crystallize into a spherulitic morphology. The elevated maximum temperature requires an operating line pressure of approximately 10 bar prior to atomization to maintain the liquid state of the feed.\n\nAn Armfield Tall Form Spray Dryer/Chiller FT 80/81 was modified to be a high temperature spray drying system which could withstand an operating temperature of 180\u00b0C and an operating pressure of 10 bar. An experiment was designed to determine the effect of the feed concentration, feed flow rate, operating temperature, and drying temperature on the total percent recovery, spherulite number density, and spherulite size. In addition, the percent crystallinity of the spherulites was investigated.\n\nThe system was able to successfully produce starch spherulites from 10% w/w, 20% w/w, and 30% w/w dispersions of high-amylose maize starch in deionized water.

Post hoc analysis was done to determine the cause of the variation, however, no observable variable yielded a relationship to the final product properties.\n\nAlthough no statistically significant relationship could be determined between the operating conditions and the final product properties, the ability of the high temperature spray system to produce starch spherulites provides the foundation for future research.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [624], "author_name_tesi": "Tirio, Beth Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Tirio", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Beth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Greg Ziegler And Dr Wayne Curtis", "Dr Greg Ziegler And Dr Wayne Curtis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Greg Ziegler And Dr Wayne Curtis, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Greg Ziegler And Dr Wayne Curtis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["spherulite", "high temperature spray drying", "starch"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Miscanthus Yield and Nitrogen Fertility of an Amended, Reclaimed Mine Soil", "id": "13952zet103", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13952", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abandoned mine land (AML), comprising more than 75,000 ha in Pennsylvania, is generally low in organic matter and nutrients.

The EU promotes a \u2018Europe\u2019 that is culturally diverse, yet homogenous; geographically fixed, yet open to expansion. Member-states must prove their \u2018European-ness\u2019 by implementing policies and ideals that define \u2018European\u2019 ways of life, while EU citizens must negotiate how their own identities and daily practices fit in.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a main pathological driver of the vascular permeability and BRB abnormalities observed in these insults. Importantly, agents targeting VEGF are robust medical therapies that have revolutionized eye care. However, only 35% of patients improve vision while 60% have further loss vision loss prevented when treated with anti-VEGF therapies suggesting alternative factors are also able to induce BRB dysfunction. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) contributes to retinal inflammation and is a candidate to mediate some of the deleterious effects observed in these diseases. Therefore, elucidating the downstream commonalities of VEGF and TNF signaling may provide an ideal point of therapeutic intervention. This dissertation tests the hypothesis that the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms represent a common permeabilizing signaling node downstream of VEGF and TNF.\n\nPreviously data from our laboratory defines an essential role for aPKC in TNF-induced retinal endothelial permeability. Building upon this observation, the contribution of aPKC to VEGF-induced retinal endothelial permeability was assessed. Here, VEGF treatment activated aPKC in both primary retinal endothelial cells and in the rodent retina. Furthermore, pharmacological and genetic manipulation of aPKC demonstrated that aPKC not only contributed to VEGF-induced permeability but also was sufficient to increase endothelial permeability. Novel small molecule inhibitors of aPKC were identified and were shown to prevent VEGF-induced retinal permeability in primary culture and in the rodent retina. Data in chapter 3 of the dissertation provides evidence that aPKC isoforms mediate VEGF-induced permeability and identifies novel small molecules inhibitors of aPKC isoforms and are effective anti- permeabilizing agents that warrant further investigation.\n\nFurther characterization of the novel small molecule aPKC inhibitors was performed to define the structural requirements necessary for inhibitory activity. Detailed structure-activity relationships (SAR) were performed which delineated a novel pharmacophore required for inhibitory activity in two aPKC-dependent cell based assays that measure inflammation and vascular permeability. Data in chapter 4 provides the structural framework necessary for future medicinal chemistry efforts to solidify this chemotype as a clinically efficacious compound and identified a lead compound for further in vivo study (aPKC-I-diMeO).\n\nThe contribution of aPKC isoforms to VEGF and TNF-induced BRB dysfunction and retinal edema was assessed using these newly identified small molecule inhibitors of aPKC. Importantly, both terminal and non-terminal assays to measure the extent VEGF/TNF-induced BRB dysfunction and retinal edema were utilized. Here, a nanomolar potent aPKC inhibitor (aPKC-I-diMeO) significantly prevented the combined permeabilizing effects of VEGF and TNF in primary endothelial culture and in vivo. The combined treatment of VEGF and TNF-induced diffuse leakage of fluorescently labeled albumin and increased retinal edema by 20% within 24 h in anesthetized rats. Strikingly, co-administration of aPKC-I-diMeO significantly prevented the VEGF/TNF-induced tight junction alterations and retinal vascular permeability in the rodent retina. Furthermore, aPKC inhibition prevented albumin leakage from retinal vessels and retinal edema as measured by fluorescent angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Chapter 5 suggests targeting aPKC with a potent and specific small molecule inhibitor effectively prevents BRB dysfunction induced by VEGF/TNF in clinically relevant models.\n\nFinally, preliminary studies were performed to elucidate the VEGF-induced phosphoproteome and to identify novel substrates downstream of aPKC isoforms. Multiple VEGF-induced phosphosites were identified using phosphopeptide enrichment strategies coupled with isobaric relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) tags. Furthermore, several of these phosphosites were dependent upon aPKC kinase activity and specifically associated with cytoskeletal and endocytosis regulation.\n\nThe data described in this dissertation, taken together with published reports, strongly implicates aPKC in the regulation of both VEGF and TNF-induced BRB dysfunction and provides a novel point of therapeutic intervention. Multiple small molecule inhibitors of aPKC isoforms were identified and represent novel agents to prevent alterations in BRB integrity in ocular disease. Furthermore, these compounds should be applied to disease models of metabolic disease, cancer, and inflammation which all have implicated some degree of aberrant aPKC activity.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8182], "author_name_tesi": "Titchenell, Paul Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Titchenell", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles H Lang", "Charles H Lang", "Thomas E Spratt", "David Antonetti", "Yuguang Shi", "Christopher Martin Yengo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles H Lang, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles H Lang, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member", "David Antonetti, Special Member", "Yuguang Shi, Committee Member", "Christopher Martin Yengo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vegf", "drug discovery", "PKC", "blood-retinal barrier", "vascular permeability", "macular edema", "phosphoproteomics", "kinase inhibitor", "TNF"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "APPLICATION OF THE DSMC METHOD TO HIGH DENSITY MICRO-FLOWS\n", "id": "7793", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1889", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research discusses the application of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method to flows in Micro Electro Mechanical devices (MEMS) and the Space Shuttle leading edge reinforced Carbon-Carbon destruction due to the chemically active flows.

I shared what I learned as a mentor through my accretion of points of view, reframed conceptions of coteaching and mentoring, and epistemological transformation about instructional planning.  My findings have implications for understanding the use of coteaching and self-study as potential transformative practices in clinical field experiences. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12673], "author_name_tesi": "Titus, Nicole Evelyn", "last_name_ssi": "Titus", "middle_name_ssi": "Evelyn", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernard Joel Badiali"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernard Joel Badiali, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["coteaching", "self-study", "transformational learning theory", "teacher education", "mentor", "professional development school", "student teaching", "critical friend"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "A Logical Framework for Reasoning about Logical Specifications\n", "id": "6230", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "118", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-03-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We present a new logic, Linc, which is designed to be used as a framework for specifying and reasoning about operational semantics. Linc is an extension of first-order intuitionistic logic with a proof theoretic notion of definitions, induction and co-induction, and a new quantifier nabla. Definitions can be seen as expressing fixed point equations, and the least and greatest solutions for the fixed point equations give rise to the induction and co-induction proof principles. The quantifier nabla focuses on the intensional reading of the universal quantifier and is used to reason about encodings of object systems involving abstractions. The logic Linc allows quantification over lambda-terms which makes it possible to reason about encodings involving higher-order abstract syntax, a clean and declarative treatment of syntax involving abstraction and substitution. All these features of Linc co-exist within the same logic, allowing for expressing proofs involving induction and co-induction on both \nfirst-order and higher-order encodings of perational semantics. We prove the cut-elimination and the consistency results for Linc, extending the reducibility technique due to Tait and Martin-Loef. We illustrate the applications of Linc in a number of areas, ranging from data structures, abstract transition systems, object logic and functional programming. The expressive power of the full logic is demonstrated in the encoding of pi-calculus, where we show that the notion of names in the calculus can naturally be interpreted in the quantification theory of Linc. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [119], "author_name_tesi": "Tiu, Alwen Fernanto", "last_name_ssi": "Tiu", "middle_name_ssi": "Fernanto", "first_name_ssi": "Alwen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Joseph Hannan", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Padma Raghavan", "Stephen George Simpson", "Frank Pfenning"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Joseph Hannan, Committee Chair", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Stephen George Simpson, Committee Member", "Frank Pfenning, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["proof theory", "operational semantics", "co-induction", "induction", "logical framework", "cut-elimination"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Design Of A Cooling System For A Hydraulic Fracturing Equipment", "id": "26446", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11263", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this thesis is to design a cooling system for a skid-mounted hydraulic fracturing equipment. Hydraulic fracturing, popularly known as \u201cfracking\u201d, is a process by which natural gas and oil are extracted by fracturing shale rock formations using a high pressure water-jet mixed with sand, abrasives and chemicals. A fracking equipment typically consists of a reciprocating pump driven by an electric drill motor. The motor itself is cooled by air from a centrifugal blower while the lubricating oil from the pump is cooled separately by an air-cooled radiator. The newly proposed design aims to remove the radiator fan and cool both the motor and the radiator via cooling air supplied by a centrifugal blower through a duct system. The scope of this thesis is limited to the design of the drill pump motor cooling tubes and the transition duct connecting the exit motor plenum to the radiator. The total heat load of the system is 139.5 kW. Out of this, 64.6 kW & 38.9 kW are due to internal heat generation in the stator and the rotor respectively. The remaining 36kW is due to the heat exchange in the oil cooler/radiator. The design mass flow rate is 4000 SCFM. Pressure drop through the system and heat load of the system are the two most important parameters affecting the design of rotor and stator cooling tubes & transition duct. This is because these parameters are the potential bottlenecks to the overall performance of the system. \nBaseline CFD & Conjugate Heat Transfer analysis of the drill pump motor revealed that at the maximum operating load of 103.5 kW, the maximum steady state temperature in the motor was 203.50C which exceeded the upper limit of 2000C for the electric insulation of the motor windings. This observation was consistent with GE-Transportation\u2019s experimental data.  Above 2000C, the electric insulation of the windings would melt causing short circuit in the motor. To alleviate this problem, a number of heat transfer enhancement techniques like longitudinal fins, transverse grooves and transverse ribs of various shapes were studied. Out of these, circular grooves were chosen as the heat transfer enhancement solution due to their simplicity with respect to manufacturability and reasonable effectiveness. Parametric analysis of the design of the rotor/stator tubes with circular grooves was also done. It was concluded that the recommended heat transfer enhancement solution could bring down the working temperatures of the rotor and the stator by 43.10C at full load at operating point. \nThe transition duct connecting the exit motor plenum to the radiator supplies cooling air from the blower to the radiator after it has passed through the inlet plenum, rotor & stator cooling tubes and exit plenum. Design this transition duct for optimal performance is the second major objective of this thesis. Due to the dimensional constraints, the transition duct has a high aspect ratio at the inlet (3.5:1) and high divergence angles (78.40 in the top view and 37.90 in the front view).  Consequently, without any flow control mechanism, this duct would have a lot of flow separation & recirculating flow which would reduce the cooling efficiency of the radiator. After many design iterations, an optimum perforated flow distributor plate was designed which had a solidity ratio of 58.6%. Further, it was concluded that the best results were obtained if the plate was located at the center of the transition duct. The percentage forward-flow area at the outlet (where the radiator is placed), was compared with that in case of fan. The best perforated plate design had a forward flow area of approximately 75-80% while the forward flow area in case of a fan was approximately 71.3%. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10804], "author_name_tesi": "Tiwari, Ankit ", "last_name_ssi": "Tiwari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ankit", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Savas Yavuzkurt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Savas Yavuzkurt, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CFD", "Conjugate Heat Transfer", "3-D flow separation", "Heat Transfer enhancement", "induction motor cooling"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Characterization of ascites-derived chicken ovarian cancer cells: evidence for the presence of a pool of highly invasive cancer stem cells", "id": "23616", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10870", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a highly metastatic disease and fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide.  Laying hens are the most appropriate animal model for human OC as chickens develop OC spontaneously, similar to women.  Although the chicken model is being extensively used to study human OC by several groups across the world, the cellular and molecular biology of chicken ovarian cancer (COVCAR) cells has not been explored in the past.  The objective of the first study was to isolate COVCAR cells from ascites, develop an in vitro culture system and characterize gene expression, growth pattern, and invasive property of OC cells.  COVCAR cells expressed several tumor metastasis-related genes, exhibited robust growth pattern at earlier passages and were found to exhibit greater invasive properties compared to normal ovarian surface epithelial (NOSE) cells.  Since advanced stages of OC are usually accompanied by the presence of ascites and greater expression of water channel protein aquaporin-5 (AQP5) which has been positively correlated with ascites volume and lymph node metastasis in OC patients, we sought to elucidate the expression of AQP5 in the cancerous chicken ovaries and in ascites-derived COVCAR cell lines.  Therefore, the objective of the second study was to determine if AQP5 expression was altered in COVCAR cells and cancerous chicken ovaries compared to that in NOSE cells and normal ovaries, respectively.  Both AQP5 mRNA and protein levels were found to be altered in COVCAR cells and cancerous ovaries, suggesting association of AQP5 expression with ovarian tumorigenesis in chicken.  Cancer stem cells (CSCs), also known as tumor initiating cells, are reported to be responsible for tumor origin, development, metastasis, and treatment failure in several cancers including OC.  High aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) activity has been associated with stemness in various cell lineages including OC cells.  We sought to determine if a stem cell pool with high ALDH1 activity existed in ascites-derived COVCAR cells.  Therefore, the objective of the third study was to isolate stem (ALDH1+) cells from ascites-derived COVCAR cells utilizing greater ALDH1 activity and in addition, to compare ALDH1+ and ALDH1- cells for their anchorage-independent growth, invasive properties and ovosphere forming abilities in vitro.  Utilizing next-generation sequencing approach, a global transcriptomic analyses was performed to determine differential expression of genes and identify biological pathway networks in ALDH1+ and ALDH1- cells.  ALDH1+ cells exhibited greater sphere formation and invasive properties than ALDH1- cells.  ALDH1+ cells also exhibited a distinct morphology in an anchorage-independent three dimensional culture with formation of unique intra-and inter-ovosphere channels connecting multiple ovospheres.  Interestingly, ALDH1+ cells exclusively expressed genes related to self-renewal and stem cell homeostasis (WNT7B) and invasiveness (GNRHR and TNFRSF19), while ALDH1- cells expressed genes related to apoptosis (CD72).  Collectively, through the studies presented herein we have developed an in vitro system for culturing COVCAR cells, developed 31 ascites-derived COVCAR cell lines, and identified altered expression of water channel protein AQP5 and presence of a CSCs pool in COVCAR cells.  This study enhances our understanding of the cellular and molecular biology of COVCAR cells.  These COVCAR cells can be utilized in the future to identify factors that could contribute to their invasive properties.  It would also be of interest to determine angiogenic and tumorigenic potential of CSCs in an in vivo system and the effect of hypoxia on these properties of CSCs.  Furthermore, CSCs and COVCAR cells developed in this study could be utilized for screening potential anti-cancer compounds in combination with in vivo cancer preventive and therapeutic approaches.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10465], "author_name_tesi": "Tiwari, Anupama ", "last_name_ssi": "Tiwari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anupama", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Ramesh Ramachandran", "Alan Leslie Johnson", "Joy Lee Pate", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Daniel R Hagen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Ramesh Ramachandran, Dissertation Advisor", "Alan Leslie Johnson, Committee Member", "Joy Lee Pate, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Daniel R Hagen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ovarian cancer", "chicken ovarian cancer cells", "ovarian cancer stem cells", "aquaporin-5 in chicken ovarian cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Teachers, Discipline and the Corporal Punishment Ban in Delhi, India", "id": "22735", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10130", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "      Corporal punishment has been a common disciplinary method in Indian schools. In recent years, however, this practice has become controversial. In 2000, the Supreme Court of India said that corporal punishment should be outlawed from the schools (Bhowmick, 2009). Ten years later, in 2010, the government of India banned the use of corporal punishment in schools through Right to Education Act (RTE). However, even with the judicial and legislative ban, the practice still continues (The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, 2011). According to a report by Ministry of Women and Child Development (2007), every year more than 225,000 students receive corporal punishment in Delhi. Drawing on interviews with 31 teachers and 6 principals across 7 school districts in Delhi, this preliminary study examines teachers\u2019 perceptions of corporal punishment, the extent to which they accept this ban, the effect of the ban on disciplinary practices, and the reasons why corporal punishment still persists.\n\tThe findings from the study shed light on the socio-cultural beliefs that support the use of corporal punishment on students. The residual religious beliefs and traditions such as caste system have influenced teachers\u2019 use of corporal punishment. Additionally, a lack of resources has also resulted in teachers\u2019 continued use of corporal punishment, despite the ban. For example, a significant number of participants mentioned large class sizes as a reason for continued use of corporal punishment. Several participants have indicated their uncertainty with the ban primarily because of the socio-economic reasons and because the law is not clear. Thus it could be concluded that policy makers need to define and clarify the implications of the ban to ensure its effectiveness.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9822], "author_name_tesi": "Tiwari, Ashwini K", "last_name_ssi": "Tiwari", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Ashwini", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger C Shouse", "Roger C Shouse", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich", "Davin Jules Carr Chellman", "Madhu Suri Prakash"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger C Shouse, Dissertation Advisor", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich, Committee Member", "Davin Jules Carr Chellman, Committee Member", "Madhu Suri Prakash, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Corporal punishment", "Physical punishment", "Discipline", "Teachers", "Media", "Delhi", "India", "Educational reform", "Right to Education Act"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INNOVATIVE ENERGY ABSORBING AND LOAD LIMITING DEVICES BASED ON COMPOSITE TUBES\n\n", "id": "10070", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1195", "abstract_tesi": "Analytical and experimental studies of innovative load limiting and energy absorbing devices are presented here.

An attractive alternative for achieving this in an economical manner is the use of atomic self assembly. However, to achieve control over atomic self assembly and tailor surface morphologies on demand, we need to understand the inherent interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics. In order to achieve these objectives, we use multi-scale simulations to elucidate the mechanisms of self assembly in Al(110) homoepitaxy, in which, hut-shaped nanostructures or ``nanohuts\" were observed in experiments cite{Mongeot03}. At the atomic scale, we use first-principles calculations to study the atomic interactions that govern assembly, and find that many-body effects are important. We propose a ``Connector Model\", which is more accurate and efficient in representing high-order, many-body interactions than the traditional lattice-gas approach, and it may be suitable for describing a variety of surface phenomena, such as thin-film and crystal growth, adsorption, phase transitions, and catalysis at surfaces. Further, we elucidate diffusion mechanisms and quantify energy barriers for atomic diffusion on flat (110), (100), and (111) surfaces, (100) and (111) steps, and between the (100), (111) and (110) surfaces of Al. We uncover novel mechanisms for atomic diffusion in this system, including diagonal exchange on flat (110) surface, and three-atom diagonal exchange for inter-layer transport on the (100) and (111) steps. We find that the energy barriers for diffusion are significantly reduced under certain configurations of neighboring adatoms, which makes it easier for a dimer to climb the (100) and (111) facets than an isolated adatom. Finally, we incorporate the results obtained at the atomic scale in a 3-dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo model of homoepitaxial growth on Al(110). We use this to predict shapes and spatial organization of self-assembled nanostructures under different growth conditions, and explain the trends observed in experiments. We also demonstrate that thermal-field-directed self assembly can be employed to achieve uniform spatial distribution of nanostructures during Al(110) homoepitaxy, by using dual-beam or four-beam laser interference irradiation of the substrate.

Such polarity is determined by precise cellular mechanisms that include endocytosis and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Beta heavy-spectrin (bH) is a cytoskeletal protein that is localized to the apical surface of epithelial tissues. bH has been hypothesized to be involved in endocytosis because the early endosome marker Rab5 is lost from karst(bH)mutant midgut cells. Furthermore, the overexpression of C-terminal region of bH leads to the formation of an expanded apical membrane. The bilayer of this expanded apical membrane is folded and adhered together, forming a \u2018bimembrane\u2019 structure that sequesters the GTPase Dynamin, a protein that is involved in vesicle pinching from the plasma membrane. Also present in these bimembranes is Annexin B9 (AnxB9), a calcium dependent membrane binding protein of a class that is thought to be participating in protein transport processes. A previous genome-wide analysis found that AnxB9, one of the three annexins in the fly, physically interacts with bH. These results suggest that AnxB9 and bH collaborate in the regulation of protein trafficking.\n\nI examined the consequences of AnxB9 loss-of-function by reducing the level of AnxB9 in salivary glands through RNA mediated interference. In the cells lacking AnxB9, bH was found to be mislocalized from its canonical apical location and to be increased in the basolateral domain. Furthermore, bH was found to accumulate on cytoplasmic structures which were connected to the basolateral membrane, and which stain for the multivesicular body/late endosome markers, Hrs and Vps16. This leads to the hypothesis that AnxB9 is participating in the formation of multivesicular body along with bH. Since colocalization of cytoplasmic bH with Hrs had been found under other conditions, it seems very likely that bH has a role in the endosomal trafficking system and that AnxB9 interacts with bH in the endosomal compartments.\n\nCrumbs, an apical polarity determinant, recruits bH to the apical domain via its FERM binding domain. I found that the distribution of Crumbs was not affected by a reduction of AnxB9 suggesting that AnxB9, like bH, is downstream of this protein. However, I found that upon reducing the level of AnxB9, the apical-lateral boundary was degraded. The basolateral septate junction markers, Coracle and Dlg were also relocated to cytoplasmic structures that colocalized closely with bH and Hrs. These results suggest that AnxB9 has a role inmaintaining the proper segregation at the boundary between the apical and lateral membranes.These findings lead to the hypothesis that AnxB9 is involved in maintaining the basolateral polarity.\n\nIn addition, I discovered a novel role for AnxB9 in keeping a balanced environment for cells during stress. Knocking down AnxB9 levels made the endosomal trafficking system very vulnerable to heat shock and an increase in the number of structures labeled by multivesicular body markers was seen. \n\nIn summary, I have uncovered several novel functions for AnxB9 in endocytosis: 1) AnxB9 is involved in the formation of multivesicular bodies; 2) AnxB9 is needed to stabilize the apical-lateral boundary; 3) AnxB9 stabilizes the endomembrane system during stress. I hypothesize that multivesicular body half-life is determined by the interaction of AnxB9 and bH, and that AnxB9 is involved in the formation of intralumenal vesicles in multivesicluar bodies.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4570], "author_name_tesi": "Tjota, Monika ", "last_name_ssi": "Tjota", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Monika", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Graham Hugh Thomas", "Graham Hugh Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Graham Hugh Thomas, Thesis Advisor", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["drosophila melanogaster", "endocytosis", "annexin b9", "beta heavy spectrin", "multivesicular body"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Characterization of bifidobacterial strains obtained from Ukraine.\n\n\n\n", "id": "10345", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3801", "abstract_tesi": "Speciation of bifidobacterial isolates using traditional biochemical and phenotypic methods is tedious and often provides inconclusive results.

When digested with XbaI, 9 of the isolates gave patterns identical to DSMZ 10140. One strain, RT09, had one extra band when digested with XbaI. Allelic profiling of the\nUkrainian bifidobacterial strains, revealed four distinct groups. Interestingly, 6 (60%) of\nthe isolates fell into the same cluster as that containing the common commercial probiotic\nstrain BB-12. Our results demonstrate the conventional phenotypic methods used to\ncharacterize these isolates were sufficient to assign the correct genus, but not the correct\nspecies. These findings highlight the importance of employing molecular methods when typing bifidobacterial isolates.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3779], "author_name_tesi": "Tmanova, Lyubov  ", "last_name_ssi": "Tmanova", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lyubov ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roberts Robert", "Robert F Roberts"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roberts Robert, Thesis Advisor", "Robert F Roberts, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bifidobacterium", "PCR", "PFGE", "Bifidobacterium lactis. ssp. lactis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF MODELING AND SIMULATION TOOLS FOR ANALYSIS OF DUCTED FAN AIRCRAFT\n", "id": "8864", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1806", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A generic simulation model was developed for stability / control analysis and real-time simulation of ducted fan aircraft.

The signature is characterized by a low-level enhancement in differential reflectivity (ZDR) and decrease in co-polar correlation coefficient (\u03c1hv) within a region of decreasing radar reflectivity factor at horizontal polarization (ZH) toward the ground. The signature is examined for the first time in conjunction with crowdsourced precipitation reports and thermodynamic data. Time-averaged quasi-vertical profiles (QVPs) retain the most prominent features of the signature, which appear to line up with certain thermodynamic features among cases. The height at which the low-level ZDR values begin to increase towards the ground corresponds to wet-bulb temperatures (Tw) = -5 \u00b0C, and may indicate the height at which freezing begins. Humidity profiles suggest the local generation of anisotropic crystals growing at the expense of small liquid drops via evaporation and vapor deposition. These crystals may promote the refreezing of fully melted hydrometeors via contact nucleation. Some regions suggest the rapid cooling of hydrometeors, that may act to freeze drops quickly and reduce their fall speeds, which may be responsible for producing an enhancement in ZH near the top of the refreezing layer (RFL) present in some cases.\n\nThe evolution of the signature is also examined during three winter storms in which surface precipitation type transitions from ice pellets to freezing rain. Synoptic analyses reveal similarities among these cases in the location of nearby surface features associated with an approaching low-pressure system, namely an advancing warm front and an inverted surface trough, and strong warm-air advection aloft at 850 hPa and weak temperature advection at the surface. During transition events, the refreezing signature descends monotonically and intersects the ground at the time of the transition. A simple method for forecasting this changeover time from quasi-vertical profiles (QVPs) of polarimetric radar data is developed and compared to crowdsourced precipitation reports and surface precipitation types derived from Rapid Refresh (RAP) model wet-bulb temperatures (Tw) and a recently developed background precipitation classification algorithm.

Through this law [P.L. 111-353], the Food and Drug Administration will establish mandatory minimum standards based on known safety risks for the safe production and harvesting of produce.  As the new law is implemented, continuing to assess consumer perceptions regarding produce safety will be particularly important, for those perceptions will allow stakeholders within the supply chain to better meet consumer demand.  \n\nThe purpose of this study was to assess Pennsylvania consumer perceptions of produce safety and various factors that affect those perceptions.  Using data collected among Pennsylvania consumers, this study presents evidence documenting how consumer demographics, along with their preferences for specific attributes in fresh produce, such as locally grown, organically grown, and inspected for food safety, affect their produce safety perceptions.  In order to determine these relationships, telephone interviews with randomly sampled Pennsylvania consumers were conducted.  Interviews included questions about consumers\u2019 produce safety perceptions, their preferences for local produce, organic produce, and produce that has been inspected for on-farm food safety, as well as demographic information.  A total of 604 Pennsylvania consumers provided valid data, for a survey cooperation rate of 71.6%.\n\nAmong the most significant results from this study are that Pennsylvania consumers, regardless of gender, race, age, educational level, financial status, or residential location, believed produce safety is an important issue.  A multivariate analysis also determined that preferences for locally grown produce, organically grown produce, and produce that has been inspected for on-farm food safety were the most significant predictors of produce safety perceptions among consumers.  Those who more strongly preferred these produce attributes placed higher importance on the issue of produce safety.  The only demographic variable that emerged in the multivariate analysis as a significant predictor of produce safety perceptions was income group.  Those in lower income groups perceived the issue of produce safety as more important than those in higher income groups.  \n\nThe results from this study provide important information for other groups of stakeholders seeking to implement practices that reduce the risk of foodborne contamination.  A better understanding of consumer produce safety perceptions and preferences will allow stakeholder groups, including growers and supermarkets, to make better informed decisions regarding their food safety policies and practices.  Communicating this information to supermarkets and produce growers is particularly important, for these groups are not likely to capitalize on market opportunities without a thorough understanding of consumer perceptions.  Extension, therefore, can fill a critical role as a communications facilitator among these groups of stakeholders.

As this market-oriented development approach gains prominence, research must investigate how value chains interact with local places and the livelihoods of the people who live there. Through a case study of one community in the Peruvian central highlands and the native potato value chains implemented there, this study explores the horizontal dynamics among community livelihoods and vertical dynamics among value chain actors.\n\nBased in Actor-oriented Perspectives (AP) theory, this study posits that development is (re)constructed by the actors participating. Though a mixed methods approach, this study investigated the experiences that households have had since a national NGO implemented native potato value chains with (trans)national corporations. During five months of fieldwork, 149 of 152 households (98%) were surveyed and 36 interviews were conducted among community members, NGO coordinators, and company executives. Multivariate regression and thematic analysis explored specific livelihood components of community members: dietary quality, project participation, on-farm diversification, livelihood activity diversification, social interaction, and demographics. Analysis also considered the native potato value chains and how the livelihood decisions of community members influence their structure and function.\n \nAccording to the findings, farmers recognize economic and social benefits of value chains, yet struggle to adhere to quality requirements, are frustrated by inconsistencies in demand, and lack organizational capacity. The facilitating NGO stretches its resources across civil society and commercial functions, and purchasing firms are detached from development objectives. These value chains have not negatively affected potato biodiversity, although social stratification existed according to project participation. Participating households were found to have higher dietary diversity, though this likely has less to do with any causal effects of the project than participation itself acting as a marker of social status. Significant predictors of dietary diversity also included animal ownership, social interaction, and crop diversification. Beyond dietary diversity, social/cultural acceptability and stability were identified as other relevant food security components. Findings also revealed that households are dedicating their potato production increasingly to home consumption as they pursue other livelihood activities, sometimes out of necessity and sometimes because other activities are deemed more lucrative. Decreasing commercial production limits the scalability and sustainability of native potato value chains. \n\nBased on the findings, several recommendations emerged. To increase value chain viability, actors\u2019 roles and objectives must be mutually established, and enhancing capacity of farmer associations must constitute a primary programmatic focus. In order to mitigate social stratification, support must also be given to the commodity and informal market outlets that households typically access. Expanding economic opportunities in the region should be pursued through projects based on product transformation and high value alternative crops. Agroecological projects in particular can simultaneously address production constraints and fears that pesticide residues cause health problems. By targeting both the function of value chains and the livelihoods of local producers, pro-poor value chains can be beneficial in ways that avoid damaging social and ecological consequences.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10167], "author_name_tesi": "Tobin, Daniel  ", "last_name_ssi": "Tobin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark A Brennan Jr.", "Mark A Brennan Jr.", "Rama B Radhakrishna", "Leland Luther Glenna", "Ricky M Bates", "Richard Schuhmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark A Brennan Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Mark A Brennan Jr., Committee Chair", "Rama B Radhakrishna, Committee Member", "Leland Luther Glenna, Committee Member", "Ricky M Bates, Committee Member", "Richard Schuhmann, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pro-poor value chains", "Livelihoods", "Smallholding farmers", "Food security", "Biodiversity", "Andean agriculture", "Collective capacity"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Thermal Sanitizing Treatments for Eliminating Listeria Monocytogenes from Industrial Mushroom Disc Slicing Equipment", "id": "m613mx563", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13126", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Listeria monocytogenes can colonize processing environments and transfer to food contact equipment. Current industrial mushroom slicers consist of successive cutting disks aligned and separated by spacers. This design makes complete disassembly for cleaning and sanitizing time consuming and therefore, impractical. Although current industry practice is to remove the slicer head for submersion in hot water, this practice must be validated for elimination of L. monocytogenes. In this study, effective thermal sanitization treatment parameters for mushroom disk slicers were determined. \nA 6-strain L. monocytogenes cocktail was prepared from the most heat tolerant strains isolated from mushrooms, environmental samples, and non-mushroom associated outbreaks. The cocktail was used to determine the effect of incubation time on heat tolerance of L. monocytogenes in planktonic and surface adhered forms. Planktonic cells heat treated immediately after inoculation were the most heat tolerant growth state and were used to study thermal destruction kinetics of L. monocytogenes and L. innocua. Thermal death time curves were generated by immersing samples in a circulating water bath at 50, 60, and 70\u00b0C for up to 150 minutes and D values were calculated for 50, 60, and 70\u00b0C. L. innocua had equal or greater heat tolerance compared to L. monocytogenes cells and was therefore a suitable non-pathogenic surrogate for use in subsequent pilot plant thermal sanitization validation studies.\nHeat penetration into the mushroom slicer during immersion in a temperature-controlled, recirculating, clean-out of-place (COP) wash tank filled with water heated to 55, 65, and 75\u00b0C was studied using embedded thermocouples and a data logger. A similar study was performed using moist air heated at 85\u00b0C. Spacers on the top axle heated slightly more slowly than those on the bottom axle. Therefore, the inner circumference of the spacer on the top axle was used as the inoculation site in the subsequent pilot plant validation study. \nThe achievable inoculum concentration on the inner circumference and the previously calculated D-values at 50, 60, and 70\u00b0C were used to calculate times required to achieve at least 7 log reductions of L. innocua at tank water temperatures of 55, 65, and 75\u00b0C. After each treatment temperature and time combination, L. innocua was undetectable after enrichment. The same results can be achieved using moist air heated to 85oC. This thermal sanitization validation study can therefore be used to provide practical recommendations to the mushroom industry for eliminating L. monocytogenes on mushroom slicers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12326], "author_name_tesi": "Tobin, Hilary Maureen", "last_name_ssi": "Tobin", "middle_name_ssi": "Maureen", "first_name_ssi": "Hilary", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luke LaBorde, Ph.D.", "Catherine Nettles Cutter, Ph.D.", "Ramaswamy C.

The theoretical framework of the study was grounded in in the phenomenology of the body of philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and the work of psychologists who have studied writing and healing. The study focused on four creative writers who explored their body awareness as it informed their writing process.  Data collection consisted of two participant interviews, one at the beginning and one at the end of the study, and journals kept by the participants during the six-week period where they were engaged in exercises intended to increase body awareness.  The participants\u2019 narratives were analyzed for emergent themes and connections.   \nThe findings revealed first, that participants shared stories of being encouraged to write as children, and how writing became a source of creativity and consolation.  Second and related, their writing became an effective tool for coping with emotional and physical turmoil revealing implications for healing. Third, their engagement in activities intended to increase body awareness seemed to increase their ability to get into a state of flow, where they were able to tap into embodied knowledge, thus writing from a more holistic and embodied perspective.

In adult brain, OPCs are the principal cell type involved in myelin repair and remyelination. Therefore, understanding factors that govern development and survival of oligodendrocytes is important not only for a complete understanding of normal brain development, but also may aid in elucidating pathogenesis and identify therapeutic targets of dysmyelinating disorders. Hence, the purpose of this thesis project was the identification of Tim-2 protein as novel cellular receptor for the uptake of extracellular H-ferritin in developing oligodendrocytes, and characterization of how this molecular system may play a physiologic role in iron acquisition and pathologic relevance in oligodendrocyte dysfunction and destruction in two demyelinating disorders: perinatal vanadium toxicity and multiple sclerosis. \nIn support of the thesis, we demonstrate that Tim-2 is expressed on cells of oligodendroglial lineage in rodent Central Nervous System (CNS) both in vivo and in vitro, that the pattern of Tim-2 expression overlaps with pattern of H-ferritin binding in oligodendrocytes, and that Tim-2 expression can be regulated by iron in the oligodendrocyte CG4 line. Blocking antibodies to the extracellular domain of Tim-2 nearly completely abate specific binding of H-ferritin to primary OPCs and CG4 oligodendrocyte cell line, suggesting that binding and uptake of H-ferritin in oligodendrocytes is dependent on Tim-2. In vitro, we demonstrate that H-ferritin stimulates differentiation of OPCs, and can replace iron and support growth and survival of OPCs in the absence of transferrin, which was previously considered to be an essential growth factor of oligodendrocytes. Collectively, this part of the thesis suggests that transferrin and H-ferritin, with their respective receptors, are complementary and alternative iron acquisition systems in oligodendrocytes. Because the H-ferritin delivered iron in oligodendrocytes can be red-ox active, and because of intrinsic vulnerability of OPCs to oxidative stress, we evaluated the contribution of the H-ferritin iron delivery pathway to vanadium toxicity, because the chief neurological consequence of early postnatal exposure to this metal is hypomyelination. We show that vanadium exposure in the early post-natal period results in selective destruction of OPCs in vivo and in vitro, an effect which is accompanied by cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and increase of apoptotic indices of OPCs. Vanadium cytotoxicity on OPCs was increased by iron and H-ferritin treatment, and was decreased by the iron chelator desferroxamine (DFO), suggesting an interaction between H-ferritin-delivered iron and vanadium. Using a supercoiled DNA relaxation assay, we demonstrate iron-dependent synergistic effect of vanadium and ferritin on DNA nicking, which suggests that vanadium interaction with ferritin may promote unregulated release of red-ox active iron with consequent oxidative stress and apoptosis. Lastly, we demonstrate that the other reported ligand of Tim-2 in the immune system, class IV semaphoprin Sema4A, is overexpressed within active MS plaques as compared to normal white matter. Sema4A primarily immunolocalized within infiltrating lymphocytes and activated microglia within the plaques. We demonstrate that recombinant Sema4A-Fc chimera collapses processes and causes apoptosis of oligodendrocyte progenitors in culture, which carries significant implications for pathogenesis of remyelination failure within MS plaque. We also found that Sema4A preferentially binds to OPCs over astrocytes, but we find no evidence of Sema4A binding dependence on Tim-2, suggesting that Sema4A acts on oligodendrocytes through an alternative receptor, most likely of the Plexin family.\nIn summary, we demonstrate a novel molecular pathway for iron assimilation involving H-ferritin and its receptor Tim-2, which appears to play important physiological and pathological role developing oligodendrocytes. Identifying regulatory mechanisms of this pathway as well as human orthologue of this pathway are important future research directions. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [813], "author_name_tesi": "Todoric, Bozo ", "last_name_ssi": "Todoric", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bozo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "James Robert Connor", "Richard Bruce Tenser", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Robert J Milner", "William E Seaman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Dissertation Advisor", "James Robert Connor, Committee Chair", "Richard Bruce Tenser, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Robert J Milner, Committee Member", "William E Seaman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["iron", "demyelinating disease", "oligodendrocytes"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Hot Jupiter Atmospheres with the Spitzer Space Telescope", "id": "19209", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9210", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I analyze Spitzer Space Telescope observations of seven transiting hot Jupiters during the time of secondary eclipse, the portion of the planet\u2019s orbit when it is behind the star from the point of view of a Solar System observer. For six of them, HAT-P-3b, HAT-P-4b, HAT-P-6b, HAT-P-8b, HAT-P-12b and XO-4b, I analyze broadband photometric light curves at 3.6 and 4.5 \u03bcm. I compare the resulting eclipse depths, which are a measure of the planets\u2019 dayside emission, to model emergent spectra by Burrows\net al. and Fortney et al. The atmosphere of XO-4b has a strong temperature inversion,\nHAT-P-6b has weak or no temperature inversion, HAT-P-8b has a non-inverted atmosphere. The models are inconclusive about the temperature structure of the atmospheres of HAT-P-3b and HAT-P-4b. I find that HAT-P-3b, HAT-P-4b and HAT-P-8b have relatively inefficient heat transport from their day sides to their night sides. The models suggest moderate to low heat transport for XO-4b and HAT-P-6b. I discuss the\nphysical implications of my results in the context of theoretical and empirical hypotheses\non correlations related to the temperature-pressure structures of the atmospheres and the efficiency of energy transfer to the night side of the planet. In particular, I focus on the idea by Knutson et al. that planets with chromospherically active host stars may in general not have a stratosphere-like temperature inversions, while a quiet host star\nmay lead to an inverted atmosphere. Another hypothesis I examine is that by Cowan and Agol and Perna et al. who suggest that the hottest planets have a narrow range of permitted heat redistribution efficiencies and, thus, high day-night contrasts.\n\nThe seventh object I study is HD 189733b.

Some of these data sets have been analyzed in the past by Grillmair et al., however eight of them are examined here for the first time. I use the latest analysis techniques to remove the systematic effects from the spectral light curves, and measure the secondary eclipse depths as a function of wavelength. I compare the results with three emergent spectrum models I compute using a modified version of a radiative transfer code by Richardson et al., and with the best fit model by Burrows et al. that Grillmair et al. adopt. I exclude isothermal and gray atmospheres with a high degree of confidence and confirm the water feature detected by Grillmair et al.

In particular, the introduction of exotic forest pests is increasing globally, frequently resulting in decline and die-off of affected forest types. The loss of foundational forest species can drastically change the structure and composition of vegetation communities in forests, a phenomenon that holds strong implications for avian communities. However, little research has focused on the long-term effects of forest die-off at a community-wide scale. \nTo examine the response of bird communities to forest die-off, we studied the community associated with declining eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) forests affected by the introduced hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). We conducted variable-radius point counts to survey bird communities in both hemlock and hardwood stands in 2000, during early stages of adelgid infestation, and again in 2015 and 2016, following significant hemlock decline. We also measured the severity of hemlock decline and associated vegetation variables in the same hemlock stands where avian surveys occurred. We used multi-species occupancy models to examine species-specific and species group responses to hemlock decline. Results showed that hemlock basal area declined to varying degrees across the hemlock stands, and that hemlock decline was correlated with current vegetation structure, including an increased deciduous understory. Hemlock-associated bird species declined between the two time periods, while all other species groups responded positively, with the strongest responses in species associated with the shrub-layer, forest edge, and mature deciduous habitat. Species composition in hemlock and hardwood stands became more correlated over time, highlighting a trend toward homogenization of the avian community as the unique species assemblages in hemlock stands give way to the avian community of the surrounding hardwood landscape. Where hemlock-associated species persisted, their presence was correlated with the combined effect of greater hemlock basal area and better hemlock condition. Our results demonstrate that the decline and die-off of foundational forest species can restructure vegetation communities and their associated avian communities over time, with strong implications for forest type specialists.  \nDue to regional variation in patterns of forest die-off and community composition, understanding impacts on forest-dependent communities requires examining response at broad spatial and temporal scales. To determine how the responses to forest die-off that we observed in the avian community may vary across a large regional scale, we examined bird communities in hemlock stands at four sites across the range of hemlock woolly adelgid in the northeastern/mid-Appalachian regions of the United States. We surveyed the avian community in earlier stages of infestation and again following hemlock decline, and analyzed this data using a multi-species occupancy modeling approach. Despite variability among sites in characteristics of the avian community and of the die-off itself, changes in species richness over time were similar across all sites. Hemlock-associated bird species declined at all sites, with concurrent increases in other species groups, especially those associated with forest edge and shrub-layer habitats. Finer-scale variation in the magnitude of avian response coincided with the varying stages of hemlock decline across sites. Species-specific trends showed that Acadian Flycatcher declined most consistently across this large regional scale. Understanding these patterns is critical to predicting and preparing for changes to not only forested landscapes affected by the loss of hemlock, but also for those that will experience similar die-offs as forest pest introductions increase globally.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15710], "author_name_tesi": "Toenies, Matthew John", "last_name_ssi": "Toenies", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Miller", "Matthew Marshall", "Margaret Brittingham"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Miller, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew Marshall, Committee Member", "Margaret Brittingham, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tsuga canadensis", "Empidonax virescens", "Setophaga virens", "birds", "community", "forest die-off", "Adelges tsugae", "decline", "occupancy", "response"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Kinetic Modeling and Sensitivity Analysis of Plasma-assisted Combustion", "id": "27303", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11902", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Plasma-assisted combustion (PAC) is a promising combustion enhancement technique that shows great potential for applications to a number of different practical combustion systems. In this dissertation, the chemical kinetics associated with PAC are investigated numerically with a newly developed model that describes the chemical processes induced by plasma. To support the model development, experiments were performed using a plasma flow reactor in which the fuel oxidation proceeds with the aid of plasma discharges below and above the self-ignition thermal limit of the reactive mixtures. The mixtures used were heavily diluted with Ar in order to study the reactions with temperature-controlled environments by suppressing the temperature changes due to chemical reactions. The temperature of the reactor was varied from 420 K to 1250 K and the pressure was fixed at 1 atm. Simulations were performed for the conditions corresponding to the experiments and the results are compared against each other. Important reaction paths were identified through path flux and sensitivity analyses. Reaction systems studied in this work are oxidation of hydrogen, ethylene, and methane, as well as the kinetics of NOx in plasma.\nIn the fuel oxidation studies, reaction schemes that control the fuel oxidation are analyzed and discussed. With all the fuels studied, the oxidation reactions were extended to lower temperatures with plasma discharges compared to the cases without plasma. The analyses showed that radicals produced by dissociation of the reactants in plasma plays an important role of initiating the reaction sequence. At low temperatures where the system exhibits a chain-terminating nature, reactions of HO2 were found to play important roles on overall fuel oxidation. The effectiveness of HO2 as a chain terminator was weakened in the ethylene oxidation system, because the reactions of C2H4 + O that have low activation energies deflects the flux of O atoms away from HO2. For the ethylene and methane oxidation systems, the reaction pathways important for the formation of intermediate species are discussed. The reactions of CH3 and C2H5 were found to influence the production channels of minor species.\nIn the studies on the kinetics of NOx in plasma, several mechanistic insights were obtained, including the identification of formation and consumption steps of N2O and the extensive review of three NO formation schemes found in the current reaction mechanism.

This is important because creative ideas are often filtered out during this process due to people\u2019s inadvertent bias against creativity, decreasing the likelihood of innovation that is crucial for long-term economic success. Therefore, research is needed that examines how variations in commonly utilized design activities affect creative idea generation and how factors such as an individual\u2019s risk attitudes, the structure of the problem, and representations of concept creativity affect the flow of creative ideas during the concept selection stage of the design process. In this thesis, the results of three experimental studies with 136 engineering students are reported. The results of this thesis show that participants who interact with physical examples generate ideas with less novelty and focus less on the functional aspects of design compared to participants who interact with pictorial examples.\n\nThe first study was developed to understand the impacts of different types of designer- product interactions that are commonly practiced in engineering. This study showed that participants who interact with examples in a more meaningful way (through product dissection) also produce ideas with more variety than those who merely visually inspect them. The second and third studies of this thesis were geared at investigating the factors that impact creative idea selection during concept selection in engineering design. These studies show that participants who are more prone to risk-taking are found to select more creative ideas during concept selection. On the other hand, participants who are more tolerant of ambiguity tend to generate ideas with more novelty than participants who are less tolerant of ambiguity. Lastly, the results show that the structure of the problem and the representation of creativity presented to participants can also influence the selection of creative ideas during the design process. Overall, the results of this thesis add to our understanding of the factors that contribute to the flow of creative ideas from concept generation to concept development.
