In practice, data are often complex and in large scale. The data may be high dimensional, have missing values, or contain objects that are not well defined in a vector space. The flexibility of mixture models enables us to model the distribution of complex and large-scale data and estimate their probability densities. In this dissertation, we present several new mixture models that extend such application.\n\nA two-way Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is proposed for classifying high dimensional data. This model regularizes the mixture component means by dividing variables into groups and then constraining the parameters for the variables in the same group to be identical. The grouping of the variables is not pre-determined, but rather it is optimized as part of model estimation. A dimension reduction property for a two-way mixture of distributions from a general exponential family is proved. The issue of missing values that tend to arise when the dimension is extremely high is addressed. Estimation methods for the two-way Gaussian mixture with or without missing data are derived. Experiments on several real data sets show that the parsimonious two-way mixture often outperforms a mixture model without variable grouping, and as a byproduct, significant dimension reduction is achieved.\n\nWe propose a new approach for mixture modeling based only upon pairwise distances via the concept of hypothetical local mapping (HLM).  This work is motivated by increasingly commonplace applications involving complex objects that cannot be effectively represented by tractable mathematical entities. The new modeling approach consists of two steps. A distance-based clustering algorithm is applied first. Then HLM takes as input the distances between the training data and their corresponding cluster centroids and estimates the model parameters. In the special case where all the training data are taken as cluster centroids, we obtain a distance-based kernel density. We have examined the classification performance of the mixture models on many data sets. Experimental comparisons have been made with other state-of-the-art distance-based classification methods, for instance,\nk-NN, variations of k-NN, and SVM based algorithms. It is found that HLM based algorithms are highly competitive in terms of classification accuracy, and in the mean time are computationally efficient during both training and testing. Furthermore, the HLM based modeling approach adapts readily to incremental learning, a valuable mechanism\nto achieve scalability for dynamic data arriving at a high velocity. We have developed two schemes of incremental learning and tested them on several data sets.\n\nDriven by demands in visual analytics, we investigate a GMM with component means constrained in a pre-selected subspace, which allows us to visualize the clustering or classification structure of high dimension data in a lower dimensional subspace. We prove that the subspace containing the component means of a GMM with a common covariance matrix also contains the modes of the density and the class means. This finding motivates us to identify a subspace by applying weighted principal component analysis to the modes of a kernel density and class means. For choosing the kernel bandwidth, we acquire multiple subspaces from the kernel densities based on a sequence of bandwidths. The GMM constrained by each subspace is estimated, and the model yielding the maximum likelihood is chosen. A dimension reduction property is proved in the sense of being informative for classification or clustering. Experiments on real and simulated data sets are conducted to examine several ways of determining the subspace and to compare with the reduced rank mixture discriminant analysis (MDA). Our new method with the simple technique of spanning the subspace only by class means often outperforms the reduced rank MDA when the subspace dimension is very low, making it particularly appealing for visualization. \n\nFinally, to bridge the computational gap between information visualization and data mining in visual analytics, we implement two parallel versions of hierarchical mode association clustering (HMAC), a previously proposed nonparametric method that groups data points into a cluster if they are associated with the same mode of a mixture-type density. Parallel HMAC runs on a cluster of compute nodes using the message passing interface (MPI) library and dramatically improves the speed of the original algorithm, making it feasible to perform clustering on large-scale data.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8001], "author_name_tesi": "Qiao, Mu ", "last_name_ssi": "Qiao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jia Li", "James Z Wang", "Jia Li", "Daniel Kifer", "Jesse Louis Barlow", "Xiaolong Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jia Li, Dissertation Advisor", "James Z Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jia Li, Committee Chair", "Daniel Kifer, Committee Chair", "Jesse Louis Barlow, Committee Member", "Xiaolong Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mixture models", "complex", "large scale", "high dimensional classification", "clustering", "visualization"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF GEOMETRIC EFFECTS INDUCED BY 90\u00b0 VERTICAL ELBOWS IN AIR-WATER TWO-PHASE FLOW", "id": "13858szq105", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13858", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conventional modeling of two-phase flows is typically based on experimental data acquired in straight flow channels of different flow orientations with no flow restrictions.  No model is currently available to dynamically predict the transition between different flow orientations.  To bridge this gap, it is important to characterize and model the geometric effects induced by flow restrictions or junctions in air-water two-phase flows.  The present work investigates the effects of a 90\u00b0 vertical-upward to horizontal and a 90\u00b0 horizontal to vertical-downward elbow on two-phase flow and establishes the interfacial area transport equation (IATE) applicable to air-water two-phase flow influenced by the 90\u00b0 elbows.  A detailed database for the local and global two-phase flow parameters in different flow orientations and across vertical elbows is established with state-of-the-art four-sensor conductivity probes, a pressure transducer, and a high-speed video camera.  The elbow effects are characterized by investigating the evolution of void fraction, interfacial area concentration, bubble velocity and two-phase pressure drop across and downstream of elbows.  The degree of influence made by the elbow is characterized by the variance of void fraction.  The axial development of the flow downstream of the elbow is modeled by an exponential function of the axial length based on the experimental data.  Then, the dissipation length of the elbow is determined by characterizing the evolution of the elbow strength parameter.  The elbow strength parameter is also used to correlate the void-weighted bubble velocity and covariance terms in the IATE.  The two-phase pressure drop across the vertical elbows is modeled with a modified Lockhart-Martinelli correlation that considers the minor loss induced by these elbows.  The developed models and correlations are implemented into the IATE to establish a model that is applicable to the region influenced by the elbow.  The established IATE is evaluated by the data obtained in different flow orientations and across elbows in bubbly flow.  The newly developed IATE can predict the interfacial area concentration with an average percent difference of \u00b16% compared with the experimental data, demonstrating that the models and correlations developed in this work for the two-phase flow parameters in elbow influenced regions are reliable.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15852], "author_name_tesi": "Qiao, Shouxu ", "last_name_ssi": "Qiao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shouxu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seungjin Kim", "Seungjin Kim", "Marek Flaska", "Alex Rattner", " Hojong Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seungjin Kim, Dissertation Advisor", "Seungjin Kim, Committee Chair", "Marek Flaska, Committee Member", "Alex Rattner, Committee Member", " Hojong Kim, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["elbow effects", "dissipation length", "pressure drop", "interfacial area transport", "Two-phase flow", "Elbow effects", "Dissipation length", "Pressure drop", "Interfacial area transport"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Leadership Development in China:How the companies develop their leaders and what critical factors contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of leadership development practices", "id": "7187", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6685", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to investigate how companies in China develop their leaders, and to identify the key factors that contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of leadership development practices in China.

In the substantive domain, the findings of this study presented an overview of current leadership development practices in China. When compared with the best practices found throughout the world, it points to future directions for leadership development in China.\n\nThis study adopted a multiple-case study design. Four companies\u00a8C\u00a8CABB, BenQ, Lenovo and Motorola\u00a8C\u00a8Cwere studied in China. The data collected included interviews, which served as primary data, and documents, as secondary data. The interview data were collected from the CEO (whenever possible), HR professionals, training professionals, line managers and high potentials using pre-developed interview guides. A total of 40 people participated in the interviews. \n\nBased upon study data, the researcher concluded that, first, the four companies in China developed their leaders in more or less the same way as their counterparts in the United States, but in a less structured and formalized fashion. The needs assessment phase and measuring the effectiveness of leadership development were the two components apparently left far behind. The researcher contended that this was due in part to the fact that few human resources development professionals in China have formal education background in the HRD field. Second, the Leadership Development with Impact model works well in the Chinese context. In addition to the five major factors identified in this model, additional factors were revealed in this study as key factors contributing to enhancing the effectiveness of leadership development practices, including top management support, corporate culture, communication, execution, etc.\n\nThe findings of this study have a number of important implications for both researchers and practitioners in the leadership development field. As the companies under study each demonstrate their excellence in different aspects of the leadership development process, together their experiences reveal excellence in leadership development that will no doubt provide benchmarking examples for other companies in China. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6682], "author_name_tesi": "Qiao, Xuejun ", "last_name_ssi": "Qiao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xuejun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edgar Paul Yoder", "Albert Vicere", "William J Rothwell", "Thomas E Chermack"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Albert Vicere, Committee Member", "William J Rothwell, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Chermack, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["succession planning", "human resources development", "Leadership development"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Analysis on Singular Spaces: Applications of Operator Algebras to Boundary Value Problems", "id": "12056", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6861", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis explores the Method of Layer Potentials on domains with conical points.

These luminous discharges often exhibit a brief descending high-altitude diffuse glow in the shape of a pancake with diameters up to ~80 km near ~75 km altitude, referred to as a sprite halo, and develop into fine-structured filaments with diameters up to several hundred meters in the altitude range of ~40 to ~90 km, commonly referred to as sprite streamers. Since the first video documentation, sprites have attracted extensive research interest in the last two decades, primarily due to their potential as natural resources for the study of streamer physics, their great impact on the chemistry in the upper atmosphere, and their ability to perturb the subionospheric radio signals. However, up to date, the inception mechanism of sprite streamers, the origin of different sprite morphology, the lightning polarity asymmetry in producing sprites, and the characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation from sprites remain outstanding issues to be resolved. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the above-mentioned outstanding issues through numerical modeling of sprite halos and sprite streamers using a previously introduced plasma fluid model and some newly developed models and simulation techniques.\n\nThe first outstanding issue that is addressed by this dissertation is the inception mechanism of sprite streamers. Although the streamer nature of sprites has been explained theoretically and confirmed experimentally, how these filamentary plasmas are initiated in the lower ionosphere has not yet been well understood, as many spatial and temporal features of sprites in their initial stage cannot be explained by the modeling studies in the existing literature. To better understand the initiation of sprite streamers, a plasma fluid model, an improved avalanche-to-streamer transition criterion, and a 'two-step' technique are used to numerically simulate the initiation of sprite streamers from electron density inhomogeneities during the development of a sprite halo. The reported modeling results suggest an original mechanism for the inception of sprite streamers. This mechanism specifically explains the spatial and temporal offsets between sprite streamers and the preceding sprite halo, the 10s to 100s millisecond long delay of some sprites with respect to the onset of their causal lightning discharge, and the initiation of sprite streamers by lightning discharges associated with charge moment changes as small as ~200 C km. The inception of sprite streamers is demonstrated to depend strongly on the charge moment change of the causative lightning discharge and the ambient conditions in the lower ionosphere (i.e., the ambient electron density profile and electron density inhomogeneities), which together determine the size and location of the streamer initiation region. We specifically emphasize the crucial role of electron density inhomogeneities in the lower ionosphere for the initiation of sprite streamers, especially in the case of small charge moment changes.\n\nIn the last two decades, video observations have revealed the complexity of sprite morphology, showing that sprites can be composed of many distinct, spatially separated filamentary streamers with a complex mixture of sizes, orientations and shapes. Generally, sprites are classified into carrot sprites, that exhibit both upward and downward propagating streamers, and column sprites, that contain predominantly vertical downward streamers. The origin of these different sprite morphologies is the second outstanding issue that is addressed by this dissertation. In order to find out the physical conditions that lead to the production of carrot sprites and column sprites, we study the dependence of sprite morphology on lightning characteristics and upper atmospheric ambient conditions. It is demonstrated that the morphology of sprites is mainly determined by the characteristics of their causative lightning discharges, namely the polarity, the total charge moment change, the impulsiveness of the return stroke, and the strength of the continuing current. A detailed relation between the above-mentioned lightning characteristics and the sprite morphology is established. We also quantify the impact of lower ionospheric ambient conditions (i.e., the ambient electron and ion density) on the threshold charge moment changes required to produce column sprites and carrot sprites.\n\nAnother well-known puzzle is that sprites are almost exclusively produced by positive cloud-to-ground lightning discharges (+CGs), and that 'negative sprites' (produced by -CGs) are extremely rare, with only nine events documented in the existing literature compared to thousands of their positive counterparts. To understand the lightning polarity asymmetry in producing sprites, we investigate possible differences between the requirements for the initiation of positive and negative sprites. A parametric study shows that positive sprites require an ambient electric field with smaller magnitude and shorter persistence when compared to those required for the initiation of negative sprites. Consequently, the initiation of positive sprites requires a smaller threshold charge moment change than that of negative sprites (320 C km and 500 C km, respectively, under typical nighttime conditions). This difference between the initiation thresholds represents one of the key factors accounting for the polarity asymmetry of sprites. Other factors, including the charge moment contrast of +CGs and -CGs, and the differences originating from physical properties of streamers and observability of positive and negative sprites are also discussed.\n\nFurthermore, radio atmospherics observed in association with sprites demonstrate that significant electrical current is flowing in the body of sprites, which produces detectable electromagnetic radiation typically observed in the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) band. In the previous literature, it was generally believed that sprites were unable to produce radio signals with higher frequencies in the Very Low Frequency (VLF) to Low Frequency (LF) range. Up to date, no theoretical work exists that is dedicated to studies of the possible VLF and LF radio signals from sprites. This dissertation work presents the first theoretical estimates of the electromagnetic radiation produced by individual sprite streamers using simulation results from plasma fluid modeling. It is demonstrated that the spectral content of the sprite radiation is highly dependent on the air density and the ambient electric field, i.e., sprite streamers propagating at lower altitudes with higher air density or propagating in a higher electric field produce a higher frequency radiation. Most interestingly, we quantitatively demonstrate that sprite streamers at low altitudes (~40 km) can produce VLF and LF radiation, that needs to be confirmed by future radio observations.\n\nFinally, this dissertation work presents research efforts that are devoted to a direct comparison of morphological features predicted by the streamer model with those appearing in video observations in order to derive the mechanism of column and carrot sprites from optical and radio observations, a direct comparison of optical emissions produced by the modeled halo events and high-speed video observations in order to develop a useful remote sensing technique to study the poorly known ambient conditions in the lower ionosphere, and an investigation of the impact of successive lightning strokes that are separated by tens of milliseconds on the initiation and propagation of sprite streamers.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8277], "author_name_tesi": "Qin, Jianqi ", "last_name_ssi": "Qin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jianqi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko", "Victor P Pasko", "John David Mathews", "Julio Urbina", "Deborah A Levin", "Sebastien Celestin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko, Dissertation Advisor", "Victor P Pasko, Committee Chair", "John David Mathews, Committee Member", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "Deborah A Levin, Committee Member", "Sebastien Celestin, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lightning", "Sprites", "Halo", "Streamers", "Inception", "Morphology", "Radio signals", "Modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "EXPLORING PEDESTRIAN MOVEMENT PATTERNS WITH URBAN  ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN BEIJING", "id": "mg74qm08d", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12481", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research is an exploratory investigation to understand Beijing citizens\u2019 travel modes by looking into their daily movement patterns.

This thesis examines systems where market changes and production technology advances happen frequently and unpredictably during the PLC, causing difficulties in predicting an appropriate demand on the knowledge workforce and in maintaining reliable performance. Knowledge workforce agility (KWA) is identified as a desirable means for addressing the difficulties, and yet previous work on KWA is incomplete. \nThis thesis accomplishes several critical tasks for realizing the benefits of KWA in a representative PLC environment, semiconductor manufacturing. Real options (RO) is chosen as the approach towards exploiting KWA, since RO captures the essence of KWA \u00a8C options in manipulating knowledge capacity, a human asset, or a self-cultivated organizational capability for pursuing interests associated with change. Accordingly, market demand change and workforce knowledge (WK) dynamics in adoption of technology advances are formulized as underlying stochastic processes during the PLC. This thesis models KWA as capacity options in a knowledge workforce and develops a RO approach of workforce training, either initial or continuous, for generating options. To quantify the elements of KWA that impact production, the role of the knowledge workforce in production and costs in obtaining KWA are characterized mathematically. It creates necessary RO valuation methods and techniques to optimize KWA. \nAn analytical examination of the PLC models identifies that KWA has potential to reduce negative impacts and generate opportunities in an environment of volatile demand, and to compensate unreliable performance of knowledge workforce in adoption of technology advances. The benefits of KWA are especially important when confronting highly volatile demand, a low initial adoption level, shrinking PLCs, a growing market size, intense and frequent WK dynamics, insufficient learning capability of employees, or diminishing returns from investments in learning. The thesis further assesses RO, as an agility-driven approach, by comparing it to a chase-demand heuristic and to the Bass forecasting model under demand uncertainty. The assessment demonstrates that the KWA attained from the RO approach, termed RO-based KWA, leads to a stably higher yield, to a persistently larger net present value (NPV), and to a NPV distribution that is more robust to highly volatile demand. Subsequently, a quantitative evaluation of KWA value shows that the RO-based KWA creates a considerable profit growth, either with uncertainty in demand or in the WK dynamics. In evaluation, RO modeling and the RO valuation are identified to be useful in creation of KWA value especially in highly uncertain PLC environments.\nThis thesis illustrates the effectiveness of the numerical methods used for solving the dynamic system problem. This research demonstrates an approach for optimizing KWA in PLC environments using RO. It provides an innovative solution for knowledge workforce planning in rapidly changing and highly unexpected environments. The work of this thesis is representative of studying KWA using quantitative techniques, where there is a dearth of quantitative studies in the literature.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5402], "author_name_tesi": "Qin, Ruwen ", "last_name_ssi": "Qin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ruwen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Arthur Nembhard", "Harriet Black Nembhard", "Bryan A Norman", "James Landis Rosenberger", "Tao Yao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Committee Member", "Bryan A Norman, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["knowledge workforce", "agility", "product life cycle", "real options"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "UNDERSTANDING THE DETERMINANTS OF AND MALE/FEMALE DIFFERENCES IN CONSUMER ATTITUDES TOWARDS GETNETICALLY ENGINEERED SALMON", "id": "7436", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6554", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Consumer attitudes towards genetically engineered (GE) foods will determine the future use and expansion of this technology.

The aim of our research was to understand the determinants of consumer attitudes towards introducing GE salmon into the US food supply, to explore male/female differences in these attitudes and to test two plausible hypotheses (safety concern and institutional trust) to elucidate this sex difference. To accomplish these, a series (n=12) focus groups were firstly used to explore participants perceived consequences of and concerns about approval of GE salmon, to examine the level of information needed that would help participants reach an informed opinion, and to observe male/female differences. Then, two pieces of introductory information varying in formats (perspectives vs. consequences) were developed to address the needs voiced in the focus groups. We tested and selected the consequence information for further use as it was likely to motivate the readers to scrutinize the content, achieve significant knowledge gain, and help the readers achieve greater confidence in understanding the issues surrounding the introduction of GE salmon into the food system. \nIn the final step, a survey of 501 individuals was conducted in Pennsylvania. An attitude model (R2~0.8) was developed based on two subsamples using structural equation modeling. The model indicated that positive attitudes towards GE salmon could be promoted by trust in government agencies and industry organizations, higher level of knowledge, and perceived health benefits; and dampened by perceived environmental risks, concerns about unknown effects, ethical issues, and lack of choice. Attitudinal male/female differences were attributed to women\u2019s lower trust in government agencies and scientific organizations, and higher level of perceived health risks compare to men\u2014supporting both the safety concern and institutional trust hypothesis.

This research contributes to the problem in three major aspects: modeling of Internet services via new approaches, more realistic and advanced control designs, and intensive performance evaulations of various design solutions.\n\nModeling wise, it is learned that the linear methods may not be adequate for Internet services modeling when there are large variations in load conditions. Consequently, more sophisticated nonlinear system modeling is needed to improve system performance and robustness with respect to large variations of load conditions. A linear uncertain model and a Linear-Parameter-Varying (LPV) model of hosting center server systems are derived based on theoretical analysis of transient queueing dynamics, as well as LPV system identification, where workload characterizing parameters are utilized as scheduling variables. \n\nExisiting feedback control based performance management for Internet server systems relies on worst-case estimates of load and resource availability thus provisions resources to meet peak demands. Since the worst-case resource demand is likely to be significantly higher than its normal usage, these methods could be economically unfavorable. This work focuses on the development of an LPV control design for the performance management of server where time-varying effects of the system are explicitly considered by utilizing workload arrival and service parameters as scheduling variables. Further, it is widely noticed that workload parameters of Internet services are more or less unpredictable. This makes deterministic modeling and control design approaches either too conservative or unable to meet performance service level agreements (SLA). Probabilistic modeling and control design methods are proposed to balance between the risk of missing performance SLA and the resource efficiency.\n\nRequest level approach to provide response time guarantee based on detailed analysis of requests response time components is studied. A request level scheduling algorithm is proposed that can be used with workload characterization and modeling techniques. Preliminary results in a response time guarantee problem show impressive request level performance over a wide range of sampling intervals. \n\nIntensive simulations are conducted using real Web server workloads. Performances of the proposed LPV based modeling and control design approaches are benchmarked using queueing theory based provisioning results and existing linear control modeling & designs. It is shown that the proposed method outperforms linear control and conventional queueing-theory based designs. These evaluations provide guidelines on which method to use for a particular problem. The results from this research can be easily generalized to accommodate more complicated models in characterizing workloads and server environments to enhance system performance. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6553], "author_name_tesi": "Qin, Wubi ", "last_name_ssi": "Qin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wubi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Qian Wang", "Asok Ray", "Dr Kon Well Wang", "Anand Sivasubramaniam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Qian Wang, Committee Chair", "Asok Ray, Committee Member", "Dr Kon Well Wang, Committee Member", "Anand Sivasubramaniam, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["linear parameter varying systems (lpv)", "internet services", "feedback control", "performance management", "quality of service (qos)", "request level scheduling", "web server"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THERMO-ELASTO-VISCO-PLASTIC MODELLING OF FRICTION STIR WELDING IN AN EULERIAN REFERENCE FRAME\n\n", "id": "9205", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6707", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two sets of stabilized, Galerkin finite element formulations for modeling elasto-visco-plastic material response of quasi-steady state processes in Eulerian frames are presented.

It studies the temporal network structure and impacts on actors at both macro and micro levels. Specifically, social network modeling is the macro-study of network structure. It identifies general principles of link formation that lead to interesting network properties. Link prediction is the micro-study of network structure. It predicts future links between nodes. The impact analysis investigates impacts of links on individual nodes, and impact dynamics of the networks.\n\nAlthough the links between actors in social networks are the results of social interactions between the actors, most of the current network dynamics analysis is link centric. For instance, social network modeling studies networks by simulating individual links. A link centric approach for dynamics analysis has the following problems: 1) difficult to model n-ary ($n>2$) relationship; 2) difficult to include properties of social interaction in modeling network dynamics; 3) difficult to aggregate properties of past social interactions in network modeling and prediction; 4) difficult to analyze impacts of social interactions (on actors and networks) using their properties. \n\nTo solve the problems, we developed new approaches for social dynamics analysis from the perspective of social interactions. Specifically, to model n-ary ($n geq 2$) social interactions and incorporate their properties in modeling networks, we investigate an event-driven social network modeling to model behavior patterns of multi-actors social interactions. To aggregate properties of past social interactions to predict future links between actors, we develop behavior evolution based link prediction to discover temporal behavior patterns for predicting future links. Finally, we use the characteristics of social interactions to investigate the sentiment impact of interactions in an online heath community. \n\nThe experimental results of social network modeling suggest that our event-driven social network modeling can generate realistic networks exhibiting important macroscopic properties, such as power-law degree distribution, hierarchical community structure and assortativity which are similar to real networks. The experimental results of link prediction indicate that our behavior evolution based link prediction approach consistently achieves significant improvement on link prediction accuracy on multiple real networks. Finally, our work in sentiment impact analysis discovers the patterns of sentiment change of members of a online heath community, and identify factors that affect the sentiment change. These research results indicate the benefits of modeling social interactions directly for characterizing and predicting dynamic behaviors of social networks at both macroscopic and microscopic levels.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [861], "author_name_tesi": "Qiu, Baojun ", "last_name_ssi": "Qiu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Baojun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Yen", "John Yen", "Guohong Cao", "Jesse Louis Barlow", "Jia Li", "Qiyang He", "Raj Acharya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Yen, Dissertation Advisor", "John Yen, Committee Chair", "Guohong Cao, Committee Chair", "Jesse Louis Barlow, Committee Member", "Jia Li, Committee Member", "Qiyang He, Committee Member", "Raj Acharya, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["temporal data mining", "machine learning", "Social network analysis", "text mining", "sentiment analysis", "link prediction"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "PersonFinder: Locating People Through On-Demand Crowdsourcing", "id": "14819juq116", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14819", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "On-demand crowdsourcing takes advantage of the ubiquity of mobile devices equipped with high resolution cameras to collect photos on demand from various geographical areas. One promising application is to help search for people in real time. Unlike traditional surveillance cameras, on-demand crowdsourcing allows crowdsourcing photos from anywhere, since mobile users are available everywhere, and hence it can improve the effectiveness of finding the target person. In this thesis, we present PersonFinder, an on-demand crowdsourcing system that enables users to search for the target person anytime and anywhere, and retrieve the results in real time. When a task is generated to search for a person, PersonFinder selects some workers to perform the task from a large number of candidate workers. Then workers use their mobile device to capture photos which are further processed to detect and recognize the target. Finally, the requester receives photos which include the target. We address two key challenges in PersonFinder. First, many candidate workers can be selected to participate in the task, but selecting all of them will significantly increase the cost. To address this challenge, we formulate the worker selection problem as selecting a subset of workers to maximize the probability of finding the target under some budget constraints. We prove its NP-hardness, and propose a heuristic based solution. Second, many photos taken by the workers may not have good quality or may not contain the target person. Transmitting such photos to the server still consumes battery power. To save energy, we design image processing techniques and only transmit images that contain the target person. We also design algorithms to determine whether the image processing will be done locally or offloaded to the server.

It serves as an important regulatory step for gene expression, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Two factors, DRB-sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF) have been recognized as central to the establishment of pausing. They associate with Pol II after it has transcribed around 20 nucleotides and cause Pol II to pause in the promoter proximal region. My work has focused on one of these factors, DSIF. The large subunit of DSIF, Spt5 is a universally conserved transcription elongation factor containing multiple domains. How these domains regulate its multiple functions in transcription is not known. In order to identify regions in Spt5 that are involved in pausing, I constructed Spt5 mutant forms of DSIF and tested their capacity to restore promoter proximal pausing to DSIF-depleted Drosophila nuclear extracts. The C-terminal repeats (CTR) region of Spt5, which has been implicated in both inhibition and stimulation of elongation, is dispensable for promoter proximal pausing. A region encompassing the KOW4 and KOW5 domains of Spt5 is essential for pausing. Mutations in this region reduced the affinity of Spt4/5 to Pol II elongation complex. In addition, mutations in the KOW5 domain shift the location of the pause downstream. Protein-RNA crosslinking analyses reveal that KOW5 directly contacts the nascent transcript and that mutations in KOW5 disrupt this interaction. My results suggest that KOW5 influences the location of the pause through its contact with the nascent transcript. The identification and biochemical analysis of functional domains of Spt5 involved in pausing provide information towards understanding how DSIF contributes to the establishment of pausing. Furthermore, I developed a strategy to evaluate the functions of these mutants in vivo and showed that the KOW4-5 mutants that are pausing-defective in vitro also impair the development of flies. This strategy paves the way for genome-wide analysis on how these mutations affect pausing in vivo.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14145], "author_name_tesi": "Qiu, Yijun ", "last_name_ssi": "Qiu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yijun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Gilmour", "David Scott Gilmour", "Joseph C.

In both of these domains, some categories may be rare or unknown, with very few or no labeled samples to start with. For example, in a network intrusion detection system, following a standard statistical anomaly detection (AD) approach, one would train a null hypothesis, characterizing the normal behavior whose data sources are usually captured in a sandbox environment, and flag any sample that deviates from the norm (above a pre-defined threshold) as anomalies. Naively deploying the null model, however, will flood the administrator with too many uninteresting anomalies to further fully investigate. Thus, it makes sense to further discriminate many of the uninteresting anomalies from the truly interesting ones, and develop an active selection strategy to efficiently forward samples for oracle labeling that help to learn to discriminate these groups. Moreover, the interesting anomalies, which may amount to zero-day threats, are often highly skewed and may only manifest on a very small subset of features. Using all features to identify anomalies will not be advantageous because many features may not be informative/discriminative in practice. We try to design a rare category identification and characterization system that can benefit from 1) statistical AD, 2) a semi-supervised active learning based discriminant classifier, with zero weights given to the irrelevant features, and 3) an active sample selection strategy to select the most likely unknown sample, hence efficiently ranking/forwarding interesting anomalies for the administrator. In terms of 1), we also develop a purely unsupervised learning technique to extract group behavior that jointly exhibits anomalousness on a sample and feature subset. \n \nIn the case of semi-supervised learning, wherein the fundamental idea is to combine the usage of the limited number of labeled training samples and the abundance of unlabeled samples to learn a classifier, we focus on domains where some categories are rare or unknown, with very few or no labeled samples to start with. Unlike the conventional approaches in the mainstream literature, where unlabeled samples are perceived as belonging to one of the known categories and should be leveraged to minimize class posterior uncertainty, we propose a semi-supervised objective that seeks to {\\it preserve} the uncertainty among unlabeled samples, both to avoid overtraining and to help efficiently discover unknown classes. Specifically, using Shannon entropy as the measure of uncertainty, we propose to use max entropy regularization (maxEnt), rather than minimum entropy regularization (minEnt). Moreover, our proposed model in a two class classification problem is convex (unlike minEnt) and it has been shown to outperform in a variety of rare category characterization problems, compared to existing approaches. While semi-supervised learning focuses on exploiting the latent structures hidden in the sample distribution, active learning tries to explore the sample space with the least representation. We combine our maxEnt semi-supervised learning with a novel active learning strategy that together efficiently draw from the pool of unlabeled samples for oracle labeling, to achieve the best class discovery (exploration) and classification (exploitation). \n\nIn the case of anomaly detection, wherein the fundamental idea is to detect significant outliers that deviate from the one class or null hypothesis, we have two contributions to make. First, we propose a group based anomaly detection scheme that identifies the sample and feature subset that jointly manifest the potential anomalous group, with a Bonferroni approximation used to account for multiple testing. Unlike point-wise anomaly detectors, our model has the potential to jointly identify which of the sample and feature subsets are most atypical with respect to the null, thus avoiding most point-wise, superficial outliers and efficiently capturing group anomalies. Second, a singleton and pairwise Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) method is proposed as a novel feature representation to characterize atypicality on each single or pairwise dimension, using p-value as score/feature. This avoids the curse of dimensionality and achieves superior performance, compared to other non-informative feature mapping techniques in the literature.

As an extension of the standard Finite Element Method (FEM),  \nthe GFEM has more flexibility in dealing with complicated domain geometry, corner singularities, transmission problems and mixed boundary conditions.\n It differs from the standard FEM in the construction of the finite-dimensional space in which the approximate solution is sought. Instead of using piecewise polynomials on each element of a triangulation of the domain, the global GFEM space is defined by using partition of unity in combination with local approximation spaces defined in each patch of the partition. In this sense, the GFEM is an example of so called \\emph{meshless methods}, since the partition of unity need not be subordinated to a particular triangulation of the domain as the standard FEM does. The GFEM allows one to incorporate a priori knowledge of the local behavior of the solution in the construction of the approximation space, and gives the option of constructing trial spaces of any desired regularity.\n\n For transmission (interface) problems on domains with smooth, \n curved boundaries, we establish quasi-optimal rate of convergence of the numerical solution to the true solution by using a\nnon-conforming GFEM. To achieve this goal, we construct a sequence of approximation spaces  $S_n$,  satisfying the following two conditions: (1) {\\em nearly zero boundary and interface matching}, (2) {\\em approximability}. We then seek the numerical solution in this spaces as the Galerkin approximation to the true solution, and show that the approximation error of order $O(h_{n}^{m})$, where $h_{n}$ is the typical size of elements in the GFEM space $S_{n}$, and $m$ is the degree of polynomials used for the local approximation of the solution.  Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate these theoretical results.\n\nWe also study the GFEM approximation for Poisson problem in polygonal domains with corner singularities. It is well-known that the loss of regularity of the exact solution due to domain singularities will deteriorate the convergence rate of the standard FEM  on quasi-uniform mesh.  To circumvent this difficult, we pose the problem in  certain weighted Sobolev spaces, and show that the continuous problem has the expected  regularity in these spaces. We then construct GFEM approximation spaces using partition of unity and local approximation spaces. For the former, we use dilation techniques to deal with corner singularities, while we use standard piecewise polynomial spaces for the latter.

While some can be solubilized with surfactants or ethanol, there is a demand for alternative approaches. Casein has been shown to solubilize hydrophobic small molecules, and this might be an attractive option in some applications. Previous studies have shown that ethanol affects the conformation of the casein micelle, and in this work I consider if ethanol may facilitate the loading of sodium caseinate with lipophilic small molecules (i.e., pyrene and piperine). When ethanol and water are removed, I hypothesize the resultant powder can be readily rehydrated to produce an aqueous suspension of piperine- or pyrene-loaded caseinate with a total concentration in considerable excess to the aqueous solubility limit of the compounds.\n\nA large excess of pyrene or piperine was mixed with 2% (w/v) sodium caseinate in buffer (pH 6.7) and ethanol (0-40%, v/v), stirred for 24 h, and lyophilized to remove ethanol and water. The resultant powder was rehydrated in buffer to achieve a 2% casein suspension. The excess, insoluble pyrene or piperine was removed by gentle centrifugation and the concentration of solubilized fraction (i.e., dissolved in water, plus that which was bound to the the casein) was determined by UV-spectroscopy following extraction into acetonitrile or by fluorescence spectroscopy respectively. \n\nPyrene is effectively insoluble in water (i.e., not fluorescing), however, in the presence of the caseinate, it was solubilized and showed a characterized fluorescence spectrum in buffer. The solubility of piperine in water was 49 mg/L, but in the presence of 2% casein (i.e., no ethanol used in preparation), the solubility increased to 134 mg/L (i.e.,50 moles of piperine per mole of caseinate). As the ethanol present at the solubilization step increased, the amount of solubilized piperine in the final product increased to a maximum of 342 mg/L (i.e., 175 moles of piperine per mole of caseinate) in 40% ethanol. I hypothesize that both pyrene and piperine were solubilized in water by binding to caseinate and that ethanol both facilitates mass transport to the protein from the insoluble powder by increasing the aqueous solubility of pyrene/piperine, and changes the conformation of the protein to increase binding. \n\nNext, the in vitro acid and proteolysis digestibility of the casein-pyrene complexes was tested over 48 hours. During the acid digestion, fluorescence dropped to zero immediately, because caseinate precipitated at the isoelectric point (i.e., 4.6) and pyrene remained the binding with precipitated protein.

It suggests that the pyrene is able to be released in the gastrointestinal fluid during the enzymatic digestion.

Investigations on RNase MRP will help elucidate the architectural and mechanistic basis of RNA-based RNP enzymes, and shed light on the pathology of RNase MRP-related human diseases.\n\nThe large size and intricate compositions of yeast RNase MRP complicate direct structural study of the holoenzyme. To overcome this hindrance, the general idea is to dissect the holoenzyme into several stable protein (or protein-RNA) \"subcomplexes\" and analyze them one by one. By using a strategy based on in vitro translation and His-tag pulldown, I was able to identify two protein subcomplexes of RNase MRP. These subcomplexes were coexpressed and copurified in E. coli. Dynamic light scattering results showed that the purified subcomplexes were soluble and suitable for further study. One subcomplex bound RNase MRP RNA. Identification and investigation of an RNA-binding RNase MRP subcomplex provided a platform for future efforts towards a better understanding on yeast RNase MRP; together with previous studies, it also suggested a feasible strategy for investigating the protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions of a RNP complex. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1176], "author_name_tesi": "Quan, Chao ", "last_name_ssi": "Quan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chao", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrey S Krasilnikov", "Andrey S Krasilnikov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrey S Krasilnikov, Thesis Advisor", "Andrey S Krasilnikov, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["RNA-protein interactions", "RPP1_POP5", "RNase MRP", "protein-protein interactions"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONAL AND EVOLUTIONARY ANALYSES OF KINESIN AND MEIOTIC GENES IN PLANTS\n\n", "id": "8612", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3904", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Meiosis is an essential step in sexual reproduction but only a small number of genes are known to be needed for plant meiosis.  In addition, although several kinesin genes are known to function in intracellular transport and microtubule organization in animal and fungal organisms, relatively little is known about kinesin function in plants.  My thesis research focuses on functional studies of kinesin genes in meiosis and other reproductive development, the evolutionary of kinesin genes in plants, and characterization of new meiotic mutants.  In the 2nd chapter, two kinesin genes, AtKIN14a and AtKIN14b, which were possibly generated by a recent Arabidopsis genome-wide duplication event, are shown to function redundantly in female meiosis and gametophytic development.  Although these two kinesin genes both seem to be under purifying selection, there is evidence for sequence divergence.  This might explain the functional difference between these two genes in male meiosis where AtKIN14a plays a more critical role than AtKIN14b since the atkin14b mutant has normal male fertility.  This study suggests that these two kinesins might function in microtubule organization during both meiosis and gametophytic mitosis.\nIn the 3rd chapter of this thesis, to understand how plant species are able to have given birth to and retained many copies of kinesin genes through evolution, a genome-wide evolutionary analysis is performed.  This analysis indicates that segmental duplication could possibly play a major role in increasing plant kinesin number.  Additionally, this analysis suggests that at least in Arabidopsis, these duplicate kinesin pairs have been under purifying selection and exhibit varying ratios of nonsynonymous/synonymous frequencies (dN/dS) across the entire gene length.  Moreover, expression analysis of Arabidopsis kinesin genes indicates that most of these pairs show very similar expression profiles during plant development with subtle expression divergence at some stages.  This divergence becomes more obvious when plant encounters stressful growth conditions, suggesting potential functional divergence between close paralogs.\nIn the 4th chapter, a forward genetic approach is used to identify genes possibly involved in Arabidopsis meiosis.  Two mutants were identified to carry mutational alleles of a known meiotic gene by molecular and genetic analyses.  In addition to exhibiting similar homologous recombination defects at late prophase I to the mutant, chromosomal univalents in these two mutant lines are able to be aligned at the equatorial plane.  Also, these univalents show stretched chromosomal morphology, suggesting that these chromosomes are under mechanical forces from microtubules.  These novel phenotypes suggest that this gene could possibly participate in sister-chromatid recombination, thereby affecting the cohesion and kinetochore orientation.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3877], "author_name_tesi": "Quan, Li ", "last_name_ssi": "Quan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Li", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Ma", "Teh Hui Kao", "Richard Cyr", "Zhi Chun Lai"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Ma, Committee Chair", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Richard Cyr, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["kinesin", "meiosis", "spindle", "gene duplication", "homologous recombination", "functional divergence"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Selective Hydrogen Sulfide Removal from Biogas on Nitrogen-Modified Adsorbents", "id": "14749wqq5009", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14749", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Biogas is a renewable energy source derived from the fermentation of organic materials which contains high concentrations of methane (CH4, 40-60 vol%) and carbon dioxide (CO2, 10-40 vol%). However, the presence of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in biogas limits its environmentally-friendly applications, thereby making the H2S removal a priority task for enhancing biogas utilization. The existence of a large amount of CO2 in biogas can strongly impede the H2S removal using conventional methods. The selective H2S removal in the presence CO2 is still challenging in the field of biogas processing. Therefore, the objective of the present work is to achieve selective H2S removal from biogas on nitrogen-modified adsorbents, by specifically (i) studying the effect of surface modifications with different N-containing groups on H2S removal from CO2-containing gas mixtures, and (ii) clarifying the effect of key factors that affect the sorption performance, including CO2 concentrations, type of amine groups, pore structure, and surface functional groups.\nFirst, by loading tertiary amines on SBA-15, tetramethyl hexanediamine (TMHDA), the sorption selectivity of H2S was enhanced dramatically in the presence of CO2. On carbon-based solid sorbents including TMHDA-loaded activated carbons (TMHDA/ACs) and nitrogen-doped carbons (NCs), it is interesting that the H2S sorption performance was significantly enhanced in the presence of CO2. Characterization was conducted to shed light on the surface chemical properties-textural property-sorption performance relationship. On the silica-based sorbents, the H2S sorption capacity was closely related to the silanol groups on the surface of SBA-15, where the silanol groups were responsible for anchoring the TMHDA molecules which determined the number of active sites for H2S sorption. On the carbon-based sorbents, not only the surface chemistry but also the textural properties affect the H2S sorption performance. The surface pH value, double-bonded oxygen functional groups, and surface density of nitrogen all contributed to the observed enhancement of sorption capacity, likely through acid-basic interaction, while micropores in carbon materials offered higher adsorption potential towards H2S. It is noteworthy that this work, to our best knowledge, first discovered that the presence of CO2 can dramatically promote the H2S sorption on certain carbon-based sorbents, which is accompanied by the formation of solid sulfur deposit along with the release of CH4, both of which are valuable chemical products. The CO2-promoting effect likely originated from its interaction with H2S on the sorption sites on the carbon surface and the delocalized \u03c0 electrons on the carbon planes. Additionally, other factors, such as inlet CO2/H2S concentrations and sorption temperatures, were also investigated. The H2S sorption capacity remained stable on TMHDA-loaded SBA-15 and NC_800 with increasing the inlet CO2 concentration up to 40 vol%, however, the sorption capacity exhibited a volcano-shape trend within the same range of CO2 concentrations on AC-based adsorbents. The sorption capacity decreased monotonically with the increasing temperature from 25 to 75 \u2103 on TMHDA-loaded adsorbents.  The estimated H2S sorption heat on TMHDA/SBA-15 was 15.4 kJ/mol by fitting with Langmuir isotherm, while the heat on NC_800 was less than 20 kJ/mol by fitting with both Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) isotherms. Such relatively low sorption heat indicates that the H2S interaction with surface sites is relatively weak and thus higher density of adsorption sites would be desirable.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15820], "author_name_tesi": "Quan, Wenying ", "last_name_ssi": "Quan", "first_name_ssi": "Wenying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Chunshan Song", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Xiaoxing Wang", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Dissertation Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Committee Chair", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member", "Xiaoxing Wang, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["H2S Removal", "Biogas Purification", "Selective Adsorption", "Nitrogen-Modified", "Porous Materials"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Primary MicroRNA Structure on Recognition by the Microprocessor Complex in MicroRNA Maturation", "id": "24430", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11077", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since their discovery over a decade ago, thousands of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been found across all multicellular organisms. These RNAs in combination with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) make up the RNA silencing pathway, also called the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Mature miRNAs are ~22-nucleotide-long, single-stranded non-coding RNAs that participate in various cellular, developmental, and differentiation processes via post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression for more than 90% of human genes. Therefore, these key RNAs have been linked to several disease states including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiac disease, diabetes, and numerous viral diseases. Recently, they have become a key target for the medical RNA therapeutics community.\n\nThe human canonical miRNA maturation pathway involves a series of cleavage steps beginning in the nucleus and ending in the cytoplasm, where the final mature miRNA down-regulates gene expression via \u201csilencing\u201d messenger RNA translation. Therefore, these small RNAs down-regulate the expression of every protein within an organism; thus, potentially controlling all bodily processes. The first processing step in the nucleus involves cleavage of the miRNA precursor by the Microprocessor complex, consisting minimally of the RNase III enzyme Drosha and the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein DGCR8. The second processing step involves an analogous complex consisting minimally of the RNase III enzyme Dicer and the dsRNA binding protein TRBP. This pathway is unique because all of these mentioned proteins contain dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) that help to recognize the miRNA precursors in the cell.\n\nHowever, much is still unknown about the processing of these miRNA precursors into their final mature forms. Although it is known that both Drosha and DGCR8 are required for Microprocessor activity, the molecular mechanism of RNA substrate recognition by these proteins is still not fully known. In particular, the means by which Drosha locates and recognizes the exact cleavage site on the RNA plays a critical role in Microprocessor efficiency and must be known to fully understand miRNA biogenesis.\n\nLiterature suggests that the recognition and cleavage of miRNA precursors is in part based on unique structural characteristics of the RNA, which guide the proteins to their cut-site locations. However, there are currently no experimentally-determined structures of entire miRNA precursors. Therefore, it is necessary to biochemically determine native solution structures of these RNAs as they would be seen by the Microprocessor if the maturation process at the molecular level is to be characterized. Atomic resolution methods for RNA structure determination pose several challenges that are not yet overcome; however, a variety of RNA secondary structure mapping and RNA modeling techniques have proven successful for determining structures of other large RNAs comparable to those encountered in this pathway. Therefore, a primary aim for this thesis was to combine these approaches to analyze structurally diverse miRNA precursors, which revealed a possible Microprocessor recognition site on the RNA.\n\nIn addition to the recognition site, RNA structure mapping yielded a consistent display of structural deformations periodically placed along the miRNA precursor. Surprisingly, these periodic deformations along miRNA precursors correlate to the binding surface required for dsRBDs, such as those found in both protein components of the Microprocessor complex \u2013 while Drosha only contains a single dsRBD, whereas DGCR8 has two in tandem. dsRBDs are characterized as binding to RNA with little sequence specificity; therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that DGCR8 function is dependent on the recognition of specific structural features in the miRNA precursor. This thesis utilizes a variety of binding techniques to fully characterize the binding of these dsRBDs with RNA, taking into account the different structural features natively present in miRNA precursors. Interestingly, I found that the dsRBD located in Drosha is not capable of binding RNA at all, leaving DGCR8 as the primary RNA binding protein. Furthermore, DGCR8 showed little sensitivity to the presence of structural deformations within miRNA precursors, leaving us to believe that its tandem dsRBDs are capable of cooperatively binding around them. In the end, while DGCR8 is necessary for dsRNA binding and recruitment to the Microprocessor, it is not sufficient on its own in directing the exact Drosha cut-site position on miRNA precursors.\n\nAs mentioned, the dsRBDs from Drosha and DGCR8 exhibit very different binding affinities for RNA. The differences seen in RNA binding by dsRBDs from these various proteins begs for an explanation. These dsRBDs display low sequence conservation, which may result in small differences in their folded domains. Therefore, an ongoing aim for this thesis is to examine the structure of dsRBDs bound to dsRNA in order to determine key regions governing the binding interaction as well as portions of the dsRBD important for maintaining the folded domain. However, due to solubility issues, DGCR8 was not amenable to studying this interaction at the atomic level. Instead, results from NMR and X-ray crystallography data of the dsRBD from Dicer (the cytoplasmic processing enzyme) bound to dsRNA will serve as the comparison to bound structures in the Protein Data Bank of dsRBDs with different amino acid sequence.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10650], "author_name_tesi": "Quarles, Kaycee Andrea", "last_name_ssi": "Quarles", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrea", "first_name_ssi": "Kaycee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott A Showalter", "Philip C.

Most students have an anti-cheating general attitude about cheating. Students also are influenced not to cheat by non-contextual influences: (1) academic self-efficacy, (2) value of education, (3) adherence to societal and group norms, and (4) personal character and responsibility. However, in particular situations, contextual influences either support or override the anti-cheating influences. The contextual influences are (1) classroom context (including class size, prevention measures and fear of consequences, perceptions of faculty demeanor and teaching, relationship with faculty, relevance or understanding of material or subject, type of assignment, and peer behavior and trust), (2) grade pressure, (3) time constraints and personal life circumstances, and (4) personal definition of cheating. If the contextual influences create an environment in which cheating is deemed acceptable, students adopt a temporary, pro-cheating attitude and act on that attitude. \n\nThe findings from this research inform the practice of educators and administrators in their efforts to educate about and prevent cheating. The findings suggest that changes to practices in the classroom might curb cheating. Additionally the findings point to the need for more education about the issue of cheating.

As a result, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of the IT workforce, and in particular, the opportunities and constraints that influence career choice and retention of IT professionals. Therefore, this research empirically investigated individual career anchors (or self-perceived values and career motives) and how these factors relate to career satisfaction and turnover intentions among women in the American IT workforce.\nThis research employed an interpretive epistemological approach comprised of a preliminary methodological phase and an empirical methodological phase. The purpose of the preliminary phase was to identify initial themes through an in-depth literature survey and a qualitative analysis of an existing dataset. In this phase, emergent themes about career anchor manifestation, career anchor clusters and temporal characteristics about career anchors were identified. The purpose of the empirical phase, which served as the primary component of the research, was to further analyze and refine the themes identified in the previous phase through a quantitative investigation. In this phase, a career values and motivations questionnaire was developed and administered on-line with 210 women employed at four organizations in the American IT workforce. \nThe research resulted in several findings. It was found that demographic characteristics do not have a relationship with career anchor alignment, whereas life experiences have a mixed relationship with career anchor alignment. Clear evidence of career anchor clusters was found. A factor analysis identified three career anchor clusters: organizational autonomy and entrepreneurship, problem solving competitiveness, and balancing career and personal life. In addition, evidence was found that career anchors change over time. The entrepreneurship/creativity career anchor was found to change the most, whereas managerial competence was found to change the least. Finally, high levels of career satisfaction and low levels of turnover intention were reported by the women included in the research.

Focusing on the autobiographical writing of the Paris expatriate communities of the 1920s and 1930s, I adapt contemporary interdisciplinary feminist inquiries to the study of American literary modernism. In doing so, I aim to break with longstanding critical axioms from all three fields, in favor of fresh frameworks that place socio-cultural concerns (especially of identity and difference) at the forefront. \n     The first of my five chapters presents a survey of the status of literary study in relation to feminist scholarship, as well as the position of feminist and lifewriting studies within mainstream modernist scholarship. I demonstrate that although the feminist traditions of recovery and revision were once at the heart of feminist academic work (from the 1970s through the 1990s), those strategies were also the root cause of both feminist theory\u2019s marginalization in literary scholarship and the waning influence of literary scholarship on contemporary feminist interests. Lifewriting scholarship, for me, presents a common ground on which to negotiate this antagonism between modernist and feminist studies.  \n     In the next three chapters, I develop my interdisciplinary approach in terms of history, ethics, and theory, drawing on autobiographical writing by authors such as Ernest Hemingway, Janet Flanner, Nancy Cunard, Malcolm Cowley, Gertrude Stein, and Margaret Anderson. More specifically, I use sociability frameworks from feminist science studies to challenge the historical narrative of author communities within the Paris expatriate scene; I reconsider the value of autobiographical war writing using feminist philosophical work on moral repair; and I explore how self-reflexive archival and lifewriting texts can theorize queer communities and aesthetic values in ways that challenge normative literary theories.\n     By bringing together the methodological and theoretical frameworks of modernism, feminism, and lifewriting studies, I argue that interdisciplinary approaches compel scholarly conversations to be more engaged and mutually relevant than those bound by disciplines. What I call for is neither an incorporation of these three fields into a flattened sub-field nor a corrective that simply replaces existing conventions with new norms. \n     Instead, I call for a more prismatic and divergent approach to reading literature that opens fields and boundaries rather than foreclosing them. This project aims to hold scholars accountable to colleagues in related fields, so that we might all become more attentive to the productive conversations happening across the humanities, as well as less reliant on conventional narratives in our own disciplines. Ultimately, my project reaches past the broad and rich scholarly landscapes that already exist in modernist, feminist, and lifewriting studies by demonstrating how interdisciplinary reading methodologies (and feminist reading practices, in particular) can generate purposeful resistance to conventional disciplinary common wisdom that otherwise withstands revision and update over time.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13736], "author_name_tesi": "Quesenberry, Krista Dawn", "last_name_ssi": "Quesenberry", "middle_name_ssi": "Dawn", "first_name_ssi": "Krista", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Susan Squier", "Dr. Susan Squier", "Dr. Robert Caserio", "Dr. Sandra Spanier", "Dr. Sarah Clark Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Susan Squier, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Susan Squier, Committee Chair", "Dr. Robert Caserio, Committee Member", "Dr. Sandra Spanier, Committee Member", "Dr. Sarah Clark Miller, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["American literature", "modernism", "modernist", "lifewriting", "autobiography", "feminism", "feminist", "gender", "sexuality", "interdisciplinary", "cross-disciplinary", "feminist science studies", "feminist ethics", "disability studies"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Investigating the Communication of Weight Stigmatization to Obese People: Classes of Stigmatization and their Predictors", "id": "26949", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11798", "abstract_tesi": "\tWeight stigma is pervasive and damaging, yet little research has focused on how people stigmatize (e.g., tease, aggress, advise, or avoid) obese adults.

Participants (N = 317) completed an online survey that assessed stigmatization of an obese acquaintance and personality trait covariates, including trait verbal aggression, misanthropy, disgust sensitivity, and sensation seeking. Using latent class analysis, a six-class model was found: Bystanders, Passive Supporters, Active Supporters, Avoiders, Devaluers, and Actors. In regard to their obese acquaintance, Avoiders reported avoiding; Devaluers reported teasing, aggressing, and advising; and Actors reported teasing, aggressing, advising, and avoiding. The covariate analysis revealed that personality traits predicted class membership. For example, people higher in trait verbal aggression were 4.18 times more likely to be Avoiders, 1.85 times more likely to be Devaluers, and 7.18 times more likely to be Actors, as compared to Bystanders.

However, little is known about collaborative efforts among educational scholars in Latin America. In order to address this gap in our knowledge, a Social Network Analysis (SNA) is used to examine the relationships and patterns that emerge from a dataset of co-authored scholarly publications among Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in Chile and Latin America, taking into account a purposeful dataset retrieved from Web of Science (WoS). Based on several sociograms and networks\u2019 centrality indicators (density, degree, betweenness, and closeness), along with bibliometric results, this study focuses on detecting which educational actors are in positions of leadership in the collaborative networks, exploring the existence of clusters, and identifying what countries, institutions and scholars are acting as positive contributors in the collaborative network as a whole. \nThus, at the country level, it was found that 5 out of the 19 Latin American countries are totally unconnected within the collaborative network: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Paraguay. Interestingly, most of them are smaller countries located in Central America. Conversely, bigger nations such as Mexico, Argentina and Brazil have higher number of publications along with respectable inter-country rates of collaboration. This situation allow them to display higher centrality indicators. The case of Brazil is outstanding, since it is the only country in the region where the official language is Portuguese. More surprisingly is the case of Chile, which is an isolated and relatively small country in South America; however, it presents the highest centrality indicators, leading the network in terms of degree centrality (number of direct connections among the actors of the network), betweenness (suggesting a strategic position on paths within the network), and closeness (interacting quickly with other actors in the network).  \nEven though Chile and the bigger nations of Latin America form a distinctive pattern of collaboration and leadership, the network as a whole has a density of 0.193, which means that only 19.3% of the potential connections occur in this network. This indicates that, at the country level, the network has the potential to improve its interconnectedness.    \nTaking into account the performance of Chile, additional analysis is conducted for this country at the institutional and scholar levels, along with an exploration of clusters (social groupings within networks), and the examination of the international dimension of the collaborative efforts at the scholar level. \nAt the institutional level, a total of 45 HEI were publishing papers, and 13 of them were not coauthoring educational articles through inter-institutional collaboration. In this case, the density of the network is 0.0515 (5.15%). In other words, only 102 collaborative efforts between two or more institutions were actually made, among a potential total of 1,980 connections. In addition, a cluster analysis is appropriate for this large network. In this case, it was detected 7 different clusters that are grouping different institutions together. Most of these clusters seem to follow a geographical distribution, grouping universities from the central or central-south regions of Chile. Universities from either the extreme North or South regions are actually part of the group of unconnected institutions. Thus, Chilean universities that are leading collaboration also have the highest centrality indicators. These institutions are Pontifical Catholic University (PUC) and University of Chile (UCH). To a lesser extent, other institutions such as PUCV, USACH, and UDP also have leadership roles but within their own clusters. UDP is the only private institution established after 1981, following a major educational reform that allowed the creation of private HEIs, and with the exception of PUCV, all the mentioned institutions are located in Santiago, the capital city of Chile. Moreover, UCH and PUC are the oldest universities in the country, usually recognized for their long-traditions and prestige. \n At the scholar level, researchers were ordered alphabetically and assigned to the same order that a Microsoft Excel sheet uses (i.e., A, B, C, \u2026, Z; AA, AB, \u2026, AZ; BA, BB,\u2026, BZ; \u2026, ZA, ZB, \u2026, ZZ; AAA, AAB, and so on). In order to detect a potential advancement of the network, the analysis was separated into two spans of time: between 1941 and 1999, and between 2000 and 2014. Before 2000, the network had a total of 83 scholars, and 35 of them were not coauthoring articles at all. This explains the low density of the network, with just 1.9% of the potential connections occurring. In addition, 14 clusters arose, but most of them involved either just 2 authors or just one article. In this regard, just one cluster (the bigger one) stands out over the rest, which actually contains the only leadership role detected \u2013 scholar VK\u2013 who is the only one with a betweenness centrality different than zero, and also has the highest degree centrality, along with the lowest farness (i.e., the highest closeness within its own cluster). Interestingly, most isolated scholars and those grouped in smaller clusters are located in Chile. The biggest cluster is mostly formed by scholars located abroad, with the exception of VK, who focus all their collaborative efforts with colleagues who are outside Chile.        \nSince 2000, a total of 635 scholars have been publishing papers, and 23 of them single-authored their articles. The network has a density of 0.009, which means that only 0.9% of potential connections were evidenced. However, taking into account the density of the network before 2000, the increase in the number of authors compared with the period before 2000 (from 83 to 635), and the decrease of unconnected scholars (from 35 to 23), it is possible to argue that, since 2000 the network achieved a respectable density. In addition, 112 different clusters (labeled from G1 to G112) were detected, most of them grouping 2, 3, 4 or 5 scholars. Nevertheless, some clusters group 11 to 80 scholars, representing several disciplines of subfields within educational research. Actually, in the bigger clusters, more intense collaboration and leadership roles were detected: 15 scholars have a more significant role and relatively higher centrality indicators, having the ability to communicate and interact with other nodes from sub-structures within the network, even connecting some clusters. In this regard, the role of scholar QP was the most relevant. Furthermore, most collaboration is promoting international partnerships, taking into account that almost 70% of the clusters present at least one scholar located outside Chile, and most unconnected scholars are located within Chile.  \nFinally, 9 authors appeared in both analyzed periods of time, and 4 of them increased their centrality indicators, when the periods before and since 2000 are contrasted. QP is one of the researchers that appears in both periods. This scholar was the most prolific and coauthored all their articles (a total of 39).\nThe results of this study seem to indicate several patterns and factors that affect collaboration and leadership in the analyzed context. Firstly, when a zoom-in/zoom-out examination is executed (i.e., a global perspective, passing through country, institutional and scholar level analyses), with a special focus on Chile, each network appears to be apt for concentration of collaboration following particular patterns in different ways. Moreover, collaboration rates and sociograms vary greatly across the mentioned levels, where leadership roles align with few actors. Based on the analysis at the scholar level, it seems that networks increase constantly by the accumulation of new actors, and the latter preferentially join already well-connected actors and neighborhoods, forming disciplinary clusters or research fields.\nOn the other hand, the roles of geography, language, and technology seems to vary across levels. Thus, at the country level, most countries are connected \u2013even Brazil, the only country where the official language is not Spanish. Nevertheless, most unconnected nations are smaller and located in Central America. For the Chilean case, most papers were found in journals where the official language is English (74%). Also, most unconnected universities are located in the extreme North or South regions of the country. Furthermore, most scholars located in Chile are collaborating with colleagues located abroad, probably supported by information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the globalization process around the globe. However, some policies seem to be necessary in order to improve collaboration and leadership across the analyzed networks. \nThus, regarding some policy implications of this study, forming successful educational partnerships should accommodate collaborative goals, and promote the modernization of institutional practices and a new sort of university faculty, highly motivated to collaborate with colleagues despite traditional and bureaucratic practices, based on a more broad and distributed leadership.\nIn addition, maps and networks of science and knowledge can help research actors to find places of their interest, since they provide global views of large amounts of knowledge. Thus, institutions and scholars can judiciously make use of the best knowledge sources, easily discover the best collaborators, and quickly recognize the best research opportunities. For the Chilean case, the main issue is that there is a strong centralization of the educational research, mostly developed in the capital city, which may limit a larger impact of this knowledge on the entire society\nDespite the creation and development of several formal and informal organizations that promote collaboration at all levels (e.g., UNESCO, World Bank, Fulbright, etc.), it seems that most challenges and opportunities are based on either funding or leadership frameworks. Thus, since the mentioned unconnected countries in Latin America may be deprived of funds to sustain research colleges, it may be a reasonable option to develop a regional research-oriented university. In addition, Chilean and Latin American educational research may be supported by local funding as well as funding from abroad. Financial support models for the development of human capital is also necessary and initiatives such as Becas Chile seem to be appropriate for the Chilean context. To some extent, this policy provides more and appropriate leaders, which also depends on pertinent detection and leadership preparation. Thus, policies and training about scholars and institutional leadership roles may be outlined in order to develop new and dynamic leaders in the educational research field, such as promoting junior scholars\u2019 participation and collaboration on several projects funded by public or private organizations.\nRegarding future research about the topic of this study, its replication in other contexts and a subsequent comparison could be a reasonable suggestion for future work \u2013especially if the evolution of the network for future spans of time becomes the focus of analysis. Additionally, mapping journals instead of authors would provide several disciplinary maps. Citation, co-citation and inter-citation analysis also appear to be relevant for the Latin American and Chilean context, in order to evaluate the impact of research from local scholars in the academic world within specific fields.\nThe analysis of who is the first author on collaborative articles is another area that justifies further research and analysis. Also, a bibliometric analysis would be interesting to examine the relationship between the countries with more associations, partnerships, collaboration or other kinds of interactions (e.g., Chile with the United States). Semantic web and semantic network analysis are other ways to examine patterns of research, in order to improve knowledge management. Finally, mapping coauthored educational research and authors\u2019 expertise, career or trajectory, based on their personal bibliography files, may be a novel way to examine the evolution of the researchers\u2019 role. A special focus on the involvement of women in the profession may be interesting in this regard.\n  In summary, this study aims to provide a better understanding for collaboration and leadership in large-scale networks, using SNA techniques for the visualization of the collaborative environment among researchers, with a special focus on the Chilean context. The results of this kind of study may be useful and interesting for policymakers, institutions, researchers, educators, and practitioners involved in the promotion and development of more and better collaboration and leadership among higher education institutions that investigate educational topics. For the Chilean case, collaboration through co-authorship is a reasonable way to intensify the quantity and quality of papers in the educational field. In fact, this study reveals a perceptible upward trend of collaborative research, based on the results of coauthored efforts reported in major ISI-indexed journals. The dynamism and other characteristics of collaboration and leadership within the discipline have been detected. Thus, the findings of this study can be helpful in research planning and the improvement of policies at the institutional and country levels. They may support the accomplishment of a more efficient and effective organization and management of information resources and services among the actors that develop educational research in the Chilean context, which in turn can assist the evolvement of leaders that facilitate multi-authored research activities.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12341], "author_name_tesi": "Queupil, Juan Pablo", "last_name_ssi": "Queupil", "middle_name_ssi": "Pablo", "first_name_ssi": "Juan", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nona Ann Prestine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nona Ann Prestine, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Collaboration Networks", "Educational Leadership", "Social Network Analysis", "Chile", "Latin America"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Comparative Study of the Anatomy and Functional Morphology of the Mammalian Nasal Cavity", "id": "25064", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11296", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The mammalian nasal cavity is an intricate anatomical structure with a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and functional roles.

Twenty-five federal and state court opinions from twenty-one separate cases are thoroughly examined. They are then analyzed using reasoning by analogy. The results reveal five major themes. First, several sources of law shape the contours of student online speech rights. Second, clear policy language and consistent adherence to policies is essential to treating students fairly and withstanding legal challenge. Third, courts\u2019 treatment of student academic freedom is consistent with principles articulated by the AAUP and others. Fourth, there is uncertainty and debate related to the proper application of legal standards in assessing student online speech rights and corresponding institutional authority.

While others have studied these topics, most research considers just a small snapshot in time.  However, it may be that the potential for CEO impact and stakeholder beliefs about their impact vary greatly across different time periods.  In this dissertation I considered these possibilities.  First, in Chapter 2, I develop theoretical arguments related to media coverage, CEO hiring and tenure, the business environment, and CEO compensation and make the case that certain actors believe CEOs became increasingly important determinants of firm outcomes in the period between 1950 and 2009.  Building on this theoretical view, I then argue that these changes in beliefs will be reflected in market reactions to unexpected CEO death.  I conclude Chapter 2 with an empirical test of this idea and find that the magnitude of market reaction (either positive or negative) to unexpected death has grown over time.  The results are consistent with the idea that certain actors believe in an increasingly impactful CEO.  In Chapter 3, I argue that changes in beliefs about CEO impact are at least partially based on a real and tangible increase in their impact on firm outcomes.  In outlining a series of social and macroeconomic trends, I theoretically describe how CEOs have gained managerial discretion which ultimately results in increased impact on firm outcomes.  In Chapter 4, I empirically test these ideas on a 59-year sample of 30 industries and more than 1000 firms.  I find evidence that CEO impact has changed in significant but complicated ways that provide partial support for my theories.  Namely, CEO impact has increased steadily in recent years.  However, their impact was highest in the period between 1950 and 1965 before declining rapidly in the late 1960s.  Despite the steady increases since, CEO impact has not year reached levels seen in the earliest period of this study.  In Chapter 5 I discuss the implications of these results.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6189], "author_name_tesi": "Quigley, Timothy J.", "last_name_ssi": "Quigley", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald C Hambrick", "Donald C Hambrick", "Vilmos Fosnocht Misangyi", "Forrest Scott Briscoe", "Mark William Dirsmith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald C Hambrick, Dissertation Advisor", "Donald C Hambrick, Committee Chair", "Vilmos Fosnocht Misangyi, Committee Member", "Forrest Scott Briscoe, Committee Member", "Mark William Dirsmith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Upper Echelons", "Strategic Management", "Leadership", "CEO Impact", "Managerial Discretion"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Investigating Genes Related to the Evolution of Indigenous American Skin Pigmentation", "id": "11415", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1753", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The genetic study of human pigmentation is fundamental to anthropology because pigmentation represents an enormously variable phenotype present in all humans shaped and reshaped over the history of the hominid lineage by the forces of evolution.  Skin pigmentation is among the most conspicuously varying traits among individuals and populations and must be understood in the context of the evolutionary history of the human species.  As a population moves into a new environment, natural selection acts on both existing and newly emerging genetic variation in the population.  There is a clear north-south gradient of skin pigmentation across the globe, with populations at higher latitudes having less melanin in their skin on average than populations at lower latitudes.  This distribution suggests that skin pigmentation has been under strong selection as human populations spread throughout Africa and eventually around the world.  There are a number of hypotheses to explain why this distribution occurs, predominantly rooted in the distribution of ultra-violet radiation (UVR).  Previous researchers have employed statistical methods which detect distributions of allele frequencies and genomic signatures inconsistent with neutral evolution.  These methods have identified skin pigmentation genes in a number of Old World populations that appear to have undergone selection.  This dissertation reports on the first genome-wide analysis of evidence for selection at skin pigmentation genes in New World populations.\nFrom 76 initial pigmentation candidate genes, four tests of selection \u2013 Locus-Specific Branch Length (LSBL), Log of the Ratio of Heterozygosities (lnRH), Tajima\u2019s D, and a heuristic haplotypes analysis \u2013 were used to identify fourteen pigmentation genes with signatures of selection unique to Indigenous American populations.  Based on the evidence of selection, a logical hypothesis is these genes may play a role in determining skin color in Indigenous American populations.  To test this hypothesis, admixture linkage analysis was performed in several samples of European and Indigenous American ancestry.  Admixture linkage analysis exploits a number of unique properties of admixed populations.  In an admixed population, genes influencing skin pigmentation variation between the Indigenous American and European parental populations will have a higher proportion of Indigenous American alleles than expected in individuals with darker skin pigmentation.  Most importantly, the use of admixed populations allows for the appearance of heterozygotes at loci where alternate alleles may be fixed in the parental populations.  \nTo characterize these admixed populations, ancestry informative markers (AIMs) were genotyped in the samples.  In particular, the distribution of biogeographic ancestry as described by both nuclear AIMs and male-specific non-recombinant Y chromosome markers is discussed for a sample of 173 Colombian individuals.  The distribution of biogeographic ancestry (BGA) in this population includes ancestors from West Africa, America, and Western Europe.  Although these individuals self-report ethnic identifications that are generally consistent with their BGA, the distribution of BGA among the ethnic groups shows a large degree of overlap which demonstrates the heterogeneous nature of these ethnic groups.  Additionally, the Y-chromosomal markers, which are inherited exclusively through the male line can be traced to a likely geographic region of origin.  The ancestry estimates from the nuclear and Y-chromosomal markers indicate that there is a bias towards more European males and more African and Indigenous American females contributing to the gene pool.  This sex-biased gene flow is common in admixed populations of the Americas.\nIn total, 515 individuals with mixed Indigenous American and European ancestry were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) chosen to be ancestry informative between the European and Indigenous American parental populations.  These SNPs were used to test for admixture linkage association between the candidate genes and variation in skin color.  The results of this analysis show a novel association of the genes PAX3 and ASIP with mean constitutive skin pigmentation differences between European and Indigenous American populations.  The roles of SLC24A5 and MATP (SLC45A2) in contributing to skin pigmentation differences between European and non-European populations were also confirmed.    SLC24A5 and MATP (SLC45A2) are each linked to approximately 3 melanin units of variation in skin pigmentation while PAX3 and ASIP each contribute to less than 1.5 melanin units of difference. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1739], "author_name_tesi": "Quillen, Ellen Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Quillen", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Ellen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Shriver", "Mark Shriver", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss", "David Andrew Puts", "David John Vandenbergh", "Nina G Jablonski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Shriver, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Shriver, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Committee Member", "David Andrew Puts, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member", "Nina G Jablonski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["skin color", "human evolution", "natural selection", "Colombia", "pigmentation", "population genetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Low-Cost Wind Sensing for Dynamic Soaring UAVs.", "id": "15582", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7836", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Small UAVs have tremendous potential in military and civil applications, but are limited by their size in payload capacity and flight endurance.   Extra batteries or fuel can be added to increase endurance, but at the expense of mission payload.   Autonomous soaring techniques directly inspired by birds extract energy from the environment and offer the ability to increase UAV endurance without sacrificing payload.\n\nDynamic soaring exploits naturally-occurring spatial wind gradients to gain energy and has been used by albatrosses to routinely fly hundreds of miles out at sea.  This technique requires precise knowledge of the wind vector and albatrosses are the only birds capable of it due to specialized sensory organs in their beak nostrils.  A flush air data sensing (FADS) system located on the nose of a soaring-capable UAV operates similar to an albatross beak and measures the aircraft's orientation with respect to the wind.  The approach aims to create a small, versatile, low-cost sensing system in comparison to the large, expensive, commercial-grade wind sensors currently available.\n\nThe design of the system was developed from potential flow and panel method models.  Flush pressure ports drilled into the surface of a detachable nosecone feed airspeed, angle of attack, and angle of sideslip measurements to an Arduino microcontroller acting as a programmable air data computer.  The entire FADS system cost less than $130 to construct and instrument, but still measures the complete wind vector.  \n\nNeural networks are implemented to compute the wind vector.  Wind tunnel tests collected training and validation data for airspeeds from 9 m/s to 27 m/s and aerodynamic angles from -15 to +15 degrees.  Five neural networks of 3, 9, 15, 30 and 45 neurons were created for each wind parameter from the training data.  Validation results confirm the more complex networks outperform the simpler 3, 9, and 15 neuron models, although not by considerably more.  Ultimately, a 30 neuron network model is chosen as it performs just as well as the 45 neuron model, but with a simpler structure.\n\nNumerous flight tests conducted with a FADS-equipped sailplane demonstrate the capability of the system in real world flight regimes.  Pilot-induced longitudinal and lateral-directional maneuvers verified the system's accuracy in dynamic maneuvers and steady glides.  The preliminary flight test results prove the neural network-based FADS system's ability to accurately compute the wind vector for use in dynamic soaring research.

Agriculture is practiced by about 80% of the country\u2019s working population, and the majority of the production is done by small-scale farmers. However, the productivity of staple food remains very low and is considered below the potential compared to other African countries.  The use of improved seeds is crucial for increasing agricultural productivity.  It is recognized that the use of improved seed may improve smallholder farmer crop productivity, income, and livelihoods. However, the uptake of improved seed in Mozambique is very low and the productivity of crops remains low. New technologies are being developed and strategies are needed to increase adoption. Social networks are fundamental for information and resource acquisition, and the adoption of new technologies. Social networks can help farmers to obtain improved seed and contribute to higher rates of adoption.\nThis research investigated the effect of social networks on information acquisition and willingness to adopt a newly-introduced low-phosphorous (low-P) bean variety in rural Mozambique. The study draws on data from an ex-ante baseline socioeconomic survey of 289 farmers in six villages in three rural provinces in Mozambique that was conducted in 2008-2009 by the Mozambican Agricultural Research Institute (IIAM) and Penn State University (PSU) under a McKnight Foundation project.\n Bivariate logit models were estimated to examine the effects of social networks and other factors on 1) famer willingness to adopt a new low-P bean variety, specifically the meso-American black bean (a small variety adapted to low-P soils and with faster cooking time), and 2) on information acquisition on improved seed varieties from weak ties sources for the total sample and for men and women farmers separately. Farmer willingness to adopt the low-P bean was assessed under the condition that a buyer can be assured. The male and female information models were limited to households in which both household decision-makers were interviewed.  \nResults indicate that social networks in general have positive effects on farmer\u2019s information acquisition and willingness to adopt the new low-P beans. Results show that 84% of farmers were willing to adopt the new low-P bean variety and 50% acquired information on how to get improved seed from their weak ties (eg, NGOs, traders, etc.).  The results indicate that the oldest farmers are less likely to be willing to adopt the new low-P bean variety as compared to the youngest farmers. Further, farmers with larger farms are found to be more likely to be willing to adopt the low-P bean than farmers on smaller farms. The effect of participation in off-farm activities is negative and statistically significant, suggesting that farmers participating in off-farm activities are less likely to willing to adopt meso-American low-P beans. The effect of economic networks is positive and statistically significant as well, suggesting that farmers with economic ties are more willing to adopt the new low-P beans. Finally, village location in relation to an IIAM research station has positive influences on willingness to adopt; farmers in IIAM-influenced villages in the provinces of Zambezia and Niassa were more likely to be willing to adopt the new low-P bean variety compared to farmers in the non-IIAM influenced village in Tete Province. There were no statistical differences between the non IIAM influenced villages in Niassa and Zambezia Provinces and that in Tete Province. \nFindings show that effect of farmer gender (male) is positive and statistically significant at the .05 level, suggesting that men are more likely to acquire information from weak ties compared to women in the villages. The results also show that older men and women farmers are less likely to acquire information from weak ties compared to the youngest farmers. Household size is found to positively affect information acquisition from weak ties, with larger household more likely to access information on improved seed from NGOs, traders, etc. A negative effect of farm size on information acquisition from weak ties was also found. The results suggest that farmers with smaller farms were more likely to acquire information from weak ties than farmers with larger farms. At the same time, farmers on the larger farms are more likely to adopt, an interesting result. \nThe coefficient for access to credit was positive and statistically significant for the full sample and for men. The results suggest that men farmers with access to credit are more likely to acquire information from weak ties than those with no access to credit. The credit variable was not significant for women farmers, likely due to low levels of credit receipt among them. Access to credit is important for information acquisition.\nThe estimated models also showed that men participating in off-farm activities are more likely to acquire information from weak ties than those not participating in off-farm activities. The result may indicate that off-farm jobs provide conduits to information from weak ties. While farmers with off-farm engagement were less likely to adopt the new bean variety, they are more likely to access information on improved crop varieties than their counterparts. Additional research is needed. \nFurther, the coefficient for clubs that influence agricultural decisions is positive and statistically significant for the full sample and for women. The results suggest that women in clubs that influence their agricultural decisions are more likely to acquire information from weak ties than women who are not in clubs. Also, location closer to an IIAM research station can positively influence information acquisition for both men and women. \nThe results from this study support the recommendation that villages farther from established research stations be targeted for interventions to provide farmers with knowledge on the new low-P varieties of the common bean. The results also suggest that smallholder farmers in Mozambique obtain improved seed from different sources, including strong ties (informal sources) and weak ties (formal sources). Both sources play a role in seed dissemination; through introduction of new seed and through seed sharing/exchange. It is recommended that both weak and strong ties be strengthened as sources of improved seed. \nThere are limitations to this research that will be overcome in future phases of the project. Foremost is that one of the dependent variables of this study is \u2018willingness to adopt\u2019 the new low-P beans. One of the drawbacks of asking willingness instead of actual uptake of seed is that farmers may be more likely to say \u2018yes\u2019 with the expectation to receive free seed. Future research on the actual adoption in the future is encouraged.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13900], "author_name_tesi": "Quinhentos, Maria ", "last_name_ssi": "Quinhentos", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leland Glenna", "Jill Findeis", "Carolyn Sachs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leland Glenna, Thesis Advisor", "Jill Findeis, Committee Member", "Carolyn Sachs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["social capital", "willingness", "phosphorus efficient", "bean", "Mozambique"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Corporeality and the Rhetoric of Feminist Body Art\n\n", "id": "8603", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5250", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nRhetorical Studies has only begun to understand the materiality and corporeality of rhetorical texts. Corporeality and the Rhetoric of Feminist Body Art aims to draw attention to the intersection between visual rhetoric and visual culture. In so doing, I  \u201clook\u201d elsewhere\u2014beyond traditional notions of public address and the rhetorical situation\u2014for women\u2019s rhetorical accomplishments. The inventional visual rhetorics of feminist body artists point to the ways in which the space and time of the rhetorical situation silences the voices and bodies of women as well as other marginalized groups. The Cartesian mind/body split has historically rendered women speechless bodies, despite their being no voice without the body. The study of feminist body art fruitfully interrogates the sites (or representation new and hybrid media) where marginalized individuals articulate their bodies to counter official discourses and center the corporeality of rhetoric.\nChapter one, \u201cIntroduction: Feminist Body Art, Space, and Time,\u201d lays the framework for the rhetorical criticism of feminist body art. Exploring some of the most famous feminist body artworks and feminist materialist theories of the body, I detail the rhetorical form and functions of feminist body artworks and determine the five main methodological questions researchers should ask when critiquing feminist body art from a rhetorical perspective. Feminist body artworks are invention-memory vehicles\u2014they refuse binaries, deconstruct acts of remembrance, and interrogate the drive toward fixed identity. Feminist body artworks, as visual rhetorics in their own right, substantiate the corporeality of rhetoric by undoing viewer\u2019s subjectivities and complicating theories of the gaze.\nChapter two, \u201cA Transgendered Gaze toward a Becoming-Body,\u201d argues that Nan Goldin\u2019s performative photography of drag queens from the 1970s and 1990s breaks down the sex/gender/sexuality trinary. By tracing the changes in drag queen aesthetics and the larger GLBT community\u2019s attitudes toward drag queens, Goldin visualizes the plasticity and pliability of the body. In so doing, she also deconstructs viewer\u2019s ability to read sex and gender and to name diverse sexualities. Thus, viewers\u2019 expectations about the ability to \u201csee\u201d sex are undone by Goldin\u2019s tactics of representation, inviting audience members to think of themselves as becoming-bodies, rather than seeing through a knowing gaze.\nChapter three, \u201cA Clinical Gaze toward a Becoming-Body,\u201d analyses three of Goldin\u2019s serials about her friends who died from AIDS-related illnesses. Goldin\u2019s works reconfigure the rhetorical work of memorials to open viewers to the problematics of the act of remembrance. In so doing, she counters official discourses about the AIDS crisis and transports viewers directly into the AIDS wound. Through images of objects, others, and spaces Goldin protects her subjects from the voyeuristic and clinical gazes of viewers. Goldin\u2019s images are haptic. They rely on viewers\u2019 abilities to see-touch the images. Her works invite viewers into a mode of synesthesia wherein their own personal memories work with the artwork to make meaning.\nChapter four, \u201cA Terrorist Gaze toward a Becoming-Body,\u201d critiques Coco Fusco\u2019s A Room of One\u2019s Own: Gender and Power in the New America,\u201d a rhetorical text designed to invite audience members to become the terrorist Other. In this performance, Fusco plays a military interrogation expert who lectures recruits/audience members about sexual interrogation tactics. Invoking images of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, Fusco draws out the connections between the discourses of liberal feminism and the U.S. military\u2019s imperialist project. This chapter also centrally addresses the question: In what ways have new media technologies changed the landscape of visual culture with regard to the War on Terror? Fusco\u2019s multi-media performance invites a telechiasmic-becoming gaze, which calls attention to the possibilities and problems associated with the new media. Thus, audience members are transported to women\u2019s new frontline\u2014that of the interrogation room\u2014and are forced to interrogate and become interrogated through means of new communication technologies. Switching subjects positions in this way opens a space for a becoming-body, that of the terrorist and feminist military interrogator.\nBy way of conclusion, chapter five, \u201cSkin Rhetoric,\u201d documents the necessity of studying the subversive tactics of feminist body artists in order to understand the constraints of space and time on voice-body. This chapter also seeks to identify the ways in which rhetorical critics must move to a phenomenological rhetorical criticism, that of skin rhetoric, in order to theorize rhetoric\u2019s most basic characteristic: a move from materiality to corporeality.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5227], "author_name_tesi": "Quinlivan, Raena Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Quinlivan", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Raena", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rosa A Eberly", "Thomas Walter Benson", "Stephen Howard Browne", "Jeanne Hall", "Stephanie Springgay"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rosa A Eberly, Committee Chair", "Thomas Walter Benson, Committee Member", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Member", "Jeanne Hall, Committee Member", "Stephanie Springgay, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["corporeality", "materiality", "feminist rhetoric", "body art"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A geovisual analysis of social influence in OpenStreetMap construction", "id": "28759", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12282", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the Web 2.0-induced rise of online user-generated content, digital databases of \"volunteered geographic information\" (VGI) are beginning to emerge, ranging from locational coordinates attached to social media posts, to full-fledged cartographic databases.

Although OSM allows a new bottom-up approach to geographic data collection and a possible way out of \"cartographies of silence\" identified by critical human geographers, the project suffers from participation divides observed in other media sources wherein the Global North produces the majority of the content. In this dissertation, I explore spatial questions about how OSM participation divides play themselves out at different scales, how they affect map contents, and how individual influences in OSM construction can be better understood using geovisualization and visual analytics. In Chapter 1 I lay out the context for the overall work and describe the research goals and objectives. In Chapter 2 I employ automated language identification software to map the geolinguistic footprints of OSM contributors, revealing which areas are mapped by local-language speakers and which are likely mapped from afar. I further investigate varying priorities that users of each language exhibit toward mapping different items. In Chapter 3 I undertake a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the OSM history in small cities, constructing a picture of each contributor's work on the map and developing a typology of contributor motivations. I show how OSM contributors approach the map at different scales with widely varying motives, including strong love of place, business incentive, and an affinity for particular feature types. Chapter 4 describes the design, implementation, and application of an interactive visual analytics tool to help users compare and make sense of the history of OSM construction in small cities across the world.

They are useful for monitoring many parts of a helicopter including engines, gearboxes, rotor components, and bearings.  These systems are usually powered by battery or wired to onboard power, but some monitoring spots cannot use these power sources due to location or accessibility. A solution for these locations is to use energy harvesters to power the monitoring equipment.  Energy harvesters convert mechanical or thermal energy into electrical energy. The ability to use self-powered wireless sensors has the potential to greatly simplify installation and lower the support costs for HUMS systems.  \nOne possible location for an energy harvester is the pitch link located on the rotor assembly.  Using the Blackhawk helicopter pitch link as the design case, an energy harvester was designed to fit inside the pitch link rod end to power a load monitoring sensor.  An electromagnetic energy harvester was designed with a goal of harvesting 1 mW of electrical power from the motion of the pitch link.  The energy harvester must be able to withstand the rotating environment and must also be able to fit inside the pitch link rod end of the Blackhawk helicopter.  \nA dynamic model was formulated using Newtonian Mechanics to characterize the pitch link motion.  The dynamic model proved there was sufficient motion for a simple electromagnetic energy harvester.  The design parameters of the energy harvester were optimized using a non-uniform magnetic field model.  An energy harvester was built to validate the theoretical model and to test the power output of the system.  This energy harvester was tested on a shaker and was able to generate sufficient power with a maximum value of 2.2 mW at 1.2 g base acceleration.  The theoretical model was able to predict the power output and voltage signal accurately.  The energy harvester was also tested in a rotating environment, but it was only able to generate 0.82 mW at 8.5 g base acceleration. The large friction force from the resulting centrifugal force is believed to have caused the decrease in power.  Some improvements were given to achieve the 1 mW goal such as using ball bearings to decrease the dissipation of power due to friction.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4422], "author_name_tesi": "Quintangeli, Michael Vincent", "last_name_ssi": "Quintangeli", "middle_name_ssi": "Vincent", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Smith", "Karl Martin Reichard", "Stephen Clarke Conlon", "Edward C Smith", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Martin Reichard, Thesis Advisor", "Stephen Clarke Conlon, Thesis Advisor", "Edward C Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["rotor", "electromechanical", "electromagnetic", "pitch link", "helicopter", "energy harvesting", "rod end", "HUMS"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Complexity in Procurement Decision Making", "id": "25759", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10920", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the first essay, we investigate the effect of observed inventory decisions on firm performance. In particular, our goal is to measure and understand how much profit a newsvendor-type of decision maker stands to lose due to behavioral (intuitive but suboptimal) ordering. The current literature, primarily focused on a newsvendor making decisions in isolation, reports results which imply profit losses of 1-5% when compared to the analytical solution, due to the flatness of the profit curve in the neighborhood of the optimum. In contrast, we show that in a practical situation, when a behavioral inventory decision-maker competes against a management-science-driven competitor, profit losses are orders of magnitude larger. By considering several plausible and simple competitor policies, we demonstrate average profit losses between 22-76%, regardless of policy sophistication or embedded assumptions. Our results send a clear message to business executives and highlight the importance of considering behavioral biases in procurement.\n\nIn the second essay, we study the econometric identification of multi-attribute score auctions.

We establish nonparametric identification of bidders\u2019 independent private (pseudo)types for multi-attribute procurement where bids are evaluated using a preannounced quasi-linear-score, calculated on the basis of the submitted levels of the attributes.

Cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, which play important roles in HIV-1-associated neuropathogenesis, arise from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) within the bone marrow and peripheral blood.  CD34+ HPCs in the bone marrow are generally resistant to HIV-1 infection, likely due to deficiencies in HIV-1 coreceptor expression.  However, cells of the monocytic lineage that arise from these precursor cells are able to support a productive HIV-1 infection, indicating that the process of differentiation from CD34+ HPCs to monocytes or macrophages may induce changes in cell surface receptors and transcription factors that favor viral entry and productive replication.  In studies of HIV-1 genomic sequence compartmentalization, gp160 sequences isolated from deep white matter of a HAD patient\u2019s brain were more closely related to sequences isolated from bone marrow and monocytes within the blood, suggesting either similar paths of viral evolution or migration of HIV-1-infected cells from the bone marrow to the brain.  The differentiation of HIV-1-infected bone marrow cells and their migration to the brain could represent an important step in the development of HIV-1-associated neuropathogenesis and HAD.  The central hypothesis of this thesis is that differentiation of bone marrow CD34+ progenitor cells leads to increased HIV-1 susceptability, LTR activation, and virus production that promotes the alteration of signaling pathways associated with increased cellular trafficking.  \nThe TF-1 erythromyeloid CD34+ progenitor cell line has been used to model bone marrow progenitor cell differentiation and to examine HIV-1 coreceptor expression levels during phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation.  Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry analyses were used to measure the expression of TF-1 cell RNA and surface proteins that are either crucial for HIV-1 binding and entry or indicative of cellular differentiation.  TF-1 cells express the HIV-1 receptor CD4 and very low or undetectable levels of the HIV-1 coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5.  However, TF-1 cells had increased expression of CXCR4 and CCR5 coreceptors after PMA treatment, with high expression levels of both coreceptors 48-72 hr post-treatment.  Expression of the activation marker CD69 also increased dramatically within 24 hr after PMA treatment.  These results indicate that during progenitor cell differentiation the cells may become more susceptible to HIV-1 infection as a consequence of increased levels of the chemokine receptors involved in HIV-1 binding and entry.\nCellular differentiation of bone marrow-derived progenitor monocytic cells can produce a distinct array of transcription factors that can modulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) activity and subsequently regulate HIV-1 replication.  TF-1 cells that are induced to differentiate by PMA are being utilized as a model system for examining LTR regulation and viral replication during the differentiation of bone marrow-derived monocytic cells.  Studies of nuclear transcription factor availability using electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) analyses demonstrated that PMA treatment of TF-1 progenitor cells altered the availability of factors important to HIV-1 LTR regulation.  In transient expression experiments, PMA-induced differentiation resulted in large increases of about 100-fold in HIV-1 LTR activity compared to untreated cells.  Finally, viral infection studies using HIV-1 strains IIIB (X4) and BaL (R5) indicated increased viral production (as measured by p24) in PMA-treated TF-1 cells compared to untreated, undifferentiated cells.  Cumulatively, these results suggest that bone marrow progenitor cell differentiation results in cellular changes that promote HIV-1 LTR activation and viral replication.\nThe ability of differentiated and/or activated TF-1 cells to secrete factors that can induce the differentiation of undifferentiated TF-1 cells and other cell lines was examined.  Conditioned media taken from TF-1 cells that have undergone differentiation in response to PMA can induce differentiation and morphologic changes in undifferentiated TF-1 and U-937 cells.  The TF-1 and U-937 cells treated with the conditioned media also had phenotypic changes in cell surface marker expression and had cell surface marker expression profiles similar to cells differentiated directly by PMA.  Furthermore, cells exposed to conditioned media did not exhibit the decrease in the CD4 receptor expression that was normally associated with PMA treatment.  However, increases in the expression of the HIV-1 coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5 and the activation marker CD69 were observed.  Experiments using CD69 expression as a measure of cellular activation also indicated that media conditioned for longer periods of time induced greater levels of activation, which is consistent with time-dependent accumulation of soluble factors secreted from PMA-treated TF-1 cells.  In transient transfection experiments using LTR-luciferase reporter constructs, basal LTR activity was increased considerably in TF-1 and U-937 cells by the presence of conditioned media.  Factors such as IL-1?, TNF-?, or IL-6, secreted by the cells and acting by an autocrine or paracrine mechanism, may be responsible for inducing cellular differentiation, as well as coreceptor upregulation and LTR activation.\nThese studies provide potential insights into mechanisms that underlie the development of HAD.  As CD34+ cells undergo differentiation (and activation) in vivo in response to inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-? or secreted viral proteins such as gp120 or Tat, they become increasingly susceptible to HIV-1 infection.  The increases in infection are due to increases in HIV-1 receptor and coreceptor expression, as well as changes in nuclear transcription factor availability that promote HIV-1 expression.  Progenitor cells, infected by HIV-1 in the BM or in the blood as they differentiate down the monocytic lineage, can then travel through the blood and migrate into the brain, delivering virus into the CNS.  These activated cells are primed to migrate into tissues such as the brain because of increases in cell adhesion molecules that permit adhesion to the blood vessel endothelium and enable chemotaxis to sites of inflammation.\nHIV-1-infected cells and damaged bystander cells may also release inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that can, in turn, recruit additional monocyte/macrophage cells into the brain.  ?-chemokines, such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1? (MIP-1?) and MIP-1?, can be secreted by monocyte/macrophages, promoting chemotaxis, leukocyte trafficking, and inflammation.  Upregulation of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 (the receptor for MIP-1? and MIP-1?) in differentiating cells can thus serve a dual role of enabling HIV-1 binding and entry and mediating chemotaxis of the cells into the CNS.  Increased susceptibility to infection combined with enhanced recruitment of both uninfected and HIV-1-infected monocytic cells to the CNS may form a positive feedback loop of cell migration and viral infection that results in the production of even greater levels of HIV-1 and inflammatory mediators.\nIn vitro studies suggest that in vivo infection of CD34+ progenitor cells by HIV-1 as they differentiate into cells of monocye/macrophage lineage may lead to the promotion or acceleration of the development or progression of HIV-1-associated neuropathogenesis and HAD.  These investigations, which contribute toward a basic understanding of HIV-1-associated nervous system disease, imply that antiretroviral treatments that target HIV-1-infected cells in the peripheral immune system may also lessen the risk for CNS disease.  This hypothesis is supported by clinical studies that demonstrate correlations between a decreased incidence of HIV-1-associated CNS disease and treatment regimens involving single or multiple antiretroviral drugs.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5619], "author_name_tesi": "Quiterio, Shane Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Quiterio", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Shane", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian Wigdahl", "Shao Cong Sun", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Robert G Levenson", "Andrew Thomas Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian Wigdahl, Committee Chair", "Shao Cong Sun, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HIV-1", "bone marrow", "CNS", "CD34", "progenitor", "differentiation", "coreceptor", "LTR", "dementia", "HAD"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Societal Changes and Attitudes on the Maintenance and Shift of Pennsylvania German among the Old Order Amish in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania", "id": "23381", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10668", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Most literature on the maintenance and shift of Pennsylvania German among the Old Order Amish (hereafter often referred to as PG and OOA) suggests that PG among this conservative group of Amish will in the future still be maintained much as it has in the past.

It was also to propose possible positive actions to ensure the maintenance of the PG language. \n\nDrawing from questionnaires, interviews, participant observation, and analyses of actual conversations, the researcher concludes that English is spoken much more frequently than before, especially among the young people working off-farm employment. As a result, an increased usage of English in the home can be detected although PG is still the preferred language. \n\nA number of factors contribute to the maintenance of PG.  PG is still used extensively in intra-communication between Amish in the community and also in the workplace with Amish workmates. The Amish find it important to speak both PG and English. PG is thus still passed on to younger generations. PG serves a significant ceremonial function with respect to community worship. Furthermore, community members, both young and old, express mostly positive attitudes and loyalty toward the heritage language and culture.\n \nDespite strong maintenance, the seeds of language shift were observed as well. Elements likely to promote languages shift included increased off-farm work and more intense customer contacts, singings, youth-group meetings, and \u201crumspringa.\u201d Some negative attitudes were also expressed about PG constantly including an ever greater number of English words and expressions to an extent that in the end it will not be PG anymore. The question of identity then arose along with the issue of what will happen to the Amish as a separate people.  \n\nTo secure language maintenance, different measures need to be taken, especially to protect the home domain from the encroaching English language and to ensure that the OOA, especially the young, continue to regard PG in a positive light and thus wish to speak it also in the future.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10300], "author_name_tesi": "Qvarnstrom, Marie Yvonne", "last_name_ssi": "Qvarnstrom", "middle_name_ssi": "Yvonne", "first_name_ssi": "Marie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Carrie Neal Jackson", "Michael Travis Putnam", "John Lipski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barry Richard Page Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Carrie Neal Jackson, Committee Member", "Michael Travis Putnam, Committee Member", "John Lipski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PENNSYLVANIA GERMAN", "LANGUAGE MAINTENANCE", "SHIFT", "ATTITUDE", "SOCIOECONOMIC", "SOCIOCULTURAL CHANGES / LANCASTER COUNTY"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "PARTICULATE MATTER AND OZONE IN MEDIUM OFFICE BUILDINGS OF MEGAMILLION CITIES: SIMULATIONS USING CONTAM", "id": "3484zg88m", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12980", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ambient particulate matter (PM) and ozone are critical to human health and well-being given their association with increased mortalities of the respiratory and cardiovascular system.

The goals of this paper are to explore transports of ambient ozone and PM2.5 into urban office buildings considering outdoor air pollution, weather, and ventilation operating modes as well as estimate energy consumption of ventilation and filtration. This study employs multi-zone contaminant transport model (CONTAM) for the prediction of outdoor-indoor pollutant dynamics in three cities: Los Angeles, Beijing, and London. The model simulates infiltration of ambient ozone and PM2.5 into a Department of Energy reference building (medium office) considering outdoor climate condition, ventilation rates, and filtration efficiencies. Seasonal variations are one of the possible reasons to capture the influences of high contaminants levels in LA and elevate particle concentrations in Beijing and London. The study results show that outdoor-indoor pollutant transport varies significantly according to the ambient concentration, outdoor weather, season, and ventilation conditions. The indoor concentrations of ozone and particles in three cities are often higher than US EPA and WHO standards, implying that buildings are a critical domain of air pollution control in the major cities for reduction of human exposure to ambient air pollutants. The results suggest that flow rate and filtration efficiencies have significant influences on particulate matter transport and indoor concentrations. Pressure drops in air filtration process and ventilation of building are two major energy consumers of HVAC system. Comparisons between representative cities provide insights into particle enter into building under various weather and operation scenarios and strategies to maintain good indoor air quality and reduce energy use in cities.

Dense aggregations of Leiopathes fulfill the role of a foundation species as their branching morphology and vertical growth provide substrate and refuge for a variety of deep-sea organisms. This thesis focused on the microsatellite content, spatial distribution, genetic differentiation and response to chemical stress of Leiopathes glaberrima in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. \nMicrosatellite markers are useful in determining population genetic patterns and in detecting cryptic species yet they can be difficult to develop for Cnidaria. To elucidate the ancestral state of microsatellite dynamics in basal metazoans and develop molecular tools for L. glaberrima, abundance and type of microsatellite motifs were studied in eleven Cnidarian species representing two classes, three subclasses and eight orders within the phylum. Hierarchical clustering and log likelihood ratio tests revealed a weak relationship between phylogeny and microsatellite content. Further, comparisons between cnidaria harboring intracellular dinoflagellates and those that do not, show microsatellite coverage is higher in the latter group. The observed microsatellite patterns support previous studies that found tri- and tetranucleotides to be the most abundant motifs in invertebrates. Differences in microsatellite coverage and composition between symbiotic and non-symbiotic cnidaria suggest the presence/absence of dinoflagellates might place restrictions on the host genome. \nThe microsatellite survey yielded 10 novel microsatellite markers for the study of L. glaberrima that were used to study gene flow and mating patterns of this species. L. glaberrima inhabits carbonate outcrops in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, where multiple color morphotypes grow in sympatry. Based on both phylogenetic analysis and colony morphology these color morphotypes constitute one species. However, gene flow was disrupted between and within two nearby hard ground sites (distance = 36.4 km). The lineages and color phenotypes occurred in different microhabitats and models of maximum entropy suggested that depth and slope might influence their distribution. Thus, L. glaberrima is one phenotypically plastic foundation species employing a mixed reproductive strategy in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Utilizing a mixed mating strategy might enable this long-lived species to balance local recruitment with occasional long-distance dispersal to colonize new sites in an environment where habitat is limited. \nIn the Gulf of Mexico, cold-water corals are mostly found on carbonate outcrops of authigenic origin, which occur in areas associated with hydrocarbon prospecting, drilling and fishing. The recent 2010 oil spill from the MC252 well site exemplified effects of these activities on the deep-sea fauna, and uncovered gaps in the baseline information on deep-sea ecosystems. Here, I used differential gene expression analyses to describe and quantify the physiological responses of deep-sea corals to a sudden increase in hydrocarbons, dispersant and hydrocarbon-dispersant mixtures. Fragments from the red and white morphotypes of L. glaberrima were exposed to different concentrations of oil, dispersant and oil-dispersant solutions. Dispersant and oil-dispersant treatments were more lethal to the colonies than oil alone, in agreement with previous studies on invertebrates. The use of dispersants might prevent the hazards associated with oil slicks, but might potentially increase the amount of oil compounds in the water column to the detriment of cold water corals. Interestingly, the red colonies of L. glaberrima had better survival rates than white colonies, and also showed more changes in gene expression in response to the experimental treatments. These results suggested physiological differences between the two main morphotypes of L. glaberrima, and might indicate that white Leiopathes colonies are more susceptible to stress than their red counterparts. This has implications for understanding how L. glaberrima populations might respond to oil spills and mitigation strategies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10254], "author_name_tesi": "RUIZ,  DANNISE V", "last_name_ssi": "RUIZ", "middle_name_ssi": "V", "first_name_ssi": " DANNISE", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Iliana Brigitta Baums", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Claude Walker Depamphilis", "Christopher Howard House"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Iliana Brigitta Baums, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Chair", "Claude Walker Depamphilis, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Population genetics", "reproductive strategy", "phenotypic plasticity", "gene expression", "black corals"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Social Support and Coping on Acculturation and Acculturative Stress among East Asian International Students", "id": "23042", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10620", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the mediation effects of social support and coping on the relationship between levels of acculturation and acculturative stress among East Asian international students from China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan.

Outbreaks of severe dengue disease are increasingly common in regions where dengue was thought to be rare only a decade ago. Our knowledge of the epidemiological and evolutionary processes by which dengue viruses (DENV) invade new populations and become established as persistent viral lineages has been limited by a lack of data relating virus to host and vector populations, as well as the immune landscapes in which they spread over time.\nVirus lineages enter new populations regularly, but become established only occasionally and are generally detected long after establishment has occurred. The introduction of novel viral lineages has been shown to perturb the immune landscape in endemic environments, often causing massive epidemics and long-term changes in clinical manifestations within the host population. The use of large sets of spatially- and temporally- related DENV genome and envelope gene (E) sequences to investigate these lineage establishment events allows us to trace the timing and routes of viral movement between host populations, including the evolutionary dynamics of the viral lineages themselves. Determining whether trends in viral introduction and establishment can be distinguished within DENV phylogenies, and what these trends may be, is integral to understanding and controlling the spread of disease at local, regional, and global scales.\nIn this thesis, I explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of DENV dispersal to identify the routes by which dengue invades new populations, characterize trends in viral migration, and identify the factors that affect the speed and scope of DENV migration at various scales and in\nheterogeneous transmission environments. In hyperendemic settings, I determined that DENV diversity is maintained in densely populated urban areas, frequently spreading through urban and suburban populations and into rural areas, and following a predictable pattern of human movement that suggests a limited role for the vector in the rapid dispersal of an emerging lineage across the population. Once arriving in rural areas, transmission is remarkably spatially and temporally focal. Where climate conditions are suitable, these populations may show persistence of viral populations over multiple seasons, but the likelihood of lineage fade-out here is increased as a result of lower population densities and seasonal bottlenecks in DENV populations.\nHyperendemic urban areas further seed more distant populations at rates that appear to be dependent upon transmission intensities in the donor population and the connectedness of the human host populations, while the establishment of viral populations may show a greater dependence upon the immune landscape and the climate into which the virus is introduced. This is also true at the largest spatial and temporal scales, where I identify three geographic regions in tropical Asia that act as sources of global DENV diversity and suggest that immune- mediated competition allows for the DENV populations in these areas to be maintained largely in isolation of one another. These analyses are the first to indicate a primary role for South Asia in the evolution and maintenance of global DENV diversity. Not only does South Asia act as a primary source of DENV, but it also appears to be the most frequent source of novel DENV diversity (i.e., new lineages) for populations outside of Asia. Thus, characterizing the diversity of DENV in this region and the processes by which it is maintained and dispersed into new populations is integral to identifying the factors responsible for their emergence, persistence, and expansion into new landscapes across the globe.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8205], "author_name_tesi": "Rabaa, Maia Anita", "last_name_ssi": "Rabaa", "middle_name_ssi": "Anita", "first_name_ssi": "Maia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Holmes", "Andrew Fraser Read", "Isabella Cattadori", "Timothy Reluga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Holmes, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Fraser Read, Committee Chair", "Isabella Cattadori, Committee Member", "Timothy Reluga, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dengue", "molecular evolution", "phylogeography", "virus evolution"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Naturally Inspired Design\ninvestigation into the application of biomimicry in architectural design", "id": "14519", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "537", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current economic turmoil, persistent questions about climate change and the ubiquitous need for sustainable practices has attracted designers to turn to biomimicry for solutions to these problems.

This study contributes to knowledge of academic literacy practices socializing students in their disciplines through a social practice perspective. Specifically I focus on aspects of the social in this study of academic literacies and international graduate student socialization by looking at literacy mediators and translingual dispositions. How are the academic genres and literacy practices of international graduate students being shaped by social elements in the socialization process? How are their literacy practices mediating and being mediated by interactions and mentorship in this process? How are students\u2019 translingual dispositions to communication shaping their literacy practices? What, in fact, are students learning \u2013 e.g. strategies, outcomes, and genre knowledge \u2013 through these literacy practices? This dissertation answers these questions using a naturalistic ethnographic study of literacy mediators and translingual dispositions shaping the literacy practices of article writing, conferences presentations, and grant writing of two international graduate students. It demonstrates that academic writing competence is a function of a network of mediators and mentors, and therefore graduate students\u2019 academic literacies ought to be recognized as \u201cnetwork activities.\u201d It also highlights the affordances of a holistic socialization process that draws from the translingual dispositions students bring with them. I show that participation in non-academic activities empowers the international graduate students to negotiate between their own attitudes to literacies and disciplinary specialization.

Furthermore, cognitive difficulties may directly affect an individual\u2019s ability to employ more adaptive active coping strategies, leading to depression. The current study was designed to test whether coping mediated or moderated the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and depression longitudinally in MS.  Method: Fifty-five MS patients were assessed at two time points 3 years apart. Cognitive function was assessed at time 1, using a battery of neuropsychological tests. Coping was assessed at time one and time two using the COPE. An index of adaptive coping strategies was obtained by subtracting \u201cAvoidant Coping\u201d subscale scores from \u201cActive Coping\u201d subscale scores. Evaluative and mood symptoms of depression were assessed at time two using the Chicago Multiscale Depression Inventory.  Results: With regard to the moderation hypothesis, after accounting for the main effects for the Cognitive Task and Coping index, the interaction term accounted for 15% of the variance in depression (&#916;F = 10.40; p < .005).  With regard to the mediation hypothesis, the Sobel statistic suggested a trend towards significance (Z = -1.78; p < .10).  According to the bootstrap estimates, the indirect effect of cognitive functioning on depression via coping is different from zero with 95% confidence (-2.16; LL 95% CI: -4.90; UL 95% CI: -0.12).  This is consistent with the conclusion drawn from the Baron and Kenny (1986) criteria for mediation. Conclusions: Coping strategies, defined by the difference between active coping and avoidance coping in an individual, moderate the relationship between cognitive functioning and depression in patients with MS longitudinally. Hence, MS patients with low cognitive functioning are most at risk for experiencing depression when they use a maladaptive coping profile. Furthermore, coping partially mediates the relationship between cognitive functioning and depression longitudinally. This suggests that cognitive dysfunction influences an MS patient\u2019s\u2019 ability to employ more active coping strategies , relative to avoidant strategies, which in turn may contribute s to the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and depression in this sample.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [352], "author_name_tesi": "Rabinowitz, Amanda ", "last_name_ssi": "Rabinowitz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Andrew Arnett", "Peter Andrew Arnett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Andrew Arnett, Thesis Advisor", "Peter Andrew Arnett, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["coping", "cognitive dysfunction", "multiple sclerosis", "depresion", "moderation", "mediation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Intraindividual cognitive variability in sports-related concussion: Implications for motivation and neurological vulnerability", "id": "15105", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7903", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present thesis provides four publication-style empirical research papers that, taken as a whole, represent a study of intraindividual cross-domain cognitive variability in college athletes before and after sports-related head injury.

Conservation initiatives, including the creation of protected areas and national parks, remain the primary method of protecting Madagascar\u2019s forests and unique environment. Despite extensive research documenting the social impacts of conservation in Madagascar and globally, questions remain about how the creation of national parks and reserves influence the social well-being of forest dependent communities. \n\nThis research examines local perceptions of social well-being in two forest-dependent communities near Zahamena National Park (ZNP), Madagascar. An integrated approach applying an interactional community and political ecology framework is applied to define, and conceptualize the various ecological, social, cultural, and political processes within the community context that shape social well-being. Because past research on the social impacts of conservation has failed to explicitly define or measure social well-being, this study emphasizes specifically how residents\u2019 define it and the processes that impact individual and community well-being. Moreover, this approach merges past research on forest livelihoods and dependency with the social impacts of conservation to situate an analysis of social well-being within the community context.\n\nThis mixed methods case study was designed to highlight how the interconnections between forest livelihoods/dependency and conservation impact social well-being. Multiple qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed including key informant interviews with both local residents and conservation and park mangers and stakeholders, facilitated discussion groups, participatory photography, and a household survey to evaluate how changes in resource access and relations with ZNP influence residents\u2019 social well-being. \n\nStudy findings indicate ecological, social, and political processes impact the social well-being of ZNP residents. The creation and implementation of conservation regulations result in changes in access to land and other resources, negatively impacting residents\u2019 quality of life and overall social well-being. While significant community differences exist, overall, changes in access to the forest resource disrupts residents\u2019 quality of life and well-being. These changes in turn create strains on community relations and communion. Although regression models do not corroborate these community differences, quality of life, education levels, income sources, and community beliefs about ZNP are significant predictors of resident social well-being. Implications for these findings on current conservation management and protected area policy are addressed.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1063], "author_name_tesi": "Raboanarielina, Cara M.", "last_name_ssi": "Raboanarielina", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Cara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert E Luloff", "Albert E Luloff", "Leland Luther Glenna", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "James Craig Finley", "B Ikabolajeh Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert E Luloff, Dissertation Advisor", "Albert E Luloff, Committee Chair", "Leland Luther Glenna, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member", "James Craig Finley, Committee Member", "B Ikabolajeh Logan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Zahamena National Park", "forest livelihoods", "community perceptions", "social well-being", "social impacts of conservation", "Madagascar"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE MYXOVIRUS RESISTANCE PROTEIN, MX1, INTERACTS WITH CYTOSKELETAL PROTEINS AND IS SECRETED AS A COMPONENT OF EPITHELIAL CELL-DERIVED EXOSOMES: EVIDENCE FOR NOVEL \nCELLULAR FUNCTIONS \n\n", "id": "9769", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3406", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For the past 50 years, the dairy industry has experienced an increase in milk production accompanied by a decrease in reproductive performance [Sangsritavong et al., 2002].  This is evidenced by an increase in the number of inseminations required to establish a pregnancy, resulting in extended calving intervals [Lucy, 2001].   Approximately 40% of embryo loss occurs during a time when the conceptus is signaling to the dam to maintain the pregnancy [Thatcher et al., 1994].  In ruminants, this signal is interferon-tau (IFN-tau), which acts to block the endometrial luteolytic mechanism, allowing the corpus luteum to continue producing progesterone, which supports pregnancy [Godkin et al., 1982, Vallet et al., 1988, Spencer and Bazer, 1996].  IFN-tau also upregulates a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the endometrium, which are thought to play a role in endometrial differentiation and embryo implantation [Spencer and Bazer, 1996].  Two of these genes encode the myxovirus resistance proteins MX1 [Ott et al., 1998] and MX2 [Assiri et al., 2007].  \nOur lab has been studying the function of MX proteins in the endometrium during early pregnancy.  Recently, it was demonstrated that MX1 was secreted and regulated secretion of another protein ISG15 [Toyokawa et al., 2007].  Interestingly, MX1 and ISG15 lack a secretory signal sequence and secretion was independent of ER/golgi.  Therefore, it was hypothesized that MX1 regulates the secretion of proteins via one of the relatively uncharacterized \u201cunconventional\u201d secretory pathways.   Research presented here characterized the mechanism of MX1 secretion and further described how MX1 may function in the uterine epithelial cell as a regulator of secretion.  \nThe objectives of the first two studies were to find proteins that interact with MX1.  In the first approach, chemical crosslinkers were utilized to capture biologically relevant interactions in living ovine glandular epithelial cells (oGE) cells.  Potential interacting proteins discovered in these experiments included cytoskeletal proteins tubulin and actin, actin-modifying protein profilin 1, heat shock proteins 83 and 90, and annexin 2.  These are interesting candidates, but the identifications were based on single or double peptides using mass spectrometry, and need to be confirmed using alternate techniques.  In the second experiment a recombinant protein was developed and used as bait on an affinity column incubated with oGE cell lysates.  One protein interaction discovered using this technique was between MX1 and tubulin beta (TUBB).  These results were confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunofluorescence.  Furthermore, MX1 interacted with TUBB during interphase and mitosis in oGE cells with or without IFN-tau.  Collectively, these studies identified and confirmed the interaction between MX1 and the cytoskeletal protein TUBB, and also identified other candidate proteins that should be investigated further.\nA third study examined the mechanism of MX1 secretion.  Experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that MX1 was secreted via the multivesicular body (MVB)/exosome pathway in oGE cells.  A population of exosomes containing MX1 protein was identified and it was hypothesized that MX1 is trafficking proteins, potentially along the microtubule network, to the site of exosome formation and is being incorporated into exosomes as a result.  The objective of these studies was to characterize the MX1-containing population of exosomes to better understand the role of MX1 in their formation and secretion.   Results showed that MX1 was contained inside the exosomes and, like another exosomal protein, Alix, was secreted via a ceramide-dependent pathway.  It was also determined that MX1 was co-localized, at least partially, with the tetraspanin CD63 but not with MHC class 1 positive compartments, suggesting that there are multiple unique populations of exosomes secreted by these cells.\nThe experiments presented in this dissertation further defined the role of MX1 in unconventional secretion and provided clues to MX1 function through identification of protein interactions.  Based on previous studies and those described here, the working hypothesis is that MX1 regulates the unconventional secretory pathway of MVB formation/exosome secretion at the level of MVB and/or ILV formation in uterine epithelial cells.  MX1 could be trafficking proteins that are required for formation and secretion of these vesicles, and this process would be highly upregulated during early pregnancy because of the high levels of MX1 expression.  The free-floating preattachment embryo is completely dependent on uterine histotrophe (uterine secretions) and therefore MX1 could have a direct role in embryo survival.  Since the results of these experiments suggest MX1 could be regulating the secretion of exosomes, it will be important to determine 1) what proteins are secreted associated with exosomes and 2) their role in early pregnancy.  Exosomes have been shown to have numerous functions depending on their cellular origin.  Therefore it is likely that these uterine epithelial cell-derived exosomes have important biological functions during pregnancy, and MX1 may have a role in regulating these functions by controlling the release of exosomes from the cell. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3394], "author_name_tesi": "Racicot, Karen Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Racicot", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Karen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Troy Ott", "Troy Ott", "Daniel R Hagen", "Ramesh Ramachandran", "Anthony Paul Schmitt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Troy Ott, Dissertation Advisor", "Troy Ott, Committee Chair", "Daniel R Hagen, Committee Member", "Ramesh Ramachandran, Committee Member", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["protein interactions", "exosomes", "MX1", "maternal recognition of pregnancy"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Collimation Signatures of Gamma-Ray Bursts: Jet Properties and Energetic Inferred from X-ray Afterglow Observations\n", "id": "9821", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2807", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Our understanding of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their afterglows has progressed dramatically over the last few years thanks to the Swift mission and progress in prompt follow-up observations.

I study the extraordinary naked-eye GRB 080319B as an example of a burst with unusual observational properties of the prompt emission and afterglow suggestive of more complex two-component jet structure than the canonical form. Finally, I explore the expectations for GRB afterglow observations if all GRBs have this two-component structure but are commonly seen o&#64256;-axis. The implications of this non-canonical two-component jet structure for the total energetics, frequency, and physics of GRBs and their afterglows are far-reaching.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2803], "author_name_tesi": "Racusin, Judith Lea", "last_name_ssi": "Racusin", "middle_name_ssi": "Lea", "first_name_ssi": "Judith", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Nelson Burrows", "David Nelson Burrows", "Peter Istvan Meszaros", "John Andrew Nousek", "Derek Brindley Fox", "Paul Sommers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Nelson Burrows, Dissertation Advisor", "David Nelson Burrows, Committee Chair", "Peter Istvan Meszaros, Committee Member", "John Andrew Nousek, Committee Member", "Derek Brindley Fox, Committee Member", "Paul Sommers, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Astrophysics", "X-rays", "Gamma-ray bursts", "Afterglows"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Improving Terrestrial Carbon Modeling", "id": "22469", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "9445", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Terrestrial biosphere models can help identify physical processes that control carbon dynamics, including land-atmosphere CO2 fluxes, and have great potential to predict the terrestrial ecosystem response to changing climate.  This dissertation evaluates ways to improve biosphere model performance by 1) evaluating short term (5 years) performance across a broad range of representation complexity, 2) identifying sources of parametric uncertainty for long term (~100 years) performance within a mechanistically detailed model (Ecosystem Demography) and 3) identifying observations that best constrain long term performance.\n   Chapter 2 evaluates the performance of continental-scale carbon flux estimates from 17 models against carbon flux observations from 36 North American flux towers.   On average the regional model runs overestimate the annual gross primary productivity (5%) and total respiration (15%), and significantly underestimate the annual net carbon uptake (64%) during the time period 2000-2005. Comparison with site-level simulations implicate choices specific to regional model simulations as contributors to the gross flux biases, but not the net carbon uptake bias.   The models perform the best at simulating carbon exchange at deciduous broadleaf sites; likely because a number of models use prescribed phenology to simulate seasonal fluxes.  In general, the models do not perform as well for crop, grass and evergreen sites in terms of bias, correlation and magnitude of variation.  The regional models match the observations most closely in terms of seasonal correlation and seasonal magnitude of variation, but have very little skill at inter-annual correlation and minimal skill at inter-annual magnitude of variability.   The comparison of site versus regional level model runs demonstrate that 1) the inter-annual correlation is higher for site-level model runs but the skill remains low, and 2) the underestimation of year-to-year variability for all fluxes is an inherent weakness of the models.  The best performing regional models that do not use flux tower calibration are CLM-CN, CASA\u2013GFEDv2 and SIB3.  Two empirical models, calibrated with flux towers observations, EC-MOD and MOD17+, perform as well as the best process-based models.   This suggests that 1) empirical, calibrated models can perform as well as complex, process-based models, and 2) combining process-based model structure with relevant constraining data could significantly improve model performance. \n Through a sensitivity analysis of the Ecosystem Demography model (version 2.1), Chapter 3 identifies quantum efficiency and leaf respiration rate parameters as the highest contributors to model uncertainty regardless of time frame (annual, decadal, centennial).  This finding is sensitive to methodological choices within the meta-analysis process.  Trait data provides relatively modest constraint upon the model simulation whereas integrative measurements of NEE and AGB provide strong constraints to the model and parameter uncertainty.     Key actions for model improvement include 1) locating additional measurements related to quantum efficiency, leaf respiration rate and water fluxes (e.g. sap flux, soil moisture) and 2)  implementing a more mechanistic representation of growth respiration within the model.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9238], "author_name_tesi": "Raczka, Brett Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Raczka", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Brett", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ken Davis", "Chris Eliot Forest", "Klaus Keller", "Erica A H Smithwick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ken Davis, Dissertation Advisor", "Chris Eliot Forest, Committee Member", "Klaus Keller, Committee Member", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["terrestrial biosphere model", "carbon flux", "flux tower", "model-data comparison", "NEE", "GPP", "ED2", "parameter sensitivity analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "The Spatiality of the Corporate Landscape: Railroads and Patterns of Power\n\n", "id": "6444", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2204", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-09-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The historical and geographical literature on railroads in the United States is characterized by a paucity of work focusing specifically on the various forms of company control.

This dissertation utilizes a tripartite schema to explain power in the control of American railroads between the turn of the twentieth century and the Great Depression \u2014- in short, a more political-geographic view.  First, patterns of share ownership of 18 northeastern railroads are examined to investigate the \u201cseparation of ownership from control,\u201d the often taken-for-granted effect of the corporate revolution.

Microbial fuel cells are systems where fermentation endproducts or other organic and inorganic sources are oxidized by exoelectrogenic microbes to produce electricity with concurrent water purification. MFCs have been used effectively with a variety of substrates, but few studies have examined the stability of these systems over long periods of operation. It is shown here that MFC reactors\u2014except those fed formic acid\u2014still produced high power densities after one year of operation, but that these power densities decreased over time due to cathode deterioration. The degree of this loss in power density was specific to the electron donor, with the greatest power loss (54.3%) occurring in ethanol fed MFCs. The presence of a cathodic biofilm increased Coulombic efficiencies, but decreased power densities in MFCs fed fermentation endproducts.\nMicrobial electrolysis cells (MECs) utilize exoelectrogenic microbes for the oxidation of organic and inorganic substrates. Unlike MFCs, MECs require a small applied voltage to enable hydrogen evolution at the MEC cathode. MECs have also been shown to be effective with various substrates, but most studies still use platinum catalyst cathodes and very small reactors (<100 mL). It is shown here that a 2.5 L continuous flow microbial electrolysis cell produced a current density of 1.18 A/m2 and a maximum volumetric hydrogen production rate of 0.53 m3/m3/d without precious metal cathodes. The current density of 1.18 A/m2 is slightly lower than might be expected based on other studies, and may be due to increased electrode spacing and the presence of electrode separators. This study provides further evidence that minimizing electrode spacing is likely the most important factor in achieving high current. The continuous flow reactor was shown to be especially prone to methane production as gas produced after 15 days of operation was greater than 90% methane. This rapid transition to nearly complete methane production was likely due to a lack of periodic air exposure during continuous flow operation. \nSeveral approaches have been suggested in literature to reduce methane production in MECs. It is shown here that beyond an applied voltage of ~0.6 V, MEC methane production was not dependent on applied voltage or hydrogen production rate, as methane production rates stayed approximately constant above this applied voltage. An increase in temperature from 20 \u00b0C to 30 \u00b0C increased hydrogen and methane production approximately equally. Reactor air exposure over one day as well as a high applied voltage to the stainless steel cathode did not reduce methane production. In MFC tests, power density was hindered by a low pH solution. The combination of a low pH solution and a steel cathode in MEC operation almost prevented gas production completely. Long-term addition of a 2-Bromoethanesulfonic acid\u2014a known chemical methanogenesis inhibitor\u2014was shown to inhibit methanogenesis, but once it was omitted from the feed there was no long-term inhibition of methanogenesis.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2044], "author_name_tesi": "Rader, Geoffrey Kermit", "last_name_ssi": "Rader", "middle_name_ssi": "Kermit", "first_name_ssi": "Geoffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["methane", "hydrogen", "microbial electrolysis cell", "microbial fuel cell"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL DESCRIBING TEMPERATURE BEHAVIOR IN HORIZONTAL WELLS: INVESTIGATION OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF USING A DOWNHOLE DISTRIBUTED TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM\n", "id": "11362", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1740", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Traditionally, isothermal condition is assumed in reservoir simulation.

Wellbore solution is obtained through the banded QR decomposition solver. Both reservoir and wellbore equations are discretized using finite-difference schemes. The discretization of the hyperbolic wellbore system of equations is assessed through the Flux Vector Splitting method (FVS) which allows us to write positive and negative parts of the fluxes at interfaces based upon the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system. \nIn the developed code, all hydrocarbon fluid properties are calculated using the Peng-Robinson Equation of State (EOS) whereas water properties are evaluated via data table. Hydrocarbon fluid calculations (oil and gas) are performed according to a synthetic Composite Differential Liberation (CDL) in which a Differential Liberation synthetic experiment is combined with the flash of all liberated gas throughout the separation facility. Therefore, in spite of oil and gas being treated as black-oil fluids throughout this work and the formulation of the governing equations, the available data are close to what one could expect from a real experiment with real fluids. Developed model results showed that influx of different fluids into the wellbore can be noted by changes in temperature behavior within the wellbore and depends upon fluid type and flowrates. Therefore, the model indicated that a distributed-temperature measurement system can help spotting the exact zones where different fluids breakthrough into the wellbore. Simulated case studies showed that for an injection rate of around 6,000 STB/D of water in a 4,000 ft long wellbore led to a total temperature drop of about 0.25oF. On the other hand, a production rate of 11,000 STB of oil per day caused a 1oF temperature drop across the wellbore, whereas 5,000 gas MSCF/D lead to a 3oF total drop. Additionally, one of the simulated case studies indicated that a uniform produced water profile of 650 STB/D in a 4,000 ft long wellbore, whose oil production is around 11,000 STB/D, caused a 0.5oF decrease in total temperature drop when compared to a no-water-influx case. Additionally, a simplified theoretical model was developed in order to answer a recurrent fundamental question in industry: what drives temperature behavior inside the wellbore? The derived non-isothermal, one-dimensional, single-phase theoretical wellbore model treats the fluid as a pure substance, and, through the use of appropriate thermodynamical relationships, we obtained a set of governing equations in which the dependent variables are pressure, velocity and temperature, making the analysis more evident. One of the conclusions we could come into with the simplified theoretical model was that temperature always drop in the flow direction, in spite of what is believed by many in the literature regarding Joule-Thomson effect. Another point is that temperature profile depends on fluid type and flowrate which agrees with our findings in analyzing the simulated case studies when using the numerical model. A new coefficient arises (units of temperature over pressure) as a major player in temperature behavior and could be identified in the simplified model. It depends on fluid sound speed, isothermal compressibility and the inverse of heat capacity. Although it can be also expressed as a function of Joule-Thomson coefficient, it is always positive, and because it is strongly dependent on compressibility, it determines that the expected total temperature drop in water shall be smaller than in oil which, in turn, shall be smaller than in gas. That finding also corroborates to what is observed in the simulated case studies using the numerical model.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1726], "author_name_tesi": "Radespiel, Eduardo ", "last_name_ssi": "Radespiel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Eduardo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin / Luis Ayala", "Turgay Ertekin", "Luis Ayala", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Ronaldo Vicente"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin / Luis Ayala, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Chair", "Luis Ayala, Committee Member", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Ronaldo Vicente, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wellbore temperature", "flux vector splitting", "wellbore-reservoir coupling", "black-oil", "reservoir simulation", "non-isothermal", "horizontal well"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Philanthropy, the Welfare State, and Early Twentieth-Century Literature", "id": "7626", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4391", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     \u201cPhilanthropy, Welfare, and Early Twentieth-Century Literature\u201d furthers the discussion of modernist literature and its relationship to modernity by showing the role of the philanthropy-versus-welfare debates in early twentieth-century fiction.

When the special pair in PSI, P700, is oxidized, a charge-separated state occurs between P700 and the terminal Fe/S cluster FB, and the electron quantum mechanically tunnels from FB to the [4Fe-4S] cluster in hydrogenase.

FDHH catalyzes the two-electron oxidation of formate to carbon dioxide (CO2) yet can also catalyze the reverse reaction in which formate is produced from CO2. It is our goal to tether FDHH to PSI to generate formate, which can then be used as a renewable energy source. In regards to SiR, the enzyme that catalyzes the six electron reduction of sulfite to hydrogen sulfide, we wish to probe mechanism by inducing a charge separated state in PSI via a laser flash, and subsequently reduce SiR with individual electrons. This should allow the spectroscopic characterization of the oxidation states of the cofactors under turnover conditions.

Temperature is widely cited as the most important factor controlling the timing of aboveground growth, but the effects of warming on belowground phenology are poorly understood. Because root and shoot phenology may not be synchronous and may not be influenced by warming in the same way, root phenology research is critical to understanding shifts in whole-plant growth with climate change. In order to more fully understand the drivers of root phenology, in Chapter 1 we conducted a literature review of root phenology studies and determined that only 29% of these studies examined phenology in a highly quantitative way. We propose that if future studies quantitatively examine different phases of annual root phenology separately, specifically root initiation, peak, and cessation, we may be able to better understand the drivers of root phenology. In Chapter 2, we carried out this idea by quantitatively examining root initiation, peak, and cessation in a long-term dataset of grape root phenology. We determined that drivers of phenology above- and belowground are not likely to be the same, and drivers may change throughout the year. In Chapter 3 we examined the influence of experimental warming and herbivore exclusion on phenology in the Arctic. In this study, we found that warming did not affect roots in the same way as leaves, because warming advanced leaf phenology but not root phenology. We conducted a similar experimental warming study in Chapters 4-5, in which we compared the influence of warming on two vegetation types. Warming had minimal impacts on phenology above- and belowground at this site. Additionally, in contrast to expectations, root growth was not a primary driver of carbon exchange despite high root:shoot ratios at this site.

Existing explanations of protest policing in western democratic countries are predicated on rationalist assumptions, which assume that demonstrators' behavior is the primary factor shaping police response. Yet, such explanations ignore the political and spatial context where protest occurs, as well as the institutional pressures, policies, and preferences that also shape police action. This dissertation challenges the dominance of such rationalist explanations by emphasizing how a wide variety of elements other than protestor behavior strongly condition police responses. I address four major research questions: First, how is protest policing linked to the social structural, institutional, and political-economic environment where it occurs? Second, (how) are elements of a demonstration other than participant behavior related to police responses? Third, has the policing of protest evolved over time? If so, why has it evolved in the way that it did? Finally, do similar factors influence both overt and covert police repression of protest?\n\nTo answer these questions I examine three main aspects of protest policing: First, I look at trends in protest policing across 20 major U.S. cities (1996-2006) to see whether there are differences in protest policing by place. The results show extensive variation in police response, even after accounting for the behavior of the protestors. Second, to examine temporal trends in protest policing I analyze several thousand demonstrations occurring in New York City (1960-2006). I find a notable increase in the use of force and arrests at demonstrations over time, which I link to spatial privatization and the adoption of extremely aggressive crime control policies. Finally, to assess whether overt and covert forms of state control follow a similar logic, I examine patterns of covert surveillance of social movement organizations based in Philadelphia (2009-2010). The results indicate a groups' contentious history had little impact on surveillance rates, which were instead strongly related to groups' political ideologies. \n\nOverall, I demonstrate that explanations emphasizing behavior are incomplete and perhaps misleading.

Despite the apparently seasonal nature of these outbreaks, seasonal dynamics remain largely ignored in recent studies of amphibian parasites.  In this thesis, I present results of field studies describing seasonal patterns for multiple parasitic infections and testing between potential drivers of parasite infection risk using red-spotted newts (<i>Notophthalmus viridescens</i>) as a model species.  Most newt parasites had seasonal dynamics, with significantly more parasite species having peak infection rates during the early and late spring than in other seasons.  These similar seasonal patterns appear to have been driven by multiple different factors, many of which may have been driven in turn by bottom-up effects of the spring bloom in pond productivity.  \n\n\tSeasonal patterns in white blood cell counts indicated that amphibian immunity has similar responses to temperature in the field as have been recorded in laboratory studies.  Moreover, both temperature increases and decreases were associated with low levels of immunity relative to temperature, indicating a negative effect of temperature variability on amphibian immunity.  This pattern is probably due to a lag in production of immune cells following temperature increases in spring, and to a lag in seasonal acclimation to winter temperatures causing low immune cell production rates in autumn.  \n\tThe last three chapters focus on the ecology of <i>Ichthyophonus</i> sp., a protist parasite of newts which has caused mass morbidity events in North America.  Based on data from the seasonal survey, an additional survey of sixteen populations, and a capture-mark-recapture study, several lines of evidence suggest that the amphibian leech <i>Placobdella picta</i> is the vector of <i>Ichthyophonus</i> sp. infection in newts.  There was little indication of mortality due to infection despite high apparent morbidity, but <i>Ichthyophonus</i> sp. infection did appear to cause males to stop breeding earlier in the spring and to induce temporary emigration in female and possibly male newts.

In addition, pups will display maternal solicitation behaviors, such as perioral contact, that prompt the dam to initiate maternal behaviors.

The association between delinquent peers and delinquent behavior is among the most consistent findings in the criminological literature, yet key questions about how deviant behavior is socially transmitted remain unresolved. In particular, much of the research examining peer influence is limited to peer behavior despite a rich literature supporting the salience of beliefs in shaping behaviors. Furthermore, the extant literature has not fully explored whether these links between peers and deviance are age-graded. This dissertation examines the roles that peers play in the development of deviant behavior in early adolescence and specifically how these roles go beyond the influence of peer behavior.\n\nI pursue this line of research in three empirical chapters, each of which employs data collected from the evaluation of the PROSPER partnership model. In the first empirical chapter, I focus on the roles that peer beliefs play in the development of alcohol use. I distinguish several pathways through which peer beliefs could be associated with behavior, and my results highlight a complicated interplay between beliefs and behaviors and suggest that the salience of delinquent peers extends beyond their behavior. The second empirical chapter builds on the themes of peer and development by examining whether the links between peers and drinking change during adolescence. My results suggest that the processes of influence and selection are age-graded and that the importance of selection processes increases from early to mid-adolescence. In my final empirical chapter, I replicate the analyses of the previous chapters but consider cigarette use and beliefs related to smoking. The results of these models support the general conclusions observed in the previous chapters: peer beliefs are important factors that contribute to deviant behavior and the links between peers and deviance change throughout adolescence.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10466], "author_name_tesi": "Ragan, Daniel T", "last_name_ssi": "Ragan", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["D Wayne Osgood", "Derek Allen Kreager", "David R Johnson", "Scott David Gest"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["D Wayne Osgood, Dissertation Advisor", "Derek Allen Kreager, Committee Member", "David R Johnson, Committee Chair", "Scott David Gest, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Peers", "drinking", "smoking", "social network analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Impact of Quality of Information on Performance and Scalability of Wireless Networks", "id": "b2773v69s", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12912", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation centers around two relatively new fields of study in communication networks. The first, Quality of Information, or QoI, refers to the inherent and contextual characteristics of data that define its utility to a particular application. The second, wireless ad hoc networks, are a field of network applications in which wireless devices, which are often mobile, must exchange information without the support of existing infrastructure, making them highly suitable for applications like emergency networks, military tactical networks, and sensor networks.  \nBoth QoI and wireless ad hoc networks bring a distinct set of design challenges to light because of their novelty and unique attributes. Both, however, also provide new opportunities for rethinking network research. Specifically, we expand our approach to designing network protocols to include algorithms that control a number of layers in the network stack jointly using current network conditions, such as backpressure routing. Within this approach to network control, we also seek to understand how the QoI metrics of accuracy, precision, and freshness of the network state information impact performance. Additionally, we consider the QoI of application layer data. We do so first by designing algorithms to select data in wireless sensor networks with the goal of maximizing the coverage of the selected data. We then model the scalability and limitations of networks when designing them to provide a minimum level of QoI instead of traditional approaches that simply offer asymptotic analysis.\nIn each contribution of this dissertation, we aim to understand the impact of QoI on network control and analysis by building flexible models able to be applied to a variety of potential applications. In our analysis, we have strived to consider the practicality of applications in real-life scenarios. We achieve this practicality by considering overhead of protocols, developing and analyzing approximation algorithms to computationally complex algorithms, and providing realistic simulation results generated by the Qualnet and ns-3 network simulation software packages.\nWe first study the framework of backpressure routing, providing analysis of its performance under delayed or inaccurate network state information as well as a close look at how overhead impacts performance in distributing this network state information. Next, we use Lyapunov optimization techniques from backpressure routing theory in a QoI-aware application to data selection for maximum information coverage with cost constraints in sensor networks. Finally, we use QoI to create a framework that outlines practical scalability and maximum achievable QoI limits. Overall, the goal of this document is to explore how Quality of Information impacts design and understanding of control algorithms and performance limits in ad hoc networks designed to support a variety of applications.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12255], "author_name_tesi": "Rager, Scott Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Rager", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas F Laporta", "Thomas F Laporta", "Guohong Cao", "Wang-Chien Lee", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas F Laporta, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Chair", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "Wang-Chien Lee, Committee Member", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Network Performance", "Network Scalability", "Quality of Information", "Backpressure Routing", "Wireless Networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Laser-fired contact formation on metallized and passivated silicon wafers under short pulse durations", "id": "21939", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9701", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current process used to fabricate localized aluminum-silicon (Al-Si) ohmic contacts on the rear side of dielectrically passivated Si-based photovoltaic (PV) devices has a negative impact on manufacturing throughput and yield.  Laser processing is an alternative, non-contact method that can be used to rapidly fabricate laser-fired contacts (LFCs) without sacrificing energy conversion efficiency.  However, laser firing is a highly transient process governed by a number of complex physical phenomena, such as rapid heating, melting, and alloying element vaporization, that occur simultaneously over extremely short time and length scales.  Therefore, determining the impact of laser processing on LFC formation is not a trivial undertaking.  \nRecent development of the LFC process has centered on the use of nanosecond pulse durations, despite the need for costly control systems, to prevent significant ablation of the Al metallization layer.  The use of laser systems capable of microsecond laser pulses can be used to mitigate these issues.  In addition, longer pulse durations can be used to form larger, more heavily-alloyed LFCs while preventing significant liquid metal expulsion when laser parameters are carefully selected.  In order to assess the viability of using microsecond pulse durations for LFC formation, it is important to determine the influence that laser processing parameters have on contact geometry and passivation layer quality since these factors will directly impact device performance.  In addition, due to the complexity of the simultaneously occurring physical processes, a quantitative framework is required to evaluate the physical phenomena occurring during contact formation over a wide range of processing parameters without the need for costly experimentation.   \nThe objective of this work is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the physical processes governing LFC formation under microsecond pulse durations.  Primary emphasis is placed on understanding how processing parameters influence contact morphology, passivation layer quality, alloying of Al and Si, and contact resistance.  In addition, the research seeks to develop a quantitative method to accurately predict the contact geometry, thermal cycles, heat and mass transfer phenomena, and the influence of contact pitch distance on substrate temperatures in order to improve the physical understanding of the underlying processes.  Finally, the work seeks to predict how geometry for LFCs produced with microsecond pulses will influence fabrication and performance factors, such as the rear side contacting scheme, rear surface series resistance and effective rear surface recombination rates.  \nIn order to achieve these objectives, a combination of experimental characterization and numerical simulations are employed.  Advanced materials characterization tools are used to section, polish, and determine the impact of laser processing on the LFC and the surrounding passivated regions.  Electrical analysis is performed using physical measurements of contact resistance as well as device simulations to evaluate the influence that laser processing and contact geometry have on contact resistance.  In addition, a heat transfer and fluid model is developed to quantitatively understand how changes in processing parameters affect the LFC geometry, temperature, velocity, and concentration fields.  Finally, in order to predict the impact of contact geometry on device performance, analytical expressions are developed to account for the contacts produced using microsecond pulses that have with larger interfacial contact areas to determine the rear surface series resistance and effective rear surface recombination velocities.  \nThe characterization of LFC cross-sections reveals that the use of microsecond pulse durations results in the formation of three-dimensional hemispherical or half-ellipsoidal contact geometries.  The LFC is heavily alloyed with Al and Si and is composed of a two-phase Al-Si microstructure that grows from the Si wafer during resolidification.  As a result of forming a large three-dimensional contact geometry, the total contact resistance is governed by the interfacial contact area between the LFC and the wafer rather than the planar contact area at the original Al-Si interface within an opening in the passivation layer.  By forming three-dimensional LFCs, the total contact resistance is significantly reduced in comparison to that predicted for planar contacts.  In addition, despite the high energy densities associated with microsecond pulse durations, the passivation layer is well preserved outside of the immediate contact region.  Therefore, the use of microsecond pulse durations can be used to improve device performance by leading to lower total contact resistances while preserving the passivation layer.  \nA mathematical model was developed to accurately predict LFC geometry over a wide range of processing parameters by accounting for transient changes in Al and Si alloy composition within the LFC.  Since LFC geometry plays a critical role in device performance, an accurate method to predict contact geometry is an important tool that can facilitate further process development.  Dimensionless analysis was also conducted to evaluate the relative importance of heat and mass transfer mechanisms.  It is shown that convection plays a dominant role in the heat and mass transfer within the molten pool.  Due to convective mass transfer, the contacts are heavily doped with Al and Si within 10 \u00b5s after contact formation, which contributes to the entire resolidified region behaving as the electrically active LFC.  The validated model is also used to determine safe operating regimes during laser processing to avoid excessively high operating temperatures.  By maintaining processing temperatures below a critical temperature threshold, the onset of liquid metal expulsion and loss of alloying elements can be avoided.   The process maps provide a framework that can be used to tailor LFC geometry for device fabrication.\nFinally, using various geometric relationships for the rear side contacting scheme for photovoltaic devices, it is shown that by employing hemispherical contacts, the number of LFCs required on the rear side can be reduced 75% while doubling the pitch distance and increasing the passivation fraction.  Reducing the number of backside contacts required can have a noteworthy impact of manufacturing throughput.  In addition, the analytical models suggest that device performance can be maintained at levels comparable to those achieved for planar contacts when producing three-dimensional contacts.  The materials and electrical characterization results, device simulations, and design considerations presented in this thesis indicate that by forming three-dimensional LFCs, performance levels of Si-based photovoltaic devices can be maintained while greatly enhancing manufacturing efficiency.  The research lays a solid foundation for future development of the LFC process with microsecond pulse durations and indicates that device fabrication employing this method is a critical step moving forward.

From social relationships between people to chemical interactions between bio-molecules to wired or wireless communications between technological devices, networks play a role. In recent years there has been a wide spread interest in the study of the 'structural organization' in such\ncomplex networks. The focus here is on the organization of links (who is connected to whom) in the network and its effects on dynamics and behavior of the networked system.\n\nTraditionally complex networks were modeled as random graphs that were introduced by Paul Erdos and Alfred Renyi (E-R random graphs) [1]. Here pairs of nodes in a network are linked with a uniform probability p. However in the recent\nyears empirical observations from a wide range of large-scale networks such as the movie actor collaboration network, scientific co-authorship networks, protein-protein interaction maps of cells and organisms, neural networks, the World Wide Web (WWW) and others revealed properties that deviate from the properties of E-R random graphs. For example, many real-world networks have a power-law degree distribution, high degree of local order, assortative or dis-assortative mixing patterns and tightly interlinked groups called clusters as opposed to E-R random graphs that have a Poisson degree distribution, no particular local order or mixing patterns or clustered structures. This implies that in many social, biological and technological networks the organization of links (who is connected to whom) follow specific principles (which is not random) leading to the observed network properties. A lot of research has\nbeen done in recent years to understand various structural properties of complex networks and in identifying the organizing principles defining them. In this thesis we focus on two problems of\nstructural organization in networks, namely clustering and connectivity.\n\nThe presence of clusters has been observed in many real-world networks (for example, the presence of groups or communities in social networks, functional modules in biological networks and\nwebpages on similar topics in the WWW) There has been a lot of effort recently in defining, identifying and extracting these clusters from complex networks to better understand their structural organization. To identify clustered structures in networks we develop an algorithm that uses a consensus formation mechanism to\nextract densely interlinked groups. To our knowledge such a mechanism has not been previously used to identify clusters in networks and thereby contributing to another way of defining them.\nOne of the main advantages of this algorithm is its ability to run in a near-linear time and hence its applicability to very large networks. Also unlike most of the existing algorithms we do not\nrequire any a priori information such as the number and sizes of the clusters present in the network. By applying the algorithm on actor collaboration, scientific co-authorship, protein-protein interaction and World Wide Web networks we highlight that there exists multiple significant clustered structures revealing the\nrichness of the orders present in them. Further, this result supports the presence of overlapping clusters in social and biological networks [2].\n\nA connected network is one in which it is possible to travel from any node to any other node via the links. For the connectivity problem we consider a class of networks that initially contain no links. Our goal is to create and organize links in the network, which is limited by certain constraints, to obtain network connectivity. We solve the connectivity problem in the domain of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). That is, the constraints that curb the creation of links are given by the physical limits of tiny wireless sensor devices. In WSNs the nodes are sensor devices and the links are the wireless communications between these devices. The constraint here is that the degree of any node (number of communications of a node) should be strictly bounded and cannot increase with an increasing network size ($N$). Unlike previous results that insisted that the smallest degree required, to obtain connectivity, is a function of $N$ and increases with $N$, we show\nthat it is possible to put a bound on the degree. In specific, we show that if we can tolerate certain nodes being disconnected then every node is required to communicate only to its five closest neighbors (organization principle) to obtain a giant connected component in a network of any size $N$.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6375], "author_name_tesi": "Raghavan, Ushanandini ", "last_name_ssi": "Raghavan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ushanandini", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara", "Reka Z Albert", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "Tao Yao", "Arvind Rangaswamy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara, Committee Chair", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Chair", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "Arvind Rangaswamy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["networks", "social networks", "community detection", "wireless sensor networks", "clustering", "connectivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Improved generative modeling approaches for semi-supervised and domain adaptive classifier learning from labels and constraints", "id": "23319", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10427", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation makes contributions towards the following three closely related, important problems in machine learning: {\\em 1. Semi-supervised classification, 2. Semi-supervised learning with instance-level constraints, and 3. Semi-supervised domain adaptation of classifiers}. Semi-supervised learning, which has been an active area of research for more than a decade now, attempts to mitigate the problem of label scarcity or limited supervision in practical machine learning and statistical modeling tasks, such as classification and clustering, by exploiting the relative abundance and easy availability of unlabeled data to improve upon model solutions which would otherwise be based only on the limited data having supervision. Domain adaptation of classifiers is a relatively recent area of research, where the goal is to leverage the availability of a large labeled database and/or an existing classifier model to adaptively learn a better classifier model for a target domain where the underlying distribution of data is different. \n\nIn the case of {\\em semi-supervised classification}, where the partial supervision is in the form of class labels, we developed a method for improving upon the class posterior probability model given the feature vector (set of features) for a generative mixture model based classifier. In particular, based on novel stochastic data generation methods, we allow the class posterior probability models within the mixture components to be non-trivial functions of the feature vector, addressing a significant limitation of existing methods which only allow a single class per component or a single, feature vector independent probability mass function per component. This allows for more {\\em fine-grained} component conditional class modeling, leading to potentially better classification performance as we demonstrate on synthetic and real data sets in Chapter \\ref{ss_fine_grained}. \n\nIn the case of {\\em semi-supervised constraint-based learning}, where supervision is in the form of constraints on pairs of data samples indicating whether the sample pairs are from the same underlying class (a must-link constraint) or from different underlying classes (a cannot-link constraint), we developed a method for predicting the grouping of data samples into (unknown) classes, which {\\em not only} satisfies a majority of the constraints, but also ensures that the spatial implications of the constraints are consistently enforced in the solution, leading to better grouping solutions and generalization on unseen data. Most of the prior works addressing this problem do not provide a serious treatment of this requirement to enforce the spatial implications of the constraints in the solution. Also, they make a typically unrealistic assumption that the number of underlying classes is known and provided as input, while our method does not require this knowledge, and in fact provides an estimate of the number of classes as a by-product of the model learning. In Chapter \\ref{ss_constraint_based}, we demonstrate that our method can lead to significant performance improvements on a variety of synthetic and real data sets.\n\nIn the case of {\\em semi-supervised domain adaptation of classifiers}, we have a scenario similar to semi-supervised learning in one of the data domains (called target domain), with scarcity of labeled data and relative abundance of unlabeled data. However, in addition, there is easy availability of labeled data from a different domain (called source domain) for which it is possible that the underlying probability distribution of the data (features and class labels) may be different from that of the target domain. Under the assumption that the underlying data distributions of the two domains are not {\\em very} different, we leverage an existing generative mixture model based classifier learned solely using the labeled data from the source domain, and adapt its parameters using both the labeled and unlabeled data sets from the target domain. The formulation and solution approach adopted by this method and the semi-supervised constraint based learning method are similarly motivated by the need to achieve label propagation (or constraint propagation) by imposing space-partitioning in the solution. In chapter \\ref{ss_domain_adapt}, using publicly available Internet packet-flow traffic data from different temporal and spatial domains, we demonstrate significant classification performance improvements in the setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation.

This results in illnesses such as food poisoning and lethal toxic shock in humans. SEB responses have been shown to be mediated primarily by T cells. The Tec family kinase has been shown to be involved in T cell activation in vitro. NKT cells, a T cell subset, are known to be rapid responders to infection, causing rapid release of cytokines such as IFN-\u0192\u00d7, IL-4 and IL-2. Therefore, using SEB as a model antigen we aimed to study the role of the Tec family kinase ITK in activation and function of T and NKT cells in vivo.\n   We examined proliferative responses to SEB, showing that both in vitro and in vivo ITK null T cells have reduced proliferative responses. We show that, in response to SEB, ITK deficient mice showed increased expression of the early activation marker CD69, although lower than that of WT mice. Since ITK regulates downstream signals we analyzed the role of ITK in regulating JNK pathway activation using phosporylated-c-jun as a measure of JNK pathway activation; showing that ITK mediates and is necessary for JNK pathway activation. Since NKT cells are known to be important immunomodulatory cells by their immediate responses through rapid cytokine release, we analyzed the regulatory role ITK has on NKT cells, using the potent NKT cell stimulator \u0192\u00d1-Galactosylceramide (\u0192\u00d1-GalCer). We analyzed proliferative responses and cytokine production of these cells in ITK null mice, showing NKT cells in ITK null mice exhibit reduced proliferative responses in vitro and secrete reduced levels of IL-2 in vivo. However, showing less of an effect of ITK on NKT cell secretion of IL-4, IFN-\u0192\u00d7\u0192z\u0192nand TNF-\u0192\u00d1\u0192nin vivo compared to WT\u0192| Based on the ability of NKT cells to respond to antigen quickly and their ability to inhibit responses to disease we analyzed NKT cells responses to SEB, using NKT cell null mice.  We analyzed the ability of T cells to expand in these NKT cell null mice, and found no differences compared to WT mice, suggesting that the V\u0192\u00d28+ T cell population is expanded by SEB in these mice.  When we analyzed cytokine production in response to SEB we found that J\u0192\u00d118 and CD1d null mice, thus NKT cells, do not seem to be necessary for IL-2 production, but are necessary for IL-4 secretion whereas J\u0192\u00d118, not CD1d seems to be required for the production of IFN-\u0192\u00d7; CD1d, however, is more important for the production of TNF-\u0192\u00d1, suggesting differential regulation of cytokines in response to SEB. Together these data suggest a role for ITK in regulating downstream T cell signal transduction in response to SEB, as well as regulation of NKT cell proliferation, but not development, and function, evidence that ITK may serve as an important target for T cell mediated diseases. Further, our studies suggest that NKT cells, in response to SEB, may differentially regulate disease, through their cytokine secretion patterns.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4166], "author_name_tesi": "Ragin, Melanie Jean", "last_name_ssi": "Ragin", "middle_name_ssi": "Jean", "first_name_ssi": "Melanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Avery August", "Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Pamela Correll", "Dr Biao He", "Dr Nandini Vasudevan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Avery August, Committee Chair", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member", "Pamela Correll, Committee Member", "Dr Biao He, Committee Member", "Dr Nandini Vasudevan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ITK", "SEB", "T cell activation", "NKT cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Thermally regenerative ammonia batteries for converting low-grade waste heat to electricity", "id": "14613mxr460", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14613", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Significant quantities of low-grade waste heat (temperature <130 \u00b0C) are available globally at various industrial plants and from solar or geothermal sources. Converting this heat energy to electricity has drawn increasing attention in recent years. Organic Rankine cycles, solid-state thermoelectrics, liquid-based thermoelectrochemical cells and salinity gradient energy systems have previously been investigated as means of converting low-grade waste heat to electrical energy. Despite much progress, these approaches have not produced high power densities or been cost-effective. Thermally regenerative ammonia batteries (TRAB) using copper electrodes and salts have produced ~12 times higher power densities than these previous approaches. In a TRAB, electrical power is obtained from the formation of metal ammine complexes, which are produced by adding ammonia to the anolyte, but not to the catholyte. After the cell discharges, ammonia is separated from the anolyte using a conventional technology, such as distillation with low-grade waste heat, and then added to the other electrolyte for the next discharge cycle.\nTo improve TRAB performance through a reduction in the membrane resistance, a series of quaternary ammonium-functionalized poly(phenylene oxide) anion exchange membranes (BTMA-AEMs) were examined for their impact on performance relative to a commercial AEM (Selemion AMV). The synthesized AEMs had different degrees of functionalization (DF; 25% and 40%), and thicknesses (50, 100 and 150 \u00b5m). Power and energy densities were shown to be a function of both DF and membrane thickness. The power density of TRAB was 31% higher using a BTMA AEM (40% DF, 50 \u00b5m thick; 106 \u00b1 7 W m\u20132-electrode area) compared to the Selemion (81 \u00b1 5 W m\u20132-electrode area). Moreover, the energy density increased by 13% when using a BTMA-based membrane (25% DF, 150 \u00b5m thick; 350 Wh m\u20133) compared to the Selemion membrane (311 Wh m\u20133). The thermal-electric conversion efficiency improved to 0.97% with the new membrane compared to 0.86% for the Selemion. This energy recovery was 7.0% relative to the Carnot efficiency, which was 1.8 times greater than the highest previously reported value of a system used to capture low-grade waste heat as electricity.\nA TRAB was adapted and tested as a process for recovering copper from solutions containing high concentrations of copper ions. Copper removal reached a maximum of 77% at an initial copper concentration (Ci) of 0.05 M, with a maximum power density (P) of 31 W m\u20132-cathode area. Lowering Ci decreased the percentage of copper removal from 51% (Ci=0.01 M, P=13 W m\u20132) to 2% (Ci=0.002 M, P=2 W m\u20132). Although the final solution might require additional treatment, the adapted TRAB process removed much of the copper while producing electrical power that could be used in later treatment stages. These results showed that a TRAB might be a useful technology for removing copper ions and producing electricity by using waste heat.\nTo improve the anodic coulombic efficiency of a thermal battery, ethylenediamine was examined as an alternative ligand to ammonia. The power density of the developed thermally regenerative ethylenediamine battery (TRENB) was 85 \u00b1 3 W m\u22122-electrode area (20 W m\u22122-membrane area) with 2 M ethylenediamine, and 119 \u00b1 4 W m\u22122 (27 W m\u22122-membrane area) with 3 M ethylenediamine. This power density was 68% higher than that obtained using a TRAB in parallel tests, and the energy density of 478 Wh m\u20133-anolyte was ~50% higher than that produced by TRAB. The anodic coulombic efficiency of TRENB was 77 \u00b1 2%, which was more than twice that obtained using ammonia in TRAB (35%). The higher anodic efficiency reduced the difference between the anode dissolution and cathode deposition rates, resulting in a process more suitable for closed loop operations. The thermal-electrical efficiency, based on ethylenediamine separation using waste heat was estimated to be 0.52%, which was lower than that of TRAB (0.86%), mainly due to the more complex separation process. However, this energy recovery could likely be improved through optimization of ethylenediamine separation process.\nTRABs based on copper can only be operated for a limited number of recharging cycles due to unbalanced rates of gain and loss of metal on the copper electrodes (i.e., low reversibility). To address the reversibility issue, a silver-based TRAB was developed as an alternative to the copper-based TRAB. With silver, the cathodic and anodic coulombic efficiencies of the TRAB were the same (~100%), resulting in a fully reversible system for converting low-grade waste heat into electricity over many successive cycles. The developed silver system produced a net maximum power density of 30 W m\u22122-electrode area, with a net energy production of 490 Wh m\u22123-anolyte in a flow cell with an optimal hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 s. Successive deposition and dissolution cycling (i.e., the electrode reversibility) showed the system was stable over a hundred cycles. An initial economic analysis of the system showed that the price of electricity produced based on materials costs was 1.8 times more than the average electricity price is the U.S. ($120 MWh\u22121), due primarily to the cost of the membrane and the silver. However, this could be reduced to $120 MWh\u22121 if the cost of a membrane could be reduced to $10 m\u20132. Other potential benefits, such as elimination of air pollution, and beneficial issues related to health and climate change were not included in the comparison. Although the cost of building and operation relative to energy production of Ag-TRAB is currently higher than that of conventional technologies, this approach could provide a cleaner method of electrical power generation using a waste source of heat if the commercial cost of ion exchange membranes could be significantly reduced.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15786], "author_name_tesi": "Rahimi, Mohammad ", "last_name_ssi": "Rahimi", "first_name_ssi": "Mohammad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "Manish Kumar", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Christopher Aaron Gorski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Dissertation Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Chair", "Manish Kumar, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Outside Member", "Christopher Aaron Gorski, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrochemical energy storage", "battery", "thermall battery", "waste heat recovery", "ion exchange membrane", "energy conversion", "electrochemistry", "flow battery", "electrodeposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Social interaction in student residence halls: An architectural perspective", "id": "26317", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11570", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The past decade has seen a considerable increase in student enrollment in postsecondary institutions nationwide. This increase has encouraged universities to plan new student housing facilities at the same time that family and student expectations have led to a reconsideration of residence halls and their amenities. Many universities have sought to keep students, especially upperclassmen, in on-campus housing, as a means of generating revenue as well as creating a sense of affiliation with the university community and minimizing student dropout rates. \nFacilitating social interaction among students is one of the most salient objectives of new on-campus housing developments. Social interaction aids in student retention, helps students to integrate themselves into broader student communities, increases learning opportunities, helps students adjust to their chosen universities\u2019 educational goals, integrates minority students into universities\u2019 social systems, and cultivates long-term relationships among students. \nWhile university administrators try to promote interactions among students in residence halls by providing meal plans and organizing social events or by manipulating the number and diversity of inhabitants (e.g. separating or mixing underclassmen and upperclassmen), less attention is usually paid to physical design factors. It is these physical factors, however, that are essential for creating stimulating environmental conditions that help students to interact. Despite the past decade\u2019s increased university enrollment, there remains a need for a coherent study of physical design factors in residence halls from an architectural standpoint as they relate to sociability. \n\nThis thesis aims to identify the environmental factors pertaining to social interaction in Northeastern and Midwestern residence halls in the United States. Two major steps were taken to identify these factors. First, the physical factors that influence social interactions in student residence halls were synthesized through an analysis of existing literature. A method was identified for categorizing dormitory buildings based on their socio-spatial attributes; these attributes were extracted from previous studies. Three major criteria for residential halls were extracted based on meta-analysis: the average number of bedrooms per auxiliary common space, the average number of bedrooms per service space, and the amount of corridor traffic flow. Using these criteria, 148 residence halls from four campuses in the Northeast and the Midwest were analyzed and five different typologies were developed. Secondly, a comparison was carried out between the final types in order to evaluate the degree of social interaction and the extent to which environmental factors contributed to this interaction. This resulted in developing activity maps of students\u2019 movement patterns and interactions in these residence halls over multiple observation sessions. \nThis study concludes that the environmental factors pertaining to social interaction in residence halls can be categorized into two broad groups: factors related to spatial configuration and factors related to the quality of individual spaces. For spatial configuration, three factors were identified: the separation of common spaces and individual spaces, the distribution of common spaces and individual spaces, and the fragmentation of spaces. Three factors pertaining to the quality of individual spaces were likewise identified: the visibility of spaces, the flexibility and functionality of spaces, and the finishing materials and colors. The environmental factors that were identified in this study provide a basis for architects and sociologists for both the design and assessment of the sociability level in various types of residence halls. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11075], "author_name_tesi": "Rahimi, Sohrab ", "last_name_ssi": "Rahimi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sohrab", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexandra Staub"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexandra Staub, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Social Interaction", "Residence Halls", "Space syntax", "Spatial analysis", "Dormitories", "socio-spatial environmental factors", "proxemics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "a participatory approach for constructing energy resiliency ", "id": "26169", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11770", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Energy production is typically a regional enterprise, with the majority of energy produced far from the main areas of demand causing tremendous problems in terms of lack of resiliency and flexibility in handling the ever changing demands at the users\u2019 end. On the other hand, microgrids as local energy infrastructures have offered resiliency by allowing neighborhoods to exercise greater control over the production of the energy they consume. As a system, the flexibility and resiliency that embodies the microgrid has to reside across all of its components and functions. Although microgrids integrate various techniques of automation, optimization, pervasive control and computation in its system, but equally important is addressing the human factors. Users, as an undeniable part of microgrid\u2019s operational system, are thus required to act with respect to being resilient and flexible. By making all the information of every grid component accessible to the demand side via energy metering systems and feedback loops, microgrids play an important role in filling the gap of energy illiteracy, increasing users\u2019 awareness and understanding about how energy is consumed in their homes and thus helping them to make informed energy consumption decisions. \n\nResearch on delivering high quality energy-related information on users\u2019 activities and consumption rates signify the effectiveness of such information for inspiring and motivating users to change their behavior towards more energy saving ones but however the issue of making these behavior changes durable and integrated to one\u2019s lifestyle, is still remaining a topic for further investigation.

Integration of host defense response elicitors into disease management program is one of the most innovative potential approaches to turf disease management. In order to support the wide-adoption of this approach to manage turfgrass disease, key questions, such as how exogenous application of plant resistance activators induce defense response in perennial ryegrass and whether such induced resistance is effective against fungal infections is warranted. However, how systemic defense response operates in perennial ryegrass is virtually unexplored, and only recently several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes have been identified and sequenced. Regardless of plant-pathogen interaction type, compatible or incompatible, products of several of these genes are known to accumulate to a higher degree and play a pivotal role in plant defense against pathogen infection. Incompatible interactions are typically characterized by more rapid and higher accumulation of defense-related metabolites/products compared to compatible interactions. The primary objective of this thesis research was to identify different components of induced resistance (IR) elicited by plant defense activators in perennial ryegrass, including pre-invasive defense reactions such as, papillae development, and post-invasive host responses including hypersensitive-like cell death and patterns of PR-gene expression following infection by Magnaporthe oryzae, a fungal pathogen causing gray leaf spot disease. Investigation on the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in perennial ryegrass revealed that M. oryzae infection causes accumulation of endogenous free salicylic acid (SA) in the leaf blades. Application of known SAR activators such as SA and BTH (benzothiadiazole) suppressed gray leaf spot disease with concomitant enhancement of expression levels of PR-3.1 and PR-5. Additionally, investigation on induced systemic resistance (ISR) with the biological control agent Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42, a plant beneficial rhizobacterium, and its metabolite surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide with plant defense stimulatory activity, revealed that H2O2 generating cell components play a key role in suppressing gray leaf spot on perennial ryegrass through activation of both pre- and post-invasive defense responses. Additionally, soil amendment with silicon formulation resulted in papillae-associated penetration resistance as well as enhanced defense-related gene expression in perennial ryegrass, thereby, suppressing gray leaf spot disease. The findings from these research projects contributed to enhancing our understanding of the multifaceted systemic defense responses in perennial ryegrass, which share similarities with other well-studied members of Gramineae family such as, barley, rice and wheat.

There are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies for the disease, but none are effective enough to completely diminish the debilitating side effects associated with demyelination of the central nervous system.  Opioids have been shown to regulate immune system function, but the role of opioids in MS has not been characterized.  \nThe purpose of this research was to determine if manipulation of an endogenous opioid system affects the progression of MS using an in vivo experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model.  The endogenous opioid system was manipulated using an opioid receptor agonist ([Met5]-enkephalin, Met-enk, opioid growth factor, OGF) or a high or low dose of an opioid receptor antagonist (naltrexone, NTX).  Additional in vitro studies were conducted to determine if administration of exogenous OGF or NTX affects splenic-derived lymphocyte proliferation.  OGF and NTX have been shown to decrease and increase the rate of cancer cell proliferation, respectively; the present studies focus on defining the unknown role of OGF and NTX in EAE progression.  The hypothesis of this research was that endogenous opioid systems play a role in EAE pathogenesis.  These experiments determined if disease course could be affected based on the availability and subsequent interactions of opioid peptide and receptors.  \nFor the in vivo studies, EAE was induced in 7 - 8 week old female C57Bl/6 mice with a series of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) injections on Days 0, 3, and 6.    Beginning with the first MOG injection, mice received a daily intraperitoneal injection of either phosphate- buffered saline (vehicle), a high dose of NTX to cause 24-hour opioid receptor blockade (HDN, 10mg/kg), a low dose of NTX to cause intermittent 4 - 6 hour opioid receptor blockade (LDN, 0.1mg/kg), or a high dose of opioid growth factor (OGF, 10mg/kg).  Treatment was administered at the same time each day.  Behavioral symptoms were monitored daily and disease scores were assigned based on a 0 - 5 scale.  A score of 0 was assigned to healthy animals free of EAE symptoms, and subsequent increasing scores correlated to increasing levels of disability.  Animals were sacrificed 10, 20, 30, and 60 days post-EAE induction to monitor pre-clinical EAE, acute EAE, established EAE, and chronic EAE, respectively.  Spinal cord demyelination was visualized with a luxol fast blue (LFB) stain, and additional spinal cord sections were stained with antibodies directed at astrocytes and damaged neurons to show changes in number or morphology of the cells.  \nIn vitro studies were conducted to determine if OGF or NTX administration altered splenic-derived lymphocyte proliferation.  First, the presence of both OGF and OGFr on splenic-derived mouse lymphocytes was confirmed with immunocytochemical analysis.  Next, fresh lymphocytes were isolated from the spleens of normal mice, activated with phytohemagluttinin (PHA), treated in culture with OGF or NTX, and counted daily to measure proliferation over a 72 hour time period.  \nResults revealed that chronic LDN and OGF treatment decreased EAE disease severity, disease incidence, and disease index, and increased the average day of EAE disease onset compared to vehicle-treated mice.  Continuous opioid receptor blockade with HDN had no effect on EAE disease onset or progression compared to vehicle treatment.  Immunohistochemical analysis of astrocyte activation and neuronal damage showed that daily administration of LDN improved histological symptoms of EAE in comparison to vehicle treatment at 10, 20, and 30 days post-EAE induction.  Similarly, daily injections of OGF decreased the level of astrocyte activation on Days 10, 20, 30, and 60 and the level of neuronal damage on Day 20 compared to vehicle-treated controls.  Interestingly, mice given HDN had lower astrocyte counts on Days 30 and 60 and less neuronal damage on Day 30 compared to vehicle-treated mice.  In vitro experiments demonstrated that OGF caused a decrease in lymphocyte proliferation compared to lymphocytes exposed to saline or NTX.  It is possible that OGF is effective at treating EAE in vivo due to a downregulation of immune system function due to an inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation.  Similarly, intermittent opioid receptor blockade with LDN, which causes upregulation in the production of endogenous opioid peptide and receptor, could inhibit the hyperproliferative immune response in EAE.  It is possible that LDN is beneficial in vivo because it causes an upregulation in opioid-opioid receptor interactions with subsequent decreased immune system function.\nCollectively, these results indicate that intermittent opioid receptor blockade with LDN and administration of exogenous OGF can prevent or decrease the behavioral and histopathological signs of EAE.  Although EAE is not a perfect model of MS, hallmarks of both diseases - inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration - were decreased in EAE following LDN and OGF administration.  Further studies should be conducted to determine the exact mechanism of action and efficacy in relapsing EAE models.  However, these data robustly support the use of LDN and OGF for the clinical treatment of MS.      \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3327], "author_name_tesi": "Rahn, Kristen Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Rahn", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Kristen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Mc Laughlin", "Patricia J Mc Laughlin", "Ian Stuart Zagon", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Richard Bruce Tenser", "Peter Andrew Arnett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Mc Laughlin, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia J Mc Laughlin, Committee Chair", "Ian Stuart Zagon, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Richard Bruce Tenser, Committee Member", "Peter Andrew Arnett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["opioids", "experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis", "multiple sclerosis", "naltrexone"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A NONLINEAR PREDICTIVE CONTROL OF MICROSCOPIC PROCESSES USING A FUZZY SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION APPROACH\n", "id": "12322", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "440", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "System identification and controller design for systems with atomic-scale dimensions is a challenging concept. In this work, the problem of model-based control of a microscopic process is investigated. The unavailability of closed-form models, as well as the ill-definition of variables to describe the process evolution, makes the controller design task challenging. We address this problem via a fuzzy system identification of the dominant process dynamics. The data required for the system identification of such processes is produced employing atomistic simulations. A methodology is developed in which fuzzy logic for nonlinear system identification is coupled with nonlinear model predictive control for regulation of microscopic processes. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology on a Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) realization of a simplified surface reaction scheme that describes the dynamics of CO oxidation by O2 on a Pt catalytic surface. The second case study on which this procedure performance will be evaluated is thin film deposition of silicon that has wide applicability in photovoltaic industry. Thin film deposition is of the most important manufacturing processes in the category of microscopic simulation and controller design. The quality of thin film which can be used in several different useful fields is highly dependent on the manipulated variables of the process which can be intentionally changed to achieve the highest quality. Using a lattice model of thin film evolution, the important characteristics of thin film, like thickness, roughness and porosity, can be simulated. The stochastic realization of this lattice model evolution is captured with KMC Simulation. \nThe nonlinear fuzzy model gives a reasonable approximation to the system even without using filter for the system and the proposed controller successfully forces the process from one stationary state to another state for the CO oxidation on Pt catalyst. \nIn the thin film deposition process, two important parameters are porosity and roughness of the film, which affect the quality of the thin film devices.The modeling and controller design approach is used for controlling porosity and roughness of thin film deposition process.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [434], "author_name_tesi": "Rahnamoun, Ali ", "last_name_ssi": "Rahnamoun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ali", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Antonios Armaou", "Antonios Armaou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Antonios Armaou, Thesis Advisor", "Antonios Armaou, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nonlinear model predictive control", "kinetic monte carlo", "nonlinear fuzzy system identification"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "STUDY OF PERFORMANCE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MATERIALS UNDER EXTREME ENVIRONMENT USING THE REAXFF REACTIVE MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS", "id": "zc77sq096", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12697", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary focus of this work is the study of different materials at extreme environment. These extreme environments include Atomic Oxygen (AO) impacts, ice cluster impacts, noble gas ions irradiation and electron irradiation on different materials. AO is the most abundant element in the low Earth orbit (LEO). It is the result of the dissociation of molecular oxygen by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. In the LEO, AO collides with the materials used on spacecraft surfaces and causes degradation of these materials. The degradation of the materials on the surface of spacecraft at LEO has been a significant problem for a long time. Kapton polyimide, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), silica, and Teflon are the materials used in spacecraft industry. Degradation caused by AO impact is an important issue in these materials applications on spacecraft surface. To investigate the surface chemistry of these materials in exposure to space AO, a computational chemical evaluation of the Kapton polyimide, POSS, amorphous silica, and Teflon was performed in separate simulations under similar conditions. For performing these simulations, the ReaxFF reactive force-field program was used, which provides the computational tool required to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on system sizes sufficiently large to describe the full chemistry of the reactions. Using these simulations, the effects of AO impact on different materials and the role of impact energies, the content of material, and the temperature of material on their behavior are studied. The ReaxFF results indicate that Kapton is less resistant than Teflon against AO damage. These results are in good agreement with the MISSE experimental results. In the MISSE projects, the mass loss of different materials is studied during space missions. These simulations indicate that the amorphous silica shows the highest stability among these materials before the start of the highly exothermic silicon oxidation. We have verified that adding silicon to the bulk of the Kapton structure enhances the stability of the Kapton against AO impact. Our canonical MD simulations demonstrate that an increase in the heat transfer in materials during AO impact can provide a considerable decrease in the disintegration of the material. This effect is especially relevant in silica AO collision. During aircraft or spacecraft missions, ice accumulates on different parts of their surface. We studied the dynamics of the collisions between amorphous silica structures and amorphous and crystal ice clusters with impact velocities of 1, 4 and 7 km/s using the ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics simulation method. The 1km/s and lower impact velocities can happen during aircraft missions and the impact velocities higher than 1 km/s can happen during spacecraft missions. The initial ice clusters consist of 150 water molecules for the amorphous ice cluster and 128 water molecules for the crystal ice cluster. The ice clusters are collided on the surface of amorphous fully oxidized and suboxide silica. These simulations show that at 1 km/s impact velocities, all the ice clusters accumulate on the surface and at 4 km/s and 7 km/s impact velocities, some of the ice cluster molecules bounce back from the surface. We also studied the effect of the second ice cluster impacts on the surfaces which are fully covered with ice, in particular their mass loss/accumulation. These studies show that at 1 km/s impacts, the entire ice cluster accumulates on the silica surface. At 7 km/s impact velocity some ice molecules, which are part of the ice layers accreted on the silica surface, will separate from the ice layers on the surface. At 4 km/s ice cluster impact, ice accumulation is observed for the crystal ice cluster impacts and ice separation is observed for the amorphous ice impacts. \nObserving the temperatures of the ice clusters during the collisions indicates that the possibility of electron excitation at impact velocities less than 10 km/s is minimal and ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics simulation can predict the chemistry of these hypervelocity impacts.\nHowever, at impact velocities close to 10 km/s the average temperature of the impacting ice clusters increase to about 2000K, with individual molecules occasionally reaching temperatures of over 8000K and thus it will be prudent to consider the concept of electron excitation at these higher impact velocities, which goes beyond the current ReaxFF ability. An important parameter affecting the ability to remove this ice from the surface is the heat transfer characteristics of the accumulated ice. The ice heat transfer is related to the process of ice formation and its density and internal structure. We investigated the effects of ice and silica structure and the ice cluster attachment mechanism to the silica surface on the thermal conductivity (TC) of the attached ice cluster using the ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics method. The purpose of this study is to investigate the thermal transport in amorphous and crystalline ice after deposition on the silica surfaces. A dual thermostat method was applied for the calculation of TC values. The validity of this method was verified by comparing the calculated values of TC for crystal and amorphous ice with available experimental values. Our calculations show that the TC value for both crystal and amorphous ice drop after deposition on the silica surfaces. This decrease in the TC is more significant for the ice deposition on suboxide silica surfaces. Furthermore, crystal ice shows higher TC values than amorphous ice after accumulation. However, when crystal ice impacts on the silica surface at 1 km/s impact speed, the crystalline shape of the ice cluster is lost to a considerable level and the TC values obtained for the ice clusters in such cases are closer to amorphous ice TC values. We observed a decrease in the TC values when ionic species are added inside the ice clusters. \nWe studied Kr noble gas ions irradiations on graphene, and the subsequent annealing of the irradiated graphene. Different types of defects were generated in graphene after noble gas ion irradiations. Kr irradiation mostly caused mono vacancy defects in graphene while light noble v \ngas ions can mostly generate Stone-Wales defects in graphene. The irradiated graphene was annealed between 300K and 2000K and the reconstruction of the defects was studied. In order to study the electron beam irradiation on Kapton using molecular simulation, electron beams irradiation at random positions of Kapton are modeled. For changing the amount of energy transfer to Kapton, each electron beam is irradiated for 1fs or 2fs. The temperature evolution and chemical composition changes in Kapton during and after electron beam irradiation was studied. The changes in chemical composition of Kapton are compared to the experimental results. This study shows that the time of each electron beam irradiation has considerable effect on the amount of energy transferred to Kapton. Kapton decomposition takes place at different Kapton temperatures under different electron irradiation conditions. At the start of decomposition, small molecules separate from the surface and with continuing electron irradiation, larger molecules start to separate from the surface. As our simulations demonstrate, ReaxFF can provide a cost-effective screening tool for future material optimization for applications in extreme environments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12599], "author_name_tesi": "Rahnamoun, Ali ", "last_name_ssi": "Rahnamoun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Molecular Dynamics", "ReaxFF", "Material Simulation", "Extreme Environment"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "CREATION AND ANALYSIS OF PURPOSE DRIVEN ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS \u2013 APPLICATION TO PARENTS OF GIFTED CHILDREN\n", "id": "8826", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "437", "abstract_tesi": "Gifted children are the powerful young minds that, if nourished, could one day cure leukemia or stop global warming or become the next Einstein.

Next, the thesis introduces an integrated set of methods to perform photometric calibration of endoscopes. This will enable objective and consistent\nestimation of airway surface texture/color in future. Partial photometric correction of\nvideo images for some of the bronchoscope dependent non-linearities is done now. Finally,\na method is proposed to map airway texture observed in bronchoscopic video on to the\nairway surface renderings. The method enables real-time navigation through the combined\n3D CT surface and bronchoscopic video data.\nThe proposed methods are incorporated into a computer based system for image-guided bronchoscopy and have been applied to a variety of phantom and human cases. Results show that we can e\u00aeectively accomplish mapping over a continuous sequence of airway images spanning several generations of airways in few minutes.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3907], "author_name_tesi": "Rai, Lav ", "last_name_ssi": "Rai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lav", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Evan Higgins", "Raj Acharya", "Robert T Collins", "H J Sommer Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Evan Higgins, Committee Chair", "Raj Acharya, Committee Member", "Robert T Collins, Committee Member", "H J Sommer Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CT video registration", "virtual endoscopy", "image-guided surgery", "lung cancer", "bronchoscopy", "calibration", "transfer function", "vignetting", "light source", "virtual reality", "texture mapping"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Human use, reproductive ecology, and life history of Garcinia gummi-gatta, a non timber forest product, in the Western Ghats, India\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "6118", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4639", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-03-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The harvest and sale of Non timber forest products (NTFP) by local communities has been suggested as a possible solution to the often observed conflict between forest use and forest conservation, due to the lower impact of NTFP harvest as compared to timber harvest. Recent studies have however suggested that the economic rewards might not be constant, and that ecological effects of harvest might be higher than previously believed. In India, the trade in NTFPs has a long history but few studies have explored both the ecological and socio-economic aspects of harvest. I report here, the results of a socio-economic and ecological study on the harvest of fruits from a rain-forest tree, Garcinia gummi-gatta, which occurs in the tropical forests of the Western Ghats. I studied the characteristics of G. gummi-gatta fruit harvest, socio-economic factors that influence harvest, and the ecological effect of fruit harvest. \n\nThe socio-economic study revealed that 1) Brahmin households had significantly higher income than non-Brahmin households and high income households harvested significantly more G. gummi-gatta rind than low income households, 2) the harvest of G. gummi-gatta fruits varied with forest tenure: harvest of unripe fruits and associated damage to trees in the \u2018open access\u2019 forest, and ripe fruit harvest in private forests, 3) G. gummi-gatta seedling density is higher in private forest than in \u2018open access\u2019 forest suggesting that security of tenure might result in stable populations of G. gummi-gatta, 4) a sharp fall in the price of G. gummi-gatta rind, due to market instability, resulted in a large decrease in the income of harvester households. My findings thus suggest that dependence on NTFP harvest by local communities might be problematic due to market instability, patchy resource distribution, inequitable access to forest resources within the village, and the lack of security of tenure.\n\nThe genus Garcinia, which is well represented in the Asian flora, is dioecious, and some species are apomictic. I studied the occurrence of apomixy, the mode of pollination, flowering phenology, flower production, and fruit set in a G. gummi-gatta population. G. gummi-gatta is dioecious and both male and female trees flower in the dry season. I found some evidence of facultative apomixy, possibly due to isolated trees occurring far from pollen pools. Female flowers offer no floral reward and are pollinated by \u2018mistake\u2019 by weevils of the genus Deleromus. I suggest that the correspondence between pollination by small insects and the occurrence of fleshy fruits in dioecious species is due to the trade off between the cost of elaborate floral displays and benefit accrued from increased gene flow due to seed dispersal by animals.\n\nIn order to understand the life history of G. gummi-gatta, I studied fruit production, seed dispersal, seed predation, seedling growth, seedling survival, spatial distribution of seedlings, juveniles, and adults, and adult tree growth. I found low inter-annual variability in fruit production at the population level. The degree of participation of individual trees in fruit production however varies from year to year. There is a significant positive relationship between tree size and fruit production. However, trees in the largest size class show decreased fruit production. In the study area, seeds of G. gummi-gatta are dispersed by two species of primates and endozoochorously by two species of civets. The average post dispersal seed predation was 86% at the end of 10 months. Seeds dispersed into sites far from parent trees showed significantly higher survival than seeds dispersed near adult trees. Seedlings in high density patches and near adult trees showed a higher probability of mortality than seedlings in low density patches and far from adult trees. The spatial distribution of G. gummi-gatta saplings and adult female trees shows that significantly fewer than expected saplings occur between 5 and 12m of an adult tree suggesting greater probability of seedling establishment with increasing distance from adult trees. \n\nSeedlings in canopy gaps showed significantly higher growth than seedlings in shade. Canopy cover however did not significantly affect seedling mortality. Larger trees whose crowns were in the canopy showed higher growth rates than smaller trees whose crowns were located below the canopy, suggesting that tree growth is influenced by light. I found no difference in G. gummi-gatta seedling density between high intensity and low intensity harvest sites suggesting that harvest of G. gummi-gatta fruits might have no affect on seedling recruitment.\n\nThe analysis of population growth using a stage structured matrix model showed that the rate of G. gummi-gatta population growth was stable over the two year study period. A simulation of the effects of seed removal on population growth rate resulted in l decreasing in small increments up to 90% seed removal, while greater than 90% seed removal resulted in a larger decrease in l. High rates of adult tree mortality were observed in open access areas due to damage during fruit harvest. Simulation of population growth rate using these estimates of adult tree mortality showed a large decrease in l. Population growth is more sensitive to adult tree mortality than fruit harvest. My results agree with other studies on rain forest tree species that have shown that population growth is not sensitive to seed removal. My findings suggest that due to stable fruit production, seed dispersal by animals, persistence of seedlings in shade, and adequate seedling recruitment under high fruit harvest, fruits of G. gummi-gatta might be harvested with few adverse demographic effects.\n\nOverall my study indicates that the ecological effects of fruit harvest are strongly influenced by the prevalent socio-economic conditions. The paradigm of \u2018good extractivism\u2019 that has fuelled much of the interest in NTFPs therefore needs to be re-evaluated in the light of increasing evidence that a complex interplay of factors, such as forest access, intra-community social dynamics, and fluctuating markets influence the ecology and use of NTFPs.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4605], "author_name_tesi": "Rai, Nitin Devdas", "last_name_ssi": "Rai", "middle_name_ssi": "Devdas", "first_name_ssi": "Nitin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Uhl", "Andrew George Stephenson", "James Harold Marden", "Stephen Michael Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Uhl, Committee Chair", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Member", "James Harold Marden, Committee Member", "Stephen Michael Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Garcinia gummi-gatta", "Western Ghats", "non-timber forest products", "dieocy", "fruiting ecology", "seedling establishment", "seed dispersal", "population matrix models"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MODELING OF HEAT TRANSFER AND FLUID FLOW IN KEYHOLE MODE WELDING\n\n\n", "id": "8949", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5352", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since deep penetration welds can be made with keyhole mode laser and electron beam welding, they are widely used for joining thick sheets of metals and alloys. The weld geometry and microstructure depend on the temperature distribution and the cooling rates. Experimental determination of temperatures in the work-piece through the use of thermocouples, can provide data for a limited number of points and is time consuming and expensive. Numerical modeling of heat transfer and fluid flow in high energy density laser and electron beam welding can provide previously unavailable information about the temperature distribution and thermal cycles at all points in the computational domain in a relatively short time and at low cost. A critical review of the available literature indicates the following problems with the numerical models of keyhole mode welding. (1) There is no comprehensive three dimensional model of keyhole mode electron beam welding (EBW) available in literature. (2) While comprehensive models of keyhole mode laser beam welding (LBW) have been proposed, none has been tested for the welding of various materials under different process conditions. (3) None of the existing models of keyhole mode laser or electron beam welding contains a structural component designed to provide good agreement between the computed and experimental results. (4) None of the existing models can work backwards, i.e. provide a set of welding process variables that will result in desired weld characteristics. The goal of this thesis is to address these important issues.\nIn this work, computationally efficient numerical models have been developed for linear keyhole mode LBW and EBW processes. The models combine an energy balance based model for keyhole geometry calculation with a well tested 3D heat transfer and fluid flow model. For LBW, keyhole wall temperatures are assumed to be equal to the boiling point of the alloy at 1 atm pressure. Keyhole wall temperatures in EBW are calculated from the equilibrium vapor pressure versus temperature relation for the work-piece material. The vapor pressure is, in turn, calculated from a force balance at the keyhole walls between the surface tension, vapor pressure and hydrostatic forces. A turbulence model is used to estimate the effective values of viscosity and thermal\niv\nconductivity to account for the enhanced heat and mass transport in the turbulent weld pool due to the fluctuating components of velocities in both LBW and EBW. The proposed model for LBW has been tested for materials with wide ranging thermo-physical properties under varying input powers and welding speeds covering both partial and full penetration welds. The tested materials include Al 5754 alloy, A131 steel, 304L stainless steel, Ti-6Al-4V, tantalum, and vanadium. These materials vary significantly in their thermo-physical properties, including boiling point, thermal conductivity, and specific heat. The EBW model was tested for 21Cr-6Ni-9Mn steel, 304L stainless steel, and Ti-6Al-4V for different input powers and power density distributions. To improve the agreement between the calculated and experimental results, a methodology is presented to estimate the values of uncertain input parameters like absorption coefficient and beam radius using a genetic algorithm with the numerical model and limited amount of experimental data. Finally, a genetic algorithm is used with the numerical model to prescribe welding conditions that would result in a desired weld attribute.\nThe computed weld cross-sectional geometries and thermal cycles agreed reasonably well with the experimental observations. The weld pool shapes depended on the convective heat transport within the weld pool. Convective heat transfer was more important for materials with low thermal diffusivity. The calculated solidification parameters showed that criterion for plane front stability was not satisfied for the alloys and the range of welding conditions considered in this work. Higher peak temperatures were found in the EBW of Ti-6Al-4V welds compared to similar locations in 21Cr-6Ni-9Mn stainless steel welds due to the higher boiling point and lower solid state thermal conductivity of the former. Non-dimensional analysis showed that convective heat transfer was very significant and Lorentz force was small compared to Marangoni force. Comparison of calculated weld geometries for electron beam and laser beam welds for similar process parameters showed that lower keyhole wall temperatures in EBW tend to make the welds deeper and narrower compared to laser beam welds. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the values of absorption coefficient and beam radius based on limited volume of experimental data for 5182 Al-Mg alloy welds. The weld geometry calculated using the optimized values of absorption coefficient and beam radius was in\nv\ngood agreement with experimental observations. The optimized values of absorption coefficient and beam radius were then used to prescribe sets of welding conditions to obtain specified weld geometry. These sets of welding conditions differed significantly but resulted in the same weld geometry.\nThe results show that a widely applicable and computationally efficient 3D model of heat transfer and fluid flow can be developed by combining an energy balance based keyhole calculation sub model with a 3D convective heat transfer model. The modeling results can improve the understanding of the keyhole mode welding process. The results also show that by combining numerical models with an optimizing algorithm, the model results can be made more reliable. Finally, systematic tailoring of weld attributes via multiple pathways, each representing alternative welding parameter sets, is possible based on scientific principles.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5347], "author_name_tesi": "Rai, Rohit ", "last_name_ssi": "Rai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rohit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tarasankar Debroy", "Tarasankar Debroy", "Ivica Smid", "Long Qing Chen", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Todd Palmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tarasankar Debroy, Dissertation Advisor", "Tarasankar Debroy, Committee Chair", "Ivica Smid, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Todd Palmer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["genetic algorithm", "numerical modeling", "keyhole mode welding", "electron beam", "laser"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Cerebrospinal Fluid and Brain Tissue Segmentation in Hydrocephalic Patients via Three Dimensional Level Set Method", "id": "19984", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8646", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Volume segmentation of medical image data shows great promise in assisting physicians with diagnosis and treatment.

Using a purposive sampling technique this study looked for identifiable markers that have the potential to engage learners in scientific practices and crosscutting concepts in middle school cyber charter schools in Pennsylvania. Markers for support from constructivist instructional design are identified and described. The framework for observing the virtual labs was formed from science practices and crosscutting concepts outlined in The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and design principles from constructivism. Crosscutting concepts are the foundational concepts that cut across science disciplines. The NGSS are based on the National Research Council\u2019s 2012 A Framework for K-12 Science Education. Core ideas are the third foundation of science and are not included in this dissertation as they have been studied in several other science labs (see Pyatt & Sims, 2011; Van Joolingen, De Jong, & Dimitrakopouluo, 2007). Scientific practices are espoused in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) as competencies that all students should experience to understand how science works. Constructivist support features will guide the identification of design features that could be present in the labs. \nSpecifically an ethnographic, directed content analysis was used to frame findings. The goal of content analysis \u201calways involves relating or comparing findings to some standard, norm, or theory\u201d (Carney, 1972, p. 5). This research used the NGSS as standards and the constructivist design supports as the practical application of constructivist learning theory. The directed nature of this content analysis allowed for emergent categories. Ethnographic content analysis (ECA) can be considered \u2018etic\u2019 because it is not aimed at \u201cunderstanding informants from their own perspective\u201d (Smith, Sells, & Clevenger, 1994, p. 2). An ECA forges a bridge between traditional content analysis and more ethnographic techniques. Berelson (1952) and Carney (1972) characterized traditional content analysis as quantitative and objective. An ECA approach focuses on the reflexivity of the research design while allowing for emergent data categories and narrative descriptions (Altheide, 1987). ECA differs from traditional content analysis because of the reflexive and highly interactive nature of the investigator, concepts, data collection, and analysis (Altheide, 1987, p. 68). Directed content analysis was selected because there is previous research and design principles for science labs, both virtual and traditional, but none of the extant literature found specifically looked at the labs being used in cyber charter schools or worked with K-12 students who were receiving their education primarily in an online environment. Interviews conducted with eight teachers from five cyber charter schools revealed that there is not a uniform laboratory experience for students and it does not always match the existing definitions for what a science lab is. Interviews with teachers revealed that there are a variety of innovative ways that teachers and schools have used to engage students with labs. The sample size of 20 virtual labs (4 from each of 5 cyber charter schools) was intended to provide an in-depth and targeted picture of the phenomena under study. Labs were selected based on a variety of factors. Preference was given to labs that the teacher used, that led to a wide range of core ideas selected, and that were from multiple software systems. \nA framework was created to serve as the preliminary guide of the relationships between and amongst the categories. This framework was built from the two foundations of the NGSS and design principles from constructivism. The framework is used as a starting point for the analysis of the content of the labs. In being consistent with directed content analysis, the constructs gained from previous research are used both to orient the current study and to extend the knowledge around an existing theory (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005).  \nThe results of this study identified a significant amount of variation in the science labs that students complete in cyber charter schools. Eight themes emerged from the teacher interviews that spoke to the range of expectations, support, and curricula in cyber charter schools. The themes are (1) the design of the labs; (2) teacher dedication and improvisation; (3) teacher availability to students; (4) communication practices; (5) parental expectations from the school; (6) challenges with the virtual labs; (7) willingness to allow revisions and give detailed feedback to students; and (8) teacher definitions of labs in the virtual setting. The science practices identified by the NGSS as central to the practice of science are all identified in at least one of the labs analyzed. However, as a whole the labs met some of the science practices more than others. 40% of the labs allowed students to ask research questions, 30% of the labs had prompts that allow engaging in argument from evidence, and 10% of the labs encouraged students to communicate and discuss the results of their labs. Many of the crosscutting concepts identified in the labs were implicit (34%) rather than explicit (19%). Therefore, the concept was not made clear during analysis of the labs. Quinn et al. (2012) stress the importance of making these concepts explicit to students. All of the labs had some constructivist design features/markers of constructivist learning environments. Markers that were particularly present in the labs were having some level of descriptive sequence for the students to follow in the lab (95%), controlling confounding variables for the students (80%) and giving the students some level of control/independence over the lab (75%). The constructivist design components lacking were communication features to promote communication between instructors and peers (10%), reflective and metacognitive scaffolds (25%), and having authentic activities (45%). The labs were particularly lacking in asking students for their prior knowledge (25%), acknowledging the complexity of empirical work for students (5%), or having students reflect on the empirical design (5%). Many of the labs had both ill (50%) and well-structured (70%) problems, experiments (40%) and observations (70%) all in the same lab. As a result of this research emergent categories related to the context of cyber charter schools such as engaging with parents, reducing navigation windows, and being \u2018text-lite\u2019 for students came from studying the labs. The knowledge gained from this study is that (a) more is known about the context in which students complete their virtual labs; (b) the structure and details of the virtual labs have been deeply described; and (c) emerging relationships between important features of a virtual lab from the student perspective are postulated. For cyber charter school students who do not have the option of face-to-face physical labs, the virtual labs should provide an equivalent educational experience. This research extends the conversation on whether virtual lab activities have the potential to provide this equivalent educational experience. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12292], "author_name_tesi": "Raish, Victoria Rose", "last_name_ssi": "Raish", "middle_name_ssi": "Rose", "first_name_ssi": "Victoria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Learning, Design, and Technology ", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alison Alene Carr Chellman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alison Alene Carr Chellman, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Virtual science labs", "online education", "cyber charter schools", "constructivism", "next generation science standards", "science practices", "crosscutting concepts", "simulations"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Correlation of Laboratory-Compacted and Field-Compacted Hot-Mixed Asphalt Permeability\n", "id": "10054", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "536", "abstract_tesi": "The uncertainty and diversity of measured permeability in field have motivated scholars to come up with methods to predict the coefficient of permeability.

First, the influences of unresolved turbulent fluctuations in composition and temperature (turbulence-chemistry interactions \u2013 TCI) on heat release, flame structure, and emissions are explored at four operating conditions in a conventional diesel engine. TCI are isolated and quantified by comparing results from the transported PDF model with those from a model that neglects the influence of fluctuations on local\nmean reaction rates (a well-stirred-reactor \u2013 WSR-model), with all other aspects of the modeling being the same (e.g., spray model, gas-phase chemical mechanism, and soot model). Computed pressure and heat-release traces, turbulent flame structure, and emissions from the WSR and PDF models show marked differences, with the PDF-model results being in closer agreement with experiment in most cases. While the peak cylinder pressure values predicted by the PDF model are within 3% of the measured data, those predicted by the WSR model differ up to 10.5% from experimental data. The soot results are especially striking. Computed soot levels from the PDF model are within a factor of five of the measured engine-out\nparticulate matter, and computed soot levels from the WSR and PDF models differ by up to several orders of magnitude, with the PDF-model results being in much closer agreement with experiment. These results highlight the importance of TCI in compression-ignition engines.

Several PRF chemical mechanisms are tested to model the combustion of two-component PRF mixtures, and none of them satisfactorily match the experimental data. Those mechanisms that have been primarily developed to study leaner combustion conditions predict a longer ignition delay compared to experiments.

Our notion of the 'story' is defined as the identification of people and the\nrecognition of their actions through the video. Videos are divided into segments, each containing\na separate shot. People are tracked through each shot based on appearance similarity and temporal\ncontinuity. As people in a shot are being tracked, appearance models are built for each of\nthem as person-specific classifiers, trained on-the-fly. Recurring people are then matched across shots by data association on confidence scores of the person-specific classifiers. This process is completely automated and requires only a single pass of the video. Next, the visual recognition of natural human actions performed by people in the sequence is undertaken.

COBRA-TF in its current form has a fixed power model (power vs. time table). With the addition of the new point kinetics model, one should expect more realistic results since it accounts for the thermal-hydraulic feedback. Along with the point kinetics model, two other associated models are developed and implemented into the code: the decay heat model, and the feedback model. In order to verify the validity and accuracy of the new model in COBRA-TF, the reactor analysis code TRACE is used for code-to-code verification. A sample test problem, which consists of a \u00bc core of a Pressurized Water Reactor being modeled as nine separate channels, is used to perform code-to-code verification using a 50 % loss of coolant flow transient. Based on this sample test problem, an input deck for COBRA-TF and an identical input model for TRACE are created. Steady state comparison results show consistent agreement between the two codes with respect to pressure, coolant density, coolant temperature, and liquid velocity. Transient results, which compare similar state parameter as well as reactor power and reactor multiplication factor, however, have shown some discrepancies especially for coolant density and channel temperature. TRACE predicts a flat temperature response whereas COBRA-TF predicts an increase in temperature. Reactor power and multiplication factor do show agreement between the two codes. Both COBRA-TF and TRACE predict a decline in reactor power. Similarly, both codes predict the reactor multiplication factor to have a downward slope from an initial value of one and it stays under one at the end of the transient.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1993], "author_name_tesi": "Raja, Faisal Z.", "last_name_ssi": "Raja", "middle_name_ssi": "Z.", "first_name_ssi": "Faisal", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Maria Nikolova Avramova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova, Thesis Advisor", "Maria Nikolova Avramova, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["COBRA-TF", "Point Kinetics", "TRACE"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION OF FUEL ROD GAS GAP CONDUCTANCE MODEL IN CTF AS A FUNCTION OF REACTOR POWER AND BURNUP", "id": "13509fzr100", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13509", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Having the ability to predict fuel temperatures for efficient multi-physics depletion and transient calculations with reasonable accuracy without the added burden of prohibitively expensive computation costs has been a major driving force in the nuclear industry. One of the parameters that has an immense impact on fuel surface and fuel centerline temperatures is the nuclear fuel gas gap conductance. This study addresses the issue of fuel rod gas gap conductance prediction by utilizing the subchannel thermal-hydraulics code CTF, which is a modified version of the legacy code COBRA-TF (Coolant Boiling in Rod Array \u2013 Two Fluid), to predict fuel rod temperatures with the help of a new gas gap conductance model that leverages the fuel performance code FRAPCON. Gas gap conductance data was pre-computed as a function of linear heat rate and fuel exposure and was integrated into CTF as part of the new model.  Using FRAPCON as a reference solution, the new FRAPCON-informed gap conductance model of CTF was found to be within 2 Kelvin of FRAPCON with respect to fuel surface temperature.  In addition to the inclusion of gas gap conductance model as a function of power and exposure, a comparative analysis was performed using CTF, and higher-fidelity fuel performance codes FRAPCON and BISON. The purpose of these analyses was to ascertain the predictive accuracy of the stand-alone fuel performance model in CTF, and then to use this model to integrate a FRAPCON-informed gas gap conductance model in CTF. For the comparative analysis, gap conductance and internal pin power distributions were provided by BISON and FRAPCON for CTF simulations. Excellent agreement was found between CTF and FRAPCON, and between CTF and BISON with respect to clad inside, fuel pellet surface, and fuel centerline temperatures when the gap conductance values were set by either FRAPCON or BISON.

The use of Bayesian methods of inference provides a natural framework to obtain solutions that are robust\nto various uncertainties in such processes as well as to assumptions made during the analysis. Specifically, the methods presented here aim to provide robust solutions to problems in process optimization, tolerance control and multiple criteria decision making.\n\nTraditional approaches for process optimization start by fitting a model and then optimizing the model to obtain optimal operating settings. These methods do not account for any uncertainty in the parameters of the model or in the form of the model. Bayesian approaches have been proposed recently to account for the uncertainty on the parameters of the model, assuming the model form is known. This dissertation presents a Bayesian predictive approach to process optimization that accounts for the uncertainty in the model form, also accounting for the ncertainty of the parameters given each  potential model. Both single response and multiple response systems are considered. The objective here is to optimize the model-averaged posterior predictive density (MAP) of the response where the weighted average is taken using the model posterior probabilities as weights. The MAP is thus used to maximize the posterior probability of obtaining the responses\nwithin given specification limits.\n\nThe Bayesian approach to model-robust process optimization is then extended to the case where noise factors and non-normal error terms are present. Traditionally, in process optimization, methods such as the Dual Response Surface methodology are used in the presence of noise factors, and methods such as Robust Regression\nare used when the error terms are not normally distributed. In this dissertation, the idea of model-robustness using the Bayesian posterior predictive density is extended to cases where there is uncertainty due to noise factors and due to non-normal error terms.\n\nThe tolerance control problem is the inverse of the process optimization problem. Here, the objective is to find the specification or tolerance limits on the responses. We propose a\nBayesian method to set tolerance or specification limits on one or more responses and obtain optimal values for a set of controllable factors. The dependence between the controllable factors and the responses is assumed to be captured by a regression model fit from experimental data, where the data is assumed to be available. The proposed method finds the optimal setting of the control factors\n(parameter design) and the corresponding specification limits for the responses (tolerance control) in order to achieve a desired\nposterior probability of conformance of the responses to their specifications.\n\nIn addition to process optimization and tolerance control, a new Bayesian method is presented for the multiple criteria decision\nmaking problem (MCDM). The usual approach to solving the MCDM problem is by either using a weighted objective function based on each individual objective or by optimizing one objective while setting constraints on the others. These approaches try to find a point on the efficient frontier or the Pareto optimal set based on the preferences of the decision maker. Here, a new algorithm is proposed to solve certain MCDM problems based on a Bayesian\nmethodology. At a first stage, it is assumed that there are process responses that are functions of certain controllable factors or regressors. At a second stage, the responses in turn influence the utility function of one or more decision makers. Both stages are modelled with Bayesian regression techniques. The\nmethodology is applied to engineering design problems, providing a rigorous formulation to popular ``Design for Six Sigma' approaches.\n\nAlthough the research focusses on applications in process optimization, tolerance control and MCDM, some of the results can be directly applied to other applications such as process control.

Several techniques have been utilized, over the years, to study\ncomplex systems. This dissertation proposes a Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF) methodology to analyze complex systems. Catastrophic\nfailures in complex engineering systems can often be prevented if faults/anomalies are detected at their incipient stage. Anomalies, which are defined as deviations from nominal behavior, can be associated with parametric changes in a system. Hence, detection and estimation of such parametric variations are critical in identifying faults.\n\nAccurate and computationally tractable modeling of complex system dynamics, solely based on fundamentals of physics, is often\ninfeasible. Hence, it might be necessary to learn the behavior of a system through times series data obtained from sensors. Symbolic\ndynamics provides a useful tool for time series analysis. Symbolic dynamics attempts to model a continuous time signal by a symbol sequence. Hence, the conversion of time series data to symbols is a crucial aspect of symbolic dynamics. In most symbolic time series analysis methods, time series data is directly converted to symbols.\nIn this dissertation, symbols are generated from wavelet coefficients of time series data. Systematic procedures for selection of wavelet basis and scales are discussed. The advantages\nof wavelet preprocessing with regard to noise mitigation and robustness are illustrated with numerical experiments. A new procedure for designing customized wavelets for near periodic\nsignals is also presented in this dissertation.\n\nThe subsequent step to wavelet preprocessing is conversion of wavelet coefficients to symbol sequences. Systematic procedures for\nselecting number of symbols (alphabet size), partitioning scheme to generate symbols and modeling of symbol sequences with finite state\nautomata are presented. The partitioning scheme along with the finite state machine model is referred as the Symbolic Dynamic\nFilter. A salient feature is that entropy is used as the quantity to determine all features of the Symbolic Dynamic Filter. A Maximum\nEntropy  based partitioning technique is introduced. This partitioning technique seeks to create partitions based on information content in the data. Symbols are modeled by a special\nclass of finite state automata called D-Markov machines. Depth of a D-Markov machine is chosen based on entropy rate. An algorithm for\noptimizing the structure of D-Markov Machine is also presented.\n\nTwo applications of symbolic dynamic filtering are reported in this dissertation.

Many of the metalloenzymes that harbor transition metals activate dioxygen to catalyze a diverse array of oxidation reactions to functionalize unreactive sites in biomolecules. These enzymatic transformations are often inaccessible to synthetic chemists, and consequently, understanding the naturally-evolved mechanisms by which these enzymes enact such challenging reactions will enable the development of new biocatalysts for industrial and therapeutic applications. One common strategy employed in Nature is the coupling of two transition metals, typically iron, to carry out oxidation and oxygenation reactions. Decades of research on this class of non-heme diiron enzymes has focused on three founding members, which has revealed unifying mechanistic features that enable them to enact one- and two-electron oxidation reactions. Chapter 1 summarizes the principles for dioxygen activation employing this bioinorganic scaffold that emerged from this foundational work. Chapter 1 also introduces more recent discoveries of novel non-heme diiron enzymes, facilitated by advancements in genome sequencing and bioinformatics, that have expanded the scope of chemical transformations and mechanistic strategies possible within this extensive metalloenzyme class. My dissertation research focused on three of these newly discovered diiron enzymes that invoke alternative mechanistic strategies to carry out non-canonical transformations. Chapter 2 covers the hydrocarbon-producing cyanobacterial diiron enzyme, ADO, which catalyzes a C-C bond cleavage reaction to effectively remove the chemical functional group from its fatty aldehyde substrate, producing linear hydrocarbons. My work demonstrates that ADO operates by a free-radical mechanism to enact this redox-neutral transformation, and that a cyanobacterial ferredoxin (PetF)/ferredoxin reductase/NADPH reducing system can act as an efficient reducing partner, a requisite for ADO catalysis. These mechanistic studies enabled the identification of inherent vulnerabilities that limit enzymatic efficacy, thereby highlighting direct targets for bioengineering and optimization of biofuel processes deploying this catalyst. Chapter 3 describes a project designed to biochemically characterize a diiron enzyme belonging to a new functional class. This work culminated in the discovery of a novel microbial phosphonate degradation pathway, consisting of two iron-dependent oxygenases with previously misannotated functional assignments. Finally, Chapter 4 describes progress on studies of another potential biofuel catalyst, an iron-dependent enzyme, UndA. This work provides evidence that UndA employs a diiron cofactor to convert fatty acids into terminal alkenes. This finding corrects its original cofactor assignment, rationalizes its ability to perform this transformation, and suggests a feasible catalytic mechanism.

As a result, supply voltage scaling to reduce the power dissipation in the chip comes at the penalty of increased static power dissipation.

Two possible approaches to solve the supply voltage scaling issue are: (1) Transport enhancement through high mobility material systems. (2) Threshold voltage scaling through steep switching devices. Tunneling field effect transistors (TFET) based on inter band tunneling of carriers are a promising candidate to realize steep switching slope and thus enable supply voltage scaling. In particular, tunneling transistors within the III-V compound semiconductor system are of interest since the tunneling efficiency is high due to the direct bandgap and lower effective mass of tunneling carriers. Further, wide range of compositionally tunable tunneling barrier height is possible within the III-V material system. \nThis dissertation focusses on experimental investigation of III-V n-channel and p-channel TFET targeting low power logic as well as RF applications.

This work examines the propagation of gravity waves on water of variable depth, with and without viscous dissipation. With a combination of stability, asymptotic and numerical analyses, we study the variable-depth Stokes wavetrain, waves with periodic cnoidal envelopes, and a soliton wave, as they propagate from shallower water to deeper water, and vice versa. We find that both bathymetry and viscous dissipation stabilize the Benjamin-Feir instability of a variable-depth Stokes wavetrain when the wavetrain propagates into shallower water. When waves propagate into deeper water, the effect due to bathymetry is reversed and tends to destabilize the waves. In both cases, however, viscous dissipation eventually causes stabilization, except for a special case in which the growth due to bathymetry and decay due to viscous dissipation balance. In that case, the dynamics are governed by the inviscid uniform-depth nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation, and the Stokes wavetrain solution is unstable. Our numerical results on the stability of the soliton solution and the instability of the cnoidal solutions of the inviscid MNLS are consistent with analytical results in literature. Mathematical analysis and numerical results on cnoidal waves also reveal that the asymptotic solutions can reasonably predict the evolution of the waves for oceanic scales, where the wavelength of the wave is much smaller than the characteristic scale for the depth variation, but fails to do the same for laboratory scales, where the wavelength is not as small compared to the length scale representing the depth variation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7278], "author_name_tesi": "Rajan, Girish Kumar ", "last_name_ssi": "Rajan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Girish Kumar", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Diane Marie Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Diane Marie Henderson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Modified NLS Equation", "Variable Depth", "Viscous Dissipation", "Stability", "Asymptotic Analysis", "Numerical Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Two New, Comprehensive Models of Dissipation Rates for Capillary-Gravity Waves, with an Emphasis on Ocean Swell", "id": "25718", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10564", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Linear dissipation rates of capillary-gravity waves in both laboratory and ocean settings are investigated in this dissertation. Two new models are formulated to include the effects of an upper fluid and interfacial conditions. The first is a two-fluid surfactant model in which the surfactant-adsorbed interface is treated as a contaminated monolayer. The second is a three-fluid model in which two semi-infinite fluids are separated by a thin layer of Newtonian fluid such that there are two distinct interfaces, which are treated as contaminated monolayers. In principle, the three-fluid model is the most general of all models available in literature. In the three-fluid model, dissipation rates are derived for wave propagation in both the barotropic mode, in which the displacements of the two interfaces are in phase with each other; and the baroclinic mode, in which the interfacial displacements are out of phase.\n\nWithin the framework of the two-fluid surfactant model, a dispersion relation is derived for the elastic waves at the contaminated interface, and used in a mathematical analysis to show that the dissipation rates of the gravity waves are maximized when the gravity waves are in resonance with the elastic waves. \n\nNumerical parametric studies are conducted to analyze gravity waves in an air-oil-water system using the barotropic three-fluid model. The results of the parametric studies are used to classify the gravity waves in the system into three frequency regimes based on the mechanism that dominates the energy transfer. For waves of frequencies less than about 0.1 Hz, the dominant mechanism is the loss of energy to air. For waves of intermediate frequencies about 1 Hz, the dominant mechanism is the loss of energy to the thin layer of oil separating the air and water. For waves of higher frequencies (about 3 Hz) near the limit of gravity waves, the dominant mechanism is the loss of energy to the elastic waves at the contaminated interfaces. The barotropic three-fluid model is also investigated experimentally for standing water waves of frequencies 1 Hz, 1.6 Hz, and 2 Hz, where varying amounts of oil are deposited on the water surface.\n\nThe emphasis in this dissertation is to understand dissipation of ocean swell; however, the models have been developed for general fluid systems and may thus be used to obtain the dissipation rates of capillary-gravity waves propagating in a system comprising fluids of arbitrary densities and viscosities.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10205], "author_name_tesi": "Rajan, Girish Kumar ", "last_name_ssi": "Rajan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Girish Kumar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Diane Marie Henderson", "John Michael Cimbala", "Diane Marie Henderson", "James Joseph Brannick", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Laura Pauley", "Karen Ann Thole", "Harvey Segur"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Diane Marie Henderson, Dissertation Advisor", "John Michael Cimbala, Committee Chair", "Diane Marie Henderson, Committee Chair", "James Joseph Brannick, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Laura Pauley, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member", "Harvey Segur, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dissipation/Decay", "Capillary-Gravity", "Surfactant", "Marangoni/Elastic Waves", "Resonance", "Barotropic/Baroclinic Modes", "Ocean Swell"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "LOSS MECHANISMS IN PIEZOELECTRIC PZT CERAMICS AND SINGLE CRYSTALS\n", "id": "8809", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "293", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis aims to clarify the loss mechanisms in piezoelectric ceramics and single crystals in the view of the recent developments in high power piezoelectric devices such as piezoelectric actuators, ultrasonic motors and piezoelectric transformers in commercial applications.  In these devices the piezoelectric materials are driven under high voltages and currents.  At high power conditions, the materials deviate from their linear constitutive equations due to non-linearity and hysteresis in physical parameters.  The non-linearity and hysteresis manifests in terms of loss and consequently, heat generation in piezoelectric materials.  Therefore, analysis of the fundamental principles of loss mechanisms is essential in the determination of heat generation.  The loss in piezoelectric materials is directly related to the mechanical quality factor which is defined as the inverse of the loss tangent factor.  The quality factor is experimentally calculated following IEEE standards using the impedance curves, Qm as well as near resonance and anti-resonance frequencies and defined as QA and QB.  The low power measurement setup in terms of sample holders is reexamined in order to obtain reproducible results.  Loss in the 33- and 31- vibration modes is clarified for \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 piezoelectric PZT ceramics.  Further loss anisotropy in PMN-PT based single crystals as a function of crystal orientation dependence, vibration mode and doping is investigated.  Losses associated with resonance and anti-resonance modes are discussed in the above materials.  Significant difference (20-40%) between Q values at resonance (QA) and anti-resonance (QB) with Q being higher for anti-resonance mode.  This result is verified analytically and dependence of the quality factor on k31 (electromechanical coupling coefficient), tan&#948;\u2019 (dielectric loss), tan&#981;\u2019(mechanical loss) and tan&#952;\u2019 (piezoelectric loss) is observed.  Quality factors (QA and QB) are also calculated at high power near resonance and anti-resonance while maintaining the vibration velocity constant in order to observe the difference at \u2018in-service\u2019 conditions.  At high power the quality factors drop by almost half as compared to the low power characterization while maintaining the difference in QA and QB seen at low power.  Based on these results it is recommended to drive piezoelectric devices at anti-resonance mode in order to get better efficiency.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [290], "author_name_tesi": "Rajapurkar, Aditya Mohan", "last_name_ssi": "Rajapurkar", "middle_name_ssi": "Mohan", "first_name_ssi": "Aditya", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino", "Leslie Eric Cross"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino, Thesis Advisor", "Leslie Eric Cross, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["mechanical quality factor", "loss mechanisms", "piezoelectric", "ceramics", "single crystals"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "The Repertoire of Na,K-ATPase Subunit Isoforms in Zebrafish: From Gene to Morphant\n\n", "id": "6068", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5632", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-03-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nNa,K-ATPase is the membrane embedded protein that generates the transmembrane sodium and potassium gradients that are necessary to maintain cellular homeostasis. These gradients underlie electrical excitability in nerve and muscle, as well as the transport of numerous solutes and water across epithelia.  To carry out these functions, the enzyme hydrolyzes ATP, enabling it to transport Na+ and K+ against their concentration gradients.  The active enzyme consists of a catalytic a subunit and a b subunit of unspecified function.  In mammalian species, four separate a and three distinct b subunits have been identified.  In vitro experiments indicate that association of a and b subunits is promiscuous, raising the possibility that as many as twelve distinct Na,K-ATPase isoenzymes may be formed.  Comparison of the biochemical properties between alternate a/b subunit combinations has revealed only subtle functional differences between isoenzymes.  Efforts to unravel the functional properties of different Na,K-ATPase a and b subunits have been limited by the inability to purify the isoenzymes from natural sources.  Also, it has proven difficult to reconcile which a/b subunit pairs actually associate in vivo within a particular cell or tissue type.  This has made it difficult to correlate enzyme function with a specific a/b subunit combination.  Therefore, a fundamental unresolved issue concerning Na,K-ATPase is whether the different isoenzymes are redundant or whether each subserves a unique function.\n\nTo better understand the function of distinct sodium pump isoenzymes, studies were designed to characterize Na,K-ATPase genes expressed in the zebrafish, Danio rerio.  Zebrafish is an excellent model system for studying vertebrate development and gene function.  The ability to perform high-throughput analysis of gene expression and the capacity to analyze gene function via morpholino-based gene knockdown technology make zebrafish an attractive system in which to dissect functional differences amongst members of a multigene family.  Searches of the GenBank database of expressed sequence tags revealed several cDNA clones with sequence homology to mammalian Na,K-ATPase genes.  Molecular cloning revealed a cohort of fifteen distinct Na,K-ATPase subunit genes in zebrafish.  Of this cohort, nine cDNAs encode a subunits and six encode b subunits.  Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis indicate that among the nine a subunit genes identified, six belong to the a1-like subfamily, one is an ortholog of the a2 gene, and two appear to be a3 subfamily members.  Also, two zebrafish homologs were identified for each of the mammalian b1, b2 and b3 isoform genes.  Using zebrafish radiation hybrid and meiotic mapping panels, linkage assignments for each a and b subunit gene were determined.  Na,K-ATPase genes are dispersed in the zebrafish genome with the exception of four of the a1-like genes, which are tightly clustered on linkage group 1.  Comparative mapping studies indicate that most of the zebrafish Na,K-ATPase genes localize to regions of conserved synteny \n(conservation of gene order over wide evolutionary distances) between zebrafish and humans.\n\nThe expression pattern of Na,K-ATPase a and b subunit genes during zebrafish embryogenesis was analyzed using in situ hybridization.  The most striking finding is that each of the fourteen Na,K-ATPase genes exhibits a distinct expression profile.  All a and b subunit genes are expressed in the nervous system, although the pattern of expression in different regions varies dramatically.  In peripheral tissues, three of a1-like genes are expressed in pronephros and mucous cells, one is expressed in heart, and one is predominant in skeletal muscle.  The a2 gene is expressed in brain and heart but is most prominent in skeletal muscle, while the two a3 genes are restricted in their expression to the nervous system.  Of the six b subunit genes, b1a is expressed at highest abundance in lens, pronephros, and heart, while b1b transcripts are abundant in mucous cells.  The two b2-like genes are differentially expressed in nervous system.  One b3 gene is expressed exclusively in brain while the other is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle.  Based on expression patterns, at least fourteen a/b subunit pairs are likely to be formed in various tissues.  This high degree of isoenzyme diversity is consistent with the idea that many of the isoenzymes are likely to possess distinct functional properties.\n\nIn order to test this hypothesis, expression of Na,K-ATPase b1a ( atp1b1a) and b1b (atp1b1b) in zebrafish embryos was reduced using anti-sense morpholine oligonucleotides (morpholinos).  Morphants (morpholino injected embryos) bearing reduced levels of atp1b1a showed defects in cardiac morphogenesis and function while atp1b1b morphants were deficient in neural development.  The atp1b1b morphant displayed overall neural degeneration at all injected levels of morpholino (1.5ng \u2013 12ng).  At higher doses, fused somites and stunted growth was observed.  In contrast, atp1b1a morphants exhibited dose dependent severity of phenotype.  At low doses, there was cardiac hypertrophy accompanied with pericardial edema.  However, at high doses of injected morpholino, specific degeneration of ventricle occurred along with atrial hypertrophy.  In some cases, there was a conduction defect, such that ventricular beats lagged behind the sinus rhythm. \n\nThese data provide the first evidence for functional differences between Na,K-ATPase b subunit isoforms.  The difference in morphant phenotype suggests that atp1b1a plays an integral role in fashioning the zebrafish heart while atp1b1b expression is critical for neural development.  Coupled to mRNA co-injection, these morphants provide an in vivo assay for examining whether the function of either atp1b1a or atp1b1b can be substituted by another b subunit.  The paradigm used to detect functional differences between isoforms can also be universally applied to the study of any gene family whose zebrafish orthologs are identified.  The inhibition of gene expression using antisense-morpholino and the study of the resulting morphant phenotype is a very powerful  method of reverse genetics.  This experiments contained in this thesis set the precedent for the use of zebrafish genetics to answer the fundamental questions regarding isoform heterogeneity in Na,K-ATPase subunit isoforms. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5622, 5623, 5624, 5625, 5626, 5627, 5628, 5629], "author_name_tesi": "Rajarao, Somana Johannes Ravindra", "last_name_ssi": "Rajarao", "middle_name_ssi": "Ravindra", "first_name_ssi": "Somana Johannes", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson", "Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Victor Alan Canfield", "Keith C Cheng", "Elliot Saul Vesell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson, Committee Chair", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member", "Victor Alan Canfield, Committee Member", "Keith C Cheng, Committee Member", "Elliot Saul Vesell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ATPase", "sodium pump", "isoform", "zebrafish", "morpholino"]}]
