Drugs of abuse hijack the innate reward system and reorient it towards drug-seeking and drug-taking to the detriment of behaviors involving the seeking of standard natural rewards. In the animal model of reward devaluation, rats avoid intake of an otherwise palatable saccharin solution when it predicts the availability of a drug of abuse (e.g., morphine, cocaine or heroin). Greater avoidance predicts greater drug-seeking and taking. That being said, it is not immediately clear why rats avoid the saccharin cue. One hypothesis is that the taste cue simply become aversive as a result of its association with drug. If so, the neurochemical response elicited in the nucleus accumbens by the drug-paired cue should parallel that obtained following intraoral delivery of a known aversive stimulus such as quinine (QHCl). Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to determine the neurochemical profile for rewarding (i.e., sucrose and saccharin) and aversive (i.e., quinine) stimuli and to compare those profiles with those obtained for a saccharin cue that was paired with the opportunity to self-administer heroin or cocaine. To this end, Chapter 2 collected samples from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) using microdialysis and analyzed those samples with a new method of ultra performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) that allows for the measurement of several neurochemicals from a single sample. The collection will occur while the animals consume, or are intraorally infused with, a sucrose or a quinine solution. The results of this experiment revealed different profiles for a rewarding and an aversive taste stimulus. Chapter 3 studied the neurochemical response in the NAc to a saccharin cue that was paired with the opportunity to self-administer a drug of abuse (i.e., heroin, cocaine). Following a series of such taste-drug pairings, microdialysis samples were collected while the animals received intraoral infusions of the drug-paired cue. Samples were analyzed using the same method as described in Chapter 2. The results showed changes in dopamine and other neurochemicals such as histamine, serine, glutamate, GABA and serotonin when rats were exposed to a drug-associated taste cue, particularly following an extended abstinence period. These patterns were similar to those found in response to quinine. Taken together, these data suggest the existence of a different neurochemical profile for a putatively rewarding and a putatively aversive taste stimulus and that a drug-paired cue shows changes similar to those observed in an aversive-like profile, particularly when tested following an extended period of abstinence. The drug-paired taste cue, then, may become aversive following abstinence and/or the cue may elicit the onset of an aversive withdrawal state.

The suppression of the confraternity in 1785 led to the partial destruction of its oratory and the dispersal of its works of art. Archival documents presented in this dissertation allowed for a reconstruction of the lost portions of the oratory and its missing decoration.\n\nAt the end of the Cinquecento the Scalzo had at their disposal a large and well decorated suite of rooms\u2014including the cloister, two chapels, a sacristy, a changing room and several auxiliary service areas. These rooms were lined with choir stalls and decorated with works of art that ranged from an altarpiece by Lorenzo di Credi to a sculptural program of terracotta apostles installed in niches in the company\u2019s main chapel.\n\nMany of the Scalzo\u2019s members came from Florence\u2019s artisanal class and included shoemakers, blacksmiths, painters, wallers, sculptors, goldbeaters, bakers, and others. The confraternity frequently hired these men to perform necessary jobs, from painting the company\u2019s emblem on robes and processional candles to monitoring the state of repair of the oratory\u2019s roof. Often the confraternity and one of its members agreed to exchange these services for an exemption from the organization\u2019s customary fees and fines. The Scalzo\u2019s voting records reveal that the confraternity procured several of the statues in its main chapel in exactly this manner. In other cases, a group of brothers acting as an anonymous collective underwrote the cost of the sculpture.\n\nThe Scalzo used collaborative strategies\u2014familiar to the organization from its charitable missions\u2014in order to decorate its oratory. By acting as a collective, the shopkeepers and craftsmen who constituted the Scalzo\u2019s membership were able to cast themselves in the role of art patrons. Moreover, by relying on their own members to outfit the oratory, the brothers strengthened the ritual bonds that knit the confraternity together. The apostles thus served not only as collegial exemplars for the confratelli to emulate, but also provided members and guests with concrete evidence of what the men of the Scalzo could achieve when they acted together as one corporate body.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1501], "author_name_tesi": "Dow, Douglas N.", "last_name_ssi": "Dow", "middle_name_ssi": "N.", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian A Curran", "Charlotte Marie Houghton", "Craig Robert Zabel", "Anthony Cutler", "Marica Susan Tacconi", "Sheryl E Reiss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian A Curran, Committee Chair", "Charlotte Marie Houghton, Committee Member", "Craig Robert Zabel, Committee Member", "Anthony Cutler, Committee Member", "Marica Susan Tacconi, Committee Member", "Sheryl E Reiss, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["confraternities", "architecture", "art patronage", "sculpture", "Italian Renaissance and Baroque Art"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THE ROLE OF PHOSPHOLIPASE C IN POLLEN TUBE GROWTH\n", "id": "7323", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4877", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Upon germination on a stigmatic surface, a pollen grain produces a tip-growing pollen tube that must grow down the style, locate the ovary and deliver the sperm to effect fertilization. Thus, pollen tube elongation represents regulated tip growth required for fertility. Tip growth is known to be driven by exocytosis localized to the growing apex, and one element thought to direct this secretory activity is a tip-focused Ca2+ gradient. Only a few regulators of tip growth have been identified in pollen tubes, e.g., the Rop family of G-proteins and their interacting proteins. Despite the role played by the pollen tube in plant reproduction, regulators that direct pollen tube growth and/or modulate the tip-focused Ca2+ gradient are not well characterized. \nMembrane lipid turnover is a regulatory theme in eukaryotic cells. For instance, the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase Cs (PI-PLCs) process the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) to produce diacyl glycerol, an activator of protein kinase C, and the Ca2+mobilizing agent, inositol trisphosphate (InsP3). In pollen tubes, it has been proposed that PtdInsP2 compartmentalization mediated by PI-PLC is critical for the control of pollen tube elongation. Similarly, InsP3 has been proposed as a regulator of this process, as application of InsP3 has been shown to alter pollen tube growth. However, in all cases the molecular identity of the PLC(s) involved remains undetermined. \nThe major goal of this thesis research is thus to isolate cDNA for a pollen-expressed PI-PLC of Petunia inflata that is involved in regulating pollen tube growth. A gene, named PetPLC1, was identified, and recombinant PetPLC1 produced in E. coli was found to have Ca2+-dependent PI-PLC activity expected of a membrane-bound PI-PLC. Expressing a catalytically inactive form of PetPLC1, named PetPLC1-H126A, in pollen tubes caused expansion of the apical Ca2+ gradient, disrupted the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, and delocalized growth at the tube tip. These effects were phenocopied by expressing the C2 domain of PetPLC1 alone in pollen tubes. Moreover, these phenotypes were suppressed by depolymerizing actin with low concentrations of Latrunculin B, suggesting that a critical site of action of PetPLC1 is in regulating actin structure at the growing tip. A GFP fusion of PetPLC1 expressed in pollen tubes were found to cycle on and off the apical plasma membrane in growing pollen tubes from a pool of vesicles that co-localized with the membrane dye, FM4-64. It is likely that PetPLC1 uses these vesicles as a way of locating to/from the apical membrane. A GFP fusion of PetPLC1-H126A, also localized to the apical plasma membrane until apical expansion of the pollen tube tip occurred. A GFP fusion to the PH (PtdInsP2)-binding domain of mammalian PLC?1 showed enrichment in apical regions depleted in PLC. Thus, PetPLC1 appears to be involved in the machinery that restricts growth to the very apex of the elongating pollen tube, likely through its regulatory action on PtdInsP2 distribution within the cell. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4854], "author_name_tesi": "Dowd, Peter Eric", "last_name_ssi": "Dowd", "middle_name_ssi": "Eric", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Teh Hui Kao", "David Scott Gilmour", "B Tracy Nixon", "Randen L Patterson", "Simon Gilroy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Teh Hui Kao, Committee Chair", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Randen L Patterson, Committee Member", "Simon Gilroy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["GFP", "phospholipase C", "pollen tube growth", "pollen", "tip growth"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "AUTOPHAGY AND CANCER: THE ROLE OF AUTOPHAGY IN THE HYPOXIC TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT AND TRANSLATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF TARGETING ULK1 IN NEUROBLASTOMA", "id": "15141cmd394", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15141", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A solid cancerous tumor is a complex mixture of many different cell types, varying compositions of extracellular matrix, and fluctuating degrees of oxygen and nutrient availability. This heterogeneity generates distinct stress-inducing tumor microenvironments (TME) that add selective pressure on cancer cells, selecting aggressive cancer cells that have an advantage of survival or metastatic potential. To survive stressful TMEs, cancer cells utilize an evolutionary conserved intracellular degradation and recycling mechanism, called autophagy (from the Greek for \u201cself-eating\u201d). Autophagy uses double membraned vesicles, called autophagosomes, to engulf cytoplasmic cargo for delivery to the lysosome for degradation. In general, autophagy is thought to promote cancer cell survival by facilitating the degradation of various cytoplasmic components and recycling of essential nutrients in starvation conditions, making it an attractive therapeutic strategy for treating cancers. However, the precise role of autophagy within the TME is controversial, as it exhibits both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing phenotypes, making it difficult to conclude whether autophagy is a viable target for cancer therapy. In particular, this paradox is most evident in regards to the role of autophagy in regulating cancer metastasis, as reports conflict as to whether autophagy is truly a metastasis-suppressing or -promoting pathway. \n\nEmerging research indicates that the influence of autophagy on cancer progression is dependent on several factors, including cancer cell type and the TME. Thus, more physiologically relevant assessments which incorporate TME-associated stress and cell-to-cell interactions are needed to better understand the role of autophagy in tumor progression. Accordingly, the primary focus of this doctoral dissertation involves elucidating the role of autophagy in tumor progression in the context of hypoxia (i.e. low oxygen conditions), a hallmark of the TME. \n\nIn chapter 2, we explored the impact of autophagy on the pathophysiology of breast cancer cells, using a novel hypoxia-dependent, reversible dominant negative strategy to regulate autophagy at the cellular level within the TME. Suppression of autophagy via hypoxia-induced expression of the kinase-dead dominant-negative mutant of ULK1 (dnULK1K49R) increased lung metastases in MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse models. Consistent with this effect, expressing a dominant-negative mutant of ULK1 or ATG4b or a ULK1-targeting shRNA facilitated cell migration in vitro. Functional proteomic and transcriptome analysis revealed that loss of hypoxia-regulated autophagy promotes metastasis via induction of the fibronectin integrin signaling axis. In agreement, loss of ULK1 function increased fibronectin deposition in the hypoxic TME. Additionally, we report that low expression of autophagy genes predicts a worse prognosis in human breast cancer. Together, our results indicated that hypoxia-regulated autophagy suppresses metastasis in breast cancer by preventing tumor fibrosis. These results also suggest caution in the development of autophagy-based strategies for cancer treatment. \n\nIn addition to this, a secondary focus of this dissertation involved examining the translational implications of targeting autophagy for therapeutic benefit in neuroblastoma, a cancer of immature nerve cells that predominantly effects children under five years old.  In chapter 3, we demonstrate that targeted inhibition of an essential autophagy kinase, ULK1, with a recently developed small molecular inhibitor of ULK1, SBI-0206965, significantly reduces cell growth and promotes apoptosis in SK-N-AS, SH-SY5Y, and SK-N-DZ neuroblastoma cell lines. Furthermore, inhibition of ULK1 by a dominant-negative mutant of ULK1 (dnULK1K49R) significantly reduced growth and metastatic disease and prolonged survival of mice bearing SK-N-AS xenograft tumors. We also show that SBI-0206965 sensitized SK-N-AS cells to TRAIL treatment, but not mTOR inhibitors (INK128, Torin1) or topoisomerase inhibitors (doxorubicin, topotecan). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that ULK1 is a viable drug target and inhibitors of ULK1 may provide a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of neuroblastoma.  Furthermore, this work demonstrates the antitumor effects of targeting an essential autophagy gene in neuroblastoma mouse models.\n\nIn summation, this dissertation has elucidated that hypoxia-regulated autophagy acts to suppress metastasis in breast cancer, and demonstrated that ULK1 kinase is a viable drug target for the treatment of neuroblastoma. Collectively, this work has further defined the complex role of autophagy in tumor biology, as well as provided pre-clinical data that may aid in the development of novel treatment options for cancer patients. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16463], "author_name_tesi": "Dower, Christopher Micheal", "last_name_ssi": "Dower", "middle_name_ssi": "Micheal", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong-Gang Wang", "Hong-Gang Wang", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby", "Scot R Kimball", "Charles H Lang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong-Gang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Hong-Gang Wang, Committee Chair", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby, Committee Member", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Autophagy", "Cancer Metastasis", "Hypoxia", "Tumor Microenviroment", "Neuroblastoma", "ULK1"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Differentiating Dark Triad Traits Within and Across Interpersonal Circumplex Surfaces", "id": "26212", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11642", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Interpersonal theory provides an explicit and conceptually driven framework for integrating information from a number of disciplines.

This study uses the Dark Triad of personality traits to explore potential applications of this methodology. Confidence intervals were used to examine the construct validity of the SD3 scales and 4 measures of psychopathy. Evidence for the discriminant validity of the SD3 scales and convergent validity of the psychopathy scales is discussed. Additionally confidence intervals were used to examine group differences in structural summary parameters, finding that despite mean level differences in Dark Triad traits, the associated structural summary parameters were similar for men and women.

The replacement of Si devices with SiC components could lead to a reduction in device size, weight, complexity, and cooling requirements along with an increase in device efficiency.  One area of concern under high temperature or high current operation is the stability of the ohmic contacts.  Ohmic contact degradation can cause an increase in parasitic resistance, which can diminish device performance.  While contact studies have primarily focused on the high temperature stability of ohmic contacts to SiC, different failure mechanisms may arise under high current density stressing due to the influence of electromigration.  In addition, preferential degradation may occur at the anode or cathode due to the directionality of current flow, known as a polarity effect.\n\tThe failure mechanisms of ohmic contacts to p type SiC under high current density stressing are explored.  Complementary materials characterization techniques were used to analyze contact degradation, particularly the use of cross sections prepared by focused ion beam for imaging using field emission scanning electron microscopy and elemental analysis using Auger electron spectroscopy.  Initially the degradation of commonly studied Ni and Al based contacts was investigated under continuous DC current.  The contact metallization included a bond pad consisting of a TiW diffusion barrier and thick Au overlayer.  The Ni contacts were found to degrade due to the growth of voids within the ohmic contact layer, which were initially produced during the high temperature Ni/SiC ohmic contact anneal.  The Al based contacts degraded due to the movement of Al from the ohmic contact layer to the surface of the Au bond pad, and the movement of Au into the ohmic contact layer from the bond pad.  The inequality of Al and Au fluxes generated voiding within the ohmic contact layer causing a large increase in contact resistance.\n\tA bottom to top approach was used to develop a more robust contact structure based on the failure mechanisms of the Ni and Al based contacts.  Contacts utilizing a Pd layer contacting the SiC were found to provide a lower specific contact resistance (&#961;c) and improved stability under current stressing.  A Pd/Ti contact was introduced that when annealed under a N2 atmosphere produced a robust TiN layer at the surface of the contact.  The &#961;c of the Pd/Ti contact was (4.7\u00b11.7)x10-6 &#937; cm2, compared to the Ni and Al based contacts, all of which had a &#961;c of greater than 10-5 &#937; cm2.  The Pd/Ti contacts were able to withstand higher currents than the Ni or Al based contacts under continuous DC current stressing.  The degradation mechanism of the Pd/Ti contacts depended on whether the current was pulsed or continuous.  Under continuous DC stressing, Au from the bond pad diffused through the TiW barrier and into the ohmic contact region leading to severe intermixing and voiding.  Under pulsed DC stressing, voiding at the Au/TiW interface occurred caused by the electromigration of Au.  The different degradation mechanisms were related to the temperature during stressing, as the temperature of the continuous DC stressed contacts exceeded 649 &#730;C at failure, while the peak temperature of the pulsed DC contacts was between 316 &#730;C and 371 &#730;C, using 5 \u00b5s pulses and a 10% duty cycle.\n\tFinally, the lowest &#961;c, (1.4\u00b10.6)x10-6 &#937; cm2, was attained with a Pd/Ti/Pt contact, which also possessed a very smooth surface morphology, especially compared to the conventional Ti/Al contact.  The Pd/Ti/Pt contacts were also shown to be more stable under continuous DC lateral current stressing than the Ti/Al contacts.  A polarity effect on temperature was observed during stressing with the temperature of the cathode being higher than the anode, likely due to carrier recombination at the cathode for the p type material.  The increased temperature caused preferential degradation of the cathode of both the Pd/Ti/Pt and Ti/Al contacts.  Under continuous DC stressing, degradation of the Pd/Ti/Pt contacts was characterized by voiding and intermixing at the leading edge of the cathode.  The temperature of the Pd/Ti/Pt contacts during stressing was reduced under pulsed DC current, and voiding was observed between the Au bond pad and the ohmic contact.  Mechanical stresses and thermal cycling were suspected to have produced the voiding under pulsed DC stressing.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [752], "author_name_tesi": "Downey, Brian P", "last_name_ssi": "Downey", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Douglas Edward Wolfe", "Patrick M Lenahan", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney, Dissertation Advisor", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Chair", "Douglas Edward Wolfe, Committee Member", "Patrick M Lenahan, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["high current", "electromigration", "Pd", "contact", "ohmic", "SiC", "stability"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "How can Wii learn from video games?

Methane budget studies use atmospheric CH4, \u03b413CH4, and \u03b4D(CH4) records to constrain methane sources over time. However, previous studies found that krypton (Kr) interferes with \u03b413CH4 values when measured via continuous flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (CF-IRMS). To account for this interference, we determined a Kr correction for the methane analytical system at The Pennsylvania State University (PSU). We measured this correction by adding an additional gas chromatography (GC) column to the preconcentration unit, which separated the Kr and CH4 peaks. By measuring three standards with both the original and modified systems, we quantified the Kr correction as a function of 1/[CH4] and applied it to previously published methane budgets. The Kr correction ranged from 0 to -0.4 \u00b1 0.4\u2030. We used a simple two-box model to determine how this correction affected estimated methane emissions from biomass burning (BMB) and biogenic sources.

Changes in the water-to-cement ratio (w/c) and strain rate of loading were shown to have minimal effect at the levels that were tested.  Increasing the amount of polystyrene replacement of aggregate, however, caused an increase in deformability but a decrease in strength.

Four tree species were used in this study, desiccation sensitive Washington hawthorn (Crataegus phaenopyrum Med.), Paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh) and Common hackberry (Celtis occidentalis L.), and desiccation tolerant Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) (Murakami et al, 1990). Bare-root maple and birch trees and hackberry and hawthorn were planted at three different times, April, May and June. Prior to planting, the bare-root trees were subjected to three different sweating periods of 2, 4, and 8 days in growth chambers under 70\u00ba F. During sweating procedure bud swell, bud break and new root initiations were observed.  After the sweating procedure, trees were planted in the field. Survival of broken buds was monitored, percent bud break, dry weight of leaves, height and caliper were measured and stem die back was evaluated. \nIn this study the desiccation sensitive Washington Hawthorn did not benefit from any of the sweating treatments. Birch, a desiccation sensitive tree (Murakami, 1990) appeared to show a high level of desiccation tolerance. Hackberry and Norway maple did not benefit from sweating treatments most of the time. Washington hawthorn was the only species that had most of the broken buds dried after trees were transplanted in the field. New buds broke later. Percent bud break of all four species decreased with late planting in most treatment-planting time combinations. Dry weight of leaves of all species significantly decreased with late planting. Washington hawthorn suffered from stem die back the most and Birch the least. Stem die back of Hackberry increased with late planting.

Beyond the linguistic factors (low salience, low reliability, redundancy) that render inflections less likely to be learned, the Associative-Cognitive model holds that language experience compounds this difficulty as attentional biases to cues learned in the first language (L1) can hinder the processing and in turn acquisition of important L2 grammatical cues (e.g., N. Ellis, 2006b, 2008b). Since learners\u2019 working memory limitations often inhibit attention to multiple cues in L2 input, they frequently ignore morphological cues when they are redundant and compete with lexical cues (e.g., explicit subjects, adverbs) (e.g., VanPatten, 1996, 2006), especially if their L1 is morphologically impoverished compared to the L2 (e.g., English-Spanish learners) (e.g., N. Ellis & Sagarra, 2011). The difficulty in overcoming L1 cue biases can be exacerbated by the overuse of L2 lexical cues in the classroom (e.g., Dracos, 2010), which obviates the need to process inflections for meaning. LaBrozzi (2009) found that study abroad experience helped some learners, namely those with higher working memory, rely more on morphological cues. However, study abroad is not always an option, especially in the early stages of L2 learning. Moreover, exposure to intensive amounts of input containing the target form might not be enough to override learned attentional biases; some sort of form-focused intervention might be crucial, or at least play an important role, in helping learners attend to the L2 grammatical cues, and in turn promote their acquisition (e.g., N. Ellis, 2006b, 2008b). Under this motivation, the present dissertation evaluates the efficacy of longitudinal training that forces attention to verbal inflections, while also exploring whether the provision of feedback facilitates the processing and learning of L2 morphological cues. In addition to external instructional variables, this study investigates the role of internal cognitive resources, namely working memory, in L2 learners\u2019 processing of L2 morphological cues and their ability to learn from the training.\nThis dissertation used an innovative experimental paradigm that involved five computerized training sessions that recorded performance as well as offline and online assessment measures that were administered using a pretest/posttest procedure (with immediate and delayed posttests). Similar to previous Processing Instruction research (e.g., VanPatten, 2004b), the training involved exposure to input activities that required the processing of inflectional morphology for successful interpretation of meaning (determining the subject and tense), and the learners were assessed on their ability to correctly interpret the form as well as produce it in writing. In addition to these traditionally used assessments, a cue reliance task was employed to examine the learners\u2019 biases toward lexical as opposed to morphological cues, and a self-paced reading task was used as a measure of online sensitivity to adverb-verb tense violations and subject-verb agreement violations. \nA total of 264 second-semester L1 English learners of Spanish were included in the participant pool after exclusions. The participants were assigned to one of three experimental training groups differing only in the feedback provided (none, correct/incorrect, metalinguistic) or to the control group (no training). Results indicated that when focused on form, all three experimental groups, but not the control group, showed a robust increase in reliance on and accurate processing and production of verbal inflections, with metalinguistic feedback consistently enhancing the effectiveness of the training. However, results from the self-paced reading task revealed that the training had no effects on learners\u2019 sensitivity to L2 morphological cues during more implicit, real-time processing while reading for overall meaning. With respect to the role of working memory, the findings indicated that participants with higher working memory were more accurate overall in the aural processing of verbal inflections, and they were also able to learn more from the training and improve their accuracy in the processing and written production of inflections over time. In addition, self-paced reading task results revealed that learners with higher working memory capacity better processed verbal agreement online. In fact, comparison of low-span to high-span learners indicated that only learners with high working memory were sensitive to tense and subject-verb agreement violations.\nThe three central conclusions established through this research can be summarized as follows. First, the breadth and novelty of the employed experimental design offers significant support to previous research suggesting that native speakers of a morphologically weak L1 like English rely on meaningful lexical items over redundant inflections to derive meaning in a morphologically rich L2 such as Spanish, particularly at lower levels of proficiency (e.g., N. Ellis & Sagarra, 2010a, 2010b; Lee et al., 1997; Musumeci, 1989; VanPatten, 1996, 2004, 2006). Second and more importantly, the findings from the form-focused tasks indicate that refocusing learners\u2019 attention through training intervention, particularly with metalinguistic feedback, can help learners overcome learned attentional biases and facilitate the processing and learning of L2 verbal morphology even at early stages of acquisition. This lends support to tenets of the Associative-Cognitve model (N. Ellis, 2006b, 2008b) and has important implications for instruction. Finally, this dissertation provides support for the small but growing body of research indicating effects of working memory on L2 grammar learning (e.g., Brooks et al., 2006; Kempe & Brooks, 2008; Kormos & S\u00e1far, 2008; Martin & N. Ellis, 2012), and, in response to an area of contention in the literature (e.g., Havik et al., 2009; Sagarra, 2007c; Sagarra & Herschensohn, 2010; cf. e.g., Juffs, 2004, 2005; Foote 2011), it also shows that working memory has a substantial influence on online L2 (morpho)syntactic processing.

Specifically, this study investigated the effectiveness of a knowledge-building community of practice learning environment on job-related knowledge, convergence, and on-the-job performance of study subjects.  A community of practice is defined as a group of individuals who share experiences, learn together, and engage in regular interaction though discussion and knowledge sharing activities relevant to their domain.  Through interaction, individuals influence one another to engage in the knowledge convergence process.  It was anticipated that learners in the knowledge-based community of practice learning environment would have a higher level of knowledge convergence than the self-paced learning environment.  \nThis study employed a sample selected from 61 dealership Service Advisors.  The study was designed to examine learning within an authentic, contextually rich, real-world environment.  Because the experimental groups were self-selected, a quasi-experimental study was used.  The independent variables were the self-paced online course and the online knowledge based CoP learning environment.  The self-paced online learning environment presented the course content without student or instructor interaction.  The CoP learning environment contents were identical to the self-paced course however; they contained actual customer-based scenarios in the form of discussion questions for students and instructor to interact.  The dependent variables were the pre and posttests, essay assessments, and customer survey scores.  The statistical analysis of the pretest posttest results for the two groups indicated significantly better scores in the knowledge-based community of practice learning environment.  Analysis of essay assessment responses confirmed a higher-level knowledge convergence in the knowledge based community of practice learning environment.  \nThe results of this study suggest that knowledge convergence occurred in both environments; however, participants in the knowledge-based community of practice experienced a higher level of knowledge convergence.

One such\nmodification is the addition of palmitoyl moieties by enzymes known as palmitoyl\nacyltransferases (PATs). Substrates for PATs include C-terminally farnesylated\nproteins, such as H- and N-Ras, as well as N-terminally myristoylated proteins,\nsuch as multiple Src-related tyrosine kinases. Since many of these proteins are\ninvolved in intracellular signaling pathways that drive cellular survival and\nproliferation, and their activity is predicated on specific subcellular localizations,\nthe enzymes that catalyze their posttranslational modifications are attractive drug targets. However, the primary focus of selective drug development in this arena\nhas been on the process of farnesylation, partly because the\nfarnesyltransferases have been cloned, characterized, and used in screens to\ndevelop inhibitors. In contrast, the identification and characterization of human\nPATs has been hindered by the lack of defined assays to characterize these\nenzymes, thus preventing the direct validation of the involvement of these\nenzymes in diseases such as cancer.\nCurrent assays to measure palmitoylation activity are functional; however,\nthey employ fractionated cell lysates and are relatively low-throughput. These\nmethods, though useful, are insufficient to directly measure PAT activity in intact\ncells, which would be useful in the identification of human PATs and studies of\nthe regulation of these enzymes. Thus, we sought to develop quantitative and\nefficient cellular assays to characterize PAT activity in intact cells. To develop\nthese assays, we used cell-permeable, fluorescently-labeled lipidated peptides\nthat mimic the PAT recognition domains of farnesylated and myristoylated\nproteins. These PAT substrate mimetics are accumulated by SKOV3 cells in a\nsaturable and time-dependent manner. Although both peptides are rapidly\npalmitoylated, the SKOV3 cells have a greater capacity to palmitoylate the\nmyristoylated peptide than the farnesylated peptide. Confocal microscopy\nindicated that the palmitoylated peptides co-localized with Golgi and plasma\nmembrane markers, whereas the corresponding non-palmitoylatable peptides\naccumulate in the Golgi but did not traffic to the plasma membrane. These\nresults indicate that the lipidated peptides provide useful cellular probes for\nquantitative and compartmentalization studies of protein palmitoylation in intact\ncells.\nExposure of SKOV3 cells to the peptides did not cause cytotoxicity at any\nconcentration within the maximal 2 hr timeframe of the peptide uptake,\npalmitoylation, and intracellular localization experiments. However, when\nexposed to the peptides for 72 hrs cytotoxicity did occur in a palmitoylatable and\nmotif-specific manner. Specifically, the non-palmitoylatable forms of both\npeptides caused minimal cytotoxicity even at the highest concentrations tested.\nIn contrast, the palmitoylatable forms of both peptides exhibited cytotoxicity of\nnearly equal efficacy, as measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase,\nwhen exposed to SKOV3 cells. However, the N-terminal myristoyl peptide\nexhibited greater potency for inducing cytotoxicity than the C-terminal farnesyl\npeptide. Since these peptides mimic the palmitoyaltion motifs of C-terminally\nfarnesylated and N-terminally myristoylated proteins it appears likely that they\nare acting as competitive inhibitors of the palmitoylation of these proteins. The\nfact that this inhibition is cytotoxic to SKOV3 cells validates the process of\nenzymatic palmitoylation, particularly of N-terminally myristoylated and\npalmitoylated proteins, as an interesting target for novel drug development.\nAlthough a C-terminal farnesyl-directed human PAT has been identified\nand validated as an oncogene, no human N-terminal myristoyl-directed PAT has\nbeen identified and characterized with this activity. Therefore, we sought to\nidentify a human N-terminal myristoyl-directed PAT and determine whether this\nenzyme plays a role in cancer. DHHC20 was chosen for characterization based\non homology to the N-terminal myristoyl-directed yeast PAT Pfa3 and its\nlocalization to a significant site of intracellular N-terminal myristoyl-directed PAT\nactivity, the plasma membrane. In order to characterize the gene, mammalian\nexpression vectors with or without the human DHHC20-insert were transfected\ninto NIH/3t3 cells. In vitro palmitoylation (IVP) assays demonstrated that\nDHHC20 has PAT activity specific for the N-terminal myristoyl motif with no\ndetectable activity toward the C-terminal farnesyl motif, indicating that DHHC20\nis a human PAT with activity toward proteins such as the Src-related tyrosine\nkinases. In addition, overexpression of the gene caused cellular transformation\nof NIH/3t3 cells as evidenced by foci formation and growth in soft agar. This\nindicates that expression of DHHC20 causes cells to lose contact-inhibition of\nproliferation and grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Also, cells\nexpressing human DHHC20 demonstrated elevated proliferation in normal and\nserum-depleted environments as compared to control cells, indicating that the\ngene is involved in signaling pathways that drive cellular proliferation. Also,\ncomparative analysis of multiple normal and tumor-derived tissue samples by\nquantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) demonstrate that DHHC20 is\nexpressed in a tissue-specific manner, and that it is overexpressed in several\nhuman tumor types including ovarian, breast and colon. Therefore, these results\ncharacterize DHHC20 as a human N-terminal myristoyl-directed PAT and\nvalidate it as a novel target for anticancer drug development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2846], "author_name_tesi": "Draper, Jeremiah Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Draper", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Jeremiah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Smith", "Charles D Smith", "Kent Eugene Vrana", "Michael Verderame", "Jong Kak Yun", "Melvin Lee Billingsley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Smith, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles D Smith, Committee Chair", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Member", "Michael Verderame, Committee Member", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["localization", "transformation", "Palmitoyl acyltransferase", "drug target"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Literacy and identity: Reflections of six African  American males in an adult literacy program", "id": "15298", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7704", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThis multiple case study explored how the literate experiences of six African American men influenced their perceptions of and engagement with a community-based adult basic education and literacy (ABEL) program in a large northeastern city. The theoretical framework included a social practices view of literacy and a constructivist view of identity. Narrative analysis, specifically Riessman\u2019s (2008) dialogic/performance approach, served as the analytic and interpretive lens. This study presents a socio-historical view of the men\u2019s literacy experiences beginning with early schooling and concluding with their presence in the ABEL program.\nThe findings indicate the men\u2019s literacy experiences in early schooling, society, and the ABEL program influenced their perceptions of and engagement with the program. First, their early schooling and ABEL program experiences show that the social context greatly influenced the choices they made about academic literacy and learning. Second, the men participated in the program to fulfill social roles, to be considered qualified for unemployment, and to negate the deficit construction of their literate identities formed in early schooling.

This dissertation explores the biobehavioral stress response of fear and anxiety in the domestic dog. While it is known that these problems have profound effects on dogs\u2019 interactions with their human companions, the effect on their physical well-being is less well studied. In all species, a physiological stress response occurs following exposure to a fear or anxiety -provoking stimulus. This stress response is thought to have both short and long-term effects on health and lifespan of the individual. \nSalivary cortisol as a measure of the stress response has been used in humans and other species, but factors related to collection methods, ability to collect saliva in diverse environments and under different situations, and the use of other salivary measures has not been well described for the canine species. A series of studies show that saliva can be easily collected in the home, kennel, and veterinary environments by pet owners, veterinary assistants, veterinarians, and behavior researchers. The materials and techniques used in the collection of saliva do influence the amount of saliva that can be retrieved as well as the final cortisol measurement. Cotton rope and hydrocellulose sorbettes can both be used with limited effect on cortisol concentration, and citric acid in small amounts is unlikely to have an effect on cortisol measurement, while increasing the volume of saliva collected. However, the use of beef-flavoring to enhance saliva collection in dogs is shown to introduce unpredictable error in salivary cortisol measurement. \nThe physiological and behavioral effects of fear in dogs are described in a study of dogs and their owners\u2019 reactions to a thunderstorm recording. It is shown that dogs have significant and long-lasting adrenal stimulation, as measured by salivary cortisol, following exposure to a known stimulus. These effects are compared to their behavioral response as well as to the behavioral and physiological response of their owners. Interestingly, owners\u2019 responses to their dogs\u2019 stress are not related to the amount of change seen in their dogs\u2019 biobehavioral responses. \nAn epidemiological survey of previous dog owners examines the long-term health and lifespan consequences of being a fearful or anxious dog. It is shown that certain fears and anxieties are prevalent in the domestic canine population and that there are prominent breed predispositions to particular behaviors that may have genetic components. These tendencies towards fear and anxiety are associated with specific health and lifespan consequences, including an increased severity and frequency of skin disorders in dogs with non-social fear and separation anxiety and a shortened lifespan in those dogs that are more fearful of strangers. \nSuggestions for further research into the measurement and role of fear, anxiety and other behavioral disorders in dogs are offered. This research has implications for both pet animals and working dogs, and offers a model for human fear and anxiety.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4575], "author_name_tesi": "Dreschel, Nancy Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Dreschel", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Nancy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas A Granger", "Elizabeth Susman", "David R Johnson", "Laura Klein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas A Granger, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Susman, Committee Member", "David R Johnson, Committee Member", "Laura Klein, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lifespan", "salivary cortisol", "stress", "animal behavior", "measurement", "canine"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Worth fighting for: Investigating the impact of contextual factors on task conflict and creativity.", "id": "26352", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11588", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigates the impact of various contextual variables on the relationship between task conflict and creative performance.

Although it can be driven by no more than a household battery, the simplicity and efficiency of contact charge electrophoresis has been marginalized by the inability to produce anything except oscillatory motion in a straight line - a necessary first step and invaluable for basic study of the phenomenon, but lacking a demonstration of its potential usefulness.\n\nFollowing a summary of the relevant literature, a notably simple addition to the contact charge electrophoresis system is presented which passively converts a portion of the back-and-forth oscillation into motion parallel to the electrode surface.

To illustrate the versatility of this concept, two applications in microfluidics are then demonstrated: particle separation from flowing suspensions, and liquid mixing in microfluidic channels.

Several studies have focused on specific causes, yet few have tried to look at a wide array. The purpose of this research was to investigate stresses in sugar maple forest plots in northern Pennsylvania. Three studies were undertaken.\n\nThe first study examined the spatial extent of sugar maple on 248 plots in Bailey's ecoregions 212F and 212G, which are glaciated and unglaciated regions, respectively. In addition, a health assessment of sugar maple in Pennsylvania was made, with a resulting separation in population between healthy and unhealthy stands occurring at 20 percent dead sugar maple basal area. Sugar maple was most often found to populate north and east aspects on low percent slopes across Pennsylvania within both glacial regions. No significant relationships were found between stand health and slope or aspect. Significant relationships were found between unhealthy stands and higher atmospheric deposition variables N, NH4, SO4, H and Ca across the state and within the unglaciated region of Pennsylvania. No significant relationship was found within the glaciated region between health variables and atmospheric deposition.\nThe second study was conducted to evaluate a statistical sampling design of 28 forested plots, from the above studies population of plots (248), and to provide data on physical and chemical soil variability and sample size estimation for other researchers. The variability of several soil parameters was examined within plots and between health classes of sugar maple and sample size estimations were derived for these populations. The effect of log-normal transformations on reducing variability and sample sizes was examined and soil descriptions of the plots sampled in 1998 were compared to the USDA Soil Survey mapping unit series descriptions for the plot location. Lastly, the effect of sampling intensity on the detection of significant differences between health class treatments was examined. Soil data gathered from plots matched Soil Survey data very well (< 1 parameter different) 63% of the time and matched well (< 2 parameters different) 80% of the time. Soil physical and chemical properties were quite variable within a plot, but soil horizon types within a plot matched (satellite pits to primary pit) 76% of the time. Plots that had similar horizonation (A, Bt, C) also generally had a lower variance and percent coefficient ovariation in physical and chemical properties. Plot soil parameter variability was influenced by slope and plot microtopography. Estimates of variation and sample size decreased when estimates were based on log-normal transformations as compared to untransformed data. Detecting significant differences between treatments appears to be more dependent upon sampling multiple holes within plots than on the number of plots within treatments.\n\nThe last study addressed sugar maple decline in northern Pennsylvania during the same period as the first study (approximately 1979-1989) but on 28 plots chosen from the first studies population. These were the same plots used in the second study on soil variability. Recent literature on sugar maple decline has focused on specific causes and few have tried to look at a wide array. This\n paper investigates stresses in sugar maple plots related to moisture and how these interact with other stresses such as chemistry, insect defoliation, geology, aspect, slope, topography, and atmospheric deposition. In the summer of 1998, 28 plots of declining and nondeclining sugar maple trees across northern Pennsylvania were sampled for a variety of soil physical and chemical parameters, site characteristics, and tree health. Foliage from healthy plots was found to have significantly higher base cations and P and lower Mn as compared to declining plots. Data from 762 soil horizons indicate that soils in healthy plots, as compared to declining plots, have higher base cations, pH, a Ca Al-1 > 1, and high %clay and low %sand suggesting trees on declining plots are prone to nutritional and drought stress. Regression relationships between foliar and soil chemistry indicate foliar nutrition is highly correlated with upper solum soil chemistry. Multivariate analysis indicates declining plots, as compared to healthy, tend to occur at higher elevations, have sandstone geologies, base poor--sandy soils, higher upper solum percent rock fragments, a lower deep solum pH, lower foliar base cations, and frequent, severe insect defoliations. Significant negative correlations were also found with foliar and soil chemistry and atmospheric deposition, suggesting base poor soils on sandstone geologies may be susceptible to deposition induced acidification.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4869], "author_name_tesi": "Drohan, Patrick ", "last_name_ssi": "Drohan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Patrick", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward John Ciolkosz", "David Russell Dewalle", "Susan L Stout", "Rick Lane Day", "Gary Walter Petersen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward John Ciolkosz, Committee Member", "David Russell Dewalle, Committee Member", "Susan L Stout, Committee Member", "Rick Lane Day, Committee Member", "Gary Walter Petersen, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["decline", "soil", "pennsylvania", "chemistry", "sugar maple"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Studies of Surface Initiated Polymerization using Anchored Organometallic Catalyst\n", "id": "7883", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3372", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Surface initiated polymerization (SIP) has potential applications in coatings, microelectronics, sensors and bioadhesion.

The surface concentration of anchored Pd catalyst was determined by XPS to be 0.30\u00b10.05 sites/nm2. Ultrasmooth poly(4-methoxystyrene) brushes with excellent control in thickness at room temperature were grown. In-place growth of brushes was demonstrated by patterning lines of nitrile SAM on gold by soft lithography and the eventual growth of patterned polymer lines. \nFurthermore, the difference in activity of immobilized Pd organometallic catalyst on gold was compared with the homogeneous counterpart and it was found out that the surface anchored catalyst showed lower activity compared to the homogeneous catalyst. This trend is similar to that observed with other immobilized metal catalyst systems in the literature. Additionally, ultrasmooth polyacetylene and polyphenylacetylene brushes are grown on gold surface at room temperature.

A \\textit{latin square} of order $n$ is a square array on $n$ symbols such that each symbol occurs once in each row and column. Two latin squares are called orthogonal when superimposing them gives each of the $n^2$ ordered pairs of symbols exactly once. It is well known that if $q$ is a prime power, the squares formed from the polynomials $ax + y$, $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_q$ form $q-1$ latin squares of order $q$ which are mutually orthogonal (each pair of squares is orthogonal). In this dissertation, we explore four problems relating to latin squares and other objects with similar properties, especially focusing on constructing large mutually orthogonal sets. \n\nWe explore the extent to which sets of mutually orthogonal latin squares, hypercubes, and frequency squares can be obtained by polynomials over finite fields. We are able to rescue two classical conjectures of Euler and MacNeish which are false for general latin squares but which are true when out attention is restricted to polynomial-generated squares only. \n\nWe also introduce the theory of the finite algebraic structures called \\textit{uniform cyclic neofields}, and explore the construction of sets of latin squares which are ``nearly orthogonal.'' Our main result with be to give a simple construction of large sets of such nearly orthogonal squares for all even orders $n$ where $n-1$ is prime. \n\nWe then examine a new generalization of latin squares called \\emph{class-$r$ hypercubes} which feature a larger alphabet ($n^r$ rather than $n$ symbols).

Likewise, in the photovoltaic industry, thin layers of amorphous silicon and shallow junction solar cells using single crystal and multi-crystalline silicon are of significant interest.  For all of these applications, an effective method of in-line monitoring of near-surface electrical properties is essential.  The near-surface properties of solar cell materials are of particular interest, where there is a delicate balance between having the surface textured sufficiently to minimize reflectivity, but not too excessively as to dramatically reduce carrier lifetime.  As solar cell wafers are becoming thinner and bulk recombination lifetimes improve, carrier diffusion lengths will begin to exceed the thickness of the wafer.  Hence, the back surface recombination velocity, which directly affects cell efficiency, becomes a critical factor.  Difficulties in determining the impact of near-surface effects on carrier transport properties of thin layer semiconductors have been encountered with traditional methods of electrical characterization.  The goal of this research was to investigate the near-surface electrical properties of semiconductor materials, including multi-crystalline silicon used in the photovoltaic industry, by a modified method of electrical characterization based on the photoconductive decay (PCD) effect.  The project was completed in two phases.  The first phase involved verification of a photoconductive decay method with a newly developed tool, in both a non-contact version and a physical contact version, with respect to capability for characterizing a shallow subsurface region of selected semiconductor materials.  To evaluate the capability of the tool, the longer recombination lifetimes of single crystal wafers of indirect bandgap semiconductors Si and Ge, and the relatively shorter recombination lifetimes of single crystal direct bandgap semiconductors GaAs and InP were verified.  In an early stage of the study, the sensitivity of the non-contact version of the tool in its current configuration was found to be too low for characterizing low mobility materials.  Subsequently, a high sensitivity temporary contact version of the tool was developed and utilized for a major part of the project.  The near-surface PCD measured response to surface treatments (native oxide removal and growth of a passivation layer) performed on prime single crystal Si wafers correlated with the electrical property changes that are known to occur in response to change of the chemical condition of the surface.  The reduction in measured minority carrier lifetime and mobility in response to minor increase in surface roughness (~ 1 nm RMS) of Ge wafers, and the increase in measured minority carrier lifetime of Si wafers in response to increasing SiO2 thickness demonstrates that the near-surface PCD method measures carrier transport properties in a very shallow sub-surface region of semiconductor dominated by surface effects.  The second phase was to utilize the adapted photoconductive decay characterization method to investigate surface carrier transport properties of solar cell grade multi-crystalline silicon material.  Near-surface mobility measured by the PCD tool shows a clear distinction between saw damaged and chemically treated wafer surfaces, with the mobility of the latter being approximately 4 times higher than that of the former, while bulk (Hall) mobility measurements did not distinguish between the two surface conditions.  Similarly, the near-surface recombination lifetime measurements show a distinct difference between the two wafer surface conditions, while no conclusion could be drawn from the bulk recombination lifetime difference. A method of monitoring surface passivation of mc-Si wafers, a critical step for maximizing solar cell efficiency, utilizing the near-surface PCD tool has been developed.  Experimental results obtained show that the measured recombination lifetime improves incrementally with SiO2 thickness for both sawed and chemically polished wafers, with the most significant improvement occurring in going from a bare wafer surface to tox = 91 nm.  Studies of optimizing the surface texture etch of sawed mc-Si wafers in an acidic solution were performed by monitoring the recombination lifetime with the near-surface PCD method.  It was found that wafers etched in HF/HNO3/H2O (14:1:5) solution for 2 minutes provided the best compromise between uniform texturization of the surface and low surface recombination velocity.

In this regard, detailed understanding of incipient plastic phenomena is needed to better understand potential for process-level improvements.\nIn this thesis, the transition from incipient stage to steady-state cutting was investigated in plane strain deformation of a model material system - pure copper. To measure the time-variant deformation in the incipient cutting regime, a numerical method based on a particle image velocimetry (PIV) algorithm was developed and applied to quantitatively measure deformation fields during chip formation. Characterization of the evolution to steady-state was made by PIV, hardness mapping and cutting load analysis, and all were shown to be capable of accurately predicting the length of incipient cutting stage. The incipient plastic phenomena in chip formation were analyzed under different cutting conditions and the effects of cutting parameters \u2013 tool rake angle and depth of cut \u2013 on the length of incipient cutting stage were investigated.

There is a need to inspect these films.  From the literature it seems like acoustic microscopy should work.  The currently available systems, however, do not work.  As a consequence, a theoretical analysis was carried out to explore what parameters might be necessary to conduct a successful inspection.  Results showed that frequency tuning should be useful.  An acoustic microscope was modified to do a frequency sweep and an experimental inspection feasibility study was successful.\n\nIn particular, the functional characteristics of thin films are in part determined by their synthesizing and processing procedure. A thin film component is a layered structure whose proper function depends on the film properties and the film adhesion to the substrate. Therefore, the evaluation of the integrity of thin film structures is very necessary and important. Past efforts reported in the literature have been focused on hard films and coatings on substrate materials. Little or no significant effort, however, has been reported on low modulus or soft films on hard substrates. This dissertation seeks to develop a technique to apply acoustic microscopy to the nondestructive, qualitative and quantitative characterization of thin (micron and submicron) films of low modulus.\n\nWell-established theoretical models are applied to the acoustic wave propagation in soft on hard layered structures. Using these for simulations the surface wave velocity is shown to be sensitive to film properties and interface conditions. In the dissertation work reported here,  a broadband acoustic microscopy system is assembled in order to optimize the experimental measurement through frequency tuning and amplitude modulation. Using the theoretical models as a guide the experiments on soft film show that its longitudinal wave velocity can be determined. Similarly, the experiments on Au films with differing interface conditions suggest that the surface acoustic wave velocity is sensitive to the interface conditions if the proper frequency range is selected. Comparison between the experimental results agrees well with theoretical predictions. Mechanical destructive tests further support the feasibility of the surface acoustic waves being sensitive to the interface influence. Overall, the study in the dissertation provides a comprehensive feasibility study for the characterization of low modulus film structures through the scanning acoustic microscopy techniques.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3147], "author_name_tesi": "Du, Jikai ", "last_name_ssi": "Du", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jikai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard R Tittmann", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Mark William Horn", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Judith Todd Copley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Chair", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Judith Todd Copley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["acoustic microscopy", "thin film", "non-destructive evaluation"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Permittivity measurement of circular shell using a spot-focused free-space system and reflection analysis of open-ended coaxial line radiating into a chiral medium\n", "id": "5882", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3625", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present thesis is concerned with electromagnetic simulations for material characterization. The content can be divided into two parts. The first part addresses questions related to a spot-focused free-space microwave measurement system. The goal is to establish an inversion procedure for non-planar samples. The second part is focused on the problem of an open-ended coaxial line radiating into a chiral medium. The objective is to evaluate the feasibility of using the open-ended probe method for characterization of chiral materials.\n\nThe free-space system under study consists mainly of two horn-lens antennas and a vector network analyzer. Permittivity and permeability of a sample under test are determined from its reaction to beam waves generated by the antennas. The network analyzer provides measurement output in the form of S-parameters for a linear two-port network. This system has been designed and successfully tested for planar slab samples, where a uniform plane-wave model has been used in the inversion algorithm. Extension to curved objects calls for a new model in which the wave scattering needs to be numerically simulated, and the measured S-parameters have to be defined carefully so that their (mathematical) expressions conform with the physics. To simplify the problem, the incident beam is assumed to be Gaussian, and samples with the simple geometry of a circular cylindrical slab are considered. Existing theories for Gaussian beam scattering by simple shapes and antenna near-field scanning are combined together to obtain an improved model. The improvement lies in the fact that characteristics of the antenna are now manifested in formulation of the measured response. \n\nThe model is first applied to simulate free-space mono-static measurement of planar slab samples. Numerical results are presented to validate the plane-wave approximation used in the inversion. Next, a three dimensional formulation is  derived for the bi-static setup. Calculation shows that, depending on the sample properties and thickness, the difference between the reflection coefficients of a Gaussian beam and a plane wave might be much smaller than the measurement error. Thus inversion of measured data using the plane wave model is appropriate even without correction for the defocusing effect.\nFinally, a simple technique is presented to estimate the reflection of two dimensional Gaussian beam by a circular shell. \nThe corresponding data inversion problem is studied with several approaches, including an optimization procedure using only magnitude data and a curvature correction procedure. The results are carefully evaluated and possible improvements are discussed.\n\nExtensive experiments have been performed using the free-space system. The focus is on the calibration method and settings of some important network analyzer parameters. For the free-space bistatic setup, it is found that an offset-short method reported previously is inappropriate. Therefore a simple two-tier calibration procedure is proposed. Inversion of measured data for Teflon, Plexiglas and glass slab samples shows that this procedure produces permittivity values within 10\\% difference from published data. Curved Plexiglas samples of several radii of curvature have also been measured. The data are compared with theoretical prediction and potential causes of the deviation are identified.

PLM, a small membrane protein of the FXYD family, has recently been shown to regulate the activity of both the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), two among the numerous molecular components of cardiac ECC.  To date, few studies have examined the effect of PLM on the modulation of the activities of other components of cardiac ECC, such as the L-type cardiac Ca2+ channel.  Preliminary data obtained by our lab demonstrated that PLM does in fact associate with CaV1.2 and seem to affect CaV1.2 (L-type channel) activation but not CaV2.2 (N-type channel) activation.  DIII of CaV1.2 has been shown to play a vital role in CaV1.2 channel regulation by various small organic molecules and toxins, such as the dihydropyridines and calcicludine.

The topological surface states are expected to yield unique phenomena, such as spin-momentum locking and the suppression of non-magnetic backscattering. The surface states with a Dirac cone like dispersion relation have been observed directly using Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Their signatures in electrical transport properties have also been reported although the transport behaviors are complicated by the fact that the samples often have dominating conduction from bulk channels due to high carriers density from impurity states. It is theoretically predicted that the surface states are robust against strong disorders, but it has not been tested experimentally. Bi2Te3, a member of the Bi2Se3 family, has been demonstrated to be a promising candidate of 3D topological insulators. In this work, various transport studies have been carried out on Bi2Te3 nanotubes with strong disorders. \nAs essentially narrow gap semiconductors with band gaps of 100 to 300 meV, the Bi2Se3 family often have conducting bulk due to impurity doping and lattice imperfection, such as vacancies, dislocations, and defects. Several approaches have been applied to reduce bulk conductivity. The first one is to compensate bulk carriers by chemical doping or field effect, which drags Fermi level back to bang gap. Another is to fabricate nano-scale samples with enhanced surface-to-volume ratio, and effectively reduce the weight of bulk conduction. In our work we have prepared Bi2Te3 nanotubes by solution phase method utilizing Kirkendall effect. Due to the nature of this process, polycrystalline Bi2Te3 nanotubes form with extremely strong disorders. In this way, bulk carriers are strongly localized and the samples are brought from a heavily doped band semiconductor to the regime of Anderson insulator. We have demonstrated that the bulk conductance of the nanotubes is truly insulating and characterized by Mott Variable Range Hopping (VRH) mechanism.\nDespite the strongly disordered bulk channel, Aharonov-Bohm (AB) like oscillations in magnetoconductance have been observed on the nanotubes at low temperatures. The conductance oscillations differ from those on either ballistic or diffusive normal metals. With the combination of theoretical analysis and simulations, we show that these oscillations originate from the outer surface states of the nanotubes. Their behaviors are consistent with the prediction of the \u201canomalous AB effect\u201d of topological surface states. In comparison with published work on clean TIs, we provide a direct demonstration of the fundamental aspect of topological surface states, namely their robustness to time-reversal invariant disorder.\nThe interplay between a TI and a superconductor (SC) is another interesting topic to explore the exotic behaviors of topological surface states. For example, proximity induced superconductivity on topological insulators leads to the new phase of topological superconductivity, which serves a host of Majorana fermions. On the other hand, proximity effect can be suppressed on topological surface states, with the presence of an anomalous resistance increase. We report a systematical study of the anomalous resistance increase on Bi2Te3 nanotubes with superconducting Nb electrodes. With various measurement strategies, we show that this resistance increase behavior occurs on the nanotubes rather than from SC/TI interface effects. It is induced from the contact with superconducting Nb without requiring current flowing through the Nb. The characteristic length of the anomalous resistance increase reaches as far as 450 nm at low temperature. Gate experiments confirm that the surface states of the nanotubes are responsible for this effect. Our results indicate that a new charge correlation may establish on the surface states of Bi2Te3 nanotubes under the proximity of superconductor, suggesting further studies on this subject to explore the underlying physical origins, both theoretically and experimentally.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11579], "author_name_tesi": "Du, Renzhong ", "last_name_ssi": "Du", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Renzhong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qi Li", "Qi Li", "Moses Hung Wai Chan", "Nitin Samarth", "Joan Marie Redwing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qi Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Qi Li, Committee Chair", "Moses Hung Wai Chan, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Topological Insulator", "Quantum Transport", "Nanotubes"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Commodity Futures in Asset Allocation", "id": "6841", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5811", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-11-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Commodity futures can supply fair investment return and unique diversification benefits to a portfolio manager. The relative performance between commodity futures and traditional financial assets is varied with business and market conditions. In general, commodity futures are negatively correlated with stocks and bonds. This negative correlation comes from the nature of the commodity market. Commodity futures can supply efficient diversification benefit to stocks and bonds investors when it is needed, i.e. when the stock or bond market displays poor performance or has a significant downside movement, commodity futures market usually shows strong performance and provides a good return.\nBoth commodity futures and traditional financial assets display the structure break behavior and their risk/return characters change under different market and economic conditions. Markov regime-switching model can be applied to address this asset return dynamic and corresponding portfolio selection issue. The estimation results of a simple two-regime model support that for three risky asset classes there is a \u00a1\u00b0normal\u00a1\u00b1 regime characterized by relatively high return and low risk and a \u00a1\u00b0bad\u00a1\u00b1 regime characterized by relatively low return and high risk. An investment strategy ignoring the regime switching effect leads to inefficient asset allocation and poorer portfolio performance. When the market is in the \u00a1\u00b0bad\u00a1\u00b1 regime, commodity futures perform relatively stronger than stocks and can provide more significant diversification benefit. Meanwhile, the regime-switching model can predict the break change of financial market and send signal to investors to increase commodity futures investment when financial market switches to the \u00a1\u00b0bad\u00a1\u00b1 regime.\nA general regime-switching model extends the simple regime-switching model by using economic variables as instruments to predict asset returns. This model helps investigate asset return dynamics and optimal asset allocation under alternative economic environments. The first general regime switching model uses the short rate as the instrumental variable to predict expected asset returns and regime switching probability. This model shows that the short rate plays an important role in asset return regime switching and optimal asset allocation. The optimal asset weights on risky assets negatively relate to the T-bill rate. This is not surprising as the T-bill rate determines the risk-free asset. When the return of risk-free asset is increasing, investors expect a greater return from the risky assets and have a greater chance to switch investment to the risk-free asset if the expectation is not met. However, the fraction of commodity futures in the risky asset portfolio increases with the short rate level. \nThe second general regime switching model is the IPI model which uses the monthly change of industrial production index (IPI) as the instrumental variable to model risky asset returns. The estimation results of this model support that the IPI growth rate plays an important role for efficient asset allocation since it determines both the regime transition probability and the expected returns of risky assets. Commodity futures return is always positively correlated with the IPI growth rate and the optimal weights on commodity futures increase with the IPI growth rate. \nTo further investigate the diversification benefit of commodity futures, an alternative approach is provided. Commodity futures are included into the initial portfolio with various stocks and bonds components and a new risk measure, VaR, is adopted to measure the risk of these portfolios. Three different VaR estimations are proposed: parametric VaR with regime-switching model, historical simulation VaR, and the EVT VaR. These estimation results again strongly support that commodity futures can reduce portfolio risk and improve portfolio performance. However, for different initial traditional portfolios, the optimal weight on commodity futures is not identical. Allocating 5-10% capital on commodity futures investment, as most intuitional investors have done, is not the optimal investment strategy, especially for equity investors. Meanwhile, extreme negative market movement for the traditional asset does not occur synchronously with that for commodity futures; hence, commodity futures do provide good downside protection.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5807], "author_name_tesi": "Du, Shengwu ", "last_name_ssi": "Du", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shengwu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou", "Jeffrey R Stokes", "James William Dunn", "Jingzhi Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey R Stokes, Committee Member", "James William Dunn, Committee Member", "Jingzhi Huang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Commodity futures", "portfolio", "regime switching", "VaR", "the EVT"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Supersonic jet noise prediction and noise source investigation for realistic baseline and chevron nozzles based on hybrid RANS/LES simulations", "id": "11672", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6831", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Jet noise simulations have been performed for a military-style baseline nozzle and a chevron nozzle with design Mach numbers of Md=1.5 operating at several off-design conditions. The objective of the current numerical study is to provide insight into the noise generation mechanisms of shock-containing supersonic hot jets and the noise reduction mechanisms of chevron nozzles.\n\n\nA hybrid methodology combining advanced CFD technologies and the acoustic analogy is used for supersonic jet noise simulations. Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations are solved to predict the turbulent noise sources in the jet flows. A modified version of the Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach is used to avoid excessive damping of fine scale turbulent fluctuations. A multiblock structured mesh topology is used to represent complex nozzle geometries, including the faceted inner contours and finite nozzle thickness. A block interface condition is optimized for the complex multiblock mesh topology to avoid the centerline singularity. A fourth-order Dispersion-Relation-Preserving (DRP) scheme is used for spatial discretization. To enable efficient calculations, a dual time-stepping method is used in addition to parallel computation using MPI. Both multigrid and implicit residual smoothing are used to accelerate the convergence rate of sub-iterations in the fictitious time domain. Noise predictions are made with the permeable surface Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings (FWH) solution. All the numerical methods have been implemented in the jet flow simulation code \"CHOPA\" and the noise prediction code \"PSJFWH\". The computer codes have been validated with several benchmark cases.\n\nA preliminary study has been performed for an under-expanded baseline nozzle jet with Mj=1.56 to validate the accuracy of the jet noise simulations. The results show that grid refinement around the jet potential core and the use of a lower artificial dissipation improve the resolution of the predicted high frequency noise spectra. The results also show that the predicted low frequency noise spectra are sensitive to the axial extent of the acoustic data surface, and the high frequency noise spectra are affected by the radial size of the acoustic data surface.      \n\n\nThe baseline nozzle has been studied at several off-design conditions with Mj=1.36, 1.47 and 1.56. Although the noise levels at mid to high frequencies are over-predicted at several shallow polar angles, the predicted noise spectra in the peak noise radiation direction and upstream directions agree very well with the experimental measurements. More encouraging is that the frequencies and amplitudes of the broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) are captured accurately at all three operating conditions. Three techniques are used to examine the noise source characteristics. The two-point space-time correlation method is used to analyze the statistical characteristics of the turbulent eddies. The direct flow-acoustic correlation technique and the beamformed acoustic pressures are used to reveal the different noise generation mechanisms of the large-scale and fine-scale turbulent fluctuations.    \n\n\nThe chevron nozzle simulations have been performed at the same operating conditions to evaluate the noise reduction effects. Special treatments are proposed to address the numerical difficulties caused by the chevrons. The impact of chevrons on the near-field noise sources and far-field noise radiation is simulated using the immersed boundary method (IBM) to overcome the great difficulties in grid generation. A non-matching block interface condition is developed to allow the grids to be greatly refined around chevrons for a higher accuracy of simulations without increasing the mesh size significantly. The predicted noise spectra agree very well with the acoustic measurements of the baseline nozzle, considering the small noise reductions of the chevrons at the given operating conditions. No apparent over-prediction is observed. However, the noise reductions are over-predicted because of the over-prediction of the baseline nozzle noise level at some polar angles. Analysis shows that the chevrons generate strong streamwise vorticies and induce strong lateral secondary flows near the nozzle exit. The enhanced turbulent mixing increases the noise source intensity and efficiency near the nozzle exit, and creates a high frequency noise penalty. But it reduces the turbulence intensity in the main jet potential core, and decreases the low frequency noise level. Both the flow and noise results show that the effects of chevrons on the jet flow and noise reduction depend highly on the operating conditions.

Thus, there are potentially other loci throughout\nthe genome that could influence the development and expression of sexual orientation.\nThis thesis contains two reports on male homosexuality. The first considers\nwhether differences in the gene encoding the aromatase enzyme (CYP19), a known factor\nin mammalian neural masculinization, influence sexual orientation in men. Results of the\nanalyses suggest that variation in CYP19 does not wield such influence and likely\nundermines the candidacy of this pathway of development of male homosexuality.\nThe second report and major portion of the thesis, consists of a full genome scan\nof a large collection of sibships containing brothers concordant for homosexuality.

In the analyses, sexual\norientation is considered both as a dichotomous phenotype as well as a quantitative trait\nand the Kinsey scales of sexual orientation are used to define the phenotype. The sample\npopulation consists of 144 sibships that comprise either two gay brothers (135 sibpairs)\nor three gay brothers (9 sibtrios).

Ever since the first reports, such motors have been the subject of growing interest. In addition to motility in response to gradients, these motors interact with each other, resulting in emergent collective behavior like schooling, exclusion, and predator-prey. However, most of these systems only exhibit a single type of collective behavior in response to a certain stimuli. The research projects in the disseratation aim at designing synthetic micromotors that can exhibit transition between various collective behaviors in response to different stimuli, as well as quantitative understanding on the pairwise interaction and propulsion mechanism of such motors.\nChapter 1 offers an overview on development of synthetic micromachines. Interactions and collective behaviors of micromotors are also summarized and included.\nChapter 2 presents a silver orthophosphate microparticle system that exhibits collective behaviors. Transition between two collective patterns, clustering and dispersion, can be triggered by shift in chemical equilibrium upon the addition or removal of ammonia, in response to UV light, or under two orthogonal stimuli (UV and acoustic field) and powering mechanisms. The transitions can be explained by the self-diffusiophoresis mechanism resulting from either ionic or neutral solute gradients. Potential applications of the reported system in logic gates, microscale pumping, and hierarchical assembly have been demonstrated.\nChapter 3 introduces a self-powered oscillatory micromotor system in which active col-loids form clusters whose size changes periodically. The system consists of an aqueous suspension of silver orthophosphate particles under UV radiation, in the presence of a mixture of glucose and hydrogen peroxide. The colloid particles first attract with each other to form clusters. After a lag time of around 5min, chemical oscillation initiates, and triggers periodic change of the associated self-diffusiophoretic effects as well as interactions between particles. As a result, dispersion and clustering of particles take place alternatively, and sizes of colloidal clusters vary periodically together with local colloid concentration, formulating a namely \u201ccolloidal clock\u201d.  In the system, oscillation can propagate from individual clusters to nearby clusters, and there can exist more than one oscillation frequencies in one system, possibly due to different local particle concentrations or cluster size. \nChapter 4 quantitatively investigates the influence of pairwise interaction between motors on their diffusional behaviors by analyzing motion of light-powered silver chloride particles. Powered by UV light, nano/micrometer-sized silver chloride (AgCl) particles exhibit autonomous movement and form \u201cschools\u201d in aqueous solution. Motion of these AgCl particles are tracked and analyzed. AgCl particles exhibit ballistic motion at short time intervals that transition to enhanced diffusive motion as the time interval is increased. The onset of this transition was found to occur more quickly for particles with more neighbors.  If the active particles became \u201ctrapped\u201d in a formed \u201cschool\u201d, the diffusive behavior further changes to subdiffusion. The correlation between these transitions and the number of neighboring particles was verified by simulation, and confirms the influence of pairwise interaction between motors.\nChapter 5 aims at quantitative understanding on the self-diffusiophoresis propulsion mechanism through numerical simulation with COMSOL Multiphysics. A self-powered micropump based on ion-exchange is chosen as the experimental model system. Weakly acidic-form ion-exchange resin can function as self-powered micropumps in aqueous solution, manipulating fluid flow at vicinity and transporting inert tracer colloids. Pumping direction in the system can be dynamically altered in response to pH change: lower pH leads to outward pumping, and higer pH results in inward particle motion. A COMSOL Multiphysics model is built with different boundary conditions and parameters, in accordance with the experimental system.

Exploring the rhizomatic assemblage of Deleuze|Guattari, this dissertation uses rhizomatic cartography as poetic arts based method. Based on the botanical concept of a networking system, and diverging from an aborescent model, Deleuze|Guattari refer to the rhizome as an image of thought that apprehends ideational multiplicities: the rhizome gives form to the ensemble of associations that converge/diverge in creative thought. The multiplicities that emerge from this networking process map and create the nodes, or main ideas, of this dissertation: an assemblage of borderlands, a revision of the Icarus myth, shelters of exposure, and the vicissitudes of motherhood. \nIn this dissertation, I refer to the role of poetics in contemporary culture as one that involves a poetic language that resists being easily absorbed into the conventions of our culture through a close attention to dynamic form. The rhizome creates a form that is always in the middle; the dissertation becomes an assemblage of disparate elements that resist closure, or, in other words, I argue that this form of research creates a poem. The intensive formulations of such poetry embodies, through writing, the Deleuze|Guattari concept of sensation. \nDeleuze conceptualizes sensation as an aesthetic dimension that is coextensive but distinguishable from perception: \u201cSensation is not a faculty of the subject but, rather, the mutual limit of the subject and the object, a place in which these two aspects become indistinguishable, such that one can say that in sensation the subject is altered by aspects of worldly forces that are occluded by the perception of constituted objects. Perception, the discernment of an object that stands over against a subject, is a faculty of \u201cfiguration\u201d insofar as it is the isolation, within a manifold of sensory information, of a distinct thing. Each art takes as its aim the reversal of this occlusion of sensation by perception\u201d (Ford, 2005, p. 392).\nCentral to the theoretical discussion of the logic of sensation is the idea of the figure. A Figure is a singular instance of sensation. \u201cSensation disorganizes the body of perception and in so doing it disorganizes perception. The figurative painting \u2018tells you the story in a long diatribe through the brain\u2019. Perception overwrites sensation and in so doing suppresses the forces that constitute sensation\u201d (Ford, 2005, p.392).  Finding ways to teach others to respond to works in the arts, to experience and understand the figures of sensation, is a significant project of art education. This dissertation offers one mapping of such a terrain. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12867], "author_name_tesi": "Dubin, Elizabeth Andrews", "last_name_ssi": "Dubin", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrews", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Richard Garoian", "Kimberly Anne Powell", "Charles Richard Garoian", "Christopher M Schulte", "William J Doan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Richard Garoian, Dissertation Advisor", "Kimberly Anne Powell, Committee Chair", "Charles Richard Garoian, Committee Member", "Christopher M Schulte, Committee Member", "William J Doan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gilles Deleuze", "Felix Guattari", "Walter Benjamin", "Dani Karavan", "Paulo Freire", "Antonio Machado", "Miles Horton", "Poetics", "Poetry", "Art", "Arcades Project", "Passages", "Icarus", "Art Education", "Rhizome", "Rhizomatic Cartography", "Sensation", "Arts Based Research"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EVALUATING WASTE ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING INFORMATION EXCHANGE USING LEAN THEORY\n", "id": "12260", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1124", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) Industry has the potential to increase profitability through improvement of the information exchange (IE) process on building projects.  According to a study performed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2004, the annual cost of inadequate interoperability is approximately 15.8 billion dollars on U.S. capital facilities.  Because the AEC Industry is project centered, and many different organizations work towards design and construction goals, the information exchange process is constrained, and collaboration is required for success.\n\nBuilding Information Modeling (BIM) is a process that provides a means for owners, designers, contractors, and operators to generate, organize and use detailed information throughout a project life cycle.  However, the success of BIM relies heavily on the accuracy and availability of the information exchanged between project team members.  In some studies, BIM has been shown to save upwards of 30% in field labor costs due to increased productivity; however the full potential of BIM is currently being limited by the inefficiencies associated with unplanned information exchange procedures.\n\nThis dissertation uses lean theory to identify and quantify the waste associated with the IE process from design to construction on projects using BIM.   Through research, areas of waste were derived from lean principles and adapted to develop an information exchange waste taxonomy.  The IE waste taxonomy was then used to identify the areas of IE waste on two case study projects.  Additionally, quantitative metrics were designed to document the economic scale of the identified areas of waste.  Finally, the identified waste on the two case studies was quantified, and the potential project impact was documented.\n\nThis research provides a standardized method for the identification of IE waste on current building projects.  The result of the IE waste on two case studies was estimated at 1.4 percent of the total Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) contract price.  This value does not take into account the initial benefit of BIM, which is perceived to be substantially more than 1.4 percent.  According to project team members, this research also prioritized high value added improvements to the IE process upon which they should focus their attention for future projects.  In summary, the steps provided in this dissertation provide a structured method for project team members to identify and categorize areas of IE waste, quantify the potential impact, and evaluate the results for future project improvements.  In order to improve project profitability, team members must first break through the BIM barrier, and then focus on designing efficient and effective information exchanges.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1113], "author_name_tesi": "Dubler, Craig Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Dubler", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Craig", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Messner", "John Messner", "M Kevin Parfitt", "Samuel Todd Hunter", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Messner, Dissertation Advisor", "John Messner, Committee Chair", "M Kevin Parfitt, Committee Member", "Samuel Todd Hunter, Committee Member", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Building Information Modeling", "Information Managment", "Lean Thinking"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Dual Texts in the Twentieth-Century American Novel", "id": "17469", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8404", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\u201cDual Texts in the Twentieth Century American Novel\u201d was written under the direction of James L.

The method requires a blood sample 21 days after isotope administration to determine D:H (deuterium:hydrogen ratio) in plasma; the equation assumes that S, F, and a are constants. Because of the long wait time involved in using the current equation, the goal of this study was to create a modified DRD equation that would use a sample obtained 3 days after dose administration. This would be not only more cost effective, but it would limit the possibility of acute infections disrupting normal retinol levels. Compartmental analysis was used to simulate the S, F, and a values at 3 days in both American and Chinese subjects, which have high and marginal vitamin A stores, respectively. From this analysis, S and a were both found to differ between subject groups showing that the values are affected by vitamin A stores at 3 days.

For neuroscientists, iron is of critical interest because of its function in both neurotransmitter synthesis and myelination. The study of iron in the brain has revealed both gradual accumulation as we age and also dyshomeostasis in disease. Regulation of iron movement into the brain is managed by a blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is comprised of the microvasculature throughout the brain and is characterized by tight junctions that allow for regulation of nutrient transport between the blood and the brain. Despite the importance of iron in brain function, research on the mechanism by which iron enters the brain is limited. To date, there are two potential mechanisms that have been proposed: (i) transcytosis of the iron transporter, transferrin (Tf) and (ii) endocytosis and release into the cell through divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT-1). Our research efforts have revealed both mechanisms are present. Two mechanisms may be required because the direct transcytosis mechanism overlooks the iron needs of the endothelium and the second mechanism identifies a pathway by which the endothelium and the brain iron needs are met. \nThe overall hypothesis for this thesis is that iron movement into the brain is regulated by the brain. Both cell culture and animal models were utilized to examine the two key questions regarding brain iron uptake that were investigated: (i) what are the mechanisms of iron movement into the brain and (ii) how is iron movement into the brain regulated. In the first subset of cell culture studies, we demonstrated increased release of iron from the endothelium when exposed to apo-Tf (iron poor), however hepcidin, a protein known to block iron export by binding to the iron export protein ferroportin, had no impact on iron release alone or on iron release induced by apo-Tf. These data identify iron poor transferrin in extracellular fluid in the brain as a potential mechanism to stimulate iron release from the BBB. The second set of studies focused on the impact of both apo-Tf and DMT-1 on transport of iron from the blood side of the cultured model to the brain side. A DMT-1 inhibitor, XEN602, was implemented to investigate the role of DMT-1 in iron transport. Neither apo-Tf nor XEN602 had a significant effect on total transport of 59Fe or Tf. Of note, however, is that XEN602 exposure did not result in increases in iron within the cells, which suggests that a majority of the iron seen in the brain-side chamber was transcytosed when the endocytic model was blocked. \nGiven, that the first set of studies demonstrated regulation of iron release and transport in the BBB model, we next sought to evaluate how a neurological disorder that was associated with brain iron deficiency would impact iron transport and release.  Specifically, we obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) to test the hypothesis that the brain iron deficiency in RLS results in increased signaling to upregulate brain iron uptake. First, we found that CSF from both control and RLS patients who had low hemoglobin relative to controls had decreased transport of iron across the BBB model. The low hemoglobin RLS group was also associated with higher iron transport than the low hemoglobin non-RLS control group.  Moreover, iron release had a modest but statistically significant positive correlation to systemic hemoglobin levels, but there was no correlation of transport to either hemoglobin or serum ferritin. The latter results are important because serum ferritin levels are used clinically to identify RLS patients as candidates for intravenous iron therapy. \nThe data from the cell culture models strongly suggest, consistent with our hypothesis, that there are signals on the brain side (e.g. CSF) of the BBB that regulated iron movement across or from the BBB. Therefore, we examined 3-month old mice carrying an H67D mutation in the HFE gene. This mutation promotes excess iron accumulation in most organs of the body and in its extreme case is associated with hemochromatosis. We found that the H67D/H67D mice had elevated total brain iron levels, but took up comparable amounts of iron into the brain to the wildtype mice over 24-hour and 5-day time periods. This finding supports the hypothesis that brain iron transport is regulated by the brain even in the presence of a mutation that promotes iron uptake.  We also observed significantly more 59Fe uptake into the female brain when compared to the male brain irrespective of genotype. Notably, this study is unique in that it considers the microvasculature as an independent compartment of the brain. This investigation identified iron uptake and retention within the microvessels over a 5-day time period, substantiating the hypothesis that the BBB can function as an iron reservoir for the brain.\nTogether, the data presented in this thesis confirm that the BBB functions as a central regulatory hub for brain iron uptake. We have demonstrated that there is regulation of release of iron that comes from the brain side of the BBB. The data with the mutant mice suggest that once the brain growth has plateaued, brain iron uptake is constant even if there is a mutation present that promotes uptake. There is also a significant sex effect for brain iron uptake.

Many campuses are a microcosm of the society at large made up of many diverse individuals.   As colleges and universities prepare their students to meet the challenges of a more diverse society the question of how we create an environment that encourages diversity for our students is often asked. Diversity education has been the common answer over the years, but how do faculty teach diversity education courses? What are the instructional strategies that help them to affect attitudinal change in students? The purpose of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of how faculty members\u2019 personal experiences with diversity influence their pedagogical choice and practice in diversity courses.   While there have been many studies conducted on the effects of diversity education on students, there has been few studies that focus on the experience of the teachers of these courses and how their personal identity and background experience with diversity influences how they teach about these often emotional and controversial topics. This qualitative collective case study explores the experience of diversity teachers at The Pennsylvania State University. The study uses a phenomenological framework in order to allow for an in-depth description of the perceptions and experiences of the faculty participants. The study used multiple sources of evidence including interviews, documents and course records and direct observation. The data collection occurred during the fall of 2004.  The findings of this study suggest that personal experiences with diversity do influence faculty members\u2019 pedagogical choice and practices in teaching diversity courses. Exposure to other cultures through travel and living abroad tended to influence the understanding and appreciation of other cultures. The educational experiences of the instructors also explained influences on pedagogical choice and practices. In all cases, there was a direct relation between pedagogy and background experience.  This study did not attempt to answer the question of whether these experiences made the instructors more effective teachers.

This obligate pathogen persists in the U.S. by overwintering on alternative hosts [i.e. kudzu (Pueraria lobata)] in the Gulf Coast region.  Predicting the risk of early season pathogen spread from southern inoculum sources to commercial soybean fields throughout the U.S. is an important process in determining proper management strategies.  Increased knowledge about urediniospore dispersal will be important in improving the accuracy of current risk assessment models.  This study examined the wet and dry deposition of P. pachyrhizi urediniospores into soybean canopies and the affects that environmental factors (i.e. rainfall intensity and wind speed) and cultural practices (i.e. row spacing) had on these distributions.   \nRainfall simulations within soybean field plots indicated that the wet deposition of urediniospores was significantly influenced by rainfall intensity and the soybean canopy height.  A larger mean proportion of (0.41) uredinia per cm2 was observed in the middle section of the soybean canopies for rainfall events of 75 mm/hr as compared to the mean proportion (0.25) for 15 mm/hr rainfall events.  For plant canopy height, a larger mean proportion of (0.40) uredinia per cm2 was also observed in the middle section of soybean canopies ranging in height from 30 to 38 cm when compared to the mean proportion (0.27) for soybean canopies 71 to 85 cm in height.  These results indicate that higher proportions of urediniospores will be wet deposited into the middle sections of soybean canopies earlier in the season during high intensity rainfall events than rainfall events of low intensity that occur later in the season.  \nWe examined effects of prolonged rainfall periods on the wet deposition of urediniospores on individual soybean plants with simulated rainfall.  We observed that 20 to 44% of the urediniospores wet deposited on the soybean leaf tissue in the top and middle sections of the canopy could be washed off by 1 min of simulated rainfall at the intensities of 15 and 75 mm/hr.  After 30 min of prolonged rainfall, 69 to 93% of the wet deposited urediniospores were removed from the soybean leaf tissue for both rainfall intensities.  This indicates that prolonged rainfall will reduce the number of urediniospores deposited on the soybean leaf tissue, but not remove them completely from the leaf surface.  \nThe dry deposition of Night-Glo\u00ae NG-20 zinc sulfide particle (DayGlo\u00ae Color Corp., Cleveland, OH) indicated that plant canopy height and wind speed were the main factors influencing the dry deposition of P. pachyrhizi urediniospores released above a soybean canopy.  The proportion of particles in the middle section of the canopy, normalized to the top canopy sample, decreased from 0.67 to 0.28 as the canopy increased in height from 69 - 71 cm to 84 - 91 cm.  High wind speeds were observed to deposit larger quantities of particles farther from their source above the canopy than low wind speeds.  However, even though more particles were dry deposited farther from the source than at low wind speeds, a majority the particles were still deposited within 20 m of the aerial source.  It is apparent from these results that dry deposition is an effective process in depositing aerial urediniospores into middle sections of the soybean canopy close to their source. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4686], "author_name_tesi": "Dufault, Nicholas Steven", "last_name_ssi": "Dufault", "middle_name_ssi": "Steven", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott Alan Isard", "Paul Anthony Backman", "Gary William Moorman", "Shelby Jay Fleischer", "Erick D De Wolf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott Alan Isard, Committee Chair", "Paul Anthony Backman, Committee Member", "Gary William Moorman, Committee Member", "Shelby Jay Fleischer, Committee Member", "Erick D De Wolf, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Deposition", "Soybean Rust", "Rainfall Simulator", "Detached Leaf"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A biomechanical anlysis of the bench press\n", "id": "8894", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4160", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this research project was to increase the body of knowledge concerning the biomechanics of the bench press as performed by novice lifters.  The purpose of the first study was to determine how the kinematics of a bench press change during a set to failure.  To examine these changes, subjects performed a maximal single lift (1-RM) and then as many repetitions as possible at 75% of the 1-RM load.  Statistical analysis revealed differences between maximal and submaximal lifts, and that the kinematics of a submaximal lift change as a subject approaches failure in a set.  The time to lift the bar increased from the first to the last repetition, causing a decrease in both mean and peak upward velocity.  Peak upward velocity occurred much earlier in the lift phase in these later repetitions.  Subjects also kept the bar more directly over the shoulder during the lift.  In general, most of the kinematic variables analyzed became more similar to those of the maximal lift as the subjects progressed through the set.  \nThe purpose of the second study was to determine the vertical and lateral forces applied along the bar during a maximal and a submaximal effort bench press lift.  Statistical analysis revealed the average lateral force applied along the bar to be between 22 and 29% of the applied vertical force.  The profile of the lateral force tended to be similar to the profile of the vertical force in both lifts.  The absolute vertical and lateral forces were greater for the maximal lift than for the submaximal lift, but were not different when compared as a percentage of the load lifted.  \nThe purpose of the third study was to determine how EMG activity, lift kinematics, and vertical and lateral forces applied to the bar are affected when performing the bench press at five different grip widths.  Statistical analysis revealed that vertical and lateral forces decreased as grip width increased.  Peak and mean EMG levels were not systematically affected by grip width.  \nThis research project has shown that performing the bench press with a wider grip is more efficient than a narrow grip.  The submaximal and training lifts of novice lifters are substantially different from their maximal lifts and these novice lifters displayed different kinematic, kinetic, and muscle activation patterns than those reported for experienced recreational and competitive lifters.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4136], "author_name_tesi": "Duffey, Michael J", "last_name_ssi": "Duffey", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Henry Challis", "Andris Freivalds", "William E Buckley", "Jinger Gottschall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Henry Challis, Committee Chair", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "William E Buckley, Committee Member", "Jinger Gottschall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["EMG", "grip width", "weight lifting", "benc press", "force", "biomechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Localization of Neutron Sources with Mobile Radiation Detectors Based on Drone Technology", "id": "14416tbd5106", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14416", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The threat of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism are strong motivators for systems that can detect special nuclear materials, including those that are heavily shielded or in transit.

A fleet of drones can cover larger areas, give much more localized counting data and have flexibility to change paths and work as a unit to discover a hidden source in a more efficient manner.\n\nIn this work, a simulation model is created that represents a fleet of drones mounted with radiation detectors locating a hidden stationary or moving neutron source. The dependence of the model on various system parameters is explored in detail. The system is strongly dependent on detector efficiency and counting time while only moderately dependent on the macroscopic neutron cross-section of the air and the neutron background flux.\nUsing a fleet of drones instead of a single drone is shown to be more efficient in all cases, with gains up to 100x faster for 10 drones searching for a 1 mCi source.\nDrones that respond with adaptive movement when a suspicious signal is detected allow the source to be located hundreds of seconds faster even for sources with weak activities.

The two methods give consistent results.  The crust beneath the GEOSCOPE station ATD has a thickness of 23\u201eb1.5 km and a Poisson's ratio of 0.31\u201eb0.02.  Previous studies give crustal thickness beneath Djibouti to be between 8 and 10 km. I found it necessary to reinterprete refraction profiles for Djibouti from a previous study. The crustal structure obtained for ATD is similar to adjacent crustal structure in many other parts of central and eastern Afar. The high Poisson's ratio and Vp throughout most of the crust indicate a mafic composition, suggesting that the crust in Afar consists predominantly of new igneous rock emplaced during the late synrift stage where extension is accommodated within magmatic segments by diking.\nIn the second part of this thesis, the seismic velocity structure of the crust and upper mantle beneath Ethiopia and Djibouti has been investigated by jointly inverting receiver functions and Rayleigh wave group velocities to obtain new constraints on the thermal structure of the lithosphere. Crustal structure from the joint inversion for Ethiopia and Djibouti is similar to previously published models. Beneath the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) and Afar, the lithospheric mantle has a maximum shear wave velocity of 4.1-4.2 km/s and extends to a depth of at most 50 km. In comparison to the lithosphere away from the East African Rift System in Tanzania, where the lid extends to depths of ~100-125 km and has a maximum shear velocity of 4.6 km/s, the mantle lithosphere under the Ethiopian Plateau appears to have been thinned by ~30-50 km and the maximum shear wave velocity reduced by ~0.3 km/s. Results from a 1D conductive thermal model suggest that the shear velocity structure of the lithosphere beneath the Ethiopian Plateau can be explained by a plume model, if a plume rapidly thinned the lithosphere by ~30\u00a1V50 km at the time of the flood basalt volcanism (c. 30 Ma), and if warm plume material has remained beneath the lithosphere since then. About 45-65% of the 1-1.5 km of plateau uplift in Ethiopia can be attributed to the thermally perturbed lithospheric structure. \nIn the final part of this thesis, the shear-wave velocity structure of the crust and upper mantle beneath Kenya has been obtained from a joint inversion of receiver functions, and Rayleigh wave group and phase velocities. The crustal structure from the joint inversion is consistent with crustal structure published previously by different authors. The lithospheric mantle beneath the East African Plateau in Kenya is similar to the lithosphere under the East African Plateau in Tanzania. Beneath the Kenya Rift, the lithosphere extends to a depth of at most ~75 km. The lithosphere under the Kenya Plateau is not perturbed when compared to the highly perturbed lithosphere beneath the Ethiopian Plateau. On the other hand, the lithosphere under the Kenya Rift is perturbed as compared to the Kenya Plateau or the rest of the East African Plateau, but is not as perturbed as the lithosphere beneath the Main Ethiopian Rift or the Afar. Although Kenya and Ethiopia have similar uplift and rifting histories, they have different volcanic histories. Much of Ethiopia has been affected by the Afar Flood Basalt volcanism, which may be the cause of this difference in lithospheric structure between these two regions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4354], "author_name_tesi": "Dugda, Mulugeta Tuji", "last_name_ssi": "Dugda", "middle_name_ssi": "Tuji", "first_name_ssi": "Mulugeta", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Charles James Ammon", "Tanya Furman", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Karl Martin Reichard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Committee Chair", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Tanya Furman, Committee Member", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Committee Member", "Karl Martin Reichard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["LITHOSPHERIC STRUCTURE", "EASTERN AFRICA", "JOINT INVERSION OF RECEIVER FUNCTIONS AND RAYLEIGH", "ETHIOPIAN LITHOSPHERE"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "American Indian Special Educators and Distance Education\n\n", "id": "8166", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5389", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this study the factors promoting and issues inhibiting participation in distance education (DE) courses for American Indian (AI) special education teachers were investigated.

This design enables the elimination of current swashplated designs, which are complex, subject to high drag in forward flight, heavy, and require considerable maintenance.  One of the main obstacles facing the implementation of this concept is achieving trimmed flight within the actuator stroke and authority.  Many of the current studies of this design predict required flap deflections that are beyond actuator capabilities.  This study focuses on the effects of variable main rotor RPM on both flap input and power requirements to trim the vehicle.\nExpanding on previous work, this study uses a 2-DOF flap-torsion rigid blade model with a CFD database used to model the flapped blade section, a prescribed wake geometry for inflow modeling, and advanced UH-60 rotor and fuselage geometry in addition to variable main rotor RPM.  The CFD database is analyzed by means of comparison to wind tunnel data and Thin Airfoil theory predictions.  A parametric study of rotor pre-pitch and vehicle gross weights is performed in order to determine feasible rotor designs for achieving trimmed flight at a range of advance ratios and gross weights.  The incorporation of CFD and the prescribed wake enables an analysis of main rotor power in comparison to a conventional UH-60 rotor.  Variable main rotor RPM is explored as a means of reducing prediction trailing edge flapped deflection.  Increased RPM is shown to reduce flap input requirements for the full range of gross weights for low and moderate airspeeds at the cost of increased main rotor power.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1134], "author_name_tesi": "Duling, Christopher Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Duling", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Farhan Gandhi", "Farhan S Gandhi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Farhan Gandhi, Thesis Advisor", "Farhan S Gandhi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["trailing edge flaps", "swashplateless rotors"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulation of Vacancy and Adatom Diffusion in Ag(111) with a monolayer C60 adsorbate", "id": "22441", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10063", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recently, clean Ag(111) surfaces with monolayer C60 adsorbates have been studied with scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron diffraction. These studies revealed that the C60 molecules form a commensurate (2*sqrt(3) x 2*sqrt(3))R30\u00b0 phase on the Ag(111) substrate and when observed with STM, the C60 molecules appear either \u201cbright\u201d or \u201cdim.\u201d LEED studies showed that these two species of C60 are a result of the C60 taking two different orientations on the Ag substrate, one of which only occurs when the C60 is located over an Ag lattice vacancy. STM also shows the bright and dim C60 molecules change location over time. This dynamic \u201cflipping\u201d behavior implies that vacancy diffusion in the Ag lattice is taking place. Here, using the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, I model the diffusion of vacancies in the Ag lattice. Additionally, more complex simulations involving creation/destruction of vacancies/adatoms, spatial C60 flip correlation, adatom diffusion, adatom interactions with vacancies,  and \u201csuperbright\u201d C60 molecules are also presented and studied. Datasets collected from these simulations are compared to experimental data on the flipping rate of the C60 molecules vs. temperature, the bright/dim C60 ratio vs. temperature, and the \u201csuperbright\u201d flipping rate of the C60 molecules vs. temperature. Additionally, the system of C60 on Au(111) is studied using the models developed in this dissertation. For vacancy diffusion, it is concluded that the number of vacancies in the lattice is not fixed as the temperature of the lattice changes. The source/sink of vacancies is shown to most likely be the domain boundaries of the system, as models allowing this type of diffusion approximate the experimental results and show spatially correlated flipping. A strong equilibrium number of vacancies forms in the lattice when vacancy diffusion through domain boundaries is allowed. Bulk vacancy diffusion is shown to be highly unlikely. Spatial flipping correlation is studied closely and it is concluded that it is directly related to vacancy number. Adatoms are also included in the simulation and allowed to diffuse in the hollow sites of the surface lattice. These serve to increase the flipping correlation and decrease the flipping rate. It is shown that adatoms forming a triangular pedestal beneath C60 is likely the cause of the superbright C60. Finally, this model is shown to also accurately simulate the system of C60 on Au(111).", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9760], "author_name_tesi": "Dulny, Joseph Stephen", "last_name_ssi": "Dulny", "middle_name_ssi": "Stephen", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Renee Denise Diehl", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr.", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Long Qing Chen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Renee Denise Diehl, Dissertation Advisor", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr., Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vacancies", "Adatoms", "Diffusion", "Ag", "Au", "C60", "Buckyball", "Surface Physics", "Kinetic Monte Carlo"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "A model of perceived value for leisure travel products", "id": "5974", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6320", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nCompared to service quality and satisfaction, perceived value of products is a new concept receiving growing attention from academicians and practitioners (Cronin, Brady & Hult, 2000). Consumers\u2019 value perceptions have attracted little attention from consumer behavior researchers despite its accepted importance (Holbrook, 1999). Current research is a part of the effort to discover consumers\u2019 value perceptions for leisure travel product consumption. \nThe purpose of this study was to develop and test a model of perceived value for leisure travel products. Previous models of perceived value have been extended and a model of perceived value for leisure travel products has been proposed. The theoretical framework for this study included seven antecedents of perceived value. In addition to previously proposed antecedents, which were perceived monetary price, perceived transaction value, perceived overall satisfaction and perceived overall service quality, three new constructs, novelty, control and hedonics that make up subjective leisure travel experience were tested as possible antecedents of perceived value for leisure travel products. \nEmpirical assessment of the theoretical framework included a mail survey of 392 cruise vacationers who took their most recent cruise vacation within past one year from the survey administration date. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to 1,500 randomly selected cruise vacationers across the US. All the constructs were measured with multiple items preceded by trip characteristics and followed by socio-demographic inquiries. Statistical properties of the constructs were analyzed with exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis techniques. The proposed research model was tested with regression in structural equation modeling technique.\nThe results of the study provided overall support for the proposed research model. As hypothesized, results suggested that perceived overall satisfaction mediates the relationship between affective factors and perceived value. The results further suggested that hedonics plays an important role in predicting behavioral intentions of cruise vacationers. The results of the study also provided support for previously developed relationships in the literature with regards to perceived monetary price, perceived transaction value, perceived overall satisfaction and perceived service quality. Two unexpected findings included the significant relationship between perceived monetary price and perceived overall satisfaction, and also an insignificant relationship between perceived monetary price and perceived overall service quality.\nStudy findings suggested that affective factors are significant antecedents to both perceived satisfaction and perceived value in leisure travel product evaluations. Future research is needed to further analyze the role of affective factors on post-consumption evaluations in leisure travel.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6320], "author_name_tesi": "Duman, Teoman ", "last_name_ssi": "Duman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Teoman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Leisure Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anna S Mattila", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Daniel John Mount", "Dr Harry Zinn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anna S Mattila, Committee Chair", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Member", "Daniel John Mount, Committee Member", "Dr Harry Zinn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["leisure travel", "perceived value", "perceived transaction value", "cruise vacation satisfaction", "cruise vacation value", "affect"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Factors that Influence Black and Latino High School Students to Pursue Careers in Agriculture", "id": "21726", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9867", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this research was to assess the factors that influence Black and Latino high school students enrolled in embedded agricultural education programs to pursue careers in agriculture.

The researcher observed a series of relationships in an effort to shed light on paradigms that exist for these groups.

This research examines engagement of women with ICT in traditional poor, rural, communities of Mali, a least developed country (LDC).  Mali was selected as the focus based on its broadly representative LDC challenges and the availability of locally and internationally collected data.  This research applies the theoretical framework of international regime theory and development as freedom theory to help explain how ICT diffusion can be an empowerment tool for women in development.  Women of Mali face low literacy rates, high birth rates, high infant and maternal mortality rates, and low incomes.  This research found ICT applications facilitated positive change in health, education, politics and the economy in Mali. The relationship between international and national regimes in the process of negotiating problem solutions is particularly important to policy analysis of telecommunications and of gender equity.  Policy in each of these areas permeates every sector of society.  Challenges, obstacles, solutions and benefits of ICT development with gender equity in Mali can inform policymakers\u2019 understanding of ICT diffusion and its benefits to people in LDCs.\n\nThis analysis was based on a literature review, a survey of existing relevant research studies, a country study and a case study of the Multipurpose Community Telecentre (MCT) model for rural ICT development.  The country study includes data and reports from the UNDP, ITU, IDRC, USAID and the World Bank.  It incorporates history, policy, existing research, statistical human development data over time, ethnographic data, and reports of other ICT projects in Mali.  Analyzed together, these data strongly suggest positive and directional change in Mali during 1990 to 2000, a period of dynamic telecommunications and gender equity policy liberalization. \n\nThe case study of the MCT in Timbuktu includes baseline communications research, on-site ethnographic research, interviews and the MCT Director\u2019s report.  The Mali MCT was one of five African pilot projects initially supported by ITU, UNESCO and IDRC funds and developed with national and local community support.  The MCT is a social communication center that provides ICT education and services.  This research focuses on the MCT as an ICT knowledge gathering and distribution center. Influenced by international regime policies for gender equity, Mali\u2019s national machineries have implemented gender equity policy in communication access.  Women participated in the design, implementation and operation of this MCT.  The community open access design was found to be particularly conducive to ICT development through women\u2019s social networking.  Research indicates women are keepers of indigenous knowledge systems in cultural communities.  Content developed from this local knowledge base can contribute to global knowledge systems, cultural integrity and sustainability as well as to economic development.  Conclusions of this study are based on findings that Malian ICT development with gender equity in the context of national and international policy engagement contributed to the positive growth in the political, educational and social sectors.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2483], "author_name_tesi": "Dumas, Josephine Helen Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Dumas", "middle_name_ssi": "Helen Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Josephine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Anita Fleming Rife", "Richard Denny Taylor", "Dr Judi Wangalwa Wakhungu", "Patrick Robert Parsons"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Anita Fleming Rife, Committee Member", "Richard Denny Taylor, Committee Chair", "Dr Judi Wangalwa Wakhungu, Committee Member", "Patrick Robert Parsons, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Africa", "Mali", "Telecentre", "Gender", "ICT"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "A New Approach to Bivariant K-theory", "id": "5876", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1231", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We construct a new bivariant theory, \nthat we call KE-theory, which is intermediate\nbetween the KK-theory of Gennadi Kasparov, and \nthe E-theory of Alain Connes and Nigel Higson. \nIt has an associative product, and there are \nnatural transformations from KK-theory into \nKE-theory, and from KE-theory into E-theory which\npreserve the product structures of the three \ntheories.

The pathophysiology of this disease is very complex and needs further research to elucidate the exact mechanisms of pathogenesis at the molecular level. There are several animal models available, of which experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is popular and closely resembles several crucial aspects of the pathogenesis of MS including the autoimmune component. Research has shown that opioids regulate immune system function, but their role in MS has not been elucidated. Previous research revealed the immunomodulatory role of the endogenous opioid [Met5]-enkephalin (also known as opioid growth factor (OGF)) in EAE models. Very few studies have been conducted analyzing proteomic aspects of MS. Hence, the overall objective of this study is to analyze and annotate the differential protein expression profiles of the lumbar spinal cord of EAE compared to normal mice. Secondly, to evaluate protein expression in EAE mice receiving OGF treatment or phosphate buffer saline (PBS). High-throughput proteomic profile analysis was conducted using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (2-D DIGE MALDI TOF/TOF). Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) was used to gain insight into various biological functions, pathways, and networks that are significantly represented by differentially expressed protein datasets.  \n\tA total of 12 unique proteins were identified that were up-regulated in the lumbar spinal cord of mice with EAE at Day 20 compared to normal mice. Some of these proteins have previously identified in the pathogenesis of EAE such as GFAP, neurofilament medium polypeptide, moesin, and lamin B1. Eleven canonical pathways and 1 network (score 36) were significantly represented by these differentially expressed proteomic dataset. Protein expression profile analysis of lumbar spinal cord of EAE mice at Day 20 in response to daily OGF treatment resulted in identification of 8 down-regulated and 1 up-regulated proteins. Further functional analysis of these 9 differentially expressed proteins resulted in significant representation of 1 network (score 23) and 15 canonical pathways. Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed in both studies determined 18 canonical pathways and 2 networks. The present study identified several differentially expressed proteins that were previously shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of EAE/MS. These proteins may be used as targets for further functional analysis which may aid in elucidating the exact mechanism of pathogenesis of EAE/MS at the molecular level. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7208], "author_name_tesi": "Dumpala, Pradeep kumar Reddy", "last_name_ssi": "Dumpala", "middle_name_ssi": "Reddy", "first_name_ssi": "Pradeep kumar", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Laboratory Animal Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ian Stuart Zagon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ian Stuart Zagon, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multiple sclerosis", "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis", "Opioid growth factor", "Proteomics", "2-D DIGE", "Pathway analysis", "mouse", "lumbar spinal cord"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Analysis of the Laser Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing Process Through Experimental Measurement and Finite Element Modeling", "id": "28714", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12295", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective in this work is to provide rigourous experimental measurements to aid in the development of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM).

Many watersheds and regions struggle with excess nutrient management and the Chesapeake Bay watershed is not an exception. Few studies are able to encompass both environmental losses and agronomic measurements. The field lysimeter research location offers an opportunity to improve our understanding of management strategies. Every pathway of potential loss can be monitored on a replicated basis. The four chapters in this dissertation describe the unique site location, and the research projects that have added to our knowledge of dairy manure management. \nThe first study (chapter 2) presents a hydrologic analysis of the research site\u201412 field scale lysimeters. Field lysimeters built at this scale are rare, and provide a unique opportunity to study environmental losses at a field scale as opposed to smaller column or pan lysimetry. However, the site is not uniform, and not all field lysimeters behave similarly. Based on hydrologic properties (volume and type of runoff), depth to bedrock, and hydrograph analysis, treatment-blocking maps were constructed to aid in future studies, and inform previously collected data.\nThe second study (chapter 3) focused on comparing gas emissions (NH3 and N2O) associated with broadcast and shallow disk injection. Shallow disk injection significantly decreases ammonia volatilization compared to broadcast (surface) application of manure. However, the injection band from disk injection can increase N2O emissions, which is a potent GHG. Shallow disk injection of manure did double cumulative N2O emissions as compared to broadcast application. However, NH3 volatilization was 90% lower with injected manure, leading to greater N conservation. \nThe third study (chapter 4) combined all of the data collected from the field lysimeters: gas emissions, overland flow and subsurface flow N loads, crop uptake, and soil storage into nitrogen budgets. To analyze the data, it was organized into two different manure budgets. The first budget covered January 2012 to September 2012, and the second budget spanned October 2012 to September 2013. Injection manure N balances were more difficult to close, and included a large proportion of \u2018unaccounted\u2019 N (50% and 68% of applied N for two accounting periods). Even so, results point to cumulative differences in nutrient use efficiencies that can be attributed to the greater conservation of ammonia-N with manure injection. There was an apparent build-up of soil N with manure injection that was not observed with broadcast application (in PSNT measurements). However, these trends were preliminary; over the two growing seasons covered by this study, these differences did not result in significant differences in corn yield or crop N removal.\nThe final study (chapter 5) used the Integrated Farm System Model to simulate different manure management scenarios on a typical Pennsylvania dairy farm (100 milking cows, 80 ha). Data from field experiments measuring ammonia volatilization, crop uptake and nitrate leaching was used to verify the model. The model could then be used to evaluate different manure management strategies for crop production, environmental losses, and economics. Converting the operation from daily haul to 6 months of storage with broadcast application did not substantially change N losses to the environment. However, replacing broadcast manure application with shallow disk injection resulted in substantial conservation of ammonium-N in manure and greater manure N use efficiency by crops, but slightly exacerbated nitrate-N leaching losses. Increasing manure storage from 6 to 12 months and injecting manure reduced nitrate-N leaching reduced by 38% due to better timing of manure application to crop growth. However, when manure storage was expanded to 12 months, net returns were $422 less with subsurface injection compared to broadcast manure, whereas, with a 6-month storage, the difference in net return was $469 per year.\nThe results of this research highlight the need for more long-term investigations of manure management at a field-scale. Long-term studies are important for establishing treatment differences. At field-scale some of these differences (ie. yield, crop uptake, runoff loads) might be more difficult to discern due to the highly variable nature of field research. Long-term study sites offer opportunities to further investigate BMPs like shallow disk injection. Overall, these studies find that shallow disk injection can be a positive alternative to broadcast applied manure, but that significant treatment differences are still hard to determine.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12076], "author_name_tesi": "Duncan, Emily Wong", "last_name_ssi": "Duncan", "middle_name_ssi": "Wong", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Brian Beegle", "Peter Kleinman", "Curtis Dell", "Jason Philip Kaye", "James Hamlett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Brian Beegle, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter Kleinman, Committee Chair", "Curtis Dell, Committee Member", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member", "James Hamlett, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nitrogen", "shallow disk injection", "manure", "field lysimeters", "lysimetry", "nutrient management"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "The Syntax of Headed Restrictive Relative Clauses with Special Reference to Spanish", "id": "6421", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2613", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Syntax of Headed Restrictive Relative Clauses with Special \n\nJason D.

One is to demonstrate that head raising (HR) approaches to RRCs are empirically inadequate and require more complex theoretical assumptions than a wh-movement approach to RRCs. The second goal is to demonstrate that the diachronic evolution of RRCs from Latin to Spanish (and more generally to Romance) can provide insight into some of the problems that are often associated with wh-movement based-accounts of RRCs. Tracing the historical development of RRCs sheds light on the poorly understood and complex problem of variation in the CP area of RRCs. Especially in Spanish and Romance, information about the diachronic evolution of RRCs provides a means of understanding the distribution of inflected relative pronouns (such as Spanish \u2018quien\u2019 and \u2018el cual\u2019) and uninflected complementizers (i.e., Spanish \u2018que\u2019) in the CP area of RRCs.\n\t Chapter 1 introduces the topic and provides the background and motivation of the study. Chapter 2 provides a detailed explanation of the head raising approach, as presented by those who support it in the literature (especially Kayne 1994; Bianchi 1999; Bianchi 2000b; De Vries 2002). After explaining the head raising approach in detail, it is argued that adopting a head raising approach to RRCs leaves a number of key issues unexplained and forces the assumption that semantically equivalent RRC structures (i.e., \u2018The man who I saw\u2019 vs. \u2018The man that I saw\u2019 vs. \u2018The man I saw\u2019) have important differences in their underlying syntactic structure. \nChapter 3 outlines the standard wh-dependency approach to RRCs that was developed within the Government and Binding (GB) framework. This chapter gives an overview of the basic wh-movement approach and discusses some of the problems traditionally associated with this approach, including cross-linguistic variation in the CP area of RRCs, the Doubly Filled COMP filter and That-trace effects. \nChapter 4 addresses the diachronic development of RRCs, arguing that RRCs in modern Romance languages, and specifically in Spanish, arose from earlier correlative structures. Previous proposals concerning the transition from correlatives to post-nominal RRCs are presented and then a novel analysis is offered which avoids the problems identified with the previous accounts. \nFinally, Chapter 5 explores how postnominal RRCs in Latin, which were introduced by inflected forms of the indefinite pronoun \u2018qui\u2019, evolved into RRCs in modern Romance languages, including Spanish. Unlike Latin, Spanish and other Romance languages employ a combination of inflected pronominal forms (such as \u2018quien/quienes\u2019 and \u2018el/la que\u2019) and uninflected complementizers (i.e., \u2018que\u2019) in the CP area of RRCs. Following recent work by Roberts and Rossou (2003), it is argued that complemetizers evolved from earlier Latin pronominal forms of \u2018qui\u2019 via a process of syntactic reanalysis (also called grammaticalization). Chapter 5 also applies the analysis of RRCs presented here to many different types of Spanish RRCs and summarizes the main results of the dissertation.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2606], "author_name_tesi": "Duncan, Jason ", "last_name_ssi": "Duncan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Almeida Jacqueline Toribio", "Philip Baldi", "Marie Gillette", "John Lipski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Almeida Jacqueline Toribio, Committee Chair", "Philip Baldi, Committee Chair", "Marie Gillette, Committee Member", "John Lipski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["relative clauses", "syntax", "wh-movement", "head raising", "Spanish"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Molecular Mechanisms of Growth Inhibition by the Chymotrypsin-like Serine Protease Inhibitor, AAPFcmk\n\n", "id": "11419", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3431", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in woman worldwide (Kamangar et al., 2006).  Infection with one of the 15 known high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types is etiologically linked to 95% of cervical cancer (zur Hausen, 1996).  Multiple studies have also causally linked oncogenic HPV infection to 25% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC).  Recently, preventative virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines against HPV-16 and HPV-18, two of the most common high-risk HPVs (Munoz et al., 2003), have been approved.  However, the participation of HPV in the development of multiple types of cancer, the prevalence of infected women in less developed countries and the current negative reproductive consequences of treatment makes finding novel and affordable therapies critical to treating established HPV infections.<BR><BR>\nAAPFcmk is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease inhibitor that has been shown to inhibit the growth of organotypic raft cultures containing cells with high-risk HPV types, with no effect observed on uninfected keratinocytes (Drubin et al. 2006).  Since many proteases have been shown to be overexpressed in cancer, protease inhibitors have become candidates for use in cancer therapeutics (Turk, 2006).  The Bowman-Birk serine protease inhibitor (which has mainly chymotrypsin-specific activity), has been in clinical trials for its anticarcinogenic activity against oral cancer.  AAPFcmk has not only shown the ability to inhibit the growth of high-risk HPV cells but also has demonstrated anticarcinogenic activity in a number of model systems and is relatively selective for a nuclear protease (Clawson et al., 1992b).  Investigation into potential binding targets of AAPFcmk found multiple targets which are not proteases including ATP-dependent helicases (Dhamne et al., 2006).   AAPFcmk was shown to inhibit the ATP-dependent helicase activity of the SV40 Large T-antigen in vitro. However, the molecular mechanisms of inhibition induced in HPV-infected cervical cancer cells by AAPFcmk have not yet been determined.  Understanding how AAPFcmk inhibits the growth of human cervical cancer cells at a molecular level could identify possible treatment options, including its prospect as a topical therapeutic, and applications in combination therapies.<BR><BR>\nWe hypothesized that AAPFcmk would arrest the growth of cervical cancer cell lines and cell lines immortalized or transformed by the integration of the SV40 and HPV small DNA tumor viruses through inhibition of the cell cycle based on previous studies (Clawson et al., 1995) (Drubin et al., 2006).  We also hypothesized that AAPFcmk growth arrests cell lines infected by the small DNA tumor viruses, SV40 and HPV-16, by blocking the ability of the SV40 Large T-antigen (SV40 LTag), HPV-16 E6 and/or HPV-16 E7 oncoproteins from interacting with the tumor suppressor proteins, p53 and pRb.  Both the SV40 LTag and HPV-16 E6 protein functionally inactivate p53 and the downstream cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, however the mechanism of p53 inactivation is different (Munger and Howley, 2002).  The HPV-16 E7 protein and the SV40 LTag both inactivate the hypophosphorylated form of pRb which binds to E2F1 inhibiting cell cycle progression and transcription of the DNA replication factor PCNA.  Mechanistically both the SV40 LTag and HPV-16 E7 proteins target the LxCxE motif located in the pRb binding pocket.  Previous research with serine protease inhibitors demonstrated that the binding of HPV-18 E7 to pRb could be disrupted at the LxCxE motif after protease inhibitor treatment (Stoppler et al., 1996b).<BR><BR>  \nIn this dissertation, we investigated mechanisms of AAPFcmk growth inhibition, using cell culture model systems involving three human cervical carcinoma cell lines and the THLE-2 liver epithelial cell line immortalized with the SV40 LTag to test the hypotheses.  C33a cells are cervical cancer cells with no HPV DNA while SiHa and CaSki cervical cancer cells have integrated HPV-16.  Using this model system we examined the effects of AAPFcmk on cellular growth, cell cycle kinetics, DNA synthesis, and p53 and pRb protein expression.  Growth of the three cervical cancer cell lines was inhibited after AAPFcmk treatment.  C33a cells arrested at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle after AAPFcmk treatment.  The HPV-16 SiHa and CaSki cells also exhibited an arrest of the cell cycle after AAPFcmk treatment; however, CaSki cells exhibited an arrest at the G1/S phase of the cell cycle while SiHa cells exhibited a significant decrease in cellular proliferation resulting in a global arrest of the cell cycle.<BR><BR>  \nWestern analysis of HPV-16 E7 and the E7 protein downstream target E2F1 showed no significant difference in protein expression levels after AAPFcmk treatment in both the CaSki and SiHa cells.  However, mRNA expression levels of the E2F1 target gene, PCNA, showed a significant decrease in both CaSki and SiHa cells after AAPFcmk treatment.  AAPFcmk treatment also inhibited the growth of the SV40 LTag immortalized THLE-2 cell line, but the inhibition of growth was not associated with a change in p53 protein levels, or the downstream target p21.  The protein levels of pRb, and the downstream target proteins E2F1 and PCNA, were also unchanged in THLE-2 cells after AAPFcmk treatment.  However, cell cycle arrest, decreased cellular proliferation and inhibition of PCNA transcription observed experimentally after AAPFcmk treatment in both CaSki and SiHa cells indicate that AAPFcmk may potentially inhibit the HPV-16 E7 protein binding of p21 and/or inhibit E2F1 from transcribing PCNA.<BR><BR>\nWestern analysis of p53 and p21, the downstream targets of the HPV-16 E6 protein, demonstrated a significant increase of both p53 and p21 protein expression in CaSki cells but no change was observed in the SiHa cells after AAPFcmk treatment.  The results of the western analysis were verified by p53 and p21 mRNA expression levels after AAPFcmk treatment in both cell lines.  Changes in p53 and p21 expression in SiHa cells should not be dismissed entirely as high levels of p53 and p21 expression in SiHa cells (as compared to CaSki cells), may make any changes difficult to detect.  Therefore, AAPFcmk may also potentially interfere with either HPV-16 E6 protein binding to E6AP or with the E6/E6AP complex from binding to and/or ubiquitinating p53.  Future research into the potential binding targets of AAPFcmk elucidated in this dissertation may be necessary to utilize AAPFcmk as a potential HPV therapeutic.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3419], "author_name_tesi": "Duncan, Kimberly JoAnne", "last_name_ssi": "Duncan", "middle_name_ssi": "JoAnne", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Toxicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kristin Eckert", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Gary Alan Clawson", "Neil David Christensen", "Thomas E Spratt", "John Peter Richie Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kristin Eckert, Dissertation Advisor", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Chair", "Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Chair", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member", "John Peter Richie Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HPV", "AAPFcmk", "cervical cancer", "serine protease inhibitor"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Assessment of mindful parenting among parents of early adolescents: Development and validation of the Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting scale", "id": "7740", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3758", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this study was to test the validity of a proposed construct of mindful parenting, as measured by the Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting (IEM-P) scale. This conceptualization of mindful parenting encompasses affective, cognitive, and attitudinal aspects of parent-adolescent relations and draws from the literature on intra-personal mindfulness (i.e., an ability to intentionally maintain present-centered awareness and attention with a non-judgmental stance). Mindful parenting extends the internal process of mindfulness to the interpersonal interactions taking place during parenting. Through investigation with a sample of 801 rural families of early adolescents, mindful parenting was shown to have properties of reliability and convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity. First, the IEM-P measurement model was examined in a randomly selected subsample of 375 mothers. Results of a confirmatory factor analysis supported a measurement model comprised of a higher-order factor of mindful parenting, as expected, and four first-order factors (present-centered attention, present-centered emotional awareness, non-judgmental acceptance, and non-reactivity), one more than anticipated. This model had adequate reliability, was replicated in an independent sample of 378 mothers, and was then shown to have measurement invariance across mothers and fathers. A series of structural equation models conducted with the full sample of 753 mother/adolescent pairs provided evidence of the validity of the mindful parenting construct. First, mindful parenting was shown to be positively associated with, yet clearly distinct from mothers\u2019 intra-personal mindfulness. Next, psychological functioning was shown to account for a much larger proportion of the variance in mothers\u2019 intra-personal mindfulness than of their mindful parenting, as hypothesized. Third, mothers' mindful parenting accounted for a substantial proportion of the variance in the constructs of parent-child affective quality and general child management (use of inductive reasoning, monitoring, and consistency in discipline), yet appeared independent from them. Finally, mothers' self-reported mindful parenting was shown to be moderately predictive of concurrent, adolescent-reported goal setting and inversely of girls' externalizing behavior. These findings offer preliminary validation of the extension of mindfulness to the interpersonal domain of parent-adolescent relations and can serve to inform the development and evaluation of preventive interventions targeting mindful parenting in families of early adolescents.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3737], "author_name_tesi": "Duncan, Larissa G.", "last_name_ssi": "Duncan", "middle_name_ssi": "G.", "first_name_ssi": "Larissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark T Greenberg", "J Douglas Coatsworth", "David Manuel Almeida", "Michelle Gayle Newman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark T Greenberg, Committee Chair", "J Douglas Coatsworth, Committee Chair", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member", "Michelle Gayle Newman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mindfulness", "parenting", "adolescents", "measurement", "interpersonal"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The \u201cnew Teen Momism\u201d: 16 And Pregnant\nand The New \u201cteen Mom\u201d Identity\n", "id": "15511", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7402", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Teenage pregnancy in the U.S. has been represented in popular culture in quite contradictory ways: as a serious social problem and an enviable, even glamorous youth identity. One important case in point is the television franchise 16 and Pregnant, a show that, together with its spin-off series, demonize and glamorize teen pregnancy.  Above all else, 16 and Pregnant produces the spectacle of the pregnant teen as a new identity for reality television.\nThe purpose of this thesis is to show how the content of the series 16 and Pregnant reflects and array of historical, cultural, and political-economic factors.  I adopt a feminist perspective in my political-economic and textual analysis of the show and related media.  The following analysis draws on Douglas and Michaels\u2019 (2004) conception of \u201cnew momism\u201d and Murphy\u2019s (2012) conception of \u201cteen momism\u201d and applies these terms to 16 and Pregnant to explain how teen moms are constructed as both morally reprehensible yet also desirable figures that echo neoliberal and postfeminist ideologies. I discuss, specifically, how the series relies heavily on integrating neoliberal and postfeminist messages of personal responsibility, individualization, and self-management.  I further argue that the construction of the \u201cteen mom\u201d identity within the 16 and Pregnant franchise represents a shift in previous images from \u201cteen moms\u201d as African-American, teenaged \u201cwelfare moms\u201d to \u201cteen moms\u201d as white, middle class teens.  Additionally, I demonstrate how the show also makes a media spectacle out of teen pregnancy while promoting itself as \u201ceducational entertainment.\u201d  Finally, I argue that despite its partnership with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, the series focuses on producing an entertaining show by shining a voyeuristic spotlight on the cast\u2019s personal lives all while promoting the tenets of neoliberalism and postfeminism.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7355], "author_name_tesi": "Dunfee, Jacqueline Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Dunfee", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Jacqueline", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Media Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle Rodino Colocino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle Rodino Colocino, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["reality TV", "teen pregnancy", "MTV", "neoliberalism", "postfeminism"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Evolutionary genomics of emerging RNA viruses\n", "id": "8753", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1780", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the increasing number of zoonotic infections that are rising today, examining the underlying\nreasons why only some pathogens are able to spread successfully in new host populations\nwarrants further investigation.

By strategically selecting various firms along the food supply chain, including farmers, manufacturers, distribution centers, logistic providers, retailers, government agencies and other food industry experts, this dissertation provides a holistic understanding of product recalls in food supply chains. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7035], "author_name_tesi": "Dunn, Kaitlin Snelling", "last_name_ssi": "Dunn", "middle_name_ssi": "Snelling", "first_name_ssi": "Kaitlin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher William Craighead", "Vilmos Fosnocht Misangyi", "Douglas J Thomas", "John Eugene Tyworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher William Craighead, Dissertation Advisor", "Vilmos Fosnocht Misangyi, Committee Member", "Douglas J Thomas, Committee Member", "John Eugene Tyworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Food Product Recalls", "Food Supply Chains", "Supply Chain Disruptions", "Case Research", "Theory Building"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Development of phosphorus-catalyzed reductions via P(III)/P(V) cycling with strained phosphorus catalysts.", "id": "28823", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12242", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Phosphorus catalysis is a growing field that is currently based upon the utility of three major catalytic cycles: 1) three coordinate phosphine to four coordinate phosphonium, 2) three coordinate phosphine to four coordinate phosphine oxide, and 3) four coordinate phosphonium to five coordinate phosphorane.  In this thesis, a new mode of phosphorus catalysis will be described, wherein the catalytic cycle relies upon the transition from three-coordinate phosphorus to five-coordinate phosphorane.  Specifically, we have developed two systems where geometrically constrained phosphorus(III) compounds catalyze the reduction of unsaturated substrates.  In the first system, a planar, T-shaped phosphorus(III) compound is transformed into a five-coordinate hydridophosphorane with no observable intermediates; catalytic reduction of azobenzene is observed with both species in the presence of a reductant.  In the second example, a cyclic phosphine catalyzes the reductive transposition of allylic halides.

However, relatively little research has been conducted on children's English grammatical development. The purpose of this study was to examine the English grammatical development of bilingual (Spanish-English) Head Start children during the preschool years. The goals were to determine (a) the differences in children\u2019s productions of English grammatical morphemes based on age of English immersion, (b) the order of acquisition of English morphological structures that are produced by bilingual preschool children and, (c) the growth curve trajectories of mean length of utterance in morphemes of the three longest utterances (m3lm) over a two-year period.  These aims were accomplished through in-depth analyses of spontaneous language samples collected over a two-year period in Head Start.  Comparisons were made between children who were exposed to English and Spanish in the home from birth (Home English Communication, HEC) and children who communicated in Spanish at home and were not expected to communicate in English until their entry into Head Start (School English Communication, SEC).  Results indicated that children in the HEC group mastered more morphemes earlier than the children in the SEC group; however, by the end of children\u2019s second year in Head Start both groups had mastered a similar number of morphemes.  Additionally, the children in both groups followed a different order of acquisition when compared to monolingual English-speaking children.  With regard to growth, both groups of children demonstrated a positive, linear rate of change and acceleration in their m3lm over the two years in preschool.  Differences were observed between the two groups, with the children in the HEC group producing an overall higher m3lm than the children in the SEC group.  However, children in the SEC group were increasing their m3lm at a faster rate when compared to children in the HEC group.  The results of this investigation provide information to clinicians about typical English grammatical development of Spanish-English preschool children.  This information may be useful when assessing bilingual children\u2019s English language grammatical abilities. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4054], "author_name_tesi": "Dunn Davison, Megan Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Dunn Davison", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Sciences and Disorders", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carol Scheffner Hammer", "Adele W Miccio", "Carol Anne Miller", "Linda H.

The growing demand for early childhood institutions in Taiwan stems from the increased number of two-salary families and awareness of the importance of early education by the Taiwanese Ministry of Education. Even though many educators and researchers have investigated best-practices for constructing quality child care programs and developing quality early childhood program standards and accreditation criteria to supervise these programs; however, parents\u2019 voices are often unheard. The researcher believes that parents, teachers, educators, government officers and policy makers must work together as a group to serve children and improve the quality of early childhood education programs. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of parents\u2019 attitudes toward kindergarten assessment and the factors that enter into their selection of a kindergarten.\nThis study was conducted in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, the largest city in southern Taiwan. A stratified random sample of 480 parents with children aged 4\u20136 and enrolled in licensed kindergartens were recruited for this study. The instrument was a revised questionnaire based on Kaohsiung Kindergarten Assessment Criteria. The data analysis was conducted using SPSS 13.0, a Windows-based statistical software package. Each research question was subjected to different analysis methods. Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, independent t-test and logistic regression analysis were used. Research results were as follows:\n(1)Taiwanese parents do care about a quality kindergarten, but at different levels. Parents have a more positive attitude toward teaching facilities and public safety and curriculum and child care subscales.\n(2)Parents differed by age and monthly household income in their attitudes toward kindergarten assessment. Parents also differed on practical and reputation/information factors when examined by parents\u2019 gender, education level, income and occupation.\n(3)There was no difference in parents\u2019 attitudes toward kindergarten assessment when examined by kindergarten types, but there were differences between public and private kindergarten parents\u2019 attitude toward practical and reputation/information factors.\n(4)Parents\u2019 most important kindergarten selection factors were concerned with safety and cleanliness of environment and facilities and curriculum and child care. In addition, parents\u2019 attitudes about the importance of teaching facilities and public safety and curriculum and child care concepts were the best predictor of parents\u2019 kindergarten selection.\n(5)In the open-ended question, most parents stated that the environment and teacher quality were important, especially the space and cleanness of the environment and the teacher personality. In addition, some parents also listed different criteria that related to license issues, curriculum, children preference, student quality and some practical factors.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2066], "author_name_tesi": "Duo, Gina ", "last_name_ssi": "Duo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Daniel Yawkey", "David Brent Mcnaughton", "Ladislaus M Semali", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Daniel Yawkey, Committee Chair", "David Brent Mcnaughton, Committee Member", "Ladislaus M Semali, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["attitude", "kindergarten", "early childhood programs", "assessment", "selection"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ERROR ESTIMATES FOR NODAL AND SHORT\nCHARACTERISTICS SPATIAL APPROXIMATIONS OF\nTWO-DIMENSIONAL DISCRETE ORDINATES METHOD\n", "id": "8096", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2718", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work presents advances on error estimation of three spatial approximations to the Discrete Ordinates (DO) neutron transport equation. The methods are: Diamond Difference (DD), Arbitrarily High Order Transport method of the Nodal type (AHOT-N), and of the Characteristic type (AHOT-C). The AHOT-N and AHOT-C methods are employed in constant, linear and quadratic orders of spatial approximation.\n\nDiscrete error norms for two dimensional non-scattering or isotropic scattering media are evaluated for problems characterized with different levels of differentiability of the exact solution. The results demonstrate that while integral error norms converge to zero with mesh refinement, the cell-wise error norm may not converge when the exact flux possesses discontinuities across the Singular Characteristic (SC). The results suggest that smearing across the SC is the major source of error on the global scale.\n\nTo mitigate the adverse effect of the smearing, we propose a new Singular Characteristic Tracking (SCT) algorithm which achieves cell-wise convergence even for the cases with discontinuous exact flux. Convergence is restored by hindering numerical diffusion across the SC. Two separate Step Characteristics stencils are solved for two sub-cell defined by the intersection of the SC with a mesh cell. Compared to the standard DD, SCT increases the L1 error norm rate of convergence from 0.5 to 2 for uncollided discontinuous exact flux, and from 0.3 to 1.3 for discontinuous exact flux with isotropic scattering.\n\nTo provide a confidence level to the spatial resolution of the DO equations, we have casted the AHOT-N method as a Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin projection. Within the mathematical framework of Finite Element Methods, we have derived an a posteriori error estimator that furnishes a bound on the global L2 error norm. When sufficient regularity of the adjoint solution is assumed, the error estimator is written as a function of the numerical solution's volume and surface residuals, and cell edges jumps, for which we present easily computable approximations. As a direct application of decomposing the global estimator into local indicators, we have tested an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategy to enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. In a Shielding Benchmark problem, we show that for the same level of tolerance, we can decrease the required number of unknowns by a factor of 10 when comparing AMR to uniform refinement.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2713], "author_name_tesi": "Duo, Jose Ignacio", "last_name_ssi": "Duo", "middle_name_ssi": "Ignacio", "first_name_ssi": "Jose", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yoursry Y Azmy", "John Harlan Mahaffy", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov", "Oscar M Zamonsky"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yoursry Y Azmy, Committee Chair", "John Harlan Mahaffy, Committee Member", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov, Committee Member", "Oscar M Zamonsky, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["discrete ordinates", "a posteriori error estimator", "neutron transport", "nodal and short characteristics", "adaptive mesh refinement"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS IN POST-WAR LIBERIA: THE ROLE OF\n \nEDUCATION AND TRAINING IN STRENGTHENING ORGANIZATIONAL\n\n CAPACITY\n", "id": "11708", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5721", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to understand the role of non-formal education and training in the organizational change process of Civil society organizations (CSOs) in post war Liberia.  CSOs are the local foundation for democracy and development in Liberia, and serve a wide range of roles in local communities.  For example, in post-war Liberia, CSOs provide services in communities that the government does not reach due to limited resources.  They educate disenfranchised groups such as women in micro-credit and small business practices that ultimately increase their self-sufficiency and independence.  They engage youth in community projects and build the younger generation\u2019s civic capacities. They engage fragile communities on the issue of ethnic based conflict and religious intolerance, and they engage government on all spheres of development issues, ranging from governance, transparency, accountability, to grassroots empowerment. However, the capacities of CSOs to achieve these missions depend on the education and training of their members. \n \nThe capacity for strong performance in Civil society provides the foundation for lasting social benefits. Civil society is a monumental social and economic force with vast potential to create a more free, fair and just society. The collective nature of civic action helps ensure that the interests of citizens, including women and youth, the poor and other marginalized groups are weighed by public institutions that make policy and allocate resources. Many Civil society organizations (CSOs) face common challenges limiting their effectiveness, namely the ability to manage human and financial resources, effective program design and service delivery, advocate to power holders, and manage for result. \n\nThe study was a descriptive research. Using survey instruments, the data were collected from 74 staff of the 15 CSOs that the researcher had worked with for over three years. The study adopted two instruments. The two instruments contained seven domains (Governance, Management, Human Resources, Financial Resources, External Relations, Service Delivery, and Sustainability).  A rating scale of (0 = Capacity not existing; 1 = Nascent stage; 2 = Emerging stage; 3 = Expanding stage; and 4 = Mature stage) for ease in recording responses and data analysis was used for the first instrument which measured CSO\u2019s capacity, whereas a Likert-type rating scale of the level of general knowledge related to job competence was from 1 through 5. 1= Not Very Knowledgeable; 2=Not Knowledgeable; 3=Fairly Knowledgeable; 4=Knowledgeable; and 5=Very Knowledgeable. The survey instrument also included demographic information and open ended questionnaire. The open ended questionnaires were administered to provide the baseline information about the CSOs\u2019 development work.\n\nThe results of this study show that they have rated governance and management knowledge and organizational capacity domains consistently highest, implying that their skills and organizational capacity in governance and management have improved. However, CSOs are not yet mature organizations, but in an expanding stage of organizational development. Expanding organizations have track records of achievement; their operations are recognized by their constituencies, the government, the private sector, and other NGOs active in the same sector. A significant capacity is present, but there remain areas requiring further strengthening and development. CSO staff were fairly knowledgeable to knowledgeable on the seven domains. Furthermore, the direct significant relationship between overall general knowledge related to job competence  \nlevel of the CSO staff and overall organizational capacity implies that CSOs\u2019 would ultimately increase capacity with a parallel increase in staff\u2019s capacity development activities, including training workshops, experience sharing, practices in work environment, mentoring and sustained backstopping support for staff in their immediate work environment. The implication is that capacity development through training and non-formal educational activities would strengthen the CSOs\u2019 development initiatives, adaptation of improved governance and management practices. CSOs\u2019 capacity development initiative would ensure a program delivery system that addresses development needs of the target audiences by adopting a diverse service delivery mode to address development challenges. \n\nThe 15 CSOs are organized into clusters. The cluster approach captures the participatory involvement of cluster members, their thoughts and aspirations through joint learning, experience sharing, network and joint project monitoring and evaluation.  The cluster approach was designed to establish a framework for systemically anchoring development strategies that would produce synergy and address the needs of groups with diverse backgrounds, leading to broad-based responses of target audiences to issues of poverty, governance, leadership and other development initiatives that they care about most. The cluster approach was meant to create non-formal educational tools (training workshop, experience sharing, meeting, group discussion, field visit and replication of best practices) that build upon indigenous modes of knowledge, education and action for collective problem solving. Finally, CSOs are taking advantage of their strengths in terms of expertise and resource sharing to meet their programming goals, thereby viewing learning as a process that is not limited only to outside experts.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5715], "author_name_tesi": "Duo, Samuel Nyan", "last_name_ssi": "Duo", "middle_name_ssi": "Nyan", "first_name_ssi": "Samuel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tracy Scheidt Hoover", "Tracy Scheidt Hoover", "Constance A Flanagan", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tracy Scheidt Hoover, Dissertation Advisor", "Tracy Scheidt Hoover, Committee Chair", "Constance A Flanagan, Committee Chair", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Civil society", "Capacity assessment", "Organizational capacity", "Education and Training", "Capacity Building", "Post-War Liberia", "Civic and community engagement"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "ABRUPT CHANGES IN ICE SHELVES AND ICE STREAMS: MODEL STUDIES", "id": "6176", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6206", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-11-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ice sheets are among the most important components of the Earth system because of their ability to force changes in climate and sea level.

The power sector is the single largest source of carbon pollution in the United States. The EPA has recently designed a federal rule called the Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants in the U.S.\nThe purpose of this work is to study the impact of the Clean Power Plan on the PJM Interconnection and to compare the impacts of different strategies to achieve state emissions goals. Scenarios are designed to evaluate the environmental impacts and cost-effectiveness of three different compliance strategies and ascertain how these strategies interact with one another. The three main strategies analyzed in this thesis are 1) participating in interstate CO2 emissions trading, 2) increasing the operational efficiency of existing coal-fired power plants, and 3) increasing the amount of wind generation capacity.\nThis thesis uses a unit commitment model to simulate a range of different scenarios and policy structures, and I compare the resulting cost and generation mix tradeoffs. I simulate the enforcement of the Clean Power Plan federal rule in this model by placing a limit on the total tons of CO2 that can be emitted over a certain period of time.\nThe strategies simulated do not change the overall CO2 emissions, which is always equal to the emission cap imposed, but they vary with respect to the cost of compliance with the Clean Power Plan and the fraction of coal generation at risk of premature retirement. Electricity prices and total system cost will increase with compliance in all scenarios studied, as compared with a baseline case with no emissions limit. Coal generation is displaced by natural gas generation in all scenarios, when compared with the no carbon cap baseline. The relative economic and regulatory effectiveness of the strategies is framed in terms of the tradeoffs between the cost of meeting the cap and coal\u2019s share of cumulative generation. The overall result is that increasing wind capacity reduces the risk of premature coal unit retirements whereas improving coal efficiency reduces economic risks, and that states compliance costs can reduce by cooperating within an emissions trading framework.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11893], "author_name_tesi": "Dupuis, Alexia Violaine", "last_name_ssi": "Dupuis", "middle_name_ssi": "Violaine", "first_name_ssi": "Alexia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mort D Webster"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mort D Webster, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Clean Power Plan", "Carbon dioxide emissions", "Unit commitment", "Electricity markets"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development of the Error-related Negativity and Behavioral Variability in Childhood: Clarification of Neural Processes Using Wavelet Analysis", "id": "18821", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9043", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The error-related negativity (ERN) is an event-related potential that is thought to reflect neural activity related to performance monitoring. The ERN can be measured reliably in adults and relates to individual differences in cognitive abilities, psychopathology, and personality. However, questions remain about the reliability and validity of the ERN signal in children. As the ERN is typically measured over many trials, low levels of signal temporal consistency across trials in childhood may interfere with researchers\u2019 ability to detect an ERN signal in a child\u2019s averaged waveform. The present study sought to clarify the developmental trajectory of the ERN signal in childhood by assessing both average signal strength and signal temporal consistency of the ERN, using wavelets to examine dynamics in the theta waveband, in a sample of children assessed longitudinally in kindergarten, 1st, and 2nd grade. Consistent with previous findings, ERN deflections in the averaged waveform increased with age.

This study is based on the speech of members of a bilingual community in northern New Mexico, in which Spanish and English have been in contact for over 150 years. The data are 8,723 Intonation Units totaling 43,193 transcribed words and corresponding to approximately 4.5 hours of the 29 hours of recorded material, from conversations lasting from 45 minutes to two hours. 28 Spanish-English bilinguals born and raised in Mora County participated: 14 women and 14 men, 30 to over 70 years old. From this Mora, New Mexico Corpus (MNMC), 1,181 tokens of CS were extracted.\nThe study focuses on social, prosodic, and syntactic considerations in CS. Information about acquisition and use of the two languages and linguistic attitudes were culled from the recordings, which, unlike answers obtained via a questionnaire, provide an indication of issues of concern to the community. Spanish language dominance, as evaluated by individual speakers themselves, appears to be correlated with older age and primary-school-level education. Prosodic units are important, though this is not a categorical constraint, in that 79% of all switches occur at Intonation Unit (IU) boundaries, with Spanish-dominant speakers showing a higher rate of CS internal to the IU. However, the direction of the switch is not correlated with language dominance and, in the aggregate, IU-internal CS occurs evenly from Spanish to English and from English to Spanish. Finally, with respect to syntactic considerations, the first word in CS is most frequently a closed-class item, a conjunction or preposition in Spanish and subject pronoun in English, while the word preceding a CS is usually an open-class item, in both languages. The most frequent combinations were: English noun / verb / adverb / pronoun + Spanish conjunction or adverb, and Spanish verb / noun / adverb / conjunction + English subject pronoun or adverb. These patterns were observed to hold for both kinds of CS, that is, at IU boundaries and IU-internally.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7130], "author_name_tesi": "Duran Urrea, Delfina Evelyn", "last_name_ssi": "Duran Urrea", "middle_name_ssi": "Evelyn", "first_name_ssi": "Delfina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rena Torres Cacoullos", "Rena Torres Cacoullos", "Chip Gerfen", "Paola Eulalia Dussias", "John Lipski", "Catherine Travis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rena Torres Cacoullos, Dissertation Advisor", "Rena Torres Cacoullos, Committee Chair", "Chip Gerfen, Committee Member", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Committee Member", "John Lipski, Committee Member", "Catherine Travis, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["code-switching", "discourse", "bilingual speakers", "New Mexico", "New Mexican Spanish", "intonation units", "language attitudes", "syntactic factors", "word classes"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Living Arrangements of the Elderly in Bangkok, Thailand: Impacts of Low Fertility, Life-courses, and Non-marriage", "id": "7512", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6856", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary focus of this dissertation is the living arrangements of elderly people in Bangkok, Thailand.  The specific research questions are constructed around three major topics: the determinants of living arrangements; the dynamics of living arrangements; and the function of living arrangements.  These issues are examined both quantitatively and qualitatively, using data collected during one year of fieldwork.  A questionnaire schedule, designed to follow the lives of elderly respondents in a flexible manner, was used to collect over 1,000 cases of representative data from the entire Bangkok Metropolis.  In-depth life history interviews were also conducted with both elderly parents and their co-residing children, producing a total of 28 taped, transcribed, and translated interviews.  Contextual information gathered through such ethnographic approaches as participant observation in the life of Bangkok residents further added valuable qualitative data.  \n\nAnalyses of the determinants of living arrangements have shown that the number of surviving children is a significant determinant of co-residence, suggesting that the future elderly with considerably fewer available children are less likely to live with a child in their old age.  However, as suggested by the powerful positive effects of having never-married children, these children may contribute to the maintenance of co-residence; despite the lowered availability of children, if one child remains never-married, that child can co-reside with the parent.  Because the marriage of children is a major risk for the loss of co-residing children, and conflicts with in-laws in extended families are obstacles for co-residence, never-married children are structurally more suited for co-residence.  Moreover, the continuity of co-residence over time suggests that the children\u2019s decisions to remain at home are critical in ensuring co-residence in later life.  In contrast to a common assumption, however, the results have found that household structures per se are not major determinants of the elderly\u2019s economic security, while such factors as the health status of the elderly and the socio-economic status of children are more important.  Significant contributions of the elderly to their households, economically and otherwise, also suggest a need to reconsider the function of co-residence, particularly with never-married children. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6853], "author_name_tesi": "Durand, Yoshie Moriki", "last_name_ssi": "Durand", "middle_name_ssi": "Moriki", "first_name_ssi": "Yoshie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Lyons Johnson", "James William Wood", "Gordon F De Jong", "Mark D Hayward"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Lyons Johnson, Committee Chair", "James William Wood, Committee Member", "Gordon F De Jong, Committee Member", "Mark D Hayward, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Living arrangements", "Thailand", "Low fertility"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF BANNING THE WORD \u201cRAPE\u201d FROM A RAPE TRIAL\n", "id": "11196", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1519", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In 2006, a U.S. District Court Judge banned the word \u201crape\u201d from a rape trial.

Initiation of gene transcription is a complex process, but can be summarized in a few key steps: activator binding; chromatin remodeling; assembly of general transcription factors; Pol II recruitment; transcription initiation.  Insights into chromatin remodeling over the past decade have shifted the focus of research to this regulatory mechanism, and the resulting discoveries have led to a new understanding of how cells initiate gene transcription.  The functional contributions of many histone acetyltransferases (HATs) to gene expression and their relationships with each other remain largely undefined.  Current models of gene activation suggest that acetylation of promoter nucleosomes serve to recruit factors containing protein domains with a specific affinity for binding acetylated histone tails.  Furthermore, evidence that bromodomain factors associate with a variety of chromatin remodeling and transcription factor complexes implies that bromodomain factors play an important role in linking histone acetylation with transcription factor recruitment.  The work presented in this thesis explores the relationship between histone acetylation, bromodomain factors, and the transcription complex, TFIID, and extends the study of these transcription components to a genome-wide scale.  Evidence from genome-wide studies in this thesis show that activation of TFIID-regulated genes requires hyper-acetylation of histone H4 tails by the HAT, Esa1, and that this relationship is exclusive to TFIID genes.  Association of the bromodomain subunit of TFIID, Bdf1, is dependent on H4 acetylation, and is an important step for the binding of TFIID to nucleosome-bound promoters.  Genome-wide evidence is also presented that contradicts previous models that the TAF1 subunit of yeast TFIID acetylates histones in vivo.  Furthermore, I find that only the Esa1 and Gcn5 HATs contribute substantially to global gene expression.  In summary, the findings resulting from these genome-wide studies support a model whereby acetylation of promoter nucleosomes occurs early in the activation process, and establishment of these histone acetylation patterns are crucial for the recruitment of TFIID through interaction of the bromodomain subunit, Bdf1, with acetylated histone tails. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4542], "author_name_tesi": "Durant, Melissa ", "last_name_ssi": "Durant", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Emine Koc", "Song Tan", "Naomi S Altman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Committee Chair", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Emine Koc, Committee Member", "Song Tan, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chromatin", "gene regulation", "transcription factor", "histone acetylation", "microarray"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND AGENCY\n\n", "id": "9273", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1870", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis empirically investigates the effects of agency problems\non endogenous managerial effort, firm performance, corporate\nstructure and industry-wide productivity.\n\n\nIn the second chapter, I develop an industrial evolution model with\nendogenous managerial effort and endogenous organizational form.

I examine patterns of fifth-grade achievement in reading, mathematics, and science, as well as achievement growth rates in reading and math from first through fifth grade.  The English skills of immigrants are fundamental to curriculum comprehension, student achievement, teacher ratings, and social integration in school, so in the interest of determining predictors of English acquisition, I also estimate the relationships between English ability measured at the start of kindergarten and demographic characteristics, including ethnicity, immigrant generation status, geographic residence, and family background.  Finally, drawing on the theoretical framework of \u201csegmented assimilation\u201d for explaining immigrant adaptation, I examine whether immigrant students\u2019 achievement demonstrates evidence of \u201cimmigrant optimism\u201d (Kao and Tienda 1995; Ogbu 1991).  I do so by estimating the relationship between generation status and achievement, controlling for correlates of duration of time in the United States, in particular, socioeconomic status and English ability.  I compare the achievement of first generation (born abroad), second generation (born in the U.S. to parents born abroad), and third-or-higher generation students.\n\tKindergarten English oral language skills are measured using the Oral Language Development Scale, an assessment specifically designed to measure the English proficiency of second-language English learners.  It was administered to all language-minority students in the sample, and thus a sizeable number of immigrant students.  Immigrant optimism is measured using a scale of parents\u2019 educational expectations for their children and teacher ratings of students\u2019 learning-related behaviors.  \n\t\u2018Segmented\u2019 adaptation theoretical frameworks propose that factors besides time spent in the United States are more proximal to educational outcomes, and accordingly, I find that first and second generation students demonstrate higher achievement than third-or-higher generation students but only when such factors are controlled.  In particular, I find that early English oral language ability is directly related to achievement in reading, math, and science.  It mediates the relationship between generation status and fifth-grade achievement, controlling for ethnicity and family background characteristics.  Linear growth models demonstrate that first generation students have higher growth rates in reading, while second generation students have higher growth rates in math than third-or-higher generation students.  Further, first and second generation students score higher on the immigrant optimism scale than third-or-higher generation students.  Differential achievement among ethnic groups are also evident even when controlling for generation status and its correlates.  I suggest that these findings provide strong support for both the segmented assimilation and the \u201cimmigrant optimism\u201d hypotheses. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5131], "author_name_tesi": "Durham, Rachel E", "last_name_ssi": "Durham", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George Farkas", "Duane Francis Alwin", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa", "Leif Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George Farkas, Committee Chair", "Duane Francis Alwin, Committee Member", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Immigrant children", "education", "english", "oral language", "generation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Heartwood: Pre-design towards the conscientious preservation, renovation, or re-use of the Hall log house.", "id": "28820", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12474", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Log structures across the country embody a unique craft and individuality that few architecture typologies can capture.
