The study examined how Cypriot elementary teachers use computers, and the factors that influence computer integration in their classroom practices. To address the research questions that guided the study, an evaluative case study design was applied. It employed a mixed method approach through the usage of structured questionnaires and semi-structured, open-ended interviews as the major methods of data collection. The value of the proposed study lies in its potential to help policymakers, educators, and stakeholders that have the power to take decisions and design policies, in gaining understanding on how computers are used in the classroom, and the factors that influence their use. \nThe results of the quantitative analysis indicated that while Cypriot teachers use computers rather extensively for their own purposes, they use them less frequently in their classes.  Regression analysis revealed that teachers\u2019 education, school climate, teachers\u2019 professional behavior, and teachers\u2019 attitudes towards the use of computers in education, were significant predictors for classroom computer use. \nThe results of the qualitative analysis summarize the factors that influence teachers in applying computers in their classroom practices. A general uniformity across the three categories of teachers revealed, in terms of the factors that function as barriers in applying computers in the classrooms. The factors can be summarized as follows: lack of resources; tyranny of the curriculum; incomplete and inadequate professional development training; lack of guidance, support, and incentives from the officials, and other factors, including technical problems, students\u2019 computer literacy level, etc. Along the same lines, a general uniformity across the three categories of teachers revealed in terms of the factors that facilitated them in applying computers. These factors are summarized as follows: teachers\u2019 computer literacy; teachers\u2019 education beyond bachelor in fields related to computer technology; professional development training organized by the Ministry; their attitudes about computers; and last but not least their instructional philosophies. \nAt the end, the study provides a discussion of the results, implications for policymakers and educators, as well as questions for further study.

We show that there are at most n-1 mutually strongly d-orthogonal hypercubes of dimension d and order n. Furthermore, we modify d-orthogonality to provide a bound on the number of hypercubes of dimension d and order n which are orthogonal k<d at a time.

Experimental setup for this study involved the addition of MnCl2\u22194H2O solid to a basic (pH 9 - 10.25) aqueous solution to produce an initial MnII concentration ranging 1 \u2013 100 mM. We apply a method of in situ pH and pE analysis to study the major reactions occurring during Mn oxidation. The experimental system is not run under equilibrium conditions. pH is neither titrated nor buffered, where doing so would interfere with the pH and pE of the solution. This type of analysis has not been previously performed. Calculation of an experimental rate constant of the system confirmed that changes in pE/pH slope of the solution reflected changes in the rate of the reaction. Changes in rate of reaction are due to alteration of the major reaction taking place.\nFrom solution chemistry, two major reaction stages were noted. Stage 1 can be further broken down into stages 1A and 1B, with 1A lasting one minute and consisted of the MnII hydration reaction to Mn(OH)2. Stage 1B continued with Mn hydration as well as the slower 1 electron oxidation Mn(OH)2 to Mn(OH)3. Both manganese hydroxides are amorphous phases, confirmed by both XRD and elemental analysis. However with increasing extent of reaction, the crystallinity of the solid increased. Since rate of reaction decreases with decreasing pH, and Mn hydration is fast, the expected transformation pathway for the production of observed groutite, feitknechtite and hausmannite is by oxidation of amorphous phases Mn(OH)2 to Mn(OH)3, and transformation to crystalline phases. Specifically rate of production of feitknechtite is slightly fast compared to groutite, but groutite is metastable and its rate of transformation to hausmannite is faster than its rate formation. Comparatively, the transformation of feitknechtite to\niv\nhausmannite is slower, therefore feitknechtite transformation primarily dictates the rate of reaction.\n[OH-] was found to be second order with respect to the rate of Mn oxidation, which is in accordance with the rate law for Mn oxidation given by Stumm and Morgan, 1996: -d[MnII(aq)]/dt = k1 [MnII(aq)][OH-(aq)]2[O2 (aq)] + k2[MnII(aq)][MnOx (s)][OH-(aq)]2[O2 (aq)]. However, experimental MnII(aq) concentration data over time, gathered from this study revealed [MnII] to be second order with respect to rate of reaction, which countered Stumm and Morgan, (1996). [OH-] was noted to be the major contributor to the Mn oxidation. From this, an initial approximation of the rate constant was calculated as Mn oxidation reaction to be pseudo-second order with respect to [OH-], written as \u2013d[MnII]/dt = kOH[O2][OH-]2 . kOH was then calculated and used to iteratively solve for the apparent rate constant for the overall rate equation, kapp = [MnII]2[O2][OH-]2. kapp for the oxidation of Mn was determined to be 6.2*1015 M-4 Hr-1. Complete comparison to the Stumm and Morgan, (1996) equation was not possible as BET surface area studies were not performed during this study. However, [MnII] over the course of the experiments was never reduced more than by 33%, suggesting Mn underwent autocatalytic oxidation over the course of the experiment.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10397], "author_name_tesi": "Ethier Colon, William Camilo", "last_name_ssi": "Ethier Colon", "middle_name_ssi": "Camilo", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hiroshi Ohmoto"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hiroshi Ohmoto, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["kinetics", "manganese oxidation", "rate equation", "feitknechtite", "groutite", "hausmannite", "pH", "pE"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Role of Psychosocial Stress in the Etiology of Exercise-Associated Menstrual Disturbances", "id": "14750cve5047", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14750", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\nBackground: Low energy availability and psychosocial stress have been shown to suppress reproductive function in mammals independently and in combination.  The unique contributions of psychosocial stress on the severity of exercise associated menstrual dysfunction have not been identified and there are few prospective studies that demonstrate such effects. \nObjectives: To determine the contribution of psychosocial stress to the induction of menstrual disturbances in response to a diet and exercise program that induced modest weight loss. We tested the hypothesis that increases in psychosocial stress were associated with the induction of menstrual disturbances during the original intervention. \nDesign: A secondary analysis was performed on data collected during a prior randomized controlled trial designed to assess the impact of three months of low (8 \u00b1 2%), moderate (22 \u00b1 3%), or high (42 \u00b1 3%) levels of an energy deficit created through varying combinations of controlled caloric restriction and supervised exercise on menstrual function in ovulatory, sedentary women.  We tested the hypothesis that increases in psychosocial stress were associated with the induction of menstrual disturbances during the original intervention. \nMethods: In the original trial, 36 women (age 18-24 yrs, BMI 21-29 kg/m2) were studied during a Baseline menstrual cycle followed by three successive menstrual cycles during which they exercised 5 d/wk, 50-85% VO2max for 20-75 min and all food was provided to participants according to study group assignment.  Metabolic and anthropometric measures were repeated throughout the intervention.  Menstrual disturbances (luteal cycle defects, oligomenorrhea, and anovulation) were detected using daily measures of urinary estrone-1-glucuronide (E1G), pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG), mid-cycle luteinizing hormone (LH) and menstrual calendars. Perceived stress was measured every two weeks with the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, 1983).  For the secondary analysis, logistic regression and chi-square analyses were performed to test the association between perceived stress and menstrual disturbances induced during the intervention.  For some analyses, participants were divided into tertiles based on their change in perceived stress across the intervention: Low Stress -12.5 to 0.5 (n = 13), Moderate Stress 1.0 to 4.5 (n = 11), and High Stress 5.0 to 36.5 (n = 12). ANOVA was used to detect group differences in reproductive hormone secretion and other measures.  Baseline anthropometrics, age, aerobic fitness, scores for depression and eating attitudes, and reproductive factors were investigated as possible contributors to the change in perceived stress. \nResults: The intervention caused moderate weight loss (-2.57 \u00b1 0.35 kg) and increases in aerobic fitness (p < 0.01).  The change in perceived stress was a significant predictor of anovulatory cycles during the intervention such that each unit increase in change in perceived stress was associated with a 23% increase (odds ratio 1.23, 1.03 - 1.47, 95% CI) in the odds of an anovulatory cycle occurring during the intervention (p = 0.021).  Changes in perceived stress were associated with Baseline luteal phase PdG AUC (r = -0.39, p = 0.02) and the change in BMI (r = 0.42, p = 0.01) such that higher Baseline PdG concentrations and greater reductions in BMI were associated with smaller increases in perceived stress. \nConclusions: The study suggests that the severity of menstrual disturbances in the context of energy deficiency is related to increased psychosocial stress.  Moreover, susceptibility to increases in psychosocial stress and thus more severe menstrual disturbances may be associated with suppressed baseline luteal phase progesterone and less than expected declines in BMI in untrained women who participate in programs with the goal of improving fitness and losing weight.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16065], "author_name_tesi": "Etter, Clara V", "last_name_ssi": "Etter", "middle_name_ssi": "V", "first_name_ssi": "Clara", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy Williams", "Mary Jane De Souza", "Lorah D Dorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy Williams, Thesis Advisor", "Mary Jane De Souza, Committee Member", "Lorah D Dorn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy deficiency", "psychosocial stress", "anovulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Lightning Climatology of the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States", "id": "14196", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7333", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lightning climatology over the Northeastern United States and Mid-Atlantic United States is examined from United States Precision Lightning Network observations because studying lightning climatology is important for discovering new physical trends and verifying existing patterns.  Negative lightning cloud-to-ground stroke observations from January 2005 to April 2009 are used in this study.  Two statistics are calculated from the observations: flash density and average peak negative current.  Flash density is compiled and calculated over the entire time period along with hourly, six-hourly, seasonally, monthly, and yearly time periods.  These time partitions extend those given in two lightning climatology papers based on National Lightning Detection Network data.  Within equivalent time partitions, the results of this thesis compare well with the two lightning climatology papers.\nFlash density is decreased by the Appalachian mountain chain, and it is enhanced by mesoscale convective system training over the Midwestern states, by the Gulf Stream, and by some urban centers. Hourly flash density reveals a pattern of eastward mesoscale convective system propagation over the Midwest and Ohio valley along with a sea-breeze-enhanced flash density maximum over the South Carolina piedmont and a land-breeze-enhanced maximum over the Gulf Stream that varies with diurnal cycle.  Summer flash counts dominate the flash counts for the year with both mesoscale convective systems and pulse convection contributing to large numbers of strokes during the summer months.\nAverage current over all time periods exhibit a minimum over the Appalachian mountain chain.  In contrast, the edges of the reliable data range contain inflated average current values owing to low flash counts.  Many time periods also contain a large number of bins with inflated average current values owing to low flash counts in the respective bins, and so time periods partitions for average current are not considered. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7304], "author_name_tesi": "Etters, Kyle Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Etters", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hampton Nelson Shirer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hampton Nelson Shirer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["lightning", "lightning climatology", "USPLN", "United States Precision Lightning Network", "flash density", "average current"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "HOW IDEALIZED AMERICAN ENGLISH NORMS ARE CREATED AND REINFORCED IN ENGLISH LESSONS ON TELEVISION: A DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF TWO POPULAR ENGLISH LANGUAGE TV SHOWS IN KOREA\n", "id": "6161", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3162", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to uncover the underlying philosophies and ideologies with reference to English language teaching and learning in Korean society\u2014especially to examine how these ideologies unfold at the level of instructional language television programs.

Frozen ground beef (GB, 1000 g per vendor) and longissimus lumborum steaks (LL, 4 per vendor) were purchased from online grass-fed beef vendors (n=15) in the United States and shipped to the Penn State Meats Laboratory via air freight.  Only beef from vendors willing to provide animal age, breed type (bos taurus), and postmortem aging information (14-21 d) supplied beef for this study.\nSample cost per kg and shipping container dimensions were recorded, and samples were stored at -20\u00b0C until all samples were collected.  The GB and LL steaks were thawed overnight at 2\u00b0C. The GB for use in microbiological profiling was separated and stored at -20\u00b0C until microbiological analysis.  The GB patties (113.4 g) were made with a hand mold.  Instrumental color (L*, a*, b*) was measured after GB patties and LL steaks bloomed for 0, 30, and 60 min at 22\u00b12\u00b0C.

I offer a textual reading of Trollope\u2019s short story \u201cA Ride across Palestine\u201d to demonstrate how anxiety about the empire surfaces when Trollope relinquishes his usual narrative voice and uses a more risky first person narrator. Chapter Two compares and contrasts what were in Trollope\u2019s opinion his best and worst writings.

Starches may differ with respect to both digestion rate and digestion extent in the small intestine.  The digestion extent of a starch describes resistant starch (RS).  The digestion rate of starch may be related to its glycemic index.  Both resistant starch (RS) and glycemic index are of nutritional importance.  While a number of RS-containing ingredients are commercially available today, there appear to be no starch products designed with the goal of reducing the rate of digestion of the non-RS portion.  In order to manipulate the digestion rate of starches, the digestion rates have to be quantified.  No method has been published to quantify the digestion rates of starch.  \n\tCurrent methods to enhance the RS content of starch use the structures inherent to granules as templates for development of new structures.  Formation of new structures is limited by the structures used as templates. There is currently no practical method to disperse HAMS which is necessary to overcome constrains due to inherent structure in order to then manipulate the enzyme susceptibility in new ways. \nThe overall goal of this project was to use precipitation of sodium hydroxide dispersed starch to produce non-granular starch material with a range of enzyme susceptibilities, and to relate enzyme susceptibility to physical structure.\nStarch was precpitated at different temperatures (0, 25, 50\u00baC) and starch concentrations (0.5%, 1.0%) in order to examine the effect of precipitation conditions on enzyme susceptibility.  Starch was precipitated using either ethanol and ammonium sulfate.  Mixtures of isolated linear and branched fractions were precipitates to test the effect of branched material on enzyme susceptibility.  Aspects of physical structure such as morphology, helicity and crystallinity were analyzed using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) , wide-angle x-ray diffraction (WXRD), and solid-state 13C CP/MAS NMR.\nThe official method for in vitro RS determination (AOAC 2002.02, AACC 32-40) was modified to allow analysis of small samples for determination of RS and digestion timecourse.  Digestion timecourse analysis indicated the presence of two separate substrates for the two components of digestion.  The rate constants (k1, k2) for the two component were calculated as the slopes of linear regression lines of the ln % non-digested starch (NDS) versus time plots using Origin software (Version 7.5; Originlab, Massachusetts, USA).\nThe precipitation temperatures (0\u00baC, 25\u00baC, 50\u00baC) and starch concentrations (0.5%, 1.0%) tested did not have an important effect on enzyme susceptibility of the precipitates.  The differences in the temperatures and concentrations tested might not have been large enough to have a significant effect on the structure and enzyme susceptibility of the precipitates. \nThe choice of precipitant (ethanol, ammonium sulfate) had a major effect on enzyme susceptibility of precipitates.  Precipitates prepared with ethanol had lower RS values (~24% RS) and higher proportions of substrate 1 than precipitates prepared with ammonium sulfate (~39% RS) at the same precipitation temperature and starch concentration.  As demonstrated by the k1 values, the susceptibility of substrate 1 was also higher for the ethanol precipitates.\n The starch composition also had a major effect on the enzyme susceptibility of the precipitates.  The precipitates prepared from linear fraction had the highest RS values (54% for ammonium sulfate, 29% for ethanol) and lowest proportion of substrate 1 (29%  for ammonium sulfate precipitate, 69% for ethanol precipitate), but the relationship between linear proportion and enzyme susceptibility was found to be complicated.  \nCrystallinity alone could not explain the enzyme susceptibility of whole starch precipitates.  The difference in enzyme susceptibility might be explained by a combination of crystallinity, helicity and morphology.  Ethanol precipitates had crystalline (V-type) and non-crystalline single helices compared to the double helices (B-type) of the ammonium sulfate precipitates.  The dry ethanol precipitates were composed of smaller and more porous particles than the ammonium sulfate precipitates.  The change of single helical to double helical conformation upon re-hydration as well as the more porous morphology of the ethanol precipitates might explain the higher enzyme susceptibility of substrate 1. \nThe proportion of crystallinity could also not explain differences in enzyme susceptibility for precipitates prepared from mixtures of linear and branched fractions.  Except for the amorphous precipitate prepared from the branched fraction with ethanol, no change in the proportion of crystallinity was observed for different starch compositions.  Co-crystallization of amylopectin likely contributes to the crystallinity in the precipitates.  Both linear and branched fractions seem to be involved in the development of crystallinity and helicity in the samples. Proportion of helices and the stability of helices may both be influenced by the presence of linear material and may help explain the differences in enzyme susceptibility.  \n   \n\t \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [489], "author_name_tesi": "Evans, Annette ", "last_name_ssi": "Evans", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Annette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald B Thompson", "James Patrick Runt", "Koushik Seetheraman", "John Coupland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald B Thompson, Committee Chair", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Koushik Seetheraman, Committee Member", "John Coupland, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["resistant starch", "digestion rate", "physical structure. non-granular starch", "enzyme susceptibility"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Nozzle Erosion Characterization and Minimization for High-Pressure Rocket Motor Applications\n", "id": "10610", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "689", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding of the processes that cause nozzle throat erosion and developing methods for mitigation of erosion rate can allow higher operating pressures for advanced rocket motors.  However, erosion of the nozzle throat region, which is a strong function of operating pressure, must be controlled to realize the performance gains of higher operating pressures.  The objective of this work was the study the nozzle erosion rates at a broad range of pressures from 7 to 34.5 MPa (1,000 to 5,000 psia) using two different rocket motors.  The first is an instrumented solid-propellant motor (ISPM), which uses two baseline solid propellants; one is a non-metallized propellant called Propellant S and the other is a metallized propellant called Propellant M.  The second test rig is a non-metallized solid-propellant rocket motor simulator (RMS).  The RMS is a gas rocket with the ability to vary the combustion-product species composition by systematically varying the flow rates of gaseous reactants.  Several reactant mixtures were utilized in the study to determine the relative importance of different oxidizing species (such as H2O, OH, and CO2).  Both test rigs are equipped with a windowed nozzle section for real-time X-ray radiography diagnostics of the instantaneous throat variations for deducing the instantaneous erosion rates.  The nozzle test section for both motors can also incorporate a nozzle boundary-layer control system (NBLCS) as a means of nozzle erosion mitigation.  The effectiveness of the NBLCS at preventing nozzle throat erosion was demonstrated for both the RMS and the ISPM motors at chamber pressures up to 34 MPa (4930 psia).  All tests conducted with the NBLCS showed signs of coning of the propellant surface, leading to increased mass burning rate and resultant chamber pressure.  \nTwo correlations were developed for the nozzle erosion rates from solid propellant testing, one for metallized propellant and one for non-metallized propellants.  The non-metallized propellant correlation also incorporates the RMS data, accounting for swirling flow of the products in the RMS combustor.  These correlations are useful for rocket nozzle designs.  The correlation for non-metallized propellant and RMS firings was developed in terms of the effective oxidizer mass fraction and effective Reynolds number.  The results calculated from this correlation were compared with measured erosion rate data within \u00b115% or 0.05 mm/s (2 mils/s).  For metallized propellant, the nozzle erosion rate was found to be relatively independent of the concentration of oxidizing species due to the diffusion-controlled process and the partial surface coverage by the liquid Al/Al2O3 layer.  The nozzle erosion rate was also found to be lower than those of non-metallized propellant cases.  Agreement between predicted and measured erosion rates was found to be within \u00b120% or 0.04 mm/s (2 mils/s).  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [684], "author_name_tesi": "Evans, Brian ", "last_name_ssi": "Evans", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth K Kuo", "Kenneth K Kuo", "Francesco Costanzo", "Vigor Yang", "Richard A Yetter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth K Kuo, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth K Kuo, Committee Chair", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Member", "Vigor Yang, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Carbon/Carbon Composites", "Erosion Mitigation", "Solid Propellant", "Nozzle Erosion", "Graphite", "Rocket Motor Simulator"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Piecewise-Linear Mechano-Hydraulic Models of Intracranial Pressure Dynamics", "id": "12558dje5104", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12558", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is an extremely dangerous condition for patients who are suffering from traumatic brain injury, hydrocephalus, or related neurological disorders. To make informed decisions when treating patients, clinicians must understand how the body regulates ICP. Mathematical models can aid in this task. In addition to making quantitative predictions, accurate mathematical models can also describe the transition between different qualitative behaviors of ICP. This is crucial, because, for instance, in a pathological case known as Lundberg A-Waves, ICP oscillates between high and low pressures over a long period. This is in contrast to a healthy state, where ICP remains mostly constant with respect to time.\n\nIn this thesis, we develop mathematical models of ICP dynamics with the goal of explaining how a healthy state of constant ICP can transition to the oscillatory case of Lundberg A-Waves. These low-dimensional models are built by coupling a lumped mechanical system with a hydraulic system, and applying the first-principles of the balance of mass and the balance of linear momentum to obtain the governing equations. \n\n\nThe first of these models is a single-compartment model of the coupled mechanics and hydraulics of the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the surrounding brain tissue. The governing equations are two coupled linear ordinary differential equations.  Once we develop a nondimensional form of the governing equations, we postulate several different piecewise laws for the CSF formation rate that depend on either pressure or volume. Then, we examine the resulting piecewise-linear dynamical systems for the existence of a limit cycle. To do so, we look for fixed points in an analytic expression of the Poincar\\'{e} map, which we construct as a composition of other maps  represented as parametric curves. Once we determine which of these postulated CSF formation laws result in model equations that can exhibit limit cycles, we draw possible clinical conclusions based on this information. \n\nThe second model is a dual-compartment model that couples the mechanics and hydraulics of the ventricular CSF, arterial blood, and brain tissue. The governing equations are four coupled linear ordinary differential equations. We numerically examine the stability characteristics of this linear system, once we specify values for the model parameters. In addition, we show that the steady-state ICP that the model predicts for these values agrees well with what is observed clinically. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13716], "author_name_tesi": "Evans, Davis James", "last_name_ssi": "Evans", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Davis", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Paul Cusumano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Paul Cusumano, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["intracranial pressure", "dynamics", "dynamical systems", "brain", "mathematical model", "icp", "piecewise", "limit cycle", "bifurcation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Two Projects in Theoretical Neuroscience: A Convolution-based Metric for Neural Membrane Potentials and a Combinatorial Connectionist Semantic Network Method", "id": "25060", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10918", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this work, I present two projects that both contribute to the aim of discovering how intelligence manifests in the brain.\n\nThe first project is a method for analyzing recorded neural signals, which takes the form of a convolution-based metric on neural membrane potential recordings.

Like van Rossum\u2019s (2001) metric for spike trains, the metric is based on a convolution operation that it performs on the input data. The kernel used for the convolution is carefully chosen such that it produces a desirable frequency space response and, unlike van Rossum\u2019s kernel, causes the metric to be first order both in differences between nearby spike times and in differences between same-time membrane potential values: an important trait.\n\nThe second project is a combinatorial syntax method for connectionist semantic network encoding. Combinatorial syntax has been a point on which those who support a symbol- processing view of intelligent processing and those who favor a connectionist view have had difficulty seeing eye-to-eye. Symbol-processing theorists have persuasively argued that combinatorial syntax is necessary for certain intelligent mental operations, such as reason- ing by analogy. Connectionists have focused on the versatility and adaptability offered by self-organizing networks of simple processing units. With this project, I show that there is a way to reconcile the two perspectives and to ascribe a combinatorial syntax to a connectionist network. The critical principle is to interpret nodes, or units, in the connectionist network as bound integrations of the interpretations for nodes that they share links with.

However, there is little known about how patients recognize and interpret symptoms of the disease. Two such phenomena lacking adequate attention are somatic awareness and self-symptom recognition. In addition, these concepts have not been studied in relation to the duration of time a patient has been diagnosed with HF.\n\nMethods: The mixed methods design that guided this study was the concurrent triangulation design. Using this design, a prospective cross-sectional survey design was conducted to understand if a difference exists in somatic awareness between newly-diagnosed and chronic stage D HF patients. The newly-diagnosed group included patients with Stage D HF who had been diagnosed with HF for two years or less. The chronic HF group included patients diagnosed with HF for longer than two years. Somatic awareness was measured using the HF Somatic Perception Scale, v. 3, an 18- item Likert scale. In addition, explorative qualitative descriptive interviews were conducted to better understand self-symptom recognition in this sample. All qualitative data were coded using the items from the HF Somatic Perception Scale. Each \u201cyes\u201d answer to the items on the HF Somatic Perception Scale was analyzed to determine whether the participant perceived the symptom to be related to HF.  \n\nResults: The sample included newly-diagnosed Stage D HF patients (n=9) and chronic HF patients (n=11). Analysis indicated a difference between the newly-diagnosed and chronic groups, t(18) = -2.45, p = 0.03. The chronic group had a higher mean somatic awareness score, 28.82, compared to the newly-diagnosed group, 12.33. In addition, length of time from diagnosis was significantly correlated with the HF Somatic Perception total score (rs = 0.53, p = 0.02). Qualitative analysis found that none of the participants recognized their HF symptoms as being a result of HF.\n\nConclusions: While results showed higher somatic awareness scores for the chronic group than for the newly-diagnosed group, it is unclear whether the difference is related to length-of-time of living with HF or to other variables, including co-morbidities with symptoms similar to HF. However, while participants did not attribute their symptoms to HF, it is not possible to conclude that they had poor self-symptom recognition; instead, they may have been accurate in relating their symptoms to another co-morbid condition. Implications from this research nevertheless include that Stage D HF patients may not recognize symptoms of HF, which is a concern because of the potential resulting delay in appropriate treatment. It follows that more effective education for advanced HF patients is needed to help them understand HF symptoms and so to participate more effectively in their treatment, thus potentially improving patient outcomes and decreasing the economic burden of HF overall. Future longitudinal research needs to be conducted on a larger sample to examine somatic awareness and self-symptom recognition before definitive conclusions can be reached. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11655], "author_name_tesi": "Evans, Michael Morgan", "last_name_ssi": "Evans", "middle_name_ssi": "Morgan", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith E Hupcey", "Judith E Hupcey", "Lisa Ann Kitko", "Paula F Milone Nuzzo", "Patricia M Hinchey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith E Hupcey, Dissertation Advisor", "Judith E Hupcey, Committee Chair", "Lisa Ann Kitko, Committee Member", "Paula F Milone Nuzzo, Committee Member", "Patricia M Hinchey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["heart failure", "somatic awareness", "self-symptom recognition"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Low-wavenumber turbulent boundary layer wall-pressure measurements from vibration data over smooth and rough surfaces in pipe flow\n", "id": "12344", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4732", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The vibration response of a thin cylindrical shell excited by fully-developed turbulent pipe flow is measured and used to extract the fluctuating pressure levels generated by the boundary layer.

Maintaining a healthy population of white-tailed deer is important to states in the Northeast for numerous recreational and economic reasons. The Midwest documented a decline in hunter participation and hunter-associated revenue following detection of CWD, and the presence of CWD in the Northeast could have a similar impact on local economies and wildlife management efforts. Considering CWD is a new and emerging disease in the Northeast, I investigated sampling strategies by state, ecology of deer, and environmental drivers of disease to better understand CWD in the region.\nI surveyed 14 state agencies responsible for CWD surveillance in the Northeast to identify how surveillance efforts have changed following detection of CWD in the region. Annual surveillance efforts throughout the region initially exceeded 15,000 deer per year. Loss of federal funding in 2012, however, led to a drastic reduction in these efforts (<9,000 deer per year), with Pennsylvania alone accounting for ~4,000 samples. This reduction in sampling requires states to allocate resources into areas that are at greatest risk for CWD to maximize efficiency of these limited resources. Literature pertaining to state responses to CWD had been nonexistent for the Northeast and these surveys were the initial effort for collaboration between adjacent states that had detected CWD. I compiled data that have been shown to influence movements of deer and epidemiology of CWD in other regions. This was particularly important because all previous analyses had been performed in regions with landscapes that were dominated by agriculture or rangeland in contrast to the predominantly forested landscape of the Northeast.\nSpatial processes, including spread of disease, rely on the scale of deer movement (e.g., home range), and this scale can be related to landscape. Therefore, I estimated size of home range in relation to landscape for 45 white-tailed deer in Pennsylvania to identify the spatial scale that described movements and home range of deer in the region. I documented that size of home range was related to connectivity of forest, with contiguous forest associated with expansive size of home range. In areas with high levels of fragmentation or less contiguous forest, home ranges were small (e.g., 0.63 km2 for females) likely because deer were able to fulfill daily requirements for forage intake over a smaller area. Differences in size of home range by landscape likely would result in differences in the distribution of disease due to increased contact rates among matriarchal groups of deer that occupy these fragmented landscapes. Conversely, deer that occupy expansive tracts of contiguous forest may establish home ranges of larger size (e.g., 2.65 km2 for females) due to foraging and breeding requirements and also may introduce disease into new areas. These concepts suggest that surveillance in highly fragmented areas should be concentrated locally to reflect less expansive home ranges that may inhibit expansive spread of disease, whereas surveillance in contiguously forested areas should be applied to a broad scale to reflect expansive home ranges that may allow disease to spread into new areas.\nTo further understand these concepts, I incorporated landscape into my analysis of CWD by linking location-based surveillance data to environmental and spatial factors that could influence the distribution of CWD in Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. I identified a clustering of CWD in an area where forested habitat was sparse and open (e.g., agricultural) and developed (e.g., suburban) habitats were more prominent. I identified areas of elevated risk that included a potential corridor east of the study area where spread of CWD may be expedited among several states. This corridor was at elevated risk because it was dominated by an anthropogenic landscape where forests were even less prominent than in the core of the study area where CWD was most prevalent. These open and developed landscapes may promote contact between deer, and proactively sampling these areas may improve feasibility of containment efforts if CWD is detected.

In addition, snow cover insulates the underlying soil from temperature extremes.  Quantifying the spatial distribution and ablation patterns of seasonal snow is necessary to understand these dynamics.  Annual snowfall varies spatially ranging from 3 to 50 mm of snow water equivalent, with greater amounts occurring at the coast.  Despite receiving very little precipitation, significant amounts of snow can accumulate (via aeolian redistribution) in topographic lees at the valley bottoms, forming thousands of discontinuous patches (typically 1-100 m2 in area).  These patches have the potential to act as fertility islands, controlling the landscape distribution of microbial communities, and biogeochemical cycling.\n\nHigh resolution imagery acquired during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 austral summers was used to quantify the distribution of snow across Taylor and Wright Valleys.  An object-based classification was used to extract snow-covered area from the imagery.  Coupled with topographic parameters, unique distribution patterns were characterized for 5 regions within the neighboring valleys.  Time lapses of snow distribution during each season in each region provide insight into spatially characterizing the aerial ablation rates (change in area of landscape covered by snow) across the valleys.  The distribution of snow-covered area during the 2009-2010 austral summer is used as a baseline for seasonal comparison.  The surrounding regions of Lake Fryxell, Lake Hoare, Lake Bonney, Lake Brownworth, and Lake Vanda exhibited losses of snow-covered area of 9.61 km2 (-93%), 1.63 km2 (-72%), 1.07 km2 (-97%), 2.60 km2 (-82%), and 0.25 km2 (-96%) respectively, as measured from peak accumulation in October to mid-January during the 2009-2010 season.  Differences in aerial ablation rates within and across local regions suggest that both topographic variation and regional microclimates influence the ablation of seasonal snow cover.  Elevation has shown to be the strongest control over aerial ablation.  Fifteen 1 km2 plots (3 in each region) were selected to assess the prevalence of snow cover at smaller scales.  Results confirm that snow patches form in the same locations each year with some minor deviations observed.  Stable isotopes from snow patches also provide insights into temporal and spatial processes associated with ablation.  At the snow patch scale, neighboring patches often exhibit considerable differences in aerial ablation rates, presumably controlled by snow depth.  This highlights the importance of both the landscape and snow patch scales in assessing the effects of snow cover on biogeochemical cycling and microbial communities.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3121], "author_name_tesi": "Eveland, Jeffery Wayne", "last_name_ssi": "Eveland", "middle_name_ssi": "Wayne", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffery", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael N Gooseff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael N Gooseff, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["snow hydrology", "snow ecology", "remote sensing", "stable isotopes"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "AN ASSESSMENT OF POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT WITHIN 4-H PROGRAMS IN WARREN AND SUSSEX COUNTY, NEW JERSEY \n\n", "id": "11525", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4081", "abstract_tesi": "This study is about the PYD within Warren and Sussex county NJ 4-H programs.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4056], "author_name_tesi": "Everswick, Megan Erica", "last_name_ssi": "Everswick", "middle_name_ssi": "Erica", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Henry Bruening", "Thomas Henry Bruening"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Henry Bruening, Thesis Advisor", "Thomas Henry Bruening, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["4-H", "Life Skills", "PYD"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Investigations of Phopholipid Membrane Properties Using An Artificial Cell Model for Exocytosis and Membrane Disruption", "id": "7924", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1418", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Exocytosis is a fundamental cellular process that propagates neurochemical signals as well as delivers new lipid material to cellular membranes. Exocytosis exhibits various stages which include initial membrane fusion, fusion pore formation and membrane distention or incorporation. This thesis seeks to shed light on the later stages of the exocytotic mechanism following membrane fusion. The first chapter of this thesis gives a framework to interpret experimental results in the subsequent chapters. Properties of biomembranes along with exocytosis and electrochemical means of measuring exocytosis are discussed in Chapter 1. \nChapter 2 deals with a quantitative explanation of why and how much catechol escapes the membrane-electrode gap undetected, depending on vesicle size and the size of the detection electrode. The membrane-electrode interface in this model system is similar to a synapse, the liposome as the presynaptic terminal and the electrode acts as the postsynaptic side when it detects the released molecules. This allowed for predictions to be made about coulometric efficiency of amperometric detection in exocytosis in vitro from a variety of cell types. \nThe third chapter investigates the role of lipid headgroups in exocytosis.  Various headgroups are added to the soy polar extract and the release characteristics for each lipid additive. This study looks to understand the importance of lipid headgroup composition in the cell membrane from an exocytosis point of view. This study looks toward understanding microdomains in a purely lipidic sense, able to disregard the protein interactions that would be present in a cellular system.\nTo further characterize our lipid model system, in chapter 4 the lipid nanotube that connects the two liposomes for our exocytosis model is measured using steady state electrochemistry.  The nanotube has been a fundamental part of the liposome model as it approximates the fusion pore. By measuring the diameter, a better understanding of the forces exerted upon the membrane can be determined.\nChapter 5 contains the fabrication of a new microelectrode array that can be used to add spatial resolution to the excellent temporal resolution afforded by amperometry. This electrode array allows for the identification of \u201chot zones\u201d of exocytosis from a single cell. The characterization of the electrode shows the versatility of this method of detection.\n In order to further understand membrane dynamics, Chapter 6 investigates the membrane disruption by antibacterial polymers. Based on the antibacterial agents used to kill e-coli, multiple polymers were synthesized to access their relative potency.  Then the polymers were applied to the exterior of a giant unilamellar liposome to ascertain their effectiveness in rupturing the membrane.  This study gives insight into the relationship between membrane rupture and antibacterial activity.\nChapter 7 outlines future directions in modeling exocytosis.

Snow, a Mormon woman living in Utah; Sarah Winnemucca, a Northern Paiute woman from Nevada; Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton, a Californio woman married to a United States soldier; and Helen Hunt Jackson, an Anglo-American woman living in Colorado. By doing so, I aim to contribute to a small but growing body of scholarship theorizing rhetorics of space, and enrich our understanding of nineteenth-century rhetorical practices in America by considering such practices in the context of gender, race, religion, class\u2014and place.\nIn chapter two, I draw on Eliza R. Snow\u2019s published speeches in a contemporary newspaper, The Woman\u2019s Exponent, to demonstrate how Snow uses discourses about Utah space as a constitutive rhetoric for Mormon women, ultimately using idea of Utah as a shorthand for group identity. In chapter three, I argue that Paiute activist Sarah Winnemucca\u2019s rhetorical choices (in her public speeches, letters, and published autobiography) are influenced not only by her social position as an Indian woman, but by the expectations associated with the physical and cultural locations she occupies during her performances, including reservations, military forts, and lecture halls. In chapter four, I explore the ways Helen Hunt Jackson uses discourses of domestic, natural, and national spaces to extend her appeal for Indian reform in her novel Ramona. At the same time, I analyze how the ideologies associated with these discourses ultimately undercut her reform agenda. In chapter five, I describe how Mar\u00eda Amparo Ruiz de Burton intervenes in the perception of California spaces to challenge existing social hierarchies and reestablish the upper-class position of native Californios. The final chapter reflects on the different ways that space affects these women\u2019s rhetorical practices, sketches out a \u201cGrammar of Rhetorical Space\u201d that encompasses these different effects of space on rhetoric, and offers some scholarly and pedagogical implications of this research.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5242], "author_name_tesi": "Eves, Rosalyn Collings", "last_name_ssi": "Eves", "middle_name_ssi": "Collings", "first_name_ssi": "Rosalyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Howard Browne", "Hester Maureen Blum", "John L Selzer", "Cheryl Jean Glenn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Member", "Hester Maureen Blum, Committee Member", "John L Selzer, Committee Member", "Cheryl Jean Glenn, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["rhetorics of space", "spatial theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "FABRICATION OF RADIAL P-N GERMANIUM NANOWIRES FOR THERMOPHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATIONS\n\n", "id": "10145", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2503", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Interest in thermophotovoltaic systems began with Dr. Henry Kolm and Dr. Aigrain, doing research at MIT in the late 1950\u2019s and early 1960\u2019s.1  Since that time, research has focused for the most part on system components: the development for instance of the emitters, reflectors, recyclers, the thermophotovoltaic cell, and the filters.  Interest remains in improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of the photovoltaic module in a thermophotovoltaic system.  This research is focused on the fabrication of radial p-n junction germanium nanowires for thermophotovoltaic cells.  Germanium nanowire photovoltaic cells have potential advantages over other possible candidates: germanium has a bandgap suitable to the spectrum of emitters being developed, and germanium has a long history of fundamental and technological research.  Additionally, axially aligned, epitaxially grown nanowires allow for the vertical (axial) absorption of light, with radial carrier transport, potentially allowing for a higher tolerance for bulk recombination rate, due to the shorter carrier extraction lengths.\n\nThe research herein has focused on achieving two distinct goals: germanium nanowire core growth and p-type doping, and germanium thin film deposition and n-type doping.  Germanium nanowire growth has been performed with the goal of achieving p-type nanowire cores grown inside gold-seeded porous anodized-aluminum-oxide-on-glass substrates.  In order to extract correlations between growth process variables and structural properties for germanium nanowire core growths, germanium wafers were also used as a substrate.  Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used for structural characterization.  High quality epitaxial nanowire growth was obtained on germanium wafers, with some tapering due to simultaneous gas phase decomposition of germane.  The thin film deposited by the simultaneous gas phase decomposition was single crystal if germane only was flowing.  If a dopant source (diborane) is present, there is an increase in the rate of thin film deposition.  Tapering was found to increase substantially at diborane to germane flow ratios of greater than 10-4.  The n-type germanium thin film coating was deposited on sapphire for growth rate measurements and electrical characterization, and on germanium planar wafers and the same covered in epitaxial germanium nanowires for device measurements.  The film was characterized by four-point probe and Hall measurements, and high electron concentrations were obtained using phosphine to germane ratios greater than approximately 2.1 * 10-3.  This highly doped n-type germanium thin film, when coating single crystal nanowires, was clearly polycrystalline.\n\nP-n junctions were fabricated and characterized to determine the current-voltage characteristics.  N-type thin films deposited on planar p-type germanium wafers with or without germanium nanowires were measured.  Planar samples exhibited clear rectification and were compared to the diode equation with series resistance and ideality factor to extract diode performance measures.  Recombination, as manifest in the faster current turn-on from the thicker of two thin films, may limit the planar diode quality, placing limits on the thickness of the films.  The nanowire junctions were not rectifying.  Rectification might be strengthened by cleaning the nanowire surface by an oxidation-etch procedure performed on nanowires prior to thin film shell deposition.  Future research in epitaxial n-type thin film deposition on the nanowire core, or improving the doping character of the nanowire core, are likely to be among the most beneficial avenues for improving device performance.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2486], "author_name_tesi": "Evey, Jeffrey ", "last_name_ssi": "Evey", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Joan Marie Redwing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Thesis Advisor", "Joan Marie Redwing, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["germanium", "photovoltaic", "thermophotovoltaic", "template", "porous", "gold-seeded", "nanowire", "metalorganic", "chemical vapor deposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Modeling the optical properties of metal nanoparticles and metal-molecule systems", "id": "11220", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1909", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we address two problems pertaining to  light interacting with metal nanoparticles and metal-molecule systems.

We are able to extract the dielectric functions successfully but we are unable to find any meaningful relationship between the fitted dielectric functions parameters for both alloy systems considered.  In the second project, we calculate the the polarizabilities  and hence absorption cross sections of metals and  metal-molecule nanoparticles using the polarizabilty interaction model. We investigate the effect of shape and size on the absorption cross sections of silver (Ag) clusters of different motifs i.e icosahedra, ino decahedra, Marks decahedra and cuboctahedra. We show that the absorption cross sections increase with size for all the motifs. However the peak positions of the icosahedra and cuboctahedra clusters are the same while that of the ino and Marks decahedra blue shift with increase in size. We also investigate how the arrangement of adsorbed molecules on a cluster as well as the shape of the cluster affects the plasmon peak or absorption cross section evolution of the cluster. We find that the arrangement of the adsorbed molecules affects the way the plasmon peak evolves even though both types of arrangements considered converged to the same plasmon peak when the cluster was completely covered with molecules. We also show that the shape of the cluster influences the intermediate cluster-molecules plasmon peaks  as they evolve.

Their solution was an ideology that combined an anti-radicalism that rejected the extremes of both the left and the right, with cultural modernism, which eventually became a component of Cold War liberal ideology during the 1950s and the early 1960s.  They expressed their views through literary criticism, historiography, and social science with a qualitative emphasis.  These intellectuals were originally part of the anti-Stalinist left, and they were especially associated with the journal Partisan Review.

The lack of treatment for \u201cworried well\u201d patients with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (a premalignant condition) combined with issues of recurrence and hormone resistance present significant obstacles to prostate cancer survivorship.  The long latency of prostate cancer provides opportunity to intervene with mechanistically-based agents at various stages of disease progression.  A number of signaling cascades have been shown to play important roles in prostate cancer development and progression, including the androgen receptor, PI3K/Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways.  Crosstalk between the androgen receptor and Akt pathways is thought to contribute to progression and hormone refractory disease.  Studies have also implicated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in the progression of prostate cancer and its transition to androgen independence, suggesting mTOR as a potential target for new therapies. Selenium, an essential nutrient and known antioxidant, has been shown in epidemiologic and preclinical studies to be protective against prostate cancer.  However, clinical intervention trials with selenium have thus far had contradictory outcomes and the anti-cancer mechanisms of selenium compounds are not well understood.  Studies consistently show that dose and form are critical factors in the actions of selenium compounds.  In the present investigation we compare the effects of two structurally distinct organoselenium compounds naturally occurring selenomethionine (SM) and synthetic 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)selenocyanate (p-XSC) on cell growth, apoptosis, and signaling in androgen responsive (AR) and androgen independent (AI) human prostate cancer cells.  We have found that, in contrast to SM, p-XSC dose-dependently inhibits viability, induces apoptosis, and modulates critical signaling molecules in both AR and AI cells.  p-XSC effectively inhibits androgen receptor expression and transcriptional activity, Akt phosphorylation, and Akt-specific phosphorylation of the androgen receptor.  We also show that p-XSC preferentially inhibits mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling in AI cells, a novel potential target for selenium in prostate cancer.  Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the combination of p-XSC with rapamycin, which primarily targets mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), may be a superior approach to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth than either agent alone.  Drug combination strategies can offer a number of advantages to single-agent therapies including the enhancement of efficacy, the reduction of dose and toxicity, and the management of drug resistance.   Our data show that inhibition of AI cell viability and mTOR signaling is significantly enhanced by combining p-XSC and rapamycin, compared with each agent individually.  We propose that these agents achieve this effect, in part, by targeting the two distinct arms of the mTOR signaling cascade.  The ability of p-XSC to inhibit multiple signaling pathways including mTORC2, a potentially critical target in cancer treatment, is a significant finding in support of its use as a chemotherapeutic tool against prostate cancer.  This data, together with the finding that rapamycin can enhance the anti-cancer effects of p-XSC in AI cells, provides rationale for continuing exploration of this and other organoselenium derivatives, alone or in combination, as a means for improving prostate cancer survivorship.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4604], "author_name_tesi": "Facompre, Nicole Danielle", "last_name_ssi": "Facompre", "middle_name_ssi": "Danielle", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karam E El Bayoumy", "Karam E El Bayoumy", "Raghu Sinha", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Thomas E Spratt", "Sergei A Grigoryev"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karam E El Bayoumy, Dissertation Advisor", "Karam E El Bayoumy, Committee Chair", "Raghu Sinha, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member", "Sergei A Grigoryev, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["androgen receptor", "selenium", "prostate cancer", "Akt"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "HOW ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE MARKETING OF SUSTAINABLE HOUSING  THE CASE OF AMERICA\u2019S SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING", "id": "14036szf128", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14036", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "What motivates people to invest in sustainable houses?

Challenges facing the retrofit of homes and adoption of energy conservation measures include the lack of trained auditors, the time investments required, the invasive nature of in-home audits, and the lack of resources to finance significant home upgrades. The National Energy Leadership Corps (NELC) is an education and research program designed to prepare students to engage homeowners in home energy assessments.

Previous experiments detailing the work done in annealing will be explained, as well as the material properties of the dilute magnetic semiconductor.  The dissertation will then deal with the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), an important tool in characterizing ferromagnetic materials.  MOKE can be used to determine the Curie temperature of (Ga,Mn)As, and the experimental set-up for this will be shown.  Once the case of generalized MOKE is explained, the dissertation will delve into a specific type of MOKE experiment, that of component-resolved MOKE.  Component-resolved MOKE is an elegant experiment that can be particularly useful for materials undergoing a phase transition in magnetic anisotropy.  It will be shown that tensile-strained (Ga,Mn)As undergoes such a transition, and the effect that annealing has on this transition will be demonstrated.  The dissertation will then discuss the origin of the exchange bias effect, and how it relates to (Ga,Mn)As.  Data will then be shown demonstrating that (Ga,Mn)As has been successfully exchange-biased, the first semiconductor to be done so.

However, performance improvements obtained by multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems can be severely limited by physical constraints such as antenna separation, which directly affects the random statistics with correlation. In this dissertation, we review various determining factors and their effects on a MIMO RF wireless system and apply the conclusions to other areas for modeling and optimization. \n\nUntil now, MIMO systems in communications have been restricted to wireless mediums. However, the basic tenets of MIMO transmission also apply to a general communication or imaging system. This is evident in copper cable Ethernet transmission, where the user has access to four parallel twisted-pair wires and the performance is limited by inter-channel-interference (ICI), not only inter-symbol-interference (ISI). These interferences are usually mitigated by employing single-input single-output (SISO) equalizers and interference cancellers. However, in a MIMO model, the cross-channel interferences carry useful information that can be salvaged by employing a MIMO equalizer/canceller, and thus contribute to signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) increment. We investigate the effectiveness of different MIMO equalization and cancellation techniques in such semi-static channels, and provide a comparison of SNR and bit-error-rate (BER). Signal constellation design for modulation and coding is also an important factor for achieving the theoretical capacity bounds, and these are presented for hypothetical systems supporting 10Gbps, 40Gbps and 100Gbps data rates.\n\nThe mathematical analysis for MIMO systems easily extends itself to other communication systems, such as free space optical (FSO) links. These communication links suffer from log-normal fading due to scintillation prevalent in distances longer than a hundred meters. Cloud and fog also impose barriers of attenuation in these channels. A simulation model is used in conjunction with scintillation characteristics to show the benefits of using multiple transmitters and receivers for FSO links. Furthermore, MIMO techniques are extended to indoor optical wireless communications in the infra-red wavelength range, which have the potential to provide data rates in the gigabits per second range. A MIMO modeling technique is presented here, which gives an accurate representation of the channel, and MIMO optimization techniques can be employed which use the available channel resources judiciously to improve data rate and error performances.\n\nActive optical imaging is a parallel to communication systems, with spatial information added on to the temporal information, where the latter is the only concern in communications. The mathematics behind MIMO has the flexibility to incorporate multiple variables, in this case space and time, easily into analysis and simulation. Active optical imaging by means of laser is a well-known technology used by remote sensing and surveillance communities; however, these suffer tremendously in the presence of scattering particles and turbulence. Scintillation is the greatest obstacle in imaging cases, and it causes the ideal point spread function (PSF) to broaden and distort or blur the received image. MIMO techniques, comparable to MIMO equalization for communication systems, can be applied to blindly deconvolve the received image from the distorted PSF. These novel techniques are discussed in this thesis, along with contrast and resolution improvements they offer. \n\nThe contributions of this thesis are manifold. The concept of MIMO has been applied to several communication and imaging systems and is liberated from the RF wireless communications paradigm, and meaningful quantitative and qualitative connections have been drawn to applications other than RF wireless, namely FSO and indoor optical communications, Ethernet copper cable transmission, and deblurring for active imaging. It is expected that the value of the findings will trigger a tremendous motivation in thinking \u2018jointly\u2019 in terms of multiple variables rather than in terms of the single time or space-dependent variables which communication engineers are inclined to favor. The value of the analyses also lies in the fact that communications and imaging are shown to be similar problems, when cast into a general MIMO framework.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2852], "author_name_tesi": "Fadlullah, Jarir ", "last_name_ssi": "Fadlullah", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jarir", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad", "Mohsen Kavehrad", "Shizhuo Yin", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Md Amanul Haque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad, Dissertation Advisor", "Mohsen Kavehrad, Committee Chair", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MIMO", "communication systems", "imaging", "turbulence", "copper cables", "equalization", "interference cancellation", "clouds", "monte carlo ray tracing", "infrared", "visible light communications"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Classification and Modeling of Human Activities Using Empirical Mode Decomposition with S-Band and Millimeter-Wave Micro-Doppler Radars.", "id": "19573", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9207", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ability to identify human movements can be an important tool in many different applications such as surveillance, military combat situations, search and rescue operations, and patient monitoring in hospitals. This information can provide soldiers, security personnel, and search and rescue workers with critical knowledge that can be used to potentially save lives and/or avoid a dangerous situation. Most research involving human activity recognition is focused on using\nthe Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) as a method of analyzing the micro-Doppler signatures. Because of the time-frequency resolution limitations of the STFT and because Fourier transform-based methods are not well-suited for use with non-stationary and nonlinear signals, we have chosen a diff\u000berent approach for classification. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) has been shown to be a\nvaluable time-frequency method for processing non-stationary and nonlinear data such as micro-Doppler signatures and EMD readily provides a feature vector that can be utilized for classification. For classification, the method of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was chosen. SVMs have been widely used as a method of pattern recognition due to their ability to generalize well and also because of their moderately simple implementation. In this dissertation, we discuss the ability of these methods to accurately identify human movements based on their micro-Doppler signatures obtained from S-band and millimeter-wave radar systems. Comparisons will also be made based on experimental results from each of these radar systems. Furthermore, we will present simulations of micro-Doppler movements for stationary subjects that will enable us to compare our experimental Doppler data to what we would expect from an \"ideal\" movement.\nThe Doppler radars that were developed for human activity classification consisted of a transmitter and a single receiver that are colocated in a quasi-monostatic con\ffiguration. Thus, only the radial component of the target's velocity produces a Doppler signal. If the target is moving tangentially to the radar line of sight, Doppler signals cannot be detected. To remedy this, multiple bistatic radars can\nbe utilized so that if one receiver does not detect Doppler, the other will. In addition to providing more information for classification purposes, multiple Doppler sensors can also be employed to determine a moving target's orientation by comparing the Doppler frequency shift at each sensor. The algorithm developed here uses the relationship between the Doppler frequencies measured at each sensor to determine the oscillation angle of the target. Experiments have been performed which show excellent agreement with simulations for both the mechanical motion of a swinging pendulum and also for simple human motions. These capabilities are discussed in detail and the experimental results are shown for a micro-Doppler radar system with a single transmitter and two receivers.

This study explored the effect of nozzle geometry such as orifice inlet shape and aspect ratio on the jet stream surface dynamics and the break up process before and after doublet jet impingement, respectively. Gels produced, using polymer or particle gellants, displayed less disturbed surfaces than non-gelled fluids, due to increased viscosity. As a result, for a given flow rate the sheet formed by impinging jets was much more stable and the sheet break up length was greater for gelled-water than non-gelled water jets. The nozzle aspect ratio has more noticeable effects on the near-field jet stream characteristics for both fluids than the orifice inlet shape. The longer nozzles form a more stable jet stream which delays the break-up of the sheet, leading to greater break up lengths than the shorter nozzles.

Using a novel micro-level dataset for the Greek food and beverages manufacturing sector that distinguishes subsidized from unsubsidized firms, I estimate the effect of the policy on firm investment behavior with two methodological approaches. A reduced-form firm investment demand equation is specified to estimate the average treatment effect of the policy on investment demand controlling for unobserved productivity. Exploiting variation in the intensity of the policy across locations and time a difrerences-in-differences investment demand regression is estimated. The results of this diff-in-diff analysis indicate that the policy has an economically significant effect on unsubsidized firms\u2019 investment behavior. The theoretical dynamic model is extended to a structural econometric model for estimating policy-invariant parameters by exploiting the firm\u2019s optimality conditions. I then use these estimated parameters to simulate alternative counterfactual policy scenarios. Consistent with the reduced-form evidence, the estimated structural model predicts that subsidized firms invest more because of the policy while unsubsidized firms invest less because the policy increases their option value of waiting.

These include: $Q_{neg}/Q_{pos}$, a ratio\ndesigned to test for conservation of energy; $Q_{pos}/p_{rms}^3$,\na band-limited quantity that describes energy lost from a certain\npart of the spectrum due to nonlinearity; the spectral Gol'dberg\nnumber $Gamma_s$, a dimensionless quantity whose sign indicates\nthe direction of nonlinear energy transfer and whose magnitude can\nbe used to compare the relative importance of linear and nonlinear\neffects; and the coherence indicator $gamma_Q$, which also\ndenotes the direction of nonlinear energy transfer and which is\nbounded between -1 and 1.\n\nTwo sets of experimental data are presented. The first was\nrecorded in a plane wave tube built of 2\" inner-diameter PVC pipe\nwith four evenly-spaced microphones flush-mounted with the inside\nwall of the tube. One or two compression drivers were used as the\nsound source, and an anechoic termination made of fiberglass\nserved to minimize reflections from the far end of the tube.  Both\nsingle-frequency signals and band-limited noise were used as\nsources, and waveforms were recorded at all four propagation\ndistances.  The second set of data was obtained at the model-scale\njet facility at the University of Mississippi's National Center\nfor Physical Acoustics.  A computer controlled microphone boom was\nconstructed to hold an array of six microphones. The array was\nrotated about the presumed location of the acoustic source center\n(4 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle exit), and two\nstationary microphones were mounted on the walls. Measurements\nwere made for several jet conditions; data presented here\nrepresent Mach~0.85 and Mach~2 conditions.\n\nApplication of the four candidate nonlinearity indicators to the\nexperimental data reveals that each indicator has advantages and\ndisadvantages.  $Q_{neg}/Q_{pos}$ does not detect the presence of\nshocks as postulated, but it does conform to expectations in the\nshock-free region and support the use of $Q_{pos}$ as an\nindicator. The main advantage of $Q_{pos}/p_{rms}^3$ is that it\ncan be used for band-limited measurements.  Increased indicator\nvalues are seen for signals with higher source frequencies and\namplitudes that are expected to undergo stronger nonlinear\nevolution. However, no physical meaning can yet be derived from\nthe numerical value of the indicator.  The spectral Gol'dberg\nnumber $Gamma_s$ is the most promising of the candidate\nquantities.  It has the ability to indicate the direction of\nnonlinear energy transfer as well as provide a comparison between\nthe strengths of linear and nonlinear effects.  These attributes\nallow it to be used to qualitatively predict the evolution of a\nspectrum.  The coherence indicator $gamma_Q$ also specifies the\ndirection of nonlinear energy transfer, but its numerical value\nholds less meaning. However, it is bounded between -1 and 1, so\nvalues near zero denote very weak or no nonlinearity, and values\nnear -1 or 1 denote strong nonlinearity. Further, because it is\nbounded, it does not become unstable for spectral components\nbeneath the system noise floor.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3728], "author_name_tesi": "Falco, Lauren Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Falco", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony A Atchley", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "Philip John Morris", "Victor Ward Sparrow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony A Atchley, Committee Chair", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Member", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["jet noise", "nonlinear acoustics", "nonlinearity indicators"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Electronic Design Automation Challenges in Three Dimensional Integrated Chips (3D ICs)\n", "id": "9083", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4946", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Three Dimensional Integrated Circuits (3D ICs) are currently being developed to improve existing two-dimensional (2D) chip designs.  Today's integrated chips face several problems, such as global interconnect scaling and bandwidth limitations. By stacking multiple device layers, 3D ICs can overcome these issues and produce chips with higher performance, less power consumption, smaller footprints and mixed-technology capabilities.  However, there are several challenges in the development of 3D ICs.  First, the current 3D Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools still do not offer enough support to effectively design 3D IC for widespread production.  Also, there is a lack of testing and verification tools and methods to ensure the correct functionality of 3D ICs.  In addition, integrating existing 3D EDA tools may be challenging because of the differences between the tools. Because of the early development of 3D ICs and the challenge of constructing a design flow, the design space of 3D ICs have not fully been explored.  These issues need to be solved before 3D ICs are developed into a viable commercial product.\n\nThis thesis helps address these EDA challenges in 3D ICs by exploring three areas in 3D IC development: 3D IC scan chain ordering methods, modeling 3D ICs in OpenAccess, and 3D IC Floorplan and Power/Ground (P/G) Co-synthesis. The tools and methods developed in these areas will further the understanding of the properties, benefits and limitations of 3D ICs. \n\nTo facilitate the testing of 3D ICs, three 3D scan chain ordering methods are developed: VIA3D, MAP3D and OPT3D.  VIA3D and MAP3D require no changes to a 2D ordering algorithm.  In addition, VIA3D has the lowest possible number of TSVs in the scan chain, while MAP3D results in the most number of TSVs among the methods.  However, OPT3D results in the best scan chain wirelength, with improvements over 2D wirelength of 36.3\\% for 2 tiers, 48.6\\% for 3 tiers and 53.4\\% for 3 tiers.  These 3D scan chain ordering methods can be used to construct 3D scan chains, which will permit the testing of 3D ICs.\n\nA 3D OA model is developed to provide interoperability between 3D EDA tools.  The model consists of a 2D database containing 2D tier designs and 3D database containing TSV designs and a 3D design which aggregates the design information from the 2D tiers.  In addition, a tool which creates a 3D technology for the 3D database is created.  The centralized 3D design database will allow for the creation of tightly integrated design flows to efficiently design 3D ICs.  \n\nA 3D IC Floorplan and P/G Co-synthesis tool is developed to design the 3D P/G network.  By using this tool, a floorplan can be generated with consideration of the IR drops in the circuit, which leads to better performing devices.  In addition, the co-synthesis tool can be used to explore the 3D P/G design space for a design.  Two topologies were studied in this work: a uniform mesh where each tier has the same pitch; and a non-uniform mesh where each tier may have a different pitch.  The results of experiments using the 3D Floorplan and P/G Co-synthesis tool can show the effects of 3D ICs on P/G networks and can be used to compare the different topologies.  \n\nThe results show that as the number of tiers increase in a 3D IC, the P/G routing area also increases due to the construction of P/G meshes on each tier.  In addition, as the number of tiers increase, the IR drop decreases due to the shortened P/G wires and the distribution of the P/G network throughout the tiers.  For 2 tiers, each type of mesh has approximately a 35\\% increase of P/G area and a 22\\% decrease in IR drop.  For 3 tiers, the IR drop decreases by approximately 30\\% for both meshes, and the P/G area increases by 63\\% for uniform meshes and by 92\\% for non-uniform meshes.  For 4 tiers, the P/G area increases by approximately 100\\%, or 2X, and the IR drop decreases by 33\\%.  An increased P/G routing area increases the routing congestion in the chip, but a decreased IR drop leads to faster and more reliable performance.  \n\n\nThe main difference between the uniform mesh and non-uniform mesh is that the non-uniform mesh has a better improvement in the average IR drop in the circuits.  This may be caused by the ability of the different pitches on each tier to more effectively deliver power to the modules.  The other difference between the two topologies is the P/G area for 3 tiers, where the non-uniform mesh has a larger P/G area.  However, for the P/G area for 2 and 4 tiers and for the maximum IR drop of the circuit, both topologies have similar results.  Therefore, though non-uniform mesh may be slightly more efficient in reducing the average IR drop, both types of meshes have similar advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe 3D Floorplan and P/G Co-synthesis considers the IR drop during floorplanning, explores the 3D P/G design space, and evaluates 3D IC's effect on 3D P/G networks.  This allows a more efficiently designed P/G network, improving the performance of the entire design.\n\nThough there is still a significant amount of work to be done before 3D ICs become commercially feasible, the tools and methods developed and presented in this thesis help solve these issues.  They can be used to enhance the maturation of 3D ICs. As 3D ICs develop into a practical technology, computers and systems will be able to utilize the benefits, leading to improved products for the user.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4923], "author_name_tesi": "Falkenstern, Paul ", "last_name_ssi": "Falkenstern", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Yuan Xie", "Yuan Xie"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Yuan Xie, Thesis Advisor", "Yuan Xie, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["OpenAccess", "Scan Chains", "Three Dimensional Integrated Chips (3D ICs)", "Floorplan", "Power/Ground Network Synthesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Myspedagogy:  Applications of Mystherory in Secondary English and Language Arts Education and Teacher Education", "id": "14924lcf137", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14924", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Within the past two decades, federal and state governments have increased the frequency, number, and importance of standardized tests in elementary and secondary American schools.

The Common Core standards, such as those which value a single, specific narrative writing structure, or an analysis that exclusively values and privileges authorial intent (Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2014, CC.1.4.11-12.P, CC.1.3.11-12.D) also appear to endorse these frameworks.

Myspedagogy is the application of an original theoretical framework I call \u201cmystheory\u201d to educational and pedagogical practices and contexts.  Inspired and informed by scholarly perspectives and work from post-identity theories, poststructuralism, posthumanism, quantum mechanics, chaos theory, performance theory, among others, mystheory infuses our recognitions and beings with mys-, an onto-epistemological concept that embodies mystery and uncertainty.

This original crusade against meat eating in the US engaged a wide range of reformers, including abolitionists, medical practitioners, temperance advocates, evangelists, and women\u2019s right\u2019s activists. Adherents to the diet believed controlling the American diet was a solution to the most pressing concerns of nineteenth century society. Using physiology, chemistry, anatomy, and Biblical exegesis, vegetarians stressed that humans were fundamentally different from and superior to non-human animals. Eating them, they claimed, blurred this important hierarchy. Far from an exercise of compassion, then, Vegetarianism was a desperate attempt to assert and maintain the difference between the human and the animal, physically and ideologically. \u201cFlesh\u201d was threatening to their definition of the rational human. To abstain from meat was not an act of compassion. It was an act of rejection.\n\nThis dissertation argues that by so clearly and rigidly defining the human body, vegetarians created a logic in which some humans were fundamentally more human than others; and they did so in a time in the nineteenth century when the question of who counted as \u201chuman\u201d was very much up for discussion. As abolitionists and women\u2019s rights activists sought to expand the definition of the rights-bearing human, vegetarians sought to define the human through its choices about food. This was in some senses promising for radical politics, but vegetarians more often ignored the logistical realities that informed the worlds of nonwhite and female people. I argue that vegetarians in the nineteenth century believed that we \u201care what we eat,\u201d but they used dietary advice to make problematic assumptions about the meaning of the human body in the tumultuous political world of the early republic.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16278], "author_name_tesi": "Falvo, Kathryn Rose", "last_name_ssi": "Falvo", "middle_name_ssi": "Rose", "first_name_ssi": "Kathryn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lori D Ginzberg", "Lori D Ginzberg", "Amy S Greenberg", "Bryan Lee Mcdonald", "Nancy A Tuana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lori D Ginzberg, Dissertation Advisor", "Lori D Ginzberg, Committee Chair", "Amy S Greenberg, Committee Member", "Bryan Lee Mcdonald, Committee Member", "Nancy A Tuana, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vegetarianism; nineteenth century; reform"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "CONTROLS ON FLUVIAL LONGITUDINAL PROFILE AND SEDIMENT CHARACTERISTICS: PREDICTIONS FROM A MORPHODYNAMIC MODEL\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "8221", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "614", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the sources of variation in the longitudinal profiles and sediment characteristics of rivers is important for predicting hydrocarbon reservoir quality, and understanding river responses to climate and tectonic perturbations.  Towards this end we have developed a numerical model named ZOE that simulates fluvial nonequilibrium transport and deposition of sand-sized heterogeneous mixtures.  Using ZOE we conducted a series of numerical experiments to determine the dependency of longitudinal profiles, and the composition and texture of deposits on subsidence, degree of sediment comminution, sediment supply, and variable hydrograph.  The experimental design consists of a standard steady-state control run for each sediment supply scenario to which are compared runs with subsidence, comminution, and simulated flood conditions with increased water discharge (Q) with a matching capacity sediment discharge (Qs) for each sediment/water relation.  The water surface elevation at the downstream boundary and the feedstock distribution are held constant for each model run.  Results show that climate change and sediment/water relations are the most important parameters determining the longitudinal profiles and sediment characteristics of fluvial and basin deposits.  Climate change experiments achieve a dynamic equilibrium in which the bed alternates between aggradation and degradation with the frequency of the varying discharge.  Increased Q lowers the bed slope and the fluvial system transports finer sediment relative to the feedstock.  With a lower bed slope the system preferentially transports finer sediment to the basin, leaving behind a deposit enriched in feldspar.  Climate change augments the effects of comminution and subsidence, which are otherwise negligible at the rates prescribed in this study.  Three sediment/water relations were simulated 1) linear case (Qs~=Q), 2) upstream-weighted (Qs~=Q^a   when a < 1), and 3) downstream-weighted case (Qs~=Q^a when a > 1).  For a linear sediment feed, the longitudinal profile is linear; a slight concavity is achieved only when combined with the variable discharge of either a wet-dry climate (Period = 1 yr) or a stormy climate (Period = \u00bc yr).  These experiments and a simplified analytic model show that a necessary condition for a concave bed profile is a <1 and that a change to a wetter climate (all other factors being equal) causes a temporary fining of sediment delivered to a basin and in fluvial settings. \n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [610], "author_name_tesi": "Fambrough, Brooke Anderson", "last_name_ssi": "Fambrough", "middle_name_ssi": "Anderson", "first_name_ssi": "Brooke", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rudy L Slingerland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rudy L Slingerland, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["comminution", "subsidence", "sediment transport", "nonequilibrium transport", "river", "fluvial system", "numerical model", "variable discharge"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Touch vs. Tech in Service Encounters", "id": "29551", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12675", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "New technologies are continuously being developed and infused into interactions between employees and customers, thereby transforming the traditional high touch-low tech service encounter. From the customer\u2019s perspective, all service encounters can be delineated along the dimensions of touch (the extent to which customers interact with direct service providers, such as service employees) and tech (the intensity with which customers must use technology). Systematically studying consumers\u2019 attitudes and behaviors during service encounters based on different levels of touch and tech not only furthers our understanding of modern consumers and contributes to the service encounter management research, but also helps service companies better understand their customers and provide the optimal level of service. Therefore, the first purpose of this dissertation is to develop a service matrix delineating different types of service encounters along the dimensions of touch and tech from the customer\u2019s perspective: high touch-low tech (Type 1), low touch-high tech (Type 2), low touch-low tech (Type 3), and high touch-high tech (Type 4). \n\nAccording to classic service marketing models, a service company can play either a direct or indirect role in influencing customers\u2019 perceptions of service during service encounters. Hence, the second purpose of this dissertation is to investigate how customers\u2019 relationships with a company (i.e., communal vs. exchange) influence their evaluations of touch and tech in service encounters and to identify the underlying mechanism. Due to action-norm conformity, interpersonal touch (vs. impersonal tech) service works better in a communal customer-company relationship. I examine perceptions of warmth as the underlying mechanism that leads to higher evaluations of touch service under communal relationship norms. \n\nFurthermore, I extend the interaction effects between service encounter types and customer-company relationships to the service failure context and explore the boundary condition of the basic effects. In particular, I test the moderating effect of a service guarantee in a service failure context. The results confirm the moderating effect of a service guarantee in an exchange customer-company relationship: without a service guarantee, customers\u2019 evaluations of tech (vs. touch) service failures are higher; conversely, with a service guarantee, customers\u2019 evaluations of touch (vs. tech) service failures are higher. On the other hand, the buffering effect caused by communal customer-company relationship norms attenuates the difference in customers\u2019 responses to touch vs. tech service failures, regardless of the absence or presence of a service guarantee.

Research on cell wall has become an increasingly emphasized topic due to the lignocellulosic biomass is a great candidate for biofuel production. Understanding the cell wall hierarchical structure is not only beneficial for fundamental understanding. It also provides a scientific basis for developing more effective methods for the conversion process.  In this thesis, we focus on both the structural behavior of the polysaccharides and the dynamic properties of their surrounding water. \n\tThe load-bearing network of cell wall is the cellulose/xyloglucan network. In order to avoid harsh chemical extraction treatment and to simulate the polysaccharides in the length scale that close to that in plant cell walls, we developed a coarse-grained force field for both cellulose and (XXXG) xyloglucan, and combined these two force fields for studying the network structure.  The force field for cellulose is built based on atomistic simulation of a 6x6x40 microfibril. The force sites are defined as the geometric average of the six member glucose ring. The force field is parameterized such that the chain configuration, intermolecular packing, and hydrogen bonding of the two levels of modeling are consistent. To retain the directionality of the interfibril interactions, we define pair-wised interactions between the interchain neighbors, and add the potentials sequentially until the crystal structure of the coarse-grained fibril matches that of the atomistic target. The coarse-grained simulation shows that microfibrils longer than 100nm tend to form kinks along their longitudinal direction. The kink structure may be linked to the periodic disorder of the microfibril observed based on small angle neutron scattering measurements. \n\tThe xyloglucan force field is build based on atomistic simulation of 15 (XXXG)3 segments, which is the shortest length of xyloglucan that shows significant interaction on cellulose microfibril surfaces. In order to make the two force fields compatible, we also define the xyloglucan force sites as the geometric average of the glucose rings or xylose rings. Thus, there are two types of beads in the xyloglucan chains. The coarse-grained simulation uses the atomistic chain configuration and intermolecular spacings as the target. Upon completion, we performed a simulation combining the two force fields. The simulation box in this case contains one 6x6x200 microfibril surrounded by 20 randomly placed (XXXG)50 xyloglucan chains. The coarse-grained simulation shows three types of xyloglucan based on their interaction with cellulose chains: the bridge chains (that interact with both the microfibril and its periodic image), the single chains (that only interacts with the microfibril), and the isolated chains (that do not directly interact with the microfibril). We also see that some of the isolated chains may bind to the other two types of xyloglucan and participating indirectly in bridging the microfibrils. Therefore, even though some xyloglucans may not directly interact with the microfibril, they may also contribute to the mechanical strength of the network structure. In addition, we observe that the interaction between xyloglucan and cellulose tends to extend along the fibril longitudinal direction. The above observations are very useful for revising the current cell wall models. \nWater occupies up to 90% of the cell wall, and it has been shown that water may modify the mechanical properties of cellulose by varying the hydration level. Thus, in order to fully understand the properties of the cell wall network structure, one cannot ignore the role of water. We studied the dynamic properties of water at 5% and 20% hydration levels by fitting self-intermediate scattering function using a stretched exponential model. Atomistic simulation allows us to completely decouple the contributions of translation and rotation in the scattering functions. By applying jump model, we can determine the translational diffusion coefficient, jump length, and the residence time of water proton within the local cage. We observe that multiple types of translational motion exist in 20% hydrated system, but even the faster motion is still slower than bulk water. We further performed simulation of the fibril at these two hydration levels at various temperatures. From each simulation, the rotation and translation is analyzed separately. The activation energy of rotation and translation are obtained using Arrhenius plots of relaxation time of rotation and diffusion coefficient of translation, respectively. The translation activation energy is comparable with bulk water, but the rotational activation energy of the confined water is much higher comparing to the bulk water, indicating a difference in the water rotation mechanism. However, this mechanism seems to be independent on hydration level. By performing anisotropy analysis on water rotation, we determined that the difference in the values of rotation relaxation times of the confined water is due to the difference in their extent of anisotropy. \nIn summary, we study the structural properties of the cell wall load-bearing network by developing coarse-grained force fields by requiring consistency with atomistic simulation target. The surrounding of the network is examined based on atomistic simulation, which can provide useful insights on the mechanism of the water motions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10598], "author_name_tesi": "Fan, Bingxin ", "last_name_ssi": "Fan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bingxin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janna Kay Maranas", "Janna Kay Maranas", "James David Kubicki", "Seong Han Kim", "Scott Thomas Milner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janna Kay Maranas, Dissertation Advisor", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Chair", "James David Kubicki, Committee Member", "Seong Han Kim, Committee Member", "Scott Thomas Milner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plant cell wall", "cellulose", "hemicellulose", "coarse-grained simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Behavior of the South Asian Summer Monsoon in Climate Model Simulations of Pre-industrial, Modern, and Projected Future Climate", "id": "11699", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1993", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Asian summer monsoon (\u201cASM\u201d), as one of the most important components of the climate system, has crucial economic and societal relevance to the most densely populated regions over South Asia and East Asia.

A newly developed integrative monsoon index (IMI) is applied to represent the strength of the monsoon circulation, with a focus on the most robust, South Asian Summer Monsoons (\u201cSASM\u201d) component of the ASM. The direct radiative effect of solar forcing on the SASM is found to be too weak to be detected in the context of the model simulation, whereas volcanic forcing gives rise to a significant short-term decrease of the SASM strength in the year of the largest radiative forcing anomaly associated with the volcanic eruption. It is evident that forced changes in the eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperature play an important role in the long-term changes in the SASM, but certain potential real world dynamical responses of the tropical Pacific ocean-atmosphere system to radiative forcing may not be well reproduced in this model simulation. \n\nOver the latter half of the 20th century during which (reanalysis) observations of the SASM are available, a parallel analysis is performed of the historical, 20th century experiment (\u201820C3M\u2019) simulations of the suite of coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 3 (CMIP3). The models are found to capture some of the features of the observed SASM including aspects of the mean circulation, associated precipitation influences, interannual variability, trend, and relationship with ENSO. However, there is also a fair amount of divergence in the trends found within the multi-model ensemble experiments. There is some evidence for greater consistency among the \u201cbest performing\u201d subgroup of models (based on comparison between observed and modeled SASM-related precipitation climatological statistics).\n\nA similar analysis is applied to the projections of future changes in the SASM during the 21st century in the CMIP3 720ppm stabilization experiment (\u2018SRES A1B\u2019). The seven \u201cbest performing\u201d models (as determined in the \u201820C3M\u2019 analysis described above) indicate a clear tendency for both weakening of SASM circulation, and increase in SASM-related precipitation.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1976], "author_name_tesi": "Fan, Fangxing ", "last_name_ssi": "Fan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fangxing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Mann", "Michael Mann", "Sukyoung Lee", "Jenni Evans"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Mann, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Mann, Committee Chair", "Sukyoung Lee, Committee Member", "Jenni Evans, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["South Asian summer monsoon", "integrative monsoon index", "circulation", "precipitation", "model simulation", "forcing"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Control Models of Lehman's 7th Law of Software Engineering in Single & Duopolistic Markets", "id": "28753", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12373", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis proposes an optimal control model and a differential game model of a firm's costly effort towards product maintenance in the digital software market.

It follows with a modeling component that simulates the welfare impacts of climate change on US households by linking a random utility model (RUM) with a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Linking these models enables feedbacks resulting from climate change-induced migration by simultaneously updating regional labor supply in the CGE model while changing labor wages in the empirical RUM model. \n\nA residential sorting model is used to estimate household location choices and to reveal household marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) to reduce frequency of extreme weather in the United States. A two-stage random utility model (RUM) is used for estimation. The first-stage discrete choice model employs a multinomial logit specification to recover heterogeneous parameters associated with metropolitan statistical area (MSA) specific variables, migration costs, and the mean indirect utility of each MSA. The second stage of this model decomposes the mean indirect utility obtained from the first stage into its MSA-specific attributes controlling for unobservables using region fixed effects and an instrumental variable (IV). The estimated coefficients obtained from the sorting model are compared to results from a conventional wage-hedonic model to evaluate the relative performance of these two models. \n\nAdditionally, a recursive dynamic inter-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is developed to simulate regional economic impacts. The model is calibrated to the IMPLAN 2010 state-level social accounting matrices (SAMs) for the U.S. and it solves at 1-year steps from 2010 to 2065 across 30 industrial sectors and 5 different regions in the US. An important innovation of this research is the coupling of the RUM with the CGE model to endogenize labor wages. Coupling these two models through the labor market influences household location choices in the RUM and allows for changes in the industrial size and sectoral composition of regional economies in the CGE model. This approach allows for both preference heterogeneity and sectoral interactions in the regional economies based on an iterative process. \n\nIn the empirical component, we find that extreme temperatures and extreme precipitation reduce utility. People\u2019s preferences for temperature extremes are heterogeneous. The climate of one\u2019s place of birth and demographic characteristics such as age, climate of birth region, and educational attainment are significant factors that lead to preference heterogeneity. We also find that the conventional wage-hedonic model underestimates values of amenities. \nIn the modeling component, we find that population share in the Northeast increases due to an moderate increase in frequency of warm weather reflected in the climate change scenario used in the analysis, while population share in the Midwest drops due to significant increases in extreme weather days. After considering the feedback from the labor market, population share in the West increases but shares in the Northeast, Midwest, and South drop relative to the business as usual (BAU) scenario without climate change. While climate amenity and job opportunities are both important factors in households\u2019 location decisions, wage effects tend to dominate climate effects on location choices for the working-age population, and retirees place a higher value on climate amenities compared to workers. In the high-emission A2 scenario, the percentage decrease in gross regional product (GRP) is 1.66% for the Northeast, 3.20% for the Midwest, 2.30% for the South, and 0.68% for California while comparing the climate change-induced migration scenario to the BAU scenario in 2065. In contrast, GRP in the West increases by 12.93% in the climate change-induced migration scenario relative to the business as usual (BAU) scenario. Our findings suggest that different mitigating policies should target different regions based on heterogeneous regional impacts. In addition, we find that endogenizing labor wages dampens regional economic impacts from climate change-induced migration. The results suggest that ignoring feedbacks from the equilibrium labor market will overstate the economic impacts of climate-induced migration.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8605], "author_name_tesi": "Fan, Qin ", "last_name_ssi": "Fan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Fisher Vanden", "Karen Ann Fisher Vanden", "James Samuel Shortle", "Stephan J Goetz", "Chris Eliot Forest", "H Allen Klaiber"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Fisher Vanden, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Ann Fisher Vanden, Committee Chair", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Member", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Member", "Chris Eliot Forest, Committee Member", "H Allen Klaiber, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Climate Change", "Locational Equilibrium", "Tiebout Sorting", "Migration Costs", "Endogenous Wages", "Regional Economic Impacts"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF RNA POLYMERASE II ON THE DROSOPHILA GENOME AND THE IMPACT OF THE TERMINATION FACTOR PCF11", "id": "8970", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5392", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The protein Pcf11 has been shown to dismantle RNA polymerase II elongation complexes and has been implicated in transcription termination in yeast, Drosophila and human cells.

The high resolution footprinting analysis at the 3\u2019 end of the heat shock genes identified several regions where Pol II accumulates. The changes in Pol II distribution at the 3\u2019 end of all three heat shock genes and more than 2000 other genes upon depletion of Pcf11 reveal defects in termination, indicating that Pcf11 functions as a general termination factor.

PS on both cells is required for phagocytosis.  It was asked whether bivalent annexins, which bind PS in a Ca2+-dependent manner, could bridge the target cell and macrophage.  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against annexins I or II bound to a variety of live phagocytes.  Apoptotic Jurkat T lymphocytes and human peripheral T lymphocytes, but not apoptotic thymocytes, were stained by anti-annexin I but not II.  Pretreatment of macrophages with mAbs to annexins I or II inhibited phagocytosis of apoptotic targets.  Pretreatment of apoptotic thymocytes had no effect, while pretreating Jurkat cells with anti-annexin I or removing annexin I with EGTA was inhibitory.  EGTA could not remove annexins from macrophages, suggesting that annexins bind to a receptor rather than PS on macrophages.  Annexin bridging is vectorial, since annexin is bound to PS molecules on targets but not on macrophages, suggesting annexins serve as both ligand and receptor in promoting phagocytosis.  Whether exogenous annexins could bind to apoptotic targets and enhance phagocytosis was also tested.  Purified annexins I and II were found to bind to apoptotic thymocytes.  In their presence, phagocytosis was inhibited or unaffected depending on the concentration of annexins, suggesting that exogenous annexins can mask PS on apoptotic thymocytes required for phagocytosis.  Phagocytosis of apoptotic Jurkat cells, which have both endogenous annexin I and free PS on their surface, was also inhibited by exogenous annexins I, II, or V, suggesting that free PS is essential for recognition and phagocytosis, even if annexin I is already present on the target cell surface.  The PS-binding protein, &#946;2-glycoprotein 1 (&#946;2GP1), has also been suggested as a bridging molecule in the phagocytosis of apoptotic thymocytes.  &#946;2GP1 in human serum was found to bind apoptotic thymocytes and apoptotic Jurkat cells, and this binding was independent of the presence of annexin I on the apoptotic targets.  Surprisingly, &#946;2GP1 was also found to be present normally on the surface of macrophages.

Assessing knowledge structure consists of eliciting approaches, representation approaches, and then comparing the structural representations.  In the pursuit to create an automated method to capture and assess knowledge structure, the Analysis of Lexical Aggregates tool (ALA-Reader) has shown promise.  Research has supported the ALA-Reader as a computer based approach for automatically scoring network graphs, measuring individual, and group knowledge from essays, and as an approach to elicit knowledge structure.  The ALA-Reader translates written text summaries into a proximity file to aggregate data at the sentence level to score essays in comparison to human raters.  In order to create proximity files, the ALA-Reader needs to have a list of terms.  Past research on the ALA approach for scoring network graphs and essays has focused primarily on how knowledge is elicited as proximity files, for example, within sentence approach verses the linear aggregate approach, but the number of terms used to create the proximity files was not a variable.  The purpose of this current non-experimental exploratory investigation is to attempt to answer the question: \u201cdoes an optimal number of terms exist that can be used to create proximity files or are more terms better?\"  To answer this question the current investigation plans to hold the elicitation approach for creating the proximity files constant, and focus on varying the number of terms used to create the proximity files in order to determine what effect this has on the convergent validity of essay scores relative to human rater scores.  This study found that when using the ALA-Reader to create proximity arrays, 20 terms consistently had the highest correlation of the word lists.  This result was constant when applied to all five referent expert essays.  These results suggest more terms are not necessarily needed to create valid proximity arrays, which may increase the practicality of using the ALA-Reader as a valid tool for automatically scoring essays.  This study also extends past research by considering essays that are considerably longer than those in the past; also the type of essays analyzed in this study were argumentative essays.  Future research is needed to refine these results by applying the current study\u2019s methodologies to other types of essays i.e. persuasive, expository, or narrative, and to smaller restricted response essays, blogs, or online forums.

Clustering of GABAARs at postsynaptic sites is critical for the function of inhibitory synapses. Moreover, changes in synaptic receptor concentration are believed to contribute to functional plasticity of neurons. GABAARs are important for normal brain function as evidenced by their critical role in a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases including epilepsy, anxiety, drug addiction, and diverse forms of mental retardation. Furthermore, GABAARs are a major site of action of clinically relevant CNS drugs, including the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, general anesthetics, and ethanol, as well as endogenous neurosteroids.\n\nStructurally, GABAARs represent heteropentameric ligand-gated Cl- channels, typically composed of 2?, 2? and 1?2 subunit. The ?2 subunit is specifically required for proper trafficking and clustering of the major subset of GABAARs that function at inhibitory synapses. GABAARs are subject to many posttranslational modifications, including palmitoylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Of particular relevance for this thesis, palmitoylation is implicated in regulated trafficking of the ?2 subunit containing GABAARs to the plasma membrane and, by extension, in synaptic plasticity of inhibitory synapses. The ?2 subunit of GABAARs is palmitoylated at multiple Cys residues in the cytoplasmic loop region. Furthermore, GODZ has recently been isolated as a ?2 subunit interacting protein that can palmitoylate the ?2 subunit in vitro.\n\nThe main objective of this doctoral thesis was to address the function of GODZ-mediated palmitoylation of the ?2 subunit in neurons. Here, I have shown that GODZ and its close paralog, SERZ-?, are the only enzymes among 23 DHHC family members of palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) that exhibit significant palmitoyltransferase activity for the ?2 subunit as a substrate in vitro. Moreover, GODZ and SERZ-? show indistinguishable expression patterns in brain as well as palmitoylation-dependent interaction with the ?2 subunit. Moreover, they form homo- and heteromultimers on expression in heterologous cells. Analyses in neurons indicate that GODZ is critically important for trafficking of GABAARs to synapses, for whole cell GABAergic inhibitory function and for normal amplitude and frequency of GABAergic miniature inhibitory synaptic currents. Indirectly, GODZ mediated palmitoylation in postsynaptic neurons is required for presynaptic GABAergic innervation. In contrast, GODZ is dispensable for AMPA receptor-mediated whole cell currents as well as miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Thus, GODZ-mediated palmitoylation of GABAARs is important selectively for structural and functional plasticity of inhibitory synapses.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1154], "author_name_tesi": "Fang, Cheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Fang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher", "Douglas Cavener", "Gong Chen", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets", "Wendy Hanna Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher, Committee Chair", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Gong Chen, Committee Member", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["trafficking", "synaptogenesis", "inhibitory synapses", "palmitoylation", "GABAA receptors", "DHHC-CRD proteins"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE IMPACT OF SUPERVISORY POWER AND VISIBILITY ON TELECOMMUTERS\u2019 WORK OUTCOMES IN CHINA", "id": "10590", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1595", "abstract_tesi": "More and more multinational companies are adopting telecommuting as a new mode of work arrangement in China.

The two most popular adaptive signal control systems (i.e., OPAC and RHODES) have some limitations: OPAC cannot guarantee a globally optimum solution, both systems cannot be applied to optimize phase sequence, and the arrival patterns used for optimization horizons may not be reliable. Therefore, this research develops a methodology and a corresponding implementation algorithm using dynamic programming (DP) to provide optimal signal control of diamond interchanges in response to real-time traffic fluctuations. The problem is formulated as to find a phase sequencing decision with a  phase duration that makes a pre-specified performance measure minimized over a finite horizon that rolls forward. The problem is solved by DP forward value iterations method. The optimization performance measure can be, for example, delay, queue length, number of stops, or any combination of these. A horizon of 10 seconds is divided into an integral number of intervals, each having 2.5 seconds. The optimal signal switches over each 2.5-second interval are found for each horizon. The optimization process proceeds one horizon after another and is based on the advanced vehicle information obtained from loop detectors set back a certain distance from the stop-line. A dynamic model of future vehicular detections, arrivals and departures is developed at the microscopic level in this study to estimate the traffic flows at the stop-line for each horizon.\n\nThe DP algorithm is coded in C++ language and dynamically linked to AIMSUN, a stochastic micro-simulation package, which is used for evaluation of the developed methodology. AIMSUN simulates a signalized diamond interchange instrumented with loop detectors that can provide vehicle counts and speeds to the DP algorithm. Based on this, the algorithm calculates the optimal phase sequence and the duration of each horizon, and passes them back to AIMSUN, which subsequently controls the interchange in real time. To enable the algorithm to implement practical scenarios, a so-called majority rolling technique was also developed.               \n\nA sensitivity analysis using simulation results is conducted to study the characteristics of the DP algorithm.  The results have shown that queue length and storage ratio defined performance measures are the best ones in minimizing system delays. A general rule of choosing the weight of an approach is that a larger weight applied for approaches having more demand. The study has also demonstrated the benefits of using dynamic weights without manually requiring the changing of weights. Dynamic weights can reduce system delay by 36 percent ?49 percent than fixed weights when the demand varies unpredictably every 15 minutes and is unbalanced. Moreover, the real-time DP algorithm has revealed the capability to accommodate various demand situations.\n\nThe real-time DP algorithm has also been compared to two off-line optimization packages: PASSER III and TRANSYT-7F. The optimized pre-timed signal plans from TRANSYT-7F and PASSER III are implemented in AIMSUN, and the results are compared to those from the DP algorithm. The simulation has exhibited that the real-time adaptive signal algorithm is superior to PASSER III and TRANSYT-7F in handling demand fluctuations for medium to high flow scenarios when the field demand is increased from the one used in off-line optimization. The performance of the three algorithms is almost identical if the simulation demand is the similar to off-demand situation and dose not vary much. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1975], "author_name_tesi": "Fang, Fang ", "last_name_ssi": "Fang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lily Elefteriadou", "Konstadinos Goulias", "Martin T Pietrucha", "Natarajan Gautam", "Andrew Scanlon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lily Elefteriadou, Committee Chair", "Konstadinos Goulias, Committee Member", "Martin T Pietrucha, Committee Member", "Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member", "Andrew Scanlon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Signal Optimization", "Diamond Interchanges", "Dynamic Programming", "Traffic Simulation", "Adaptive Signal Control", "ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems)", "Real-time Signal Control"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Social Support on the Relation Between Stress from Daily Life Issues and Depression Among East Asian International Students in the United States", "id": "16912", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8393", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-01-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Moderation effects of social support on the relation between stress resulting from five daily life issues (i.e., acculturation, second language, academic performance, interpersonal relationships, and financial concerns) and psychological distress (i.e., the level of depression) among China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan international students were examined in this study.

Instrumented indentation employs high resolution instrumentation to continuously record indentation force and displacement simultaneously, from which mechanical properties of the indented material, such as hardness and elastic modulus, are calculated. Accurate measurement of the contact area between the indenter tip and the sample is crucial for this technique, because the resulting mechanical properties are directly related to the contact area. Although the Oliver-Pharr method allows one to infer the contact area from the measured force-displacement curve, it is based on an elastic contact model that has limitations in some applications. The fact that the Oliver-Pharr method does not have a direct in-situ contact area measurement is a fundamental limitation that confounds instrumented indentation when characterizing thin films, materials that pile-up and dynamic behavior of materials such as creep and fatigue. The work presented here is an effort to enhance instrumented indentation as a mechanical characterization tool by developing an electrical technique to measure in-situ contact area, and thus improve mechanical characterization at micro/nano-scales.\n\nFirst, an electrical technique, electrical instrumented indentation, was developed and validated by indenting annealed Cu. An electrical coupled instrumented indentation system was designed and developed to enable reliable simultaneous electrical contact measurements during instrumented indentation. By indenting annealed Cu, the measured electrical contact current-voltage (I-V) curves were found to be nonlinear and asymmetric, posing significant challenge to obtain mechanical properties from electrical measurements. A new data analysis method was then proposed to obtain in-situ contact area and hardness from the measured contact I-V curves by relating the nonlinear contact I-V curves to the instantaneous contact area. The area under I-V curves were found to be correlated to the contact area from the Oliver-Pharr method at the initial unloading, and this correlation was a power-law function within the studied range. Using this relation, the in-situ contact area and hardness were obtained as a continuous function of applied force during instrumented indentation.\n\nSecond, a thorough investigation was conducted to determine the optimal data analysis methods for the developed electrical technique. The nonlinearity in the measured I-V curves posed significant challenge to inferring contact area and mechanical properties. To overcome this challenge, various I-V curve analysis methods were investigated for their abilities to infer in-situ contact area and hardness. Analyzing the resulting data from indentation of annealed Cu, the feasibility of each method was evaluated. The optimal methods to calculate the in-situ contact area and hardness were determined. It was found that a simple summation of the absolute values of area under I-V curves or the area under I-V curves at positive voltages yielded the most robust area measure. Error in the inferred contact area was systematic and primarily from the velocity dependence of the I-V response.\n\nFinally, the electrical instrumented indentation technique was extended to characterize work-hardened Cu, a material that exhibits pile-up. The Oliver-Pharr method is known to overestimate the hardness of materials that pile-up, sometimes by as much as 60%. To apply the electrical technique to characterize materials that pile-up, it was hypothesized that materials with the same chemical constituent have the same relation between contact area and I-V curve. Thus, it is possible to characterize a material that piles-up using the relation between contact area and I-V curve calibrated on its counterpart that sinks-in via the Oliver-Pharr method. This hypothesis was tested by indenting both annealed and work-hardened Cu and imaging the residual indents. It was found that the relations between contact area and I-V curve for these two materials were sometimes as much as 10% different. This difference, on one hand, suggested that the electrical measurements are sensitive to laboratory environment (e.g. temperature and humidity) and sample surface condition (e.g. surface roughness and oxide layer). On the other hand, the moderate difference was encouraging for us to pursue the same electrical contact characteristics for materials with the same chemical constituent with reasonable experiment control. This will prove to be useful for important applications such as characterization of thin films. Furthermore, measurements of electrical contact responses between a conductive diamond indenter tip and the sample along with post-indentation imaging yielded in-situ contact area and hardness as a continuous function of applied force with the pile-up effect appropriately accounted for. \n\nThe electrical instrumented indentation technique developed in this dissertation was demonstrated to measure in-situ contact area as a continuous function of applied force during instrumented indentation, thus enhanced instrumented indentation for characterization of dynamic behavior of materials such as creep and fatigue. It also laid the foundation of a standalone technique that has the potential to overcome all the other limitations that the Oliver-Pharr method has. Due to the nonlinear nature of the measured electrical contact I-V curves, however, the electrical technique currently still relies on other methods, either the Oliver-Pharr method or the optical method, to calibrate the relation between the contact area and the I-V curve. This relation varies from material to material; it depends on the band structures of the two contacting materials and is sensitive to lab environment and surface condition as well. These increased the difficulty in using this technique and extending it to other possible applications. A fundamental understanding of the contact I-V curves will greatly help us to overcome this difficulty. An electrical contact theory relating the nonlinear I-V curve to contact area analytically will eliminate the need of using other methods for calibration, and thus improve the electrical technique to be a powerful standalone technique for mechanical characterization that can overcome the intrinsic limitations in the Oliver-Pharr method. It will then prove to be useful for characterization of thin films and materials that exhibit pile-up and perhaps even more.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3828], "author_name_tesi": "Fang, Lei ", "last_name_ssi": "Fang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lawrence H Friedman", "Lawrence H Friedman", "Christopher L Muhlstein", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Patrick M Lenahan", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lawrence H Friedman, Dissertation Advisor", "Lawrence H Friedman, Committee Chair", "Christopher L Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Patrick M Lenahan, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["instrumented indentation", "hardness", "in-situ", "contact area", "electrical measurement"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Impact Of Polysaccharides And Hydration On The Structure Of Cellulose", "id": "22581", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9695", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The polysaccharide cellulose consists of \u03b2 linked D-glucose units, and is a major component of the cell wall of eukaryotic plants and algae. There are both amorphous and crystalline regions in the microfibrils. Cellulose crystal structure is determined by how chains are packed and interact through intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. Higher order microfibril assembly may occur through the process of co- crystallization, physical aggregation and bundling. The structure of native cellulose has important implications in the chemical or enzymatic transformation of cellulosic biomass, and for the development of new cellulose based composite materials.\nThe cellulose chains at the surface of microfibrils are in intimate contact with hemicellulose and other small molecules including water, which will affect the crystallization process, and eventually impact degradability through chemical and enzymatic processes. A better understanding of those subjects has become the main focus of many researchers aiming to produce biofuels and other useful chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass. The development of a model system should permit more systematic exploration of the complex plant cell wall system. Bacterial cellulose (BC) synthesis in Gluconacetobacter can serve as a model system to study the basic principles that govern the biogenesis of cellulose as well as cellulose interaction with other polymers during synthesis. Synthesis of BC is a precisely and specifically regulated multi-step process, involving a large number of enzymes and complexes of catalytic and regulatory proteins. Generally, there are two immediate steps: formation of a glucan chain through the polymerization of glucose units and crystallization of the cellulose chain. The two steps are coupled and consecutive processes, and the rate of polymerization is determined by the rate of crystallization.\nIn addition to cellulose, some other exopolysaccharides (EPS) have been isolated from the culture medium of cellulose-producing bacteria. Understanding the correlation between water\niii\niv soluble EPS and cellulose production is a goal of this study. Gluconacetobacter hansenii (G.\nhansenii) ATCC 53582 was found to produce different types of water soluble EPS. Those EPS have different levels of association to BC. At least a portion of the EPS can be released from the BC by 0.1M to 4M NaOH solution treatments. Hard to extract EPS (HE-EPS) released by 4M NaOH solutions have been characterized and contain approximately 75% mannose and 25% glucose. To study the effect of the EPS on BC synthesis, purified EPS were added to the medium at the start of cultivation and the BC produced was characterized. Results showed that the presence of HE-EPS in the culture medium interfered with the alignment of the BC crystals, but did not reduce crystal size. This is in contrast to similar studies performed using xyloglucan, xylan, and glucomannan. The width of the average ribbon increased by 60% when HE-EPS levels increased in the medium, which indicated that the HE-EPS could also modulate the bundling of cellulose ribbons. Based on the data, a mechanism for how HE-EPS alters cellulose formation and assembly was proposed. The addition of HE-EPS disturbs the preferential crystal orientation and increases the spacing of cellulose microfibrils without affecting crystallization by associating with ordered cellulose prior to physical aggregation or bundling. Those results may impact the interpretation of previous work, where BC is used as a pure model cellulose material.\nThis study investigates the influence of carbon source on the cellulosic and non-cellulosic EPS produced by four Gluconacetobacter strains. The yields of bacterial cellulose and water- soluble polysaccharides were dependent on both carbon source and Gluconacetobacter strain. The carbon substrate also affected the composition of the free EPS. When galactose served as the exclusive carbon source, G.xylinus ATCC 53524 and ATCC 700178 produced a distinct alkaline stable crystalline product, which influenced the crystallization of cellulose. G. hansenii ATCC 23769 and ATCC 53582, however, did not exhibit any significant change in cellulose crystal properties when galactose was used as the carbon source. Microscopic observation further\nv confirmed significant incorporation of EPS into the cellulose composites. The cellulosic network\nproduced from galactose medium showed distinctive morphological and structural features compared to that from glucose medium.\nHydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is more complicated than that of pure cellulose due to the presence of lignin and hemicellulose. The properties of cellulose such as crystallinity, porosity, particle size, and the content and distribution of lignin and hemicellulose could all contribute to substrate digestibility. Therefore, the aim of this study is to use Gluconacetobacter as a model system to study how the interaction between cellulose and other polymers influence the enzymatic hydrolysis.\nThree different types of water-soluble polysaccharides produced from plants and G. xylinus were added to the fermentation medium. There are variations in the amounts of polysaccharides incorporated into the active G. xylinus system. Glucomannan demonstrated highest affinity to bacterial cellulose. According to morphological observations, the networks of hemicellulosic polysaccharides and bacterial cellulose appeared to coalesce more prominently compared to that of the bacterial cellulose produced in the presence of bacterial polysaccharides. The cellulase digestion studies were performed on bacterial cellulose with and without added polysaccharides, and an amorphous cellulose standard. The hydrolysis rate of the native bacterial cellulose increased drastically with the incorporation of certain types of mannose rich polysaccharides produced from plants and G. xylinus. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the altering physical aggregation and bundling of cellulose microfibrils with certain types of polysaccharides could improve the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency without disrupting the crystal structure of cellulose significantly. This result could have implications for the genetic modification of plants for biofuel feedstocks.\nvi The change in the state of water in cellulose is important to its structural and mechanical\nproperties. The goal of this component of the study is to investigate the hydration and dehydration induced structural changes of native cellulose. Never dried cotton, and never dried BC with and without added matrix polymer xyloglucan, are examined under the influence of dehydration and rehydration. Significant crystal structure changes were observed in the later stage of drying for both cotton and BC. The 1% lateral expansion in glucan chain spacing and 17% decrease of calculated Scherrer dimension were detected for cotton due to the distortion of the structure possibly caused by mechanical stresses associated with drying. No detectable changes on average glucan chain spacings were observed for large BC crystals. However, an average width decrease by 4.4 nm was discovered in the (010) direction, which was more significant than that observed in the (100) and (110) directions. It is hypothesized that co-crystallized elementary fibrils preferentially disassociate along the (010) plane resulting in a significant reduction of crystal width. In the BC-xyloglucan model composite, the presence of xyloglucan does not interfere with the dehydration behavior. Rehydration leads to some structural changes but to a lesser extent than the initial drying. High temperature dehydration induced deformation and crystal size changes are found to be non-reversible due to the removal of the last hydration layer on the cellulose surface.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9451], "author_name_tesi": "Fang, Lin ", "last_name_ssi": "Fang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Virendra Puri", "Ali Demirci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark, Dissertation Advisor", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cellulose; water; structure; exopolysaccharides"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Data Mining on Communication for Identifying Terrorists: A Case Study", "id": "13189", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7148", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Terrorism incidents can cause severe impacts.

There are several popular similarity measures used for image retrieval, for example, Mallows distance and integrated region matching (IRM). Mallows distance is a metric, but IRM is much faster to compute. This thesis introduces a new measure - potential energy distance for image similarity computation. Potential energy distance is also a metric, but is much faster to compute.\nTo evaluate the performance of potential energy distance, we conduct experiments to compare potential energy distance with Mallows distance and IRM.

The advantages of Li-ion battery over NiMH are that it can provide longer life, higher cell voltage and higher energy density, etc. However, there are still some issues unsolved for Li-ion battery to fully satisfy the HEV requirement. At high temperature, thermal runaway may cause safety issues. At low temperature, however, its performance is dramatically reduced and also Li deposition may occur. Furthermore, degradation due to side reactions in the electrodes during cycling and storage results in capacity loss and impedance rise. \nAn electrochemical-thermal coupled model is first used to predict performance of individual electrodes of Li-ion cells under HEV conditions that encompass a wide range of ambient temperatures. The model is validated against experimental data of not only the full cell but also individual electrodes and then used to study lithium deposition on the negative electrode during charging Li-ion battery at subzero temperature. The simulated property evolution, e.g. Li concentrations in electrode and electrolyte, shows that either low temperature or high charge rate may force Li insertion (into the negative carbon electrode) to occur in a narrow region near the separator. Therefore, Li deposition is mostly like to happen in this location. Modeling simulation shows that reduction of the negative electrode particle size can reduce Li deposition, which has same effect as improvement of the Li diffusion coefficient in the negative electrode. The model is also used to study charge protocols at subzero temperature. Model simulation shows that employing pulse current can improve cell temperature by the heat generated inside the cell, thus this designed charge protocol is able to reduce Li deposition and improve the charge efficiency as well. \nIndividual aging mechanism is then implemented into each electrode to study Li-ion battery degradation during accelerated aging tests. The experimentally observed aging phenomena are interpreted using the degradation model. The simulated results show that the positive electrode active material loss is the main cause of capacity loss and impedance growth. And this is the key step for a model to well catch the experimentally observed aging phenomena in the two electrodes.\nIn the future work, the degradation model will further help to prolong battery life through engineering and optimization in HEV applications.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6572], "author_name_tesi": "Fang, Weifeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Fang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Weifeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Chao Yang Wang", "Long Qing Chen", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Li-ion battery", "HEV", "degradation", "modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "zeta functions of complexes from PGSp(4)", "id": "11806", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6753", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis we study the zeta functions arising from PGSp$(4)$ over a nonarchimedean local field.

During 7 weeks of hydraulic stimulation of well NWG 55-29, 90% of MEQs occurred in the shallow reservoir (\u223c500 m to \u223c1800 m), only a few occurred adjacent to the bottom of the open borehole (\u223c2500 m to \u223c3000 m) while almost no seismicity was observed in the intervening interval (\u223c1800 m to \u223c2500 m). Our analysis of frictional stability using spatial models for fluid pressure diffusion of injected fluids shows that the distribution of MEQs is consistent with observed casing damage, and a possible leak at \u223c700 m, and is inconsistent with migration of fluids from the casing shoe. The role of fluid injection through the ruptured casing is further supported by the analyses of shear failure and pore-pressure diffusion. Finally, the absence of seismicity at intermediate depths is consistent with our laboratory determinations of frictional stability, showing velocity strengthening frictional behavior for samples from intermediate depths, bracketed by velocity neutral and weakening behavior for samples from shallower and greater depths. \n        Chapter 2 introduces a method to constrain the evolution of fracture permeability at sufficiently fine resolution with observed in-situ MEQs data to define reservoir response. In this method, we propose a model that couples the moment magnitude to fracture aperture and then estimates the reservoir permeability at relatively high resolution. The critical parameters controlling fracture aperture and permeability evolution are stress-drop, the bulk modulus of the fracture embedded matrix, and the dilation angle of fractures. We employ Oda\u2019s crack tensor theory and a cubic-law based analog to estimate the permeability of a synthetic fractured reservoir at various scales, demonstrating that the resolution of permeability is largely determined by the cellular grid size. Finally, we map the in-situ permeability of the Newberry EGS reservoir using observed MEQs during two rounds of reservoir stimulations in 2014. The equivalent mean permeability evaluated by each method is consistent and unlimited by representative elementary volume (REV) size. With identical parameters, Oda\u2019s crack tensor theory produces a more accurate estimation of permeability than that of the cubic law method, but estimate differences are within one order of magnitude. The permeability maps show that the most permeable zone is located within the zone of most dense seismicity providing a reference for the siting of the production well. This model has the potential for mapping permeability evolution from MEQs data in conventional and unconventional reservoirs and at various scales.\nHowever, the impact of induced seismicity on fracture permeability evolution remains unclear due to the spectrum of modes of fault reactivation (e.g., stable vs. unstable). To better understand the hydro-mechanical behavior of reservoir due to stimulation, it becomes essential to understand the fundamental relationship between induced seismic and aseismic slip and permeability evolution of a fracture. As seismicity is controlled by the frictional response of fractures, Chapter 3 reports the results of experimental study of friction-stability-permeability relationships through the concurrent measurement of frictional and hydraulic properties of artificial fractures in Green River shale (GRS) and Opalinus shale (OPS). We observe that carbonate-rich GRS shows higher frictional strength but weak neutral frictional stability. The GRS fracture permeability declines during shearing while an increased sliding velocity reduces the rate of permeability decline. By comparison, the phyllosilicate-rich OPS has lower friction and strong stability while the fracture permeability is reduced due to the swelling behavior that dominates over the shearing induced permeability reduction. Hence, we conclude that the friction-stability-permeability relationship of a fracture is largely controlled by mineral composition, and that shale mineral compositions with strong frictional stability may be particularly subject to permanent permeability reduction during fluid infiltration.\n        Chapter 4 extends previous studies to explore frictional stability-permeability relationships of fractures and identify the role of mineralogy (i.e., tectosilicate, carbonate, and phyllosilicate content). In this study, we perform a series of direct-shear experiments on saw-cut fractures of natural rocks and sintered fractures with distinct mineralogical compositions. Our experimental results indicate that the friction-permeability relationship is controlled by mineralogy. Frictional strength and change in permeability both decrease with an increase in either phyllosilicate or carbonate content as frictional instability (a-b) increases. With this relationship, we speculate that planar fractures with low frictional stability exhibit permeability enhancement after seismic slip in the frame of rate-state friction theory. This relationship implies a new mechanical-hydro-chemical (MHC) coupling loop via a linkage of frictional properties, mineralogy, and permeability.\n        Previous experiments suggest that frictional strength and stability are primarily controlled by the mineralogical content of fracture material. The permeability of smooth fractures declines monotonically with displacement due to the generation of wear products. Chapter 5 investigates the effect of roughness on permeability evolution and frictional behavior using artificially fabricated fractures with specified roughness features. The experimental results show that (1) both smooth and rough fracture surfaces exhibit velocity strengthening frictional behavior for small net displacement and evolves to velocity neutral and velocity weakening with greater displacement. (2) Rougher surfaces exhibit higher velocity strengthening frictional behavior and higher frictional strength due to the presence of cohesive interlocking asperities during shearing. Seismicity may not be induced on rough fracture surfaces. (3) The roughness pattern exerts a dominant control on permeability evolution over the entire shearing history. Permeability evolves monotonically for smooth fractures but in a fluctuating pattern for highly roughened fractures. A higher roughness is likely to result in alternating compaction and dilation during shearing. Significant permeability damage may occur for rough samples when asperities are highly worn with wear products blocking fluid pathways. (4) There is no obvious correlation between permeability evolution and frictional behavior for rough fracture samples when fractures are subject to sudden sliding velocity change. Implications of our lab-scale experimental results suggest that characterization of fracture geometry would be beneficial for better understanding and managing induced seismicity and permeability development. \n        In shale reservoir stimulation, fractures are propped to increase the permeability of the formation. On the other hand, the proppants may also influence the frictional strength of fractures. Thus, in the appendix, we explore the evolution of friction and permeability of a propped fracture using shearing-concurrent measurements of permeability during constant velocity shearing experiments. We observe that (1) the frictional response is mainly controlled by the normal stress and proppant thickness. High normal stress results in the crushing of proppant particles although this change in particle size distribution has almost no impact on the frictional response of the proppant-fracture system. The depth of shearing-concurrent striations on fracture surfaces suggests that the magnitude of proppant embedment is controlled by the applied normal stress. Moreover, under high normal stress, the reduced friction implies that shear slip is more likely to occur on propped fractures in deeper reservoirs. The increase in the number of proppant layers, from mono-layer to triple-layers, significantly increases the friction of the propped fracture due to the interlocking of the particles and jamming, suggesting that high proppant density during emplacement would help stabilize the fractures during injection. (2) Permeability of the propped fracture is mainly controlled by the magnitude of the normal stress, the proppant thickness, and the proppant size. Permeability of the propped fracture decreases during shearing due to proppant particle crushing and related clogging. Compared to the multi-layered specimen, the mono-layer case which has fewer displacement degrees-of-freedom exhibits the smallest initial permeability due to proppant embedment. Proppants are prone to crushing if the shear loading evolves concurrently with the normal loading. These combined conclusions suggest that the use of high-density proppants not only provides high hydraulic conductivity for hydrocarbon production but may also help to mitigate the risk of induced seismicity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15639], "author_name_tesi": "Fang, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Fang", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Derek Elsworth", "Shimin Liu", "Chris J Marone", "Tong Qiu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth, Dissertation Advisor", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Chair", "Shimin Liu, Committee Member", "Chris J Marone, Committee Member", "Tong Qiu, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Induced microearthquakes", "Frictional parameters", "Permeability evolutions", "Preexisting fractures", "Fracture minerals", "Fracture surface roughness", "Enhanced Geothermal System", "Geological sequestration of carbon dioxide"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Reactive Chemical Transport under Multiphase System\n\n", "id": "6081", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6832", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-03-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents the development of BIOGEOCHEM, a numerical model to simulate biochemical and geochemical reactions in a batch system and HYDROBIOGEOCHEM, a numerical model to simulate HYDROlogic transport and BIOchemical and GEOCHEMical reactions under nonisothermal multiphase systems in 2-dimensions and 3-dimensions.\nHYDROBIOGEOCHEM is a coupled hydrologic transport and biogeochemical reaction code, reaction module of which is BIOGEOCHEM, to predict the spatio-temporal distributions of all the important chemical species.  The formulation of BIOGEOCHEM and HYDROBIOGEOCHM is new in that it is based on a general paradigm which uses the well accepted diagonalizetion-decomposition procedure. The unique features of the general paradigm are that it can simultaneously (1) facilitate the segregation (isolation) of linearly independent kinetic reactions and, thus, enable the formulation and parameterization of individual rates one reaction by one reaction when linearly dependent kinetic reactions are absent; (2) enable the inclusion of virtually any type of equilibrium expressions and kinetic rates users want to specify; (3) reduce problem stiffness by eliminating all fast reactions from the set of ordinary differential equations governing the evolution of kinetic variables; (4) perform systematic operations to remove redundant fast reactions and irrelevant kinetic reactions; (5) systematically define chemical components and explicitly enforce mass conservation; (6) accomplish automation in decoupling fast reactions from slow reactions; and (7) increase the robustness of numerical integration of the governing equations with species switching schemes. \nThe new formulation in HYDROBIOGEOCHEM uses Gauss-Jordan decomposition to diagonalize the governing matrix equations for hydrologic transport to reduce primary dependent variables (PDVs), resulting in mobile components and mobile kinetic variables as PDVs.  Methods for coupling biogeochemical reaction and hydrologic transport, such as the sequential iteration approach (SIA) and predictor corrector approach are incorporated into the code to make the model versatile. \nThe governing transport equation can be written in conservative form and nonconservative form. Five different numerical schemes based on the two forms of equations are incorporated in HYDROBIOGEOCHEM to better understand different physical processes. They are (1) FEM on advective form of equation, (2) FEM on conservative form of equation, (3) Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian FEM for interior elements + FEM on advective form of equation for boundary elements , (4)  hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian FEM, and (5) Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian FEM for interior elements + FEM on conservative form of equation for boundary elements. \n\tHeat transfer is considered in HYDROBIOGEOCHEM to account for the temperature variations that may impact hydrologic transport by affecting the hydrologic and chemical conditions in the subsurface system.

Model Predictive Control (MPC) started gaining attention three decades ago for optimal transitions between operating modes. Nonlinear MPC converts a constrained control problem of a nonlinear system into an optimization problem. This basic architecture makes Nonlinear MPC capable of handling large state-space multi-variable systems with constraints, and dealing with model-mismatches and disturbances readily.\n\nThe computation time of control policy is required to be less than one sampling time for online operation. However, this requirement is most of the times impossible to meet when the system has high nonlinearity. That becomes one of the most significant reasons holding back the application of Nonlinear MPC. As a result, there is strong motivation to develop an advanced formulation of Nonlinear MPC that demands less computational effort and thus decides the control actions faster.\n\nThe primary focus of this thesis is to develop an advanced formulation of Nonlinear MPC that decreases the amount of computational effort in order to circumvent feedback delay, to improve controller performance and to maintain stability of the system. Multiple mathematics tools combined with optimization techniques are implemented for the purpose of accelerated searching algorithms. The optimal control problem is formulated as a receding horizon one. An optimization problem is solved at each time the finite horizon moves on. Based on Carleman Linearization, the states of the system are extended to higher orders following the Kronecker product rule. The nonlinear dynamic process can thus be modeled with a bilinear representation while keeping nonlinear dynamic information. It enables analytical anticipation of system states and provides the searching algorithm with analytically computed sensitivity of the cost function to the control signals. The proposed method resembles both collocation and shooting methods for the following reasons. First, the states of the system are discretized explicitly in time while the sensitivity of the control signals is computed analytically. Second, the states are nonlinear functions of the control signals, releasing the optimization problem from equality constraints and reducing the number of design variables. \n\nThis thesis presents an introduction to MPC, Carleman Linearization and detailed derivations of the proposed method in Chapter 1 and 2. It also provides detailed description of resetting extended states to compensate for the simulation errors caused by Carleman Linearization as an independent Chapter 3.

A magnetic sensor is a system or device that can measure the magnitude of a magnetic field or each of its vector components. Usually the techniques encompass many aspects of physics and electronics. The common technologies used for magnetic field sensing include induction coil sensors, fluxgate, SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device), Hall effect, giant magnetoresistance, magnetostrictive/piezoelectric composites, and MEMS (microelectromechanical systems)-based magnetic sensors. Magnetic sensors have found a broad range of applications for many decades. For example, ultra sensitive magnetic sensors are able to detect tiny magnetic fields produced outside the brain by the neuronal currents which can be used for diagnostic application. Measuring the brain's magnetic field is extremely challenging because they are so weak, have strengths of 0.1-1 pT and thus requiring magnetic sensors with sub-picotesla sensitivity. In fact, to date, these measurements can only performed with the most sensitive magnetic sensors, i.e., SQUID. However, such detectors need expensive and cumbersome cryogenics to operate. Additionally, the thermal insulation of the sensors prevents them from being placed very closed to the tissues under study, thereby preventing high-resolution measurement capability. All of these severely limit their broad usage and proliferation for biomedical imaging, diagnosis, and research.\n\nA novel ultra-sensitive magnetic sensor capable of operating at room temperature is investigated in this thesis. Magnetoelectric effect is a material phenomenon featuring the interchange between the magnetic and electric energies or signals. The large ME effect observed in ME composites, especially the ME laminates consisting of magnetostrictive and piezoelectric components shows a promise to make novel ultra-sensitive magnetic sensors capable of operating at room temperature. To achieve such a high sensitivity (~pT level), piezoelectric sensors are materialized through ME composite laminates, provided piezo-sensors are among the most sensitive while being passive devices at the same time. To further improve the sensitivity and reduce the $frac{1}{f}$ noise level, several approaches are used such as magnetic flux concentration effect, which is a function of the Metglas sheet aspect ratio, and resonance enhancement. Taking advantage of this effect, the ME voltage coefficient $alpha_{ME}$=21.46 V/cm$cdot$Oe for Metglas 2605SA1/PVDF laminates and $alpha_{ME}$=46.7 V/cm$cdot$Oe for Metglas 2605CO/PVDF laminates. The resonance response of Metglas/PZT lamintes in FF (Free-Free), FC (Free-Clamped), and CC (Clamped-Clamped) modes are also investigated. $alpha_{ME}$=301.6 V/cm$cdot$Oe and the corresponding SNR=4$\times$10$^7$ $sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$/Oe are achieved for FC mode at resonance frequencies. In addition to this, testing setups were built to characterize the magnetic sensors. LABVIEW codes were also developed to automatize the measurements and consequently get accurate results.\n\nThen two commonly used integration methods, i.e., hybrid method and system in package (SIP), are discussed. Then the intrinsic noise analysis including dielectric loss noise, which dominates the intrinsic noise sources, and magnetostrictive noise is introduced. A charge mode readout circuit is made for hybrid method and a voltage mode readout circuit is made for SIP method. For sensors, since SNR is very important since it determines the minimum signal it can detect, the SNR of each configuration is discussed in detail. For charge mode circuit, by taking advantage of the multilayer PVDF configuration, SNR=7.2$\times$10$^5$ $sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$/Oe is achieved at non-resonance frequencies and SNR=2$\times$10$^7$ $sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$/Oe is achieved at resonance frequencies. For voltage mode circuit, a constant SNR=3$\times$10$^3$ $sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$/Oe is achieved at non-resonance frequencies. Both of the advantages and disadvantages of each method are also discussed.\n\nPiezoelectric single crystal PMN-PT with optimum orientation and cut direction is developed to increase the ME coefficient $alpha_{ME}$ and reduce the intrinsic dielectric loss noise, consequently to improve the SNR of the ME sensors. For Metlgas/PMN-PT laminates, SNR=3.9$\times$10$^6$ $sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$/Oe is achieved at non-resonance frequencies and SNR=7.3$\times$10$^8$ $sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$/Oe is achieved at resonance frequencies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6966], "author_name_tesi": "Fang, Zhao ", "last_name_ssi": "Fang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Suman Datta", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Qing X Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Suman Datta, Committee Chair", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Qing X Yang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microelectronics", "magnetostrictive", "magnetic sensors"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Summer graduation", "id": "13082zxf113", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13082", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " For tight unconventional gas reservoir formations, such as shale or coal, the transient \u2018pulse-decay\u2019 technique is a time-effective method to experimentally estimate the rock permeability from the pressure versus time profile data. Currently the analytical solution of permeability that is derived based on the expression of simulated pressure profile has been widely used (Cui et al., 2009). However, this solution may lead to erroneous results because the assumption of constant gas properties is not always valid. Besides, the permeability solution is obtained by making simulated pressure profile and experimental pressure curve have the same late-time slope. In some cases, however, different pressure decay characteristics are observed demonstrating the huge differences between simulated and experimental pressure profiles and the invalidity of the permeability result. To overcome these limitations, in this study a new method of permeability measurement is designed. Finite difference method is used to solve the governing equation numerically and reproduce the experimental pressure profile. Pressure-dependent gas properties are incorporated in numerical simulation, and permeability is obtained when the differences between simulated and experimental pressure profiles are minimum. The minimum differences ensure similar pressure decay characteristics and can be quantified by the history-matching method. This new approach was tested by measuring permeability from pulse-decay experiments conducted on Illinois coal; the types of tested gases included helium, methane and carbon dioxide. The results show improved permeability values compared with the analytical solutions of Cui et al. (2009). Two factors contained in this proposed numerical approach result in the improvement: (1) be able to apply pressure-dependent gas properties; (2) using the whole pressure profile to capture the pressure decay dynamics so that improved gas permeability estimation can be provided. Finally, sensitivity analysis is carried out. It is found that the second factor is more influential in determining permeability in this study, and the numerically estimated permeability is not sensitive to porosity, Langmuir pressure and Langmuir volume, which is an advantage for the reliable permeability estimation through the pulse-decay technique.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15352], "author_name_tesi": "Fang, Zhicheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Fang", "first_name_ssi": "Zhicheng", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shimin Liu", "Chaopeng Shen", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shimin Liu, Thesis Advisor", "Chaopeng Shen, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Permeability", "Pulse-decay experiment", "Analytical solution", "Numerical simulation", "History-matching method", "Pressure-dependent gas properties"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Growth of single crystal silicon carbide by halide chemical vapor deposition\n", "id": "7976", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3958", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Semiconductor grade single crystals of SiC were first produced in the late 1950\u2019s by Lely in Germany and by Hamilton in the United States.  Over the last 30 years this process has been improved and scaled to produce single crystal boules that yield 4\u201d diameter wafers.  These substrates are of interest for two primary classes of semiconductor devices because of its excellent thermal and high temperature electrical properties compared to competing substrates such as Si, GaAs, or sapphire.  For high frequency radar applications semi-insulating SiC wafers are used as substrates for GaN/AlGaN epitaxy.  Production of high resistivity material relies on careful control of the concentrations of impurities and point defects in the single crystal.  Trace amounts of boron and nitrogen are of particular concern as they act as residual p-type and n-type dopants respectively.  Silicon carbide is also an ideal semiconductor for high voltage and high temperature power switching devices such as Schottky diodes, PiN diodes, and MOSFET\u2019s.  The most challenging aspect of SiC substrate production and epitaxial layer growth for power switching applications is the elimination of structural defects that lead to device failure.  \nMany of the shortcomings of conventional SiC growth processes can be overcome through the use of a novel halide chemical vapor deposition (HCVD) process for bulk SiC and thick SiC epitaxial layers.  The HCVD process provides significant advantages over the conventional physical vapor transport (PVT) process for bulk crystal growth and silane-based CVD for growth of epitaxial layers.  However, the HCVD technique requires the balance of several competing processes in order to successfully grow large crystals and high quality epitaxial layers.  A detailed study of halide chemical vapor deposition is required to understand the relationships between crystal growth conditions and the resulting structural properties of the SiC deposited.  \nThe goal of this thesis is to understand relationships between the major process variables and the growth rate, doping, and defect density of SiC grown by HCVD.  Specifically this work addresses the maximum C/Si ratios that can be utilized for single crystal SiC growth by providing a thermodynamic model for determining the boundary between single crystal growth and SiC+C mixed phase growth in the Si-C-Cl-H system.  The impact of growth conditions, especially the C/Si ratio, on doping and overall structural quality are assessed within the boundaries determined by the thermodynamic model.\nSiC epitaxial layers ranging from 50-200\u00b5m thick were grown at temperatures near 2000\u00b0C on 6H and 4H-SiC substrates at rates up to 250\u00b5m/hr.  Experimental trends in the growth rate as a function of precursor flow rates and temperature closely match those expected from thermodynamic equilibrium in a closed system.  The equilibrium model can be used to predict the trends in growth rate with the changes in precursor flow rates as well as the boundary between deposition of pure SiC and deposition of a mixture of SiC and C.  Calculation of the boundary position in terms of the SiCl4 and CH4 concentrations provides an upper limit on the C/Si ratio that can be achieved for any given set of crystal growth conditions.  The model can be adjusted for changes in temperature, pressure, and chlorine concentration as well.  The boundary between phase pure and mixed phase growth was experimentally shown to be very abrupt, thereby providing a well defined window for Si-rich and C-rich growth conditions.\nGrowth of SiC epitaxial layers by HCVD under both Si-rich and C-rich conditions generally yielded the same trends in dopant incorporation as those observed in conventional silane-based CVD processes.  Nitrogen incorporation was highest on the C-face of 4H-SiC substrates but could be reduced to concentrations as low as 1x1015 atoms/cm3 at C/Si ratios greater than 1.  Residual B concentrations were slightly higher for epitaxial layers grown on the Si-face of substrates. However, changes in the C/Si ratio had no effect on B incorporation at concentrations on the order of 1x1015 atoms/cm3.\nNo significant trends in structural quality or defect density were evident as the C/Si ratio was varied from 0.72 to 1.81.  Structural quality and defect density were more closely related to substrate off-cut and polarity.  The highest quality crystals were grown on the C-face of 4\u00b0 off-axis substrates as measured by HRXRD rocking curves.  Growth on on-axis substrates was most successful on the C-face, although the x-ray rocking curves were nearly twice as wide as those on off-axis substrates.  Etch pit densities obtained by KOH etching layers grown on Si-face substrates were closely related to the defect density of the substrate not the C/Si ratio.  \nThick p-type layers with B or Al dopant concentrations on the order of 1019 atoms/cm3 were readily achieved with the HCVD process.  Trimethylaluminum and BCl3 were successfully employed as dopant sources.  Aluminum incorporation was sensitive to both the substrate surface polarity and the C/Si ratio employed for growth.  Dopant concentrations were maximized under C-rich growth conditions on the Si-face of SiC substrates.  Boron incorporation was insensitive to both the surface polarity of the substrate and the C/Si used for layer growth even though B appears to favor incorporation on Si lattice sites.  Boron acceptors in HCVD grown SiC are not passivated by H to any significant extent based on a comparison of net acceptor concentrations and B doping concentrations.  In addition, the lattice parameters epitaxial layers doped with B at concentrations on the order of 1019 atoms/cm3 showed no change as a function of B concentration.  This was in contrast to the lattice parameter decrease as expected from a comparison between the size of the Si and B atoms.  \n\tThe HCVD process has demonstrated an order of magnitude higher growth rates than conventional SiC CVD and while providing control over the C/Si ratio. This allows the user to directly influence dopant incorporation and growth morphology.  However, this control should also permit several other material properties to be tailored.  Future work should focus on determining the range of C/Si ratios required to achieve specific material characteristics.  Electronic and structural defects should be the primary focus since they directly impact SiC device design and performance.   \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3930], "author_name_tesi": "Fanton, Mark ", "last_name_ssi": "Fanton", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Joseph R Flemish", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Thomas R Shrout"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Chair", "Joseph R Flemish, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Thomas R Shrout, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chemical vapor deposition", "silicon carbide", "epitaxy"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CONTROL OF THE PERMEABILITY OF FRACTURES IN GEOTHERMAL ROCKS\n\n\n", "id": "10470", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2453", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis comprises three journal articles that will be submitted for publication (Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth).

In this study we report on flow-through fracture experiments on cracked westerly cores that reproduce, at laboratory scale, those (steps like) permeability changes that have been recorded when earthquakes occur. In particular our experiments show that under specific test boundary conditions, rapid increments of pore pressure induce transient variations of flow rate of the fracture whose peak magnitudes decrease as the variations of the effective stresses increase. We identify that the observed hydraulic behavior of the fracture is due to two principal mechanisms of origin; respectively mechanical (shortening of core) and poro\u2013elastic (radial diffusion of the pore fluid into the matrix of the sample) whose interaction cause respectively an instantaneous opening and then a progressive closure of the fracture.\nEvolution of Stiffness and Permeability in Fractures Subject to Thermally-and Mechanically-Activated Dissolution: we report the results of radial flow-through experiments conducted on heated samples of Westerly granite. These experiments are performed to examine the influence of thermally and mechanically activated dissolution on the mechanical (stiffness) and transport (stress-permeability) characteristics of fractures. The sample is thermally stressed to 80C and measurements of the constrained axial stress acting on the sample and of the flow rate of the fracture are recorded with time. Net efflux of dissolved mineral mass is also measured periodically to provide a record of rates of net mass removal. During the experiment the fracture permeability shows high sensitivity to the changing conditions of stress and temperature but no significant permanent variation of permeability have been recorded once the thermal cycle ends.  \nLinking permeability and mechanical damage for basalt from Mt. Etna volcano (Italy): volcanic edifices, such as Mt. Etna volcano (Italy), are affected from repeated episodes of pressurization due to magma emplacement from deep reservoirs to shallow depths.  This mechanism pressurizes the large aquifers within the edifice and increases the level of crack damage within the rocks of the edifice over extended periods of times. In order to improve our understanding of the complex coupling between circulating fluids and the development of crack damage we performed flow-through tests using cylindrical cores of Etna Basalt (Etna, Italy) cyclically loaded either by constant increments of the principal stress: sigma1 (deviatoric condition), or by increments of the effective confining pressure: sigma1 =sigma2 = sigma3 (isostatic conditions). Under hydrostatic stresses, the permeability values of the intact sample decrease linearly with the increments of pressure and range between 5.2*10-17 m^2 and 1.5*10-17 m^2. At deviatoric stresses (up to 60 MPa) the permeability from the initial value of 5*10-17 m^2 slightly decays to the minimum value of 2*10-17 m^2 observed when the axial deviatoric stresses range between 40 MPa and 60 MPa. For higher deviatoric stresses, increases to 10-16 m^2 are then observed up to the peak stress at 92 MPa. After failure the permeability persisted steady at the value of 8*10-16 m^2 for the whole duration of the test, independently from the applied stress. We interpreted the decrease observed as due to the progressive closure of the voids space,   as the axial load is incremented.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2436], "author_name_tesi": "Faoro, Igor ", "last_name_ssi": "Faoro", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Igor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Derek Elsworth", "Chris Marone", "Charles James Ammon", "Demian Saffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth, Dissertation Advisor", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Chair", "Chris Marone, Committee Chair", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Demian Saffer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["TCHM properties of fractures", "permeability"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Carl McIntire and his Crusade Against the Fairness Doctrine", "id": "10479", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4883", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the role that fundamentalist radio commentator Carl McIntire and his station, WXUR, played in the demise of the Fairness Doctrine.  McIntire\u2019s \u201ccrusade\u201d against the Federal Communications Commission and the Fairness Doctrine brought national attention to the doctrine.  This attention influenced the FCC, and in 1987, the Commission repealed this regulatory policy.  WXUR is the only radio or television station in American history to be denied license renewal by the FCC as a direct result of Fairness Doctrine violations.  This dissertation argues that McIntire and WXUR are underappreciated factors that contributed to the demise of the doctrine.  \n\nIntroduced in 1959 when Congress amended the 1934 Communications Act, the doctrine required radio and television stations to meet two requirements:  (1) devote a reasonable percentage of broadcast time to discussions of issues of public importance within the community the licensee served, and (2) design and provide programs so that the public had a reasonable opportunity to hear different and opposing views and arguments on the public issues of interest within that community.  \n\nIn 1970, 17 years before the Fairness Doctrine\u2019s demise, McIntire and WXUR were denied license renewal by the FCC and forced off the air because the station, according to the Commission, did not make reasonable efforts to comply with the doctrine.  Despite their historical significance with regards to the Fairness Doctrine, McIntire and WXUR have been largely ignored by media studies scholars.  While volumes of research related to the Fairness Doctrine have been produced by media studies scholars, few academics outside of religious studies have explored the fascinating career of Carl McIntire.  And no one has provided a detailed account of McIntire and WXUR\u2019s role in the eventual repeal of the Fairness Doctrine.  This dissertation addresses this oversight.  \n\nMcIntire and WXUR must be recognized for their role in the history of governmental regulation of speech in the United States.  McIntire launched a national crusade against the Fairness Doctrine, using his radio station, WXUR - a station licensed by the FCC and obligated to meet the Commission\u2019s fairness requirements \u2013 as the primary tool in his campaign.  His crusade against the doctrine influenced the opinions of lawmakers, policymakers, the courts and the American public regarding the FCC\u2019s fairness rules.  In his campaign, which he conducted through the 1960s and early 1970s, McIntire wasted no opportunity to expose the problems he perceived with the Fairness Doctrine.  He blazed a path for another campaign against the doctrine, one conducted by the Freedom of Expression Foundation during the 1980s.  The Freedom of Expression Foundation employed strategies similar to those utilized by McIntire in an effort to press lawmakers and the FCC to re-examine the \u201cfairness\u201d of the Fairness Doctrine.  Ultimately, the FCC abandoned this regulatory policy in 1987.  \n\nMcIntire\u2019s legacy in American broadcasting, however, did not end when the FCC suspended its fairness requirements.  The Fairness Doctrine\u2019s demise has contributed to a resurgence of politically conservative commentary on America\u2019s radio airwaves in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.  Today, the nation\u2019s talk radio stations are dominated by politically conservative commentators, thanks, at least in part, to the path cleared by McIntire decades earlier.  \n\nThis dissertation seeks to increase our understanding of McIntire and WXUR and their underappreciated contribution in shaping not only communication policy in the United States, but also America\u2019s contemporary talk radio landscape.  Research for the study draws from an on-line collection of radio broadcasts and sermons by McIntire;  The Christian Beacon, a weekly publication McIntire launched in 1936 to complement his radio broadcasts;  books McIntire authored;  FCC records and various legal cases and related regulatory proceedings; and a number of contemporary periodicals.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4860], "author_name_tesi": "Farabaugh, Patrick Gordon", "last_name_ssi": "Farabaugh", "middle_name_ssi": "Gordon", "first_name_ssi": "Patrick", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell Frank", "Russell Frank", "James Ford Risley", "Patrick Robert Parsons", "Errol Anthony Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell Frank, Dissertation Advisor", "Russell Frank, Committee Chair", "James Ford Risley, Committee Member", "Patrick Robert Parsons, Committee Member", "Errol Anthony Henderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fairness Doctrine", "Carl McIntire", "WXUR", "freedom of speech", "freedom of the press", "First Amendment", "Federal Communications Commission", "talk radio", "telecommunications policy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The influence of induction therapy and diabetes on\ngraft failure after kidney transplant\n", "id": "28908", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12080", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\nBackground: Induction therapy plays a significant role in reducing the rate of acute rejection in kidney transplantation (KT). Understanding differences in outcomes associated with various induction agents may lead to improvement in long-term care. Our objective was to examine the association of various induction therapies and diabetes with the risk of graft failure and patient mortality after KT.\n\nMethods: We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) between 2000 and 2013. We included only kidney transplantation patients who were maintained only on tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids. We had 92,829 patients who were categorized into four groups based on induction therapy: basiliximab (n=23,531), daclizumab (n=14,563), rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) (n=51,497) and alemtuzumab (n=3,238). All patients. The primary outcomes were graft failure and patient mortality. Cox proportional hazards models were used to model time to event after adjusting for patients and disease characteristics.\n\nResults: Graft failure was significantly higher in the r-ATG group (HR=1.047; 95% CI, 1.007 to 1.088; P= 0.0201) than the basiliximab group. However, the daclizumab group had lower risk for graft failure (HR=0.922; 95 % CI, 0.879 to 0.968; P= 0.0009). Graft failure was non-significantly higher in alemtuzumab group (HR=1.099; 95% CI, 0.994 to 1.216; P=0.0666). Patient death was significantly lower in the daclizumab group (HR=0.892; 95% CI, 0.830 to 0.958; P=0.0018) than the basiliximab group, whereas, patient death was non-significantly higher in the r-ATG group (HR=1.041; 95% CI, 0.984 to 1.101; P=0.163) and the alemtuzumab group (HR=0.978; 95% CI, 0.837 to 1.142; P= 0.7786. Diabetic status has a significant impact on graft failure and patient death. Graft failure was significantly higher in Type 2 diabetes than Type 1 and new-onset diabetes while the patient death was significantly higher in Type1 diabetes than Type 2 and new-onset diabetes.\n\nConclusion: Daclizumab has better long-term graft survival outcomes than basiliximab and antithymocyte globulin (r-ATG). It also has better long-term patient survival outcomes than basiliximab. In general IL2-RA receptor antagonists group (Basiliximab and Daclizumab) have better long-term graft survival outcomes than antithymocyte globulin (r-ATG) when tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids were used as maintenance therapy.

However, optimizing the genetic code to maximize the performance of these organisms is a time- and labor-intensive process, and has remained a challenge for decades, particularly when measurement throughput is limited. Here, we developed a systematic workflow for optimizing multi-component genetic systems. This includes employing biophysical modeling to build quantitative maps that relate a genetic system\u2019s DNA sequence to the expression rate of its genetic elements and final phenotypic activity. We used these maps to optimize three types of genetic systems: metabolic pathways, genetic circuits, and CRISPR/(d)Cas9 systems. For each type of system, we first performed a minimal number of experiments to systematically develop a biophysical sequence-expression-activity map (SEAMAP), which was then used to optimize the genetic system at the DNA sequence level. We showed that designing experiments, based on governing biophysics, substantially reduces the time and effort needed to optimize performance of genetic systems. We also created a protein expression optimization framework, the RBS Library Calculator, to automatically generate an efficient pool of mutants with maximum diversity for building these biophysics-based maps. This framework facilitates altering the expression rate of every protein in a multi-protein genetic system with a minimal number of experiments. We employed this framework to alter the expression rate of 21 proteins of different classes by up to 100,000-fold: 10 enzymes in three metabolic pathways, T7 RNA polymerase and 4 transcription factors in three analog genetic circuits, and 6 individual proteins in diverse gram-negative and gram-positive microbes", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11017, 11018], "author_name_tesi": "Farasat, Iman ", "last_name_ssi": "Farasat", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Iman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Howard M Salis", "Howard M Salis", "Ali Borhan", "Timothy Charles Meredith", "Costas D Maranas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Howard M Salis, Dissertation Advisor", "Howard M Salis, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Timothy Charles Meredith, Committee Member", "Costas D Maranas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metabolic pathway", "genetic circuit", "CRISPR", "Cas9", "modeling", "combinatorial optimization", "protein expression", "optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Ethical Reading and the Medieval Artes Amandi: The Rise of the Didactic in Andreas Capellanus, Jean de Meun, and John Gower\n", "id": "12509", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "220", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ovid, in his Ars amatoria, adopts the didactic framework in order to elevate the tradition of Latin love elegy and make a name for himself as a poet.

The twenty-first century promises to be a time of great change for the Christian Church in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The relationship between Chinese Christians and their government is complex and controversial. This situation has elicited a great deal of scholarly interest in recent years, but studies of the literature of Chinese Christianity are practically nonexistent. Our focus here is limited to the present-day situation in China, specifically to the literature of the last quarter-century.\nThe U.S. and China continue to have strongly contrasting meta-narrative national visions. This difference in how the two nations \u201ctell\u201d themselves seems an insuperable barrier to effective international communication and compromise on human rights. At the same time, the Christian and Marxist underpinnings to their respective nationalisms give these nations a common ground that makes their competition even more fierce and more closely tied to religion: the U.S. and the PRC both have missionary ideologies inextricably linked to their nationalisms. Religious narratives, therefore, will continue to be fundamental to matters of grave international concern.\nMany recent fictional narratives by U.S. and Chinese writers\u2014this study covers Amy Tan, Maxine Hong Kingston, Mo Yan, and Bei Cun among others\u2014provide, at the most basic level, mimetic accounts of Chinese Christianity, but these texts also reveal meta-narrative levels of meaning. Like political and missionary narratives, these works of fiction partake in and are shaped by national, racial, and religious meta-narratives. Western readers have often been given incomplete and distorted narratives about religion in China and are only beginning to adjust their notions of authentic Chineseness to include the reality of indigenous Chinese Christianity.\nHow this Chinese Christianity looks, of course, is sometimes different from American Christianity and different from what many Americans would expect or prefer. Chinese Christian identity in the mainland today, even more uniformly than American Christian identity, is bound up with national pride and normally too (admitting a strongly dissenting minority voice) with at least a modicum of support for China\u2019s ruling authorities.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4598], "author_name_tesi": "Faries, Nathan Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Faries", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Nathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Dr Alexander C Y Huang", "On Cho Ng", "John Philip Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Chair", "Dr Alexander C Y Huang, Committee Member", "On Cho Ng, Committee Member", "John Philip Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Christianity in China", "Religion and Literature", "Contemporary Chinese Christianity", "Contemporary Chinese Literature", "American Literature about China", "Missionary Narratives"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Rhetoric, Social Media, and Privacy", "id": "15654", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7984", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates notions and practices related to privacy in social media environments. I argue for a social and rhetorical understanding of privacy in social media environments, involving attention to how the affordances of digital media affect how privacy is practiced in these environments. For example, the aggregation of data in digital media means that control over access to information is thoroughly distributed throughout one\u2019s social network online: one\u2019s privacy is as much dependent upon others\u2019 practices and user settings as it is on one\u2019s own. \nIn order to explore privacy in these environments, I analyze popular discourses about privacy online, user interfaces, and user practices related to privacy in these environments. I explore four concepts interrelated to privacy: materiality, identity, intimacy, and sociability. Chapter 2 explores the material practices of managing privacy in public spaces using objects, including mobile phones and laptops, arguing that despite popular narratives that users do not have a sense of place when cocooned behind devices, that people use these devices in contextual ways in order to engage in their environments and manage privacy. \nChapter 3 explores how identity shifts in online environments: Identity now becomes a series of digital traces that people use in order to construct others\u2019 identities through their private information posted in various locations online. Private information is now externalized and less secure online. Chapter 4 explores the moral panic around sexting, the sharing of nude or sexually provocative images and text through text messages on mobile phones. This chapter argues that the moral panic blames young girls and women for their indiscretions disproportionately compared to those who violate privacy by forwarding images on. Privacy is incredibly gendered, and our culture has yet to extend the sorts of expectations and rights of privacy to women and girls as it extends to boys and men.\nIn Chapter 5, I argue that grand narratives about declining sociability ignore the situated material and embodied practices of sociability in environments. I argue that in order to understand how shifts in privacy practices affect sociability, scholars need to attend to the specific architectures and embodied practices of users within specific ecologies.\n\tThis project concludes with a heuristic for digital literacies of privacy in social media environments, outlined in the concluding chapter. I argue for a set of practices that involves functional, critical, and rhetorical literate practices that can be practiced in a variety of contexts.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7930], "author_name_tesi": "Faris, Michael James", "last_name_ssi": "Faris", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stuart Selber", "Debra Hawhee", "John L Selzer", "Robert Lawrence Caserio Jr.", "Lynette Marie Yarger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stuart Selber, Dissertation Advisor", "Debra Hawhee, Committee Member", "John L Selzer, Committee Member", "Robert Lawrence Caserio Jr., Committee Member", "Lynette Marie Yarger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rhetoric", "social media", "privacy", "technology", "digital media", "literacies", "digital literacy", "writing studies"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A Portraiture Study of an African American Male on His Journey to High School Graduation", "id": "9w032300g", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12570", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Presented as a counter-story to the narrative of deficit thinking regarding African Americans, this portraiture study about Vincent Clark\u2019s high school journey was guided by the question of what and/or who motivated and supported him to return to (after over a year in jail) and graduate from high school.

In the first, I study the dynamics of changes in the leverage choices made by hedge fund managers and the implications for investors.  Using SEC and commercial hedge fund database information, I examine the time-series and cross section of hedge fund leverage and find that, overall, hedge fund leverage changes are not driven by certain return-driven motivations, such as levering up before profitable times or in order to take advantage of concentrated investment opportunities.  Instead, hedge fund leverage changes are driven primarily by risk mitigation measures, which may be imposed by external actors, such as prime brokers.  Hedge funds lever down during volatile times and when risk spreads are high.  Interestingly, when hedge fund leverage is perturbed by fund flows, I find no evidence that managers trade to return to a target leverage within four quarters.   Thus overall hedge fund leverage may be the result of the fund\u2019s flow history, rather than predetermined leverage targets.  In the second study, I examine hedge fund inceptions.  New hedge funds may come into being because managers observe high demand for certain types of funds and create them to absorb this demand, or alternatively as a result of an innovative investment idea.  I create empirical proxies that allow me to distinguish the two types of inceptions and show that funds that came about because of the supply of managerial investment from those that came about because of investor demand.  Inceptions of the former type outperform those of the latter by a significant 4 to 5% annually over the first five years.  In my third study, I use a special environment, a platform of hedge fund separate accounts, as a laboratory to examine the role of share restrictions and third-party evaluation in hedge fund returns.  Separate accounts are tied to existing funds but have much lower share restrictions and feature third-party return evaluation.  By comparing separate account and main fund returns for the same funds, I find that a reduction in share restrictions leads to a performance penalty of 1.7% per year.  Also, the high liquidity and third party evaluation leads to reported returns that feature 33% less serial correlation.  This latter result suggests that managers in the main fund use discretion in reporting practices to induce serial correlation in the reported returns of their main fund, which would lead to artificially good performance in risk-adjusted evaluation metrics for those funds.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11418], "author_name_tesi": "Farnsworth, Grant Verdell", "last_name_ssi": "Farnsworth", "middle_name_ssi": "Verdell", "first_name_ssi": "Grant", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy T Simin", "Jared Williams", "Matthew Todd Lange Gustafson", "Quanwei Cao", "Jeremiah Ross Green"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy T Simin, Dissertation Advisor", "Jared Williams, Committee Member", "Matthew Todd Lange Gustafson, Committee Member", "Quanwei Cao, Committee Member", "Jeremiah Ross Green, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hedge funds", "share restrictions"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Supporting creativity: Investigating the role of awareness in distributed collaboration", "id": "8661", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6365", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Creativity is the cornerstone of collaborative scientific work. As distributed collaboration is becoming an increasingly dominant model of creative scientific work that goes on in our daily lives, it is essential to understand how creativity can be supported in such contexts. The objective of this dissertation is to investigate the feasibility, effectiveness, and consequences of supporting creativity with computer-supported awareness in distributed collaboration. This research is conducted in five phases. The first phase is a survey of creativity literature to speculate how awareness, and in particular activity awareness, can support creativity in distributed collaboration. The second phase is an exploratory experiment that identifies four breakdowns in creativity in distributed collaboration. The third phase is the design and prototyping of three novel activity awareness strategies and mechanisms to support creativity. The fourth phase is a main experiment that studies the effectiveness and consequences of using the activity awareness mechanisms. The fifth phase validates results from the main experiment through follow-up analysis. \n\nThe results show that groups with activity awareness support were more likely to be among the most creative than groups without activity awareness support. 62% of the groups with activity awareness support were ranked in the upper tier of being creative versus 37.5% of the groups without activity awareness support. The most significant results involved structured activity updates, one of the three activity awareness mechanisms, which allowed group members to update and share their work status. The structured activity updates increased awareness of group members with respect to what they had worked on. Further, the structured activity updates increased awareness of group members over time with respect to what they will do next, a relationship that was stronger for the groups with structured activity updates than groups without structured activity updates. Group members with higher metacognitive knowledge found the structured activity updates more useful than group members with lower metacognitive knowledge. \n\nThis dissertation contributes to the basic science of creativity, to the design science of supporting creative activity, and to the empirical science of measuring creativity. The application of creativity theories from the social sciences in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) contexts improves our general understanding of creative collaboration. Second, prototypes of awareness mechanisms broaden the science of design by developing new tools for supporting creativity. Third, extension of existing evaluation metrics and frameworks advances our ability to measure creativity using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The broader impact of this dissertation is to enhance the process and product of creative collaboration.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6365], "author_name_tesi": "Farooq, Umer ", "last_name_ssi": "Farooq", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Umer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Millar Carroll", "C Lee Giles", "Christopher Hoadley", "Mary Beth Rosson", "James Lewis Farr", "Rosalie Ocker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Millar Carroll, Committee Chair", "C Lee Giles, Committee Member", "Christopher Hoadley, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Rosson, Committee Member", "James Lewis Farr, Committee Member", "Rosalie Ocker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["creativity", "awareness", "human computer interaction", "computer supported cooperative work"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Urban Mosaics: Multiracial Diversity and Segregation in the American Metropolis\n\n\n\n", "id": "6807", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1126", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Racial segregation in housing is a familiar feature of the urban landscape and continues to play a key role in race relations, urban politics, and economic and educational inequality. Past investigations of residential segregation have typically focused on black-white dichotomies that exclude rapidly growing Latino and Asian metropolitan populations. Moreover, most urban segregation research examines broader metropolitan areas but fails to look at how community (i.e., city and suburb) differences within these areas also contribute to overall neighborhood segregation. This dissertation presents theoretical and methodological approaches which incorporate a more representative mosaic of racial/ethnic groups and account for the multi-layered geographic structure of segregation. Using census data from 1990 and 2000 for the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, I employ measures of multi-group diversity and segregation at different geographic levels to address the demographic realities of contemporary racial segregation. \n\nThis research reveals a number of important patterns and trends: 1) suburban communities experienced pervasive gains in multiracial diversity during the 1990s but there persists a white/nonwhite, inner-ring/outer-ring divide; 2) most metropolitan areas became less segregated during the 1990s; 3) central city neighborhoods desegregated rapidly during this period, accounting for most of the overall declines in metropolitan segregation; 4) racial differences between suburban communities contributed to an increasing share of metropolitan segregation in 2000 compared to 1990, especially in the western region; 5) most white metropolitan residents experienced increasing exposure to multiracial diversity in their neighborhoods, though neighborhoods with high rates of white homeownership have been particularly resistant to change; 6) the number of homogenous black, Latino, and Asian neighborhoods increased but most minority residents live in more diverse areas; 7) immigration is associated with higher levels of multiracial diversity in communities and neighborhoods. \n\nThese findings illustrate that the decade of the 1990s was characterized by increasing multiracial diversity in metropolitan neighborhoods and communities, a movement toward greater racial residential integration. However, these diversity gains have been incremental and many metropolitan areas remain bifurcated along white/nonwhite lines. Rather than resulting in a fragmented checkerboard of spatial niches and enclaves, immigration fuels multiracial diversity at the local level.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1115], "author_name_tesi": "Farrell, Chad R.", "last_name_ssi": "Farrell", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Chad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barrett Alan Lee", "Glenn A Firebaugh", "Susan Welch", "Marylee Carmel Taylor", "Mark Hill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barrett Alan Lee, Committee Chair", "Glenn A Firebaugh, Committee Member", "Susan Welch, Committee Member", "Marylee Carmel Taylor, Committee Member", "Mark Hill, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["suburban", "race", "housing", "segregation", "neighborhoods", "urban"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "A Platform-Based Methodology for the Redesign of Low Volume Highly Customized Products", "id": "7835", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5318", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<P>The new paradigm of mass customization has emerged in industry and is transforming markets by making product variety affordable with the ultimate goal of achieving mass production costs of individually customized goods and services.  Achieving this goal requires a methodology for providing product variety without losing the commonality of parts needed to maintain the economies of scale inherent in mass production.  In addition to the use of modularity, an emerging complementary approach is to develop a product platform consisting of common components and processes from which a family of variant products is generated.  Although product platforms have successfully improved economies of scale and scope for large companies, it is questionable whether similar success can be achieved within small companies that produce highly customized products at low volume, and the focus of this research is to develop a product platform and design methodology for low volume, highly customized products.

The methodology addresses these questions by building upon existing research regarding product platform portfolio design utilizing so called bottom-up platform design techniques.  A detailed methodology is presented for transforming an existing product line of low volume highly customized product into a virtual product platform portfolio through targeted component redesign.  In addition, an algorithm is presented for implementing a virtual product platform portfolio through a web-based interface that allows the early incorporation of custom design requirements into the design process and includes strategies for designing custom features on demand through an engineer-to-order approach.

While there have been many studies on accurate prediction of penetration rate with some progress in accounting for various geological parameters, the amount of research performed on TBM utilization and advance rate is still very limited.\n The primary objective of this research was to develop a comprehensive database of TBM utilization and advance rate from different hard-rock tunneling projects using a TBM to develop a new model for estimation of machine utilization and advance rate through statistical analysis of available machine field performance information and a new rock mass characterization system. For this purpose, information for 300 tunnel projects, including rock properties, TBM specification, TBM operational parameters, and achieved performance were compiled in a database to seek significant correlations between these parameters. As the results of statistical analyses show, Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), Cerchar Abrasion Index (CAI), and Rock Quality Designation (RQD) are the most influential parameters in estimation of PR. For utilization factor, PR, UCS, groundwater condition, and tunnel diameter are the most influential parameters. The results of the analyses also indicate that tunnel diameter and UCS are among the primary parameters for prediction of advance rate. Good correlations between the actual and predicted values with R-sq of more than 60%  have been obtained in different statistical analyses.\n In this thesis, two methods for prediction of AR are offered. One comes from multiplication of the predicted PR and U (indirect methodology) and the other method comes from direct estimation of AR from input parameters. Even though these two ARs are not exactly the same (since the methodologies and the input parameters are different), the results are reasonably close to each other. Although  the indirect methodology has more flexibility in changing the related conditions for different down time components, it might produce more errors due to the combination of many parameters. On the other hand, the direct methodology benefits from more tunnel records compared to the indirect methodology and has more reliability. Hence, the direct method is proposed as the primary method for AR prediction and the indirect method is proposed as the supporting methodology to be used for more in-depth estimation using the analysis of different down time components. \nThe results of analyses for the learning phase period show that, on average, it takes one week per each meter of tunnel diameter. This should be reflected as an adjustment on the results of the analyses for the first sections of the tunnel after completing the AR prediction for the entire length of a tunnel. In order to account for parallel activities and the probability of the parameters values, four different models were developed and calibrated for the real data. The results of simulation modeling show a very good agreement with the actual values of TBM advance rate values.   \nThe outcome of this study is establishing a framework to assist in the prediction of the main components of TBM performance parameters. This will provide an extremely useful tool for developing reliable estimates of the machine advance rate used in estimating project time and costs for a specific site, ground condition, and machine type when all input variables are properly assigned.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8183], "author_name_tesi": "Farrokh, Ebrahim ", "last_name_ssi": "Farrokh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ebrahim", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamal Rostami", "Jamal Rostami", "Dr R Larry Grayson", "Antonio Nieto", "Dr Prasenjit Basu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamal Rostami, Dissertation Advisor", "Jamal Rostami, Committee Chair", "Dr R Larry Grayson, Committee Member", "Antonio Nieto, Committee Member", "Dr Prasenjit Basu, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["TBM", "Hard Rock", "Advance Rate", "Utilization", "Cutter Life", "Learning Phase"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ESSAYS ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN OIL", "id": "ff365524z", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13054", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Trade in natural resources occupies a small part of international trade literature. Oil alone, as the most traded natural resource, accounts for 12-15\\% of world trade in recent years. The literature on international trade has included the oil industry only in multi-sector frameworks designed for manufacturing rather than natural resources. The fields of industrial organization and energy economics lack a general equilibrium framework to put the oil industry into global perspective. \nBoth the specifics of this industry and a worldwide equilibrium analysis must come together to address trade-related questions on oil markets. I seek to further this objective.\n\nSpecifically, (i) patterns of oil trade, particularly for crude oil at the level of refineries are not well-documented. (ii) Refineries' sourcing behavior and trade frictions they face are not well-understood or not yet estimated. (iii) A multi-country general equilibrium model of oil trade that incorporates the specifics of this industry has not been designed to assess counterfactual policies. I address these three voids in three chapters.\n\nIn Chapter 1, I document key patterns that emerge from refinery- and country-level oil trade data. In addition, I conduct an accounting of global oil flows to deal with mismeasurements in the available oil trade data. This chapter cleans and merges multiple datasets on oil trade, production, and consumption, and make them ready to use for researchers. \n\nIn Chapter 2, motivated by the key facts that emerge from refinery-level data, I structurally estimate refineries' choices of which suppliers to select and how much crude oil to buy from each. The model of refineries' global sourcing presented in this chapter is carefully specified using detailed institutional background on crude oil procurement. Further, I develop and implement a new procedure to estimate variable and fixed costs of sourcing at the level of individual buyers. This estimation procedure has substantial advantages in estimating buyers' selection decisions, and can be used in other settings. \n\nIn Chapter 3, I embed my analysis in Chapter 2 into a general equilibrium model of crude and refined oil trade. The model fits well out of sample. Using the estimates to simulate the effects of counterfactual policies on oil trade and prices, I find: \n(i) A boom in crude oil production of a source changes the relative prices of crude oil across countries modestly which I interpret as the extent to which the behavior of crude oil markets deviates from an integrated global market.\n(ii) By lifting the ban on U.S. crude oil exports, annual revenues of U.S. crude oil producers increase by \\$8.9 billion, annual profits of U.S. refineries decrease by \\$7.1 billion, while American final consumers face a negligibly higher price of refined oil.

The time-averaged Poynting vector of a surface wave (i) has a significant component parallel to the interface and (ii) decays at sufficiently large distances normal to the interface. If one of the partnering materials is a metal and the other a dielectric, the surface waves are called surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) waves. If both partnering materials are dielectric, with at least one being periodically nonhomogeneous normal to the interface, the surface waves are called Tamm waves; and if that dielectric material is also anisotropic, the surface waves are called Dyakonov--Tamm waves. SPP waves also decays along the direction of propagation, whereas Tamm and Dyakonov--Tamm waves propagate with negligible losses.\n\nThe propagation and excitation of multiple SPP waves guided by the interface of a metal with a periodically nonhomogeneous sculptured nematic thin film (SNTF), and the interface of a metal with a rugate filter were theoretically investigated. The SNTF is an anisotropic material with a permittivity dyadic that is periodically nonhomogeneous in the thickness direction. A rugate filter is also a periodically nonhomogeneous dielectric material; however, it is an isotropic material. \n\nMultiple SPP waves of the same frequency but with different polarization states, phase speeds, attenuation rates, and spatial field profiles were found to be guided by a metal/SNTF interface, a metal/rugate-filter interface, and a metal slab in the SNTF. Multiple Dyakonov--Tamm waves of the same frequency but different polarization states, phase speeds, and spatial field profiles were found to be guided by a structural defect in an SNTF, and by a dielectric slab in an SNTF. The characteristics of multiple SPP and Dyakonov--Tamm waves were established by the investigations on canonical boundary-value problems. \n\nThe Turbadar-Kretschmann-Raether (TKR) and the grating-coupled configurations were used to study the excitation of multiple SPP waves. In the TKR configuration, which is easy to implement in a laboratory, a plane wave of either of the two linear polarization states was made incident on the metal-capped rugate filter of finite thickness and the absorptances were calculated using a numerically stable algorithm. In the grating-coupled configuration, which is required for solar cell applications, a plane wave of either polarization state was made incident on a rugate filter or an SNTF backed by a finitely thick metallic surface-relief grating and the total absorptance of the structure was calculated using the rigorous coupled-wave approach. In both the configurations, the excitation of SPP waves was inferred by the presence of those peaks in the absorptance curves that were independent of the thickness of the dielectric material.\n\nIt was found that (i) it is the periodic nonhomogeneity (not the anisotropy) of a partnering dielectric material normal to the interface that is responsible for the multiplicity of surface waves; (ii) multiple SPP, Tamm, Dyakonov--Tamm, and Fano waves of the same frequency and different phase speeds and spatial profiles can be guided by an interface of two different materials provided that at least one of them is periodically nonhomogeneous normal to the interface; (iii) the morphology of the partnering dielectric material affects the number, the phase speeds, the spatial profiles, and the degrees of localization of the surface waves; (iv) the number of surface waves can be increased further by the coupling of two interfaces separated by a sufficiently thin layer; and  (v) multiple surface waves can be excited in the TKR and the grating-coupled configurations both with the isotropic and anisotropic but periodically nonhomogeneous dielectric materials.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7075], "author_name_tesi": "Faryad, Muhammad ", "last_name_ssi": "Faryad", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Muhammad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Akhlesh Lakhtakia", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia", "Michael T Lanagan", "Osama O Awadelkarim", "Jainendra Jain"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Dissertation Advisor", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Committee Chair", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member", "Jainendra Jain, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["surface plasmon-polariton waves", "Kretschmann", "grating", "solar cell", "sculptured thin film", "rugate filter"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Miscanthus Conditioning and Bale Compression Analysis ", "id": "24789", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10910", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Miscanthus can be difficult, expensive and inefficient to harvest and handle because of its stiff stalk, tall height and high yield. In order to decrease the cost and increase the efficiency of harvesting miscanthus, the process of harvesting miscanthus was examined. The goal of this research was to examine conditioning techniques for miscanthus, following mowing and prior to small square baling, in order to evaluate the effect of conditioning on bale density, and both the compressive forces and energy consumption required to compress baled miscanthus.\n\nThree conditioning methods were tested with miscanthus. Prior to baling, smooth roll conditioning, crimp conditioning and no conditioning were tested to evaluate their effects and compare crop properties after conditioning. After the miscanthus conditioning tests, the crimp conditioning system and no conditioning were selected to be evaluated further and small square bales of miscanthus were made from both types of conditioning. After making small square bales of miscanthus, the bales were compressed with a small square bale lab scale bale compressor. During the compression process, the forces, energy consumption, peak power, and instantaneous densities were measured and calculated. Switchgrass bales were subjected to the same process for comparison purposes.\n\nThe crimp conditioning method, when used on miscanthus, produced a wave in the crop along its length and significantly changed the crop properties. When the crimp conditioned crop was compared to the unconditioned crop, during the bale compression process, the average compressive force, peak power, energy and specific energy consumption were all statistically less than the unconditioned crop at a 95 % confidence level. In addition, a longer holding time between the compression and retraction phases statistically decreases the length that miscanthus bales bounced back and relaxed; this related to less stress and strain on the bale twine or wire that held the compressed bale together. Conditioned miscanthus bales behaved statistically similarly to switchgrass while unconditioned bales were statistically more difficult to compress, requiring approximately 60% higher compressive forces and consuming 59% more specific energy than conditioned miscanthus.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10498], "author_name_tesi": "Fasick, Gregory T", "last_name_ssi": "Fasick", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jude Liu", "Douglas Herrick Schaufler", "Charles David Ray Sr.", "Paul Heinz Heinemann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jude Liu, Thesis Advisor", "Douglas Herrick Schaufler, Thesis Advisor", "Charles David Ray Sr., Thesis Advisor", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Miscanthus", "Switchgrass", "Compression", "Baling", "Conditioning", "Biomass", "Harvesting", "Biofuels"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Ozone Uptake in the Human Nasal Cavity: The contribution of Uric Acid\n", "id": "7640", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "494", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ozone, a highly reactive, oxidative gas, is the most harmful component of urban smog.  The large surface area of the respiratory airway makes it particularly vulnerable to O3 oxidation.  As a protective barrier, a thin coating of mucus blankets the airway surface to prevent direct contact between inhaled toxins and underlying epithelial cells.  Furthermore, this lining layer contains an array of biomolecules including antioxidants, which reactively deplete O3 levels.  Previous work has proposed that the antioxidant uric acid (UA) is the major target of O3 oxidation in the nasal lining fluid (NLF).  It has been postulated that O3 is so reactive that it is depleted before fully penetrating the NLF and contacting epithelial cells.  This suggests that harmful effects of O3 must be mediated by toxic products of O3 oxidation, such as lipid peroxides and aldehydes.  \n\nThis work investigated the role of NLF uric acid in modulating O3 absorption in the human nasal cavity.  Ozone absorption was measured as the fractional uptake (L) of O3 from a humidified air stream containing 0.36 parts per million (ppm) O3, and flowing through the nose unidirectionally at 3 liters per minute (lpm). Contents of the NLF were sampled by nasal lavage with saline.  Previous studies report that a relationship between daily measurements of L and UA concentration in the NLF (CUA,NLF) cannot be observed due to significant day-to-day variations in parameters affecting L.  To overcome this problem, several perturbations were imposed to induce changes in CUA,NLF, and therefore L, allowing same-day comparison of these parameters.  \n\nIn a preliminary study, we investigated the effect of continuous O3 exposure on L&#61472;in fifteen subjects.  It was hypothesized that O3 exposure would temporarily deplete CUA,NLF, resulting in lowered L.  Results showed that L was significantly reduced (p<0.001) following exposure to 0.36 ppm O3 for 30 minutes at 3 lpm.  In a subsequent study of twenty-five subjects, we aimed to relate values of L and CUA,NLF before and after O3 exposure.  Values of L and CUA,NLF were significantly reduced following O3 exposure and were strongly correlated with each other (p<0.001).  Regression of these data indicated that L=0&#61472;when CUA,NLF=0, suggesting a major contribution of UA in modulating O3 uptake.  Reaction-diffusion modeling of the data yielded an apparent second order reaction rate constant between O3 and UA (k2) of 1.56x109 M-1s-1.  \n\nIn a third study, we investigated effects of the oxidant gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on L in twelve subjects.  Exposure to 1.0 ppm NO2 at 3 lpm for 30 minutes resulted in a small reduction of L, and no change in CUA.  Results of in vitro experiments verified minimal reactivity between gaseous NO2 and UA in aqueous solution.  Although NO2 is an oxidative gas capable of depleting various NLF compounds, it appears that none of these compounds played a major role in modulating O3 absorption.  Therefore, the facts that 1) CUA,NLF was not influenced by NO2 exposure and 2) NO2 exposure induced only a small reduction in L&#61484; are in agreement with the assumption that UA is the major NLF target of O3.  \n\nAnalysis of data from a previous study (Santiago, 2001) that employed serial nasal lavages to dilute UA levels in NLF showed a strong correlation (p<0.001) between values of CUA and the corresponding L values at each sampling time.  The apparent k2 obtained from this data was 6.04 x108 M-1s-1, which is the same order of magnitude as the value obtained in O3 exposure studies.  However, the results of this analysis indicated that there can be O3 transport in the absence of UA, likely due to oxidation of exposed cell membranes following serial nasal lavage challenges.\n\nA concentration profile for O3 in the NLF was simulated with the reaction-diffusion model employing a value for k2=109 M-1s-1 and CUA,NLF=200 uM.  Ozone penetration distance into the NLF was estimated to be 0.6 um, which was less than reported NLF thickness values of 5-10 um, indicating that O3 itself cannot not penetrate the NLF to reach underlying cells.  Therefore, as a part of the third study, we attempted to detect secondary products of O3 oxidation, such as lipid peroxides and aldehydes, that might explain how O3 exposure causes adverse health effects.  Results demonstrated significant production of TBARS, a marker of lipid peroxidation, immediately following and 60 minutes following O3 exposure.  Interestingly, increased levels of CUA,NLF appeared to reduce absolute TBARS formation, suggesting a secondary protective role for UA. \n \nIncreased cellular production of gaseous nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated during inflammation.  Therefore, in the first study, nasal air was monitored before and after O3 exposure as an indicator of an inflammatory response to O3.  Our data showed a small, but significant elevation of NO one hour following initiation of O3 exposure, suggesting an emerging inflammatory response.   \n\nIn summary, we have provided in vivo evidence that UA is the major target of O3 oxidation in the human nose.  The observed value for k2, and corresponding O3 penetration depth, provides evidence that O3 does not reach underlying cells, suggesting that secondary ozonation compounds are responsible for harmful effects of O3 exposure.  In support of this, TBARS levels were significantly elevated following O3 exposure.  Additionally, we show that there may be an inhibitory role of UA in preventing the formation of secondary ozonation compounds.  Finally, our results indicate a cellular response to O3 exposure as measured by NO.\t          \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [491], "author_name_tesi": "Fassih, Ali ", "last_name_ssi": "Fassih", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James S Ultman", "Abdellaziz Ben Jebria", "Ali Borhan", "Antonios Armaou", "Rebecca Bascom"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James S Ultman, Committee Chair", "Abdellaziz Ben Jebria, Committee Member", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Antonios Armaou, Committee Member", "Rebecca Bascom, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["uric acid", "nasal", "antioxidant", "uptake", "ozone", "respiratory"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A COLLECTIVE ACTION APPROACH TO PROACTIVITY", "id": "14227sxf944", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14227", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I draw on the social movements literature and system justification theory to put forward a collective action approach to the study of proactivity.

In the studies described in this dissertation, we explore the use of nanoparticles in the treatment of mechanobiology-related diseases, specifically atherosclerosis. It has been well studied that atherosclerosis is caused and accompanied by changes in endothelial cell physical properties including cell shape, cell area, stress state of cells and cell aspect ratio arising from the cells\u2019 response to the prevailing shear stress from blood flow. Endothelial cells in atheroprotected regions exhibit an ellipsoidal cell and nuclear morphology, whereas in atheroprone regions (particularly at the origin and bifurcation of vessels), where orderly flow direction is not presented, exhibit a cuboidal morphology. The hypothesis tested by studies described herein is that these structural and mechanical changes in endothelial cells can influence and regulate the overall rate of nanoparticle endocytosis. This phenomenon, described by a newly coined term, mechanotargeting, may arise from structural relationship between cell and cell membrane stiffness and the endocytotic process. The mechanistic understanding of the internal orchestration between cell shape and nanoparticle internalization is still lacking. In the current thesis, we try to answer the fundamental question of how alterations in cellular shape can regulate nanoparticle endocytosis.\nTo fully understand the changes in endocytosis as a result of cell shape alteration, we explored nanoparticle selectivity for isolated endothelial cells and ones existing in a monolayer. We chose endothelial cells since both elliptic and cuboidal shapes are found in atherosclerosis-resistant and atherosclerosis-susceptible areas of the vasculature. Our studies were guided by a thermodynamic model that describes the relationship between nanoparticle uptake and cell area, membrane tension, membrane bending modulus, and receptor density.  To control each of these variables, we conducted a systematic single cell study utilized micro-printing of extracellular matrix proteins in which we forced the human aortic endothelial cells into pre-defined shapes and aspect ratios and we introduce nanoparticles in different time points to the cells. This model allowed us to interpret the endocytosis process in a single cell manner with a focus on each of the governing factors (cell area, aspect ratio, nanoparticle circulation time and membrane tension) individually, and eliminate the overlapping effect. We showed that nanoparticle endocytosis by cells can be regulated by changes in cell shape, cell aspect ratio, and nanoparticles\u2019 circulation time. Our findings indicate that nanoparticle uptake is suppressed when cells convert from a low stress state (low aspect ratio, representing cells found in atheroprone regions) to a high stress state (high aspect ratio, representing cells in atheroprotected regions) independent of cellular area and time. Next, we studied nanoparticle uptake in a confluent monolayer wherein cellular shape was guided by fibers deposited by our home-built 3D near-field electrospinning (3DNFES) printer. 3DNFES provides highly controlled and aligned Poly(methyl methacrylate) fibers which provide topographic cues for cell.  \nOur study reveals that physical properties of the cells have direct effects on nanoparticle endocytosis and can regulate the nanoparticle internalization rate via cytoplasmic actin filaments reorganization (and attendant changes in internal stress and membrane mechanics). On the basis of these findings, we suggest that optimal nanoparticle internalization to the cells is dictated by cellular morphology, thus providing a more sensitive disease diagnosis and targeting strategy and opening up the possibility of directing nanoparticles to atheroprone endothelial cells by virtue of their shape and stress state.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16160], "author_name_tesi": "Fattahi, Pouria ", "last_name_ssi": "Fattahi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pouria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Justin Lee Brown", "Peter J Butler", "Sulin Zhang", "William O Hancock", "Charles T Anderson", "Peter J Butler", "Justin Lee Brown", "Siyang Zheng"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Justin Lee Brown, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter J Butler, Committee Chair", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Charles T Anderson, Outside Member", "Peter J Butler, Dissertation Advisor", "Justin Lee Brown, Committee Chair", "Siyang Zheng, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mechanotargeting"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Characterization Of The Size, Shape, And Drug Encapsulation Efficiency Of Plga Microcapsules Produced Via Electrojetting For Anticancer Agent Delivery", "id": "19927", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9504", "abstract_tesi": "Despite significant progress in the development of new chemotherapeutic agents and drug delivery methods for brain tumors, malignant gliomas (high grade brain tumor) remains deadly with a median survival period of only about a year. The high dosage of chemotherapeutic agents required for penetration through the blood brain barrier during chemotherapy not only kills cancer cells but also damages healthy tissues and causes adverse side effects. Hence, a major unmet challenge in the treatment of malignant gliomas is the development of effective and targeted local delivery of chemotherapeutic agents at the cellular level. Drug-loaded biodegradable microcapsules with high drug encapsulation efficiency and controlled shape and size are attractive candidates for a more precise control of anticancer agent delivery at the tumor sites. \nHere, I report the results of a systematic study of the size, shape, and drug release profiles of Poly(lactic-co glycolic) (PLGA) microcapsules produced and loaded with the anticancer agent 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) using an electrojetting technique.

To prepare BCNU-PLGA solutions with PLGA concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 wt%, BCNU/PLGA mixtures (5 to 25 wt% with respect to PLGA) dissolved in chloroform were electrojetted on gold substrates. I quantified the shape and size distribution of BCNU-loaded PLGA microcapsules as a function of the polymer concentration and flow rate used during electrojetting, and characterized drug release profiles for microcapsules of three different morphologies: flattened microspheres, microspheres, and microfibers. Flattened microspheres were produced from 1 and 2 wt% PLGA solutions, while microspheres and microfibers were formed as the PLGA concentration increased to 3-5 wt% and 10% wt%, respectively.

This dissertation aimed to better understand youth\u2019s supervised and unsupervised OST experiences in two studies. The first study utilized qualitative data collected from African American middle school students to examine how adolescents perceive their supervised and unsupervised OST contexts. Findings indicate that adolescents perceive three different OST contexts related to adult supervision: direct supervision, indirect supervision, and no supervision. Within these three contexts, adolescents reported positive and negative perceived settings, behaviors, experiences, and constraints. The second study used findings from the first study to develop a measure of OST that included questions about adolescents\u2019 perceived settings, behaviors, and experiences within directly supervised, indirectly supervised, and unsupervised OST contexts. Exploratory factor analysis using data from a sample of 303 African American middle school students (Mean age = 12.97; SD = 1.03) revealed similarities and differences among adolescents\u2019 perceived settings, experiences, and behaviors across the three contexts. Within the directly supervised context, the following OST themes emerged: positive feelings, negative feelings and behaviors, and conscientious behavior. Within the indirectly supervised context, the following themes emerged: positive feelings, positive behaviors, negative feelings, adult support and guidance, and freedom. Within the unsupervised OST context, the following themes emerged: positive feelings, positive behaviors, negative feelings, conscientious behavior, freedom, unhappiness with the context, and participation in thrilling behavior. Within context subscale composite scores were computed based on results from the exploratory factor analyses. Factors from within-context SEM models related to positive developmental outcomes (i.e., social competence, self-efficacy, responsible choice making, clear and positive identity, school engagement). Finally, a latent model that included all OST subscales across contexts was tested, but the model fit was poor. Even though the fit of the cross-context model was not acceptable, the within context models indicate that the relationships between OST contexts and developmental outcomes share similarities and differences across contexts, revealing the need for researchers of OST to conduct studies that attend to the three adult supervision contexts: direct supervision, indirect supervision, and no supervision. These findings also have implications for applied work as practitioners can use such findings to help design ways to: recruit youth into and retain them in organized programs; promote healthy behaviors in unsupervised contexts, and identify key OST components that may promote positive developmental outcomes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4355], "author_name_tesi": "Faulk, Monique Taveta", "last_name_ssi": "Faulk", "middle_name_ssi": "Taveta", "first_name_ssi": "Monique", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["J Douglas Coatsworth", "J Douglas Coatsworth", "Linda L Caldwell", "Edward A Smith", "Daniel Francis Perkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["J Douglas Coatsworth, Dissertation Advisor", "J Douglas Coatsworth, Committee Chair", "Linda L Caldwell, Committee Chair", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member", "Daniel Francis Perkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Structure activities", "Positive youth development", "Free time", "African American", "Adolescents", "and Unstructured activities"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "PREPARING FUTURE SECONDARY AGRICULTURE TEACHERS TO WORK WITH STUDENTS WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7528", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4879", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of the study was to examine the practices agricultural teacher educators report to cover in pre-service programs to prepare pre-service teachers to work with students with learning disabilities in secondary agricultural education programs.

The majority of pre-service teachers acquired skills for teaching students with learning disabilities during a field experience.  \nPre-service teachers reported each of the instructional techniques, accommodations, and federal legislative acts were covered in pre-service programs.  Cooperative pairs/groups and differentiated instruction were reported the most covered instructional techniques in pre-service programs.  Extra/Extended time was reported the most covered accommodation and The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 1997 was reported the most covered federal legislative act in pre-service programs.\nCollectively, both groups agreed cooperative pairs/groups was the most covered instructional technique in pre-service programs.  They also agreed that extra/extended time was the most covered accommodation.  The study concluded that both groups agreed to the extent which instructional techniques, accommodations, and federal legislative acts were covered in pre-service programs.  However, neither group reported any of the instructional techniques, accommodations, and federal legislative acts as being completely covered in pre-service programs.\nTaking into account the study\u2019s findings, it is recommended that agricultural education teacher education programs designate one faculty member as the special education contact for the agricultural teacher education program; agricultural teacher education programs provide in-service and pre-service training for pre-service teachers during and after completion of the teacher education program; and agricultural teacher education programs offer special education courses within the department, particularly if courses are not required by the accreditation agency or completed in other colleges and/or departments.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4856], "author_name_tesi": "Faulkner, Paula Elleen", "last_name_ssi": "Faulkner", "middle_name_ssi": "Elleen", "first_name_ssi": "Paula", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Connie Devine Baggett", "Tracy Scheidt Hoover", "Patreese Donette Ingram", "Kathy L Ruhl", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Connie Devine Baggett, Committee Chair", "Tracy Scheidt Hoover, Committee Member", "Patreese Donette Ingram, Committee Member", "Kathy L Ruhl, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["agricultural education", "students with learning disabilities", "pre-service teachers", "accommodations", "vocational education", "instructional techniques", "teacher education"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Anatomically Based Investigations of Total Ankle Arthroplasty", "id": "6741", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "351", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The study addressed alignment and orientation issues of the talocrural joint with a specific emphasis on applications for total ankle arthroplasty (TAA).  The first phase involved thorough morphological and geometrical characterizations of 8 cadaveric ankle joints, which were completed using a 3D digitization system and numerical optimization methods.  The study also explored the design, use, and implantation of prototype surgical instrumentation and joint replacement components as a means of evaluating talocrural joint orientations.  \n\tFirst, the 3D spatial orientations of easily identifiable and palpable anatomical landmarks were calculated along with clouds of points replicating the articular surfaces of the distal tibia, talus, and fibula.  The articular surfaces of the tibia and talus were characterized geometrically as cylinders via numerical optimization.  Results indicated that the size of the mean radius of curvature of the articular surfaces of the tali and tibiae were within the findings of previous research.  Statistical comparisons between the cylinders fit to the tibia and the talus revealed significantly larger radii of curvature for the tibia.  In addition, males had significantly larger radii of curvature than females.  The articular surfaces were also separated into medial and lateral halves for separate cylinder fits, and comparisons of radius size were made between the medial and lateral fits for the tibia vs. the talus, males vs. females, and the medial and lateral fits vs. the original whole-fits.  \n\tJoint surface orientations were identified via the cylinder fits and were compared to the 3D position and orientation of surrounding anatomical landmarks.  These assessments yielded consistent and predictable findings in the coronal plane (neutral varus/valgus), confirming some traditional TAA alignment procedures.  The orientations of the joint surfaces in the transverse plane were found to be highly variable, and as a result, no consistent relationship was identified that would predict the transverse orientation of the joint surfaces.  \n\tCalculations were also made of the coronal and transverse orientations of vectors connecting anatomical landmarks such as the intermalleolar (IM) axis and edges of the anterior and posterior articular surfaces.  Results showed that the orientations of the IM axes were highly variable in both planes, indicating that current TAA alignment procedures that approximate the alignment of the components based on the IM axis may be erroneous.   \n\tThe results from the initial orientation calculations were applied towards the development of prototype surgical alignment instrumentation and components for TAA. This instrumentation was used to perform TAA surgery and implant experimental TAA components to examine the joint orientations of 5 cadaveric ankles.  The simple, congruent, cylindrical component system developed was based on the radius of curvature data from the cylinder optimizations, and allowed unrestricted translation and rotation of the components in the transverse plane that was designed determine the optimum TAA component orientation in this plane. \n\tThe cylindrical components were inserted in place of the talocrural joint surfaces, and their orientation was measured at a static, neutral position to evaluate the accuracy of the cuts.  Next, the feet were subjected to kinematic experiments involving cycles of plantarflexion and dorsiflexion.   Initial and final orientations and translations of the components were calculated, along with intra-experimental rotational oscillations. Final component positions and orientations were compared with the spatial orientation of anatomical landmarks in order to identify repeatable alignment relationships.  Analysis of the results showed a great deal of variance in the transverse plane orientation of the components, therefore a mean transverse plane orientation that was representative of all specimens was not identified.  In addition, through the plantar/dorsiflexion trials, the components exhibited rotational oscillations in the transverse plane demonstrating that talocrural motion is multi-planar.  \n\tThe results of the study indicate that a more thorough understanding of the transverse orientations of talocrural joint surfaces is needed before reliable, predictable alignment criteria can be developed for TAA.  Nevertheless, the current study identified orientations in the coronal and sagittal planes which confirm certain existing TAA alignment protocols, and also demonstrated that it is possible to develop instrumentation that can improve the accuracy of the TAA bone cuts.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [346], "author_name_tesi": "Fauth, Andrew Ray", "last_name_ssi": "Fauth", "middle_name_ssi": "Ray", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil Sharkey", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "John Henry Challis", "Steven Howard Zarit", "James Michelson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neil Sharkey, Committee Chair", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Member", "John Henry Challis, Committee Member", "Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Member", "James Michelson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ankle arthroplasty", "talocrural joint", "joint replacement", "ankle"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "An Initial Competency Model for Sales Managers at Fifteen B2B Organizations  \n", "id": "10538", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4162", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of the study was to develop an initial competency model necessary for success in the sales manager\u2019s job in the business to business market.  The findings indicate that the initial competency model for sales managers has thirty-two competencies and six competency clusters including, relationship building, planning, monitoring, directing, evaluating and rewarding.    The initial competency model developed here gives support to the   argument that sales is moving from a transactional approach to a relationship approach.  Therefore, attention needs to be given to developing the relationship orientation skills of sales managers.  Relationships are being sought by both suppliers and customers as a way of assuring a consistent, quality supply and future business.   This is evidenced by Trent (2005) writing from the buyers point of views who states, \u201cA diverse set of research shows relationships matter to the point where they can be a source of competitive advantage,\u201d (p. 54). Trent (2005) goes on to say, \u201crelationships matter because almost every industry is facing changes that make suppliers a critical part of the firm\u2019s value chain,\u201d (p. 55).  \n\tThe findings indicate that coaching and ethical behaviors are of particular importance to sales managers and care should be taken to fully develop these competencies.

A cross-functional mentoring program may be one method to develop coaching and relationship building skills. Ethics training can be conducted in the traditional manner using case discussions and/or role-plays with ethical dilemmas. Promotion criteria should also be restructured to reflect relationship skills, coaching and ethical behavior.     \t\n\t\tAdditional research should be conducted to confirm the initial model using another method. Additional research should also be conducted to determine the current contents of training programs for sales managers.

Self-efficacy is a key teacher variable associated with many positive educational outcomes, yet little is known about how the observation of instructional modeling affects teachers' development of their self-efficacy for the specific behaviors they will need to effectively perform in their future classrooms. This study integrated methodologies which were responsive to four theoretical concerns raised in the literature to more appropriately measure changes to novice teacher self-efficacy: 1) pre-service teachers primarily form their self-efficacy from their observations of modeled teaching behaviors, 2) self-efficacy formation must be measured at the appropriate level of specificity (i.e. \u2013 the new pedagogical skill being learned), 3) self-efficacy formation must be measured as soon as possible after the targeted behavior is observed, and 4) researchers must take frequent measurements to observe small incremental changes to teacher self-efficacy.\n\nSix modeled teaching skills that are common to second language teacher education were presented to participants in a series of videos to determine their effects on participant self-efficacy appraisals for these specific skills and their relationship to participants' assessment of their larger instructional strategies self-efficacy. Results indicated that participants consistently scored higher on posttest measures of the six micro-appraisal items than on the pretest measures. Moderate to high effect sizes were observed for the six treatments, suggesting that the observation of teaching behaviors modeled on videos has positive practical effects on preservice teachers\u2019 appraisals of their self-efficacy for specific teaching tasks. Results also indicated that only one micro-appraisal change score was significantly related to participants' instructional strategies self-efficacy change. However, the cumulative score of the six micro-appraisal changes was found to be moderately correlated with instructional strategies self-efficacy change, suggesting that cumulative scores of conceptually congruent items may be more predictive that individual items.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13952], "author_name_tesi": "Favre, David Eugene", "last_name_ssi": "Favre", "middle_name_ssi": "Eugene", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephanie L.

There have been claims that superconductors will exhibit \"superscreening\", which could largely increase fusion cross sections. However, there is currently no widely accepted theory to explain superconductor electron screening. With the possibility of significantly enhanced fusion cross sections in superconductors, this research analyzed the possibility of a net energy gain system.\n    To determine the contribution of electron screening from superconductor electron pairs, the first portion of this research proposes and analyzes an experiment. The proposed experiment would utilize the bombardment of deuterons (20 keV) on a PdD target in two separate stages, above and below the superconducting transition temperature (i.e., metallic and superconducting PdD states, respectively). The protons from the resulting fusion reactions would be detected to infer the electron screening differences between metallic and superconducting states of PdD. The pre-experimental analysis shows that the experiment would be able to determine the total screening from a superconductor with a 38% error of the screening energy with 95% confidence.\n    The second portion of the research investigated the possibility of net energy gain from fusion reactions within a superconductor. In order to do so, a simple direct energy conversion model was developed. The model accounted for energy losses due to fusion product energy deposition, energy conversion, and cooling requirements. With the model, a sample calculation of energy gain was performed on superconducting PdD. Using the Carnot efficiency of cooling and the PdD sample thickness equal to the coherence length (10^-8 m), the calculation indicated that with the widely accepted 11 K transition temperature there would be no net energy gain. However, net energy gain may be possible if a superconductor were developed with a superconductor transition temperature above 100 K. Even if net energy gain was achievable, the reaction rates from lattice induced vibrations in superconducting PdD would result in an extremely low power density, thus rendering the device impractical.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3349], "author_name_tesi": "Fazel, Kamron C", "last_name_ssi": "Fazel", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Kamron", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Thesis Advisor", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydride", "palladium", "experiment", "electron", "ion", "screening", "energy", "fusion", "superconductor", "deuteride", "magnesium diboride"]}]
