These properties can be best preserved when the particles are coated to avoid aggregation.  The coating of such particles (200 nm - 5 microns) has been successfully achieved by the use of a technique called dusty plasma chemical vapor deposition (DPCVD).  Ultra-fine films only several nanometers in thickness have been attained on the particles.  This technique uses simultaneously the phenomenon of particle trapping in the plasma for particle suspension and the process of plasma polymerization for film deposition.  The plasma used in this work is a low pressure non-equilibrium radio-frequency discharge in a capacitively coupled parallel-plate reactor.\n\n\nDPCVD has been used to coat silica particles of various sizes with 2-propanol plasma polymer.  The major experimental findings are: a) the film deposition rate increases significantly with the uncoated particle size, b) the particle size distribution broadens considerably with film deposition at a rate also dependent on the uncoated particle size, and c) the coating uniformity on the particle decreases with film deposition at a rate again dependent on the uncoated particle size.  Models have been developed to successfully explain these experimental findings.  These models have shown that 1) the particle size dependent depletion of electron density in the plasma is the major factor influencing the film deposition rate and 2) the broadening of the particle size distribution is a result of the spatial distribution of deposition rates.  In addition, the second model has provided useful insights into the deposition environment in a reactive dusty plasma.\n\n\nDPCVD has also been used for the first time to synthesize hollow plasma polymer particles.  A total of 16 organic precursors of different chemistry were tested and it was found that aromaticity and a cyclohexane ring seem conducive to the appearance of an empty core in the particles.  It was found that all the precursors share the same physical mechanism of hollow particle formation.

Electrolyte ionic conductivity with extended salt concentrations under different temperatures are studied. The conductivity change trend is explained by 3 factors: the number of free ions, the viscosity of electrolyte and the dielectric constant. Later, solid diffusion coefficient measurement is studied with LS-GITT method. Without inputting phase change features, the method successfully extracts apparent solid diffusion coefficient at a reasonable magnitude level. Quantified accuracy is also given by root mean squares error values. Thus we approve the method is an efficient way deriving diffusion coefficients to reconstruct voltage profiles with good chemistry compatibility.

An important element of the risk associated with long-term CO2 storage effectiveness is the seal integrity of abandoned wells, especially when storing CO2 in depleted oil and gas reservoirs.  Any loss of seal integrity may lead to chronic escaping of CO2 through leakage pathways, which can impose potential environmental impact on groundwater quality and cause economic loss, and reduction of CO2 storage efficiency.  To assess the leakage potential, considerable attention has been drawn to the long-term wellbore isolation and the durability of wellbore cement, on which degradation has been noticed through chemical reaction in CO2-rich environments.  In this work, we investigated the cement degradation mechanisms and possible conditions affecting the integrity of wellbore cement.  A series of dynamic flow-through experiments were conducted on specially-designed cement and cement-rock samples.  In addition, reactive transport models were developed to assist the interpretation of experimental findings and identification of primary factors affecting cement alteration.  Results through experiments and simulations suggest that cement properties alone are insufficient to assess wellbore integrity over time.  Conditions such as cement/rock bonding, formation rock properties, existing fractures and evolving flow conditions play a significant role in affecting cement reactivity in CO2-rich environments.  Cement-rock core with large pre-existing cement defects and poor cement-rock bonding experienced a conductivity increase by a factor of eight after ten days of flooding.  Cement core with small initial fracture aperture and long residence time exhibited self-healing of fracture and decrease in overall conductivity after eight-day reactive flow.  In addition, cement bonded by lower permeability host sandstone rock showed higher extent of cement degradation while the reactive limestone diverted the predominant reactive zone to the host rock matrix leaving the cement zone unaltered.  This study provides resource data for the development of reactive transport models and contributes fundamental insights for the extended analysis of cement alteration and long-term wellbore integrity in the context of geological CO2 sequestration.

It can benefit for the workload balance and data backup. During the virtual machine live migration, memory is an important part that needs to be transferred from the source to the destination. Current techniques can be divided into two categories: Pre-Copy and Post-Copy. Both approaches migrate all memory blocks from source to target without memory analysis before live migration. However, some memory blocks are not necessarily transferred through live migration process, because the content of these memory blocks always remains the same. Moreover, modern operating systems use unused memory to cache recently accessed blocks of permanent storage device. This technique is called PreFetcher or SuperFetch. Although Prefetcher can speed up the amount of time that system takes to start up programs, it occupies more memory spaces which might not be used by users.\n\nThese observations lead us to propose an approach to analyze the Virtual Machine memory page table and divide the memory data into two parts (active memory and relatively stable memory). Instead of migrating all Virtual Machine memory through live migration, we only live migrate the active memory. The relatively stable memory can be merged into Virtual Machine image file. Thus, during startup process, target machine can directly load these memory blocks into its physical memory through image file stored in shared storage. The proposed approach can considerably reduce the amount of data sent between the two hosts involved in the live migration and has the potential to shorten the total migration time.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10638], "author_name_tesi": "Cao, Wenqi ", "last_name_ssi": "Cao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenqi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu", "Guohong Cao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Thesis Advisor", "Guohong Cao, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Virtual Machine", "Live Migration"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Ludic Elicitation: using serious games for knowledge elicitation purposes ", "id": "21245", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9771", "defended_at_dtsi": "3014-03-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Knowledge elicitation from human beings is important for many fields, such as decision support systems, risk communication, and customer preference studying. Traditional approaches include observations, questionnaires, structured and semi-structured interviews, and group discussions. Many publications have been studying different techniques for a variety of data elicitation tasks as well. However, few of them have considered participants' user experience in the process. One main drawback of these methods is their time consuming and labor intensive nature, because of which participants often lose their interest and attention quickly in data elicitation activities. Innovated by the success of games with a purpose in many fields such as participatory city exploration and community building, we propose to adopt a game approach for knowledge elicitation tasks. \n\nWe have developed two browser-based casual games, LinkIT and SortIT, and have applied them for three knowledge elicitation applications: relation elicitation, rank elicitation, and probability elicitation. The LinkIT game elicits relations between variables/concepts and facilitates the construction of relation network structures such as concept maps and Bayesian networks. The SortIT game presents puzzles in the form of multiple-choice questions. This format supports rank elicitation in a pairwise comparison approach. The second application of this game is probability elicitation by using probability intervals or verbal expressions. By comparing the two games with more traditional methods such as questionnaires, we have established the external validity of the games for the three knowledge elicitation tasks. Further, user experience studies conclude that the games improve user experience by forming the elicitation tasks as a play activity and making the activity more interesting, engaging, exciting, and fun. These findings provide positive support for the applications of GWAP for more knowledge elicitation tasks.

The simulated space charge and electric potential profiles at steady state agreed with recent experiment observations.

Two studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of monounsaturated fatty acids on CVD risk factors.  A meta-analysis of thirty-one selected controlled clinical trials was performed to compare the effects of moderate-fat versus lower-fat diets on lipids and lipoproteins in healthy subjects, and subjects with diabetes.  The results of the study demonstrated that moderate-fat diets decreased triacylglerol and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) greater than lower-fat diets.  However, the moderate-fat diets tested were higher than the amount recommended by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies.  Therefore, a second study was conducted.  Twenty-five mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects participated in a 2-period randomized, crossover, controlled feeding study to compare the effects of a macadamia nut-rich (MAC) diet on CVD risk factors (e.g., lipids, lipoproteins, inflammatory markers and oxidative stress) compared to an Average American Diet (AAD).  In individuals with baseline CRP levels < 1 mg/L only total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and non-HDL-C were reduced following the consumption of the MAC diet versus the consumption of the AAD.  Furthermore, lipid hydroperoxide, a marker of oxidative stress, decreased after the consumption of the AAD and MAC diets compared to baseline in subjects with CRP < 1 mg/L while it did not differ in the subjects with CRP \u00a1\u00dd 1 mg/L.  In addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, oxidative stress and inflammation are important emerging risk factors.  Macadamia nuts contain a range of antioxidants including vitamin E as tocopherols and tocotrienol, the amino acids methionine and cysteine and selenium.  A macadamia-nut rich diet is high in monounsaturated fat and antioxidants.  The antioxidants may exert a beneficial effect on oxidative stress and inflammation aside from the monounsaturated fatty acids.  Thus, we conducted the tomato study to investigate the effects of antioxidants on multiple CVD risk factors.  A randomized, treatment-controlled, 2-center (the Pennsylvania State University and University of California, Davis), 2-arm, parallel design was employed to evaluate the effect of chronic and acute consumption of processed tomatoes on LDL oxidation and paraoxonase (PON1) activity.  In the run-in period, oxidized LDL increased at 6 H compared to 0 H after the high fat meal without processed tomatoes but did not change after the high fat meal with processed tomatoes.  After six weeks of high processed tomato consumption, PON1 activity increased at 6 H compared to 3 H (P < 0.05) after the high fat meal without processed tomatoes.  Furthermore, in the high tomato group, participants showed a trend for greater PON1 activity (P < 0.07) compared to those in the low tomato group in response to the high fat meal without processed tomatoes (for QR/RR carriers only).  In conclusion, consumption of processed tomato products decreased oxidative stress; when consumed with a meal, postprandial LDL oxidation was decreased, and daily consumption of tomatoes for six weeks increased PON1 activity which would decrease LDL oxidation.  Collectively, the results of the three studies show that a monounsaturated fatty acid-rich diet, and processed tomato products elicit beneficial effects on traditional and emerging CVD risk factors.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6734], "author_name_tesi": "Cao, Yumei  ", "last_name_ssi": "Cao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yumei ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Sheila Grace West", "David Theodore Mauger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Dissertation Advisor", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Chair", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member", "David Theodore Mauger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cardiovascular disease", "diet", "monounsaturated fatty acid", "processed tomatoes"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Advances In Simulation And Thermography For \nhigh Field Mri", "id": "18817", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8812", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High field MRI systems can benefit from increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but face \nchallenges  of  decreased  homogeneity  in  signal  intensity  across  images  and  increased  patient \nheating.

Each subsequent thruster incorporated modifications that resulted in improvements in thruster performance compared to previous generations. Operational frequencies evaluated thus far include 2.45 GHz, 7.5 GHz, 8 GHz, and 14.5 GHz. As each thruster increased in operational frequency, plasmas have been ignited with successively lower amounts of input power. With higher frequency and lower power requirements, the physical sizes of the thruster and the power supply have been reduced. Decreased size results in a lighter propulsion system, which is ideal for space missions. This thesis concerns the design and development of a thruster operating at 30 GHz.\n\nElectromagnetic modeling was used in the design of the thruster to determine the optimal input antenna size and length. A 2.4-mm antenna size was chosen with a length that is flush with the bottom of the cavity. Modeling also aided in the understanding of how machining accuracy of the cavity radius affects thruster performance. The modeling results indicated that radius inaccuracies on the order of \u00b10.1 mm result in mode distortion, shifting of the resonant frequency, lowered electric field strength, and poor power transfer to the cavity.\n\nThe experimental setup for the thruster system, propellant system, electromagnetic system, and pressure system are discussed. The 30-GHz MET has an approximate radius of 0.4 cm and height of 1.4 cm. The expected power requirement for plasma ignition is 5\u201310 watts. Scaling down the thruster size resulted in different adapters and enhanced pressure sealing requirements when compared to previous METs. Initial testing is being performed at a pressure of 30 Torr using helium as the propellant. A network analyzer was used to determine the exact resonant frequency of the cavity and to determine the power coupling to the cavity. The exact resonant frequency of the cavity is 29.939 GHz.

The antibiotic oxytetracycline is used to mitigate the yield limiting symptoms of this disease. Despite that, yield loss remains high in susceptible stone fruit cultivars, raising concern among growers over the development of antibiotic resistance in the causal pathogen. Previous surveys of the stone fruit orchard bacterial community indicated the presence of oxytetracycline resistant epiphytic bacteria. This was significant because epiphytic or nontarget bacteria are thought to harbor more resistance genes and often before coexisting pathogens. Under a strong selection pressure such as repeated antibiotic applications, transfer of resistance genes from epiphytic bacteria to pathogenic bacteria is favored. Therefore, when evaluating antibiotic resistance development in pathogenic bacteria, nontarget bacteria must also be considered. The overall goal of this research was to determine the consequences of repeated oxytetracycline applications in commercial Pennsylvania stone fruit orchards, including management factors related to the incidence of bacteria carrying tetracycline resistance genes and the sensitivity of X. arboricola pv. pruni isolates to oxytetracycline. Tetracycline resistance genes, tet(A), tet(B), and tet(C), were found in epiphytic bacteria recovered from commercial stone fruit orchards and research blocks at the PSU Fruit Research and Extension Center. The most common carriers of these resistance genes were bacteria that belonged to the genera Pantoea and Pseudomonas where tet(B) was most commonly associated with the former and tet(C), the latter. Bacteria carrying these tetracycline resistance genes could grow on media amended with greater than 450 ug/ml of oxytetracycline, three times that of the rate used in the field to manage bacterial spot. While the incidence of tetracycline resistance genes in epiphytic bacteria significantly differed (P > 0.0001) among the sampled commercial orchards, this was not related to oxytetracycline use (P = 0.0855). When tested in the experimental stone fruit blocks, again, the distribution of bacteria positive for tetracycline resistance genes was not related to bactericide treatment (2013: P = 0.407; 2014: P = 0.520). Other management factors including tree age, cultivar, and sampling date were. Sensitivity to oxytetracycline among Xap isolates significantly differed (P > 0.0001) among those collected from commercial stone fruit orchards. While no tetracycline resistance genes were found in any of the sampled Xap isolates and overall sensitivity remained high (MIC < 25 \u00b5g/ml), oxytetracycline use was a significant factor associated with oxytetracycline sensitivity (P > 0.0001). Further research should be conducted to determine the molecular mechanism associated with the variability in sensitivity in the Xap isolates, including novel and untested resistance genes, adaptive resistance, or mutation.

Contact with crab shell in batch microcosms quickly increased the pH of acid impacted stream water from 3.1 to 7.6, and increased the alkalinity from 0 to 37.2 mg/L as CaCO3 in as little as 6 hours.  With increasing contact time, the pH and alkalinity continued to increase, reaching a maximum of 8.2 and 136.8 mg/L as CaCO3, respectively, after a 10 days of treatment. Under continuous-flow conditions, crab shell increased the pH of the water from 3.87 to 9.2 in just 2 days and then slowly returned to a circum-neutral pH of 7.5 for the remainder of the 54-day study.  In comparison, columns containing limestone were able to increase the pH to a maximum of 8.55 by day 24, but then lost neutralizing capacity, ending at a pH of 6.01 after 54 days.  Alkalinity followed the same trend as pH, increasing from 0 mg/L as CaCO3 to an average of 634 mg/L as CaCO3 in columns containing crab shell, yet only reaching a maximum of 22.8 mg/L as CaCO3 in columns containing limestone.  Low levels of aluminum (0.6 mg/L) were easily removed from solution by crab shell, but broke through in columns containing limestone, eventually reaching influent concentrations within 55 days.  Fermentation of crab shell released low levels of bioavailable ammonium (NH4+) into the water (< 18 mg/L as N), which may be helpful for restoring biological diversity in nutrient-deficient watersheds.  Minimum loading criteria for crab shell and limestone to neutralize the acidic water examined in this laboratory study were determined to be 0.2 \u2013 0.9 g/L and 13 \u2013 60 g/L, respectively.

Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have been studied extensively in the past couple of decades, and there have been tremendous advances in the development of these systems, especially in industries such as automotive and portable power. Anion exchange membranes (AEM) have caught the attention of scientists because they would allow for the development of fuel cells without costly precious metal catalysts, among other advantages. Efforts are being made in developing long-lived and high performance AEMs for fuel cell applications.\nPrimarily, the focus in AEM research has been membrane stability. It has been observed that AEMs are not as stable as the state-of-the-art NAFION\u00ae PEM and demonstrations of cell performance beyond 1000 hours is rare. For this reason, scientists are in the search for more stable AEMs. The first step to developing more stable membranes is to understand the mechanisms by which these membranes degrade \u2013 both in ex-situ and in-situ stability assessments. It is the focus of this thesis to provide insight in the degradation mechanisms of AEMs under highly basic conditions. \nThe topic of this thesis is the use of alkyl spacers between the polymeric backbone and cationic group, and alkyl pendant chains replacing one of the methyl groups in the quaternary ammonium moiety, to provide steric hindrance around the cation and lower the degradation rate of the nitrogen-centered cation. Samples were developed with systematically differing architectures, for example, different lengths of alkyl spacers. The samples were then degraded under highly basic conditions at high temperatures. The strategy chosen to detect degradation was the analysis of the degradation by-products of the degraded small molecules, by two different characterization techniques: 1H NMR and LC-MS. 1H NMR was chosen to provide quantitative information of the degradation rates of various analogue small molecules with distinct chemistries; LC-MS was chosen to identify the degradation by-products and thus, determine the degradation mechanisms.  These results on small molecules can be extended to membranes as described in some preliminary membrane experiments and in future work.\nIt is the aim of this work to deeply probe the steric hindrance strategy to stable ammonium cations as well as provide a clear methodology for determining the degradation rates and mechanisms of analogue small molecules for AEMs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11061], "author_name_tesi": "Capparelli, Clara ", "last_name_ssi": "Capparelli", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Clara", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["anion exchange membranes", "degradation", "small molecule cations", "NMR", "LCMS", "membrane degradation"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "PHYLOTRANSCRIPTOMICS, TAXONOMY, AND ECOLOGY OF THE CARIBBEAN-ENDEMIC MISTLETOES DENDROPEMON (LORANTHACEAE)", "id": "15121mac587", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15121", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is about the diversity, taxonomy, and ecology of mistletoes of the Caribbean Islands. The main topics treated here are: (1) a summary of the diversity of mistletoes from the Caribbean Islands, discussing our current knowledge of their taxonomy, ecology, and conservation; (2) a reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationships among the endemic Caribbean mistletoes Dendropemon (Santalales: Loranthaceae) using modern molecular tools and the proposal of taxonomic and nomenclatural updates; and (3) an ecological study exploring the interactions between a species of Dendropemon mistletoes with local trees and bird dispersers.\nIn the first part, a brief introduction to the Caribbean Islands is presented, including its geologic history and biological diversity. Then, mistletoes from the Caribbean are introduced, and their biology, ecology, and conservation discussed. A dichotomous key for all genera is provided as well as a taxonomic summary of all currently recognized species, which includes their general distributions.\nThe second part shows a study focused on the utility of multiple transcriptomes over DNA barcoding for resolving phylogenetic relationships at and below species level and testing monophyly of species using the Caribbean-endemic mistletoes Dendropemon (Santalales: Loranthaceae) as study case. Dendropemon is the most diverse of the over 180 regionally endemic genera, and the only one present in most of the major islands across the Caribbean. The results demonstrate the capacity of transcriptomes to discern among closely related species and even within a species, and shows that not all species of Dendropemon were monophyletic. A time tree analysis also shows that Dendropemon is a young genus that experienced short speciation periods and rapid diversifications. Based on the results, an updated taxonomic treatment is presented which includes a dichotomous key and descriptions for the forty species of Dendropemon proposed here.\nIn the third part, an ecological study was conducted exploring the interplay between a species of mistletoe (Dendropemon caribaeus) with local trees and frugivorous birds in Puerto Rico. In this study, phenological data of local trees were combined with inoculation experiments of mistletoe seeds on branches of trees to determine whether capacity to establish seeds versus ability to be dispersed onto those trees via birds is what limits host distribution of D. caribaeus. Results show that the compatibility between the host and the mistletoe is more important than seed dispersal explaining the local abundance of mistletoe. However, the availability of fruits modulates the behavior of birds, and trees with short fruiting phenologies are less prone to receive mistletoe seeds than trees with extended fruiting phenologies, even when they are compatible hosts for the mistletoe.\nIn summary, the diversity, taxonomy, and ecology of the Caribbean mistletoes were examined with a focus on the regionally endemic genus Dendropemon by combining modern molecular techniques for phylogenetic inferences, traditional taxonomy, field experiments, and ecological modelling. The information presented here aims to provide an updated taxonomic summary of Caribbean mistletoes, which comprise a fascinating but understudied group of plants in one of the top biodiversity hotspots in the world.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16930], "author_name_tesi": "Caraballo-Ortiz, Marcos A", "last_name_ssi": "Caraballo-Ortiz", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Marcos", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tomas A Carlo-Joglar", "Andrew George Stephenson", "Claude Walker Depamphilis", "Heather M Hines", "David Michael Geiser"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tomas A Carlo-Joglar, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Chair", "Claude Walker Depamphilis, Committee Member", "Heather M Hines, Committee Member", "David Michael Geiser, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Loranthaceae", "Viscaceae", "Santalaceae", "Arceuthobium", "Phoradendron", "Dendrophthora", "Psittacanthus", "Oryctanthus", "Passovia", "Dendropemon", "Endemism", "West Indies", "Phylogenetics", "Transcriptome", "Antilles", "Fruit Dispersal", "Parasitic Plants", "Caribbean Islands", "Caribbean Flora", "Endemic Plants"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "New Instrumental Developments in Cluster ToF-SIMS\n\n", "id": "10446", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "151", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry is a surface analysis technique that utilizes a high energy primary ion beam which, upon collision with the sample, causes the ejection of secondary ions from the sample. These ions are then separated based on their mass in a time-of-flight mass analyzer. By rastering  a highly focused beam at many locations on a sample and recording a mass spectrum at each of these locations, chemical specific images can be created of the sample. While extremely powerful in principle, this technique has several significant challenges. The two most persistent and problematic are low sensitivity and sample fragmentation upon impact of the primary ion.\nExciting progress in addressing these issues was brought about by development of cluster projectiles such as Aun+, SF5+, Bin+, and C60+. These larger projectiles spread their energy over a wider surface area and have been shown through simulation and fundamental studies to increase the number of secondary ions ejected per impact as well as to better remove any damage that occurs during the impact. This leads to the inference that a simple way to collect more secondary ions is to impact the sample with more primary ions. Unfortunately, the ToF-SIMS instrumentation has not necessarily advanced in step with primary ion sources and so the true utility of cluster projectiles is not being fulfilled.\nIn this work, we report on the addition of a 20 keV C60+ primary ion source to a commercial MALDI/ESI mass spectrometer by Applied Biosystems / MDS Analytical Technologies, the QStar XL mass spectrometer. This instrument is equipped with an orthogonal ToF which allows the primary ion source to operate in a continuous fashion as opposed to short, widely spaced pulses typical of traditional instrumentation. This mode of operation allows the delivery of several orders of magnitude more primary ion fluence. In addition, the QStar XL is a multiple quadrupole mass spectrometer which enables tandem mass spectrometry experiments (MS/MS) to aid in ion identification through collision induced dissociation fragmentation analysis.\nAside from the differing geometry of the ToF mass analyzer, the most unusual aspect of the QStar XL is the fact that it operates at significantly higher pressures, at least surrounding the sample, than typical high vacuum mass spectrometers. Two different gas inlets result in different pressures at the sample. In collisional cooling mode, the pressure at the sample is ~1 Torr. This high pressure is required to reduce the fragmentation of electrospray and MALDI generated secondary ions. Unfortunately, utilizing this gas inlet resulted in a significant loss of SIMS generated secondary ions, likely due to scattering, and so proved to be unfeasible. Using the alternate gas inlet at Q0, N2 pressure at the sample is ~5 x 10-3 Torr. The vast majority of the experiments described in this thesis are using the Q0 gas configuration which results in collisional focusing, but not collisional cooling. Chapter two deals with the experimental considerations of operating a high voltage, high velocity,  primary ion source on an instrument that requires high pressures for operation. Efforts to shield the primary ion beam from high gas include incorporating a differential pumping sleeve and a small aperture nose cone that not only restricts the amount of gas leaking in to the beam column, but also reduces the distance with which the primary ion beam needs to travel in high pressure before reaching the sample. These efforts result in a beam column pressure of less than 1x 10-6 Torr while the sample region is at normal operating condition of 5 x 10-3 Torr. Consequences of the high pressure on the primary ion beam characteristics do not seem serious. Beam spot size vs. pressure was measured with an atomic force profilometer on a thin-film of the peptide gramicidin S, and no significant broadening of the beam profile was seen for pressures ranging from  < 5 x 10-4 to 8 x 10-3 Torr N2. Additionally, spectra obtained from this prototype instrument do not differ substantially from the those obtained from the high vacuum pulsed beam instrument with regards to degree of sample fragmentation. It is likely that were the C60+ ions fragmenting significantly due to collisions with N2, the sample spectra would show more fragmentation. In fact, there is some evidence that higher pressures may be preventing fragmentation through collisional cooling; a phenomenon that occurs when low energy ions transfer some of their thermal energy to neutral N2 molecules. This instrument is designed to take advantage of this when analyzing MALDI and electrospray generated ions, but evidence of it occurring with SIMS generated ions has not previously been seen. The QStar XL operates with negligible extraction voltages and so the use of high gas pressures near the sample and a decreasing pressure gradient through the quadrupoles to the mass analyzer facilitates ion transmission through collision focusing. Similar to collisional cooling, collisional focusing occurs when low energy secondary ions collide with neutral N2 molecules  resulting in a restriction of their transverse motion which creates a beam of ions. The requirement of this instrument to operate under collisional focusing conditions is demonstrated on several molecules in chapter 2 and 3; however it should be noted that collisional focusing is required for all analytes.\nIn chapter 3, comparisons to traditional SIMS instrumentation as well as to MALDI generated data from the QStar XL are made. Orthogonal ToF designs introduce a secondary ion loss that is not present in axial ToF designs, and so secondary ion efficiencies (secondary ions detected/primary ion impact) were of great interest. It was found that the secondary ion efficiencies from SIMS generated data from the QStar XL were similar to the high vacuum pulsed SIMS instrument in this lab. Secondary ion efficiencies for both instruments for indium and gramicidin S are listed in table 3-1.\nOrthogonal time-of-flight mass analyzers decouple the secondary ion ejection event from the mass analysis. This leads to more tightly bunched secondary ions reaching the detector resulting in superior mass resolution. An example of the superior mass resolution of this instrument is demonstrated on digitonin, a detergent utilized to solubilize membrane proteins, precipitate cholesterol, and permeabilize cell membranes. In addition, the spectra acquired for this molecule with SIMS, matrix enhanced SIMS and MALDI are compared.\nThere are some limits to this prototype instrument, primarily in the area of beam size. In chapter 4, it is shown how this instrument can be used in tandem with a high spatial resolution pulsed beam mass spectrometer to improve sub-cellular imaging. MS/MS data of cholesterol taken with the QStar XL led to the discovery of a more prominent cholesterol fragment than is typically used to map cholesterol. The efficacy of using this fragment as an indicator of cholesterol was tested by doping one set of cells with cholesterol and comparing the fragment m/z+ 147, among others, to an undoped cell population. This fragment showed an increase that followed the pseudomolecular ion, m/z+ 369 which is commonly chosen as a cholesterol indicator, but at higher intensities. In addition, previous single cell imaging experiments were revisited and it was shown that by mapping m/z+ 147, better image contrast was achieved.\nDespite the imaging limitations, exciting results were achieved in imaging tissue and large single cells. Chapter 5 reports rat brain imaging, single cell sea snail neuron imaging, as well as a demonstration of the ability of MS/MS to differentiate the structural isomers leucine and isoleucine. Large samples such as rat brain sections present some unique challenges for mass spectral imaging. Traditional ToF-SIMS mass spectrometers have very small fields of view, making imaging of large samples difficult or impossible. MALDI instruments, such as the QStar XL, have the means to image large samples, but usually only at poor spatial resolution. In this experiment, the unique abilities of a primary ion source coupled to a MALDI mass spectrometer are demonstrated by imaging a rat brain at successively smaller fields of view; from 10 mm to 0.5 mm. \nLarge single cell analysis is possible despite the spatial resolution limitation. Imaging of 350 \u00b5m sea snail neurons is demonstrated revealing subcellular localization of cholesterol and vitamin E. In addition it is shown that MS/MS spectra of vitamin E can be obtained from a single cell.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [150], "author_name_tesi": "Carado, Anthony James", "last_name_ssi": "Carado", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Anthony", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nicholas Winograd", "Nicholas Winograd", "Philip C.

Innovative solar storage tanks that have two internal heat exchange coils can improve performance and reduce energy consumption in mechanical systems that employ a hydronic space heating system. The purpose of this project is to develop a Matlab model of one such system found at the MorningStar solar home at the Pennsylvania State University campus. Because the solar storage tank is a complex system involving three simultaneous energy exchanges, the model is necessary to evaluate the potential benefits and understand the dynamics of the novel storage tank. With the developed model, simulations are run to evaluate the net daily energy balance of the building with the grid, as well as the occupant comfort levels for several heating season days. The simulations explore the effects of cloud cover, time of year, temperature and flow rate set points for the radiant floor heating system, and flow rate through the solar hot water collector. These simulations are run for several mechanical system designs in order to broaden the applicability of the results and to demonstrate the flexibility of the developed code. Several conclusions are drawn from the simulation results, including recommendations for set points and suggestions for optimal system configuration when using a dual heat exchanger solar storage tank coupled with a hydronic heating system and a solar hot water collector. First, supplying the coolest possibly temperature into the radiant floor heating system allows for the greatest solar thermal energy generation, which improves the overall performance of the system, although determining this minimum temperature is not intuitive and can be solved with the aid of simulations. Second, routing either the domestic hot water system or the space heating system, whichever of the two has the least efficient backup heating system, through the bulk of the solar storage tank may allow for greater energy use reduction, depending on the time of year, solar availability, and system set points.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9963], "author_name_tesi": "Carbonnier, Kevin Mike", "last_name_ssi": "Carbonnier", "middle_name_ssi": "Mike", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen James Treado", "Stephen James Treado", "Jelena Srebric", "Jeffrey Brownson", "Susan W Stewart"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen James Treado, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen James Treado, Committee Chair", "Jelena Srebric, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Brownson, Committee Member", "Susan W Stewart, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Solar thermal", "MATLAB", "Simulation", "Set Points", "Renewable Energy", "Combisystem", "Building Model", "PI Control", "Controls"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "IDENTIFYING EFFECTIVE MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGIES FOR ELLS THROUGH SOCIAL INTERACTION\n", "id": "12482", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3497", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigated the nature of dyadic interaction between secondary English Language learners engaged in mathematics peer tutoring sessions.

These proteins loosen the linkage between cellulose microfibrils in a non-enzymatic fashion, allowing these microfibrils to slide past one another.  This loosening action has been implicated as being important in a wide variety of growth and developmental processes in plants.  Because this protein superfamily appears to be critical for the proper growth and development of land plants, its origin and evolutionary history has become a question of great interest.  Two recent papers from Sampedro <i>et al.</i> used gene colinearity data integrated with traditional phylogenetic analyses to define 17 orthologous groups of angiosperm expansins between <i>Arabidopsis</i>, <i>Populus</i> and rice.  The work presented in this dissertation provides the first look at the makeup of the expansin superfamily in basal land plant lineages.  The sequencing of the genomes of the bryophyte <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> and the lycophyte <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i> by the Joint Genome Initiative of the Department of Energy allowed for the assembly of the expansin superfamily in these organisms.  What is revealed are gene superfamilies containing EXPA and EXPB families but lacking EXLA or EXLB families.  This indicates that the EXLA and EXLB families arose sometime after the divergence of the lycophytes, or that these divergent expansin families have been lost from early land plant lineages.  The <i>Physcomitrella</i> EXPA sequences show a high degree of conservation at putatively critical amino acid residues, suggesting a conservation of biochemical function with angiosperm expansins.  Phylogenetic analyses seem to indicate, however, that most of these genes are bryophyte-specific lineages paraphyletic to all angiosperm EXPA genes.  The <i>Physcomitrella</i> EXPB genes appear to form a monophyletic group sister to all angiosperm EXPB genes, and they also show several changes at normally conserved amino acid residues.  Both the EXPA and EXPB genes of <i>Physcomitrella</i> show a relatively variable intron pattern, but these patterns do not yet warrant a change to the ancestral expansin intron patterns hypothesized in the literature.  Although <i>Physcomitrella</i> expansins appear to be evolving independently from their angiosperm counterparts, EXPA and EXPB gene families of similar sizes have evolved in parallel, indicating some critical importance of gene number for proper expansin function.  In contrast to the apparently divergent history of the expansin superfamily in bryophytes, <i>Selaginella</i> possesses a superfamily, which, although still difficult to definitively relate to angiosperm clades, seems to be much more closely related to angiosperm expansins than to the <i>Physcomitrella</i> superfamily.  It is even possible to firmly place two <i>Selaginella</i> EXPA genes as a sister group to an angiosperm clade.  Preliminary expression pattern analysis of these two <i>Selaginella</i> EXPA genes indicates that they do not share the root-hair-specific expression pattern observed for the <i>Arabidopsis</i> members of this angiosperm EXPA clade.  <i>Selaginella</i> EXPA and EXPB intron patterns are highly conserved and reflect the ancestral states proposed in earlier works.  Preliminary expression pattern data for two <i>Physcomitrella</i> EXPA genes indicates that, like their angiosperm counterparts, bryophyte expansins are expressed in a tissue-specific manner consistent with a role in plant growth and development.  This work also reveals that, like angiosperm expansins, certain <i>Physcomitrella</i> expansins seem to have their expression regulated by plant hormones.  Although functionality studies (both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>) of <i>Physcomitrella</i> expansins presented here were not able to show a role for bryophyte expansins in cell growth or wall loosening, future work may well illuminate such a role using the lessons learned here as a starting point.

Accordingly, solutions have been proposed, but few have experienced widespread adoption.  It is thought that unacceptable tradeoffs between field-based testing, performance gains, risk, and other factors are causing a development/deployment impasse.  To resolve this deadlock and incentivize deployments that address known Internet issues, two alternatives to large-scale field-based testing are promoted.\n\nPerformance and validation assessment of BGP, a policy-based path vectoring routing protocol, is difficult. Its testing methodologies are generally limited to small experimental scales and/or contain insufficient modeling detail (e.g., lack of routing policy).  To address these limitations, two new testing techniques are proposed herein.  The first technique, the AS Path Solver (where AS denotes an autonomous system), models a policy-based path vectoring routing protocol using a group theoretic structure called a path algebra.  This approach develops an algebraic framework which supports the use of Jacobi iteration to solve for an experimental topology's steady-state routing tables. As such, the AS Path Solver possesses a straightforward algorithmic form which should be less difficult to implement than that needed for discrete-event network simulation. \n\nHowever, the AS Path Solver does not demonstrate the interactions between a path-vector routing protocol and other network activities (i.e., non-routing protocols, application traffic). As such, a second technique called the Scale-Down Transformation is proposed to lower the resource consumption (i.e., memory and run-time) required by discrete-event network simulation of path-vector routing protocols.   Developed using Thevenin equivalence, Gaussian elimination, and several heuristics, the Scale-Down Transformation produces a modified network topology model that is reduced in its number of ASs.  The Scale-Down Transformation also preserves several characteristics (e.g., length) of the path vectors such that simulated traffic flows entering/exiting the ASs are preserved over the topology reduction. \n\nTo determine if these two proposed techniques are practical, their performance (i.e., run-time and memory usage) are measured over network topologies ranging in scale from tens to thousands of ASs.

This is achieved by combining multi-dimensional data visualization techniques with visual steering commands to allow designers to \u201csteer\u201d the optimization process while searching for the best, or Pareto optimal, design(s).  In this thesis, results from an empirical assessment of the performance of these visual steering commands are presented.  This is done by performing a study that compares the performance of different combinations of these visual steering commands to automated samplers, including a multi-objective genetic algorithm, that are executed \u201cblindly\u201d on the same design problems with no human intervention.  The resultant Pareto frontiers generated by the combinations of visual steering commands and automated samplers are compared to one another using the &#949;-performance metric to assess the extent to which they have identified the reference (or best known) Pareto frontier.  Specifically, three test problems are examined: (1) a sandwich beam, (2) an aircraft wing, and (3) a vehicle configuration problem.  The results of this study indicate that the visual steering commands \u2013 depending on the complexity of the test problem \u2013 can provide a 3x - 6x increase in the number of Pareto solutions that are obtained when the human is \u201cin-the-loop\u201d during the optimization process compared to an automated sampler.  The improvements are even more dramatic in cases where automated samplers have a difficult time finding feasible solutions.  In addition user-guided trials can provide from a 10x - 32x increase in the number of Pareto solutions obtained over random searching.  As such, this study provides empirical evidence of the benefits of interactive visualization-based strategies to support engineering design optimization and decision-making.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1359], "author_name_tesi": "Carlsen, Daniel Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Carlsen", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ATSV", "trade space exploration", "visual steering", "user-guided", "interactive optimization", "multi-objective genetic algorithm", "visualization"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The evolutionary ecology of intraspecific trait variation in larval amphibians", "id": "21115", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9675", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Individual organisms of the same species can differ from each other in a variety of phenotypic traits (\u201cintraspecific trait variation\u201d), a phenomenon that is increasingly understood to impact our understanding of natural ecological systems.

In this dissertation, I used tadpoles as a system to explore two general questions: why do conspecifics differ in behavior, and what are the ecological implications of behavioral variation?

Indeed, philosophers and scholars from across the academy have spent considerable time and energy describing these phenomena.  While most researchers believe that play and games are different, little consensus exists on whether or not they can be defined and, if so, what exactly they are.  Likewise, while most writers agree that play and games have some normative value, there has been much less agreement on precisely what that value is.  Therefore, this study constitutes an attempt to re-conceptualize and clarify the nature and value of play and games.  \n\nAs such, this research is both metaphysical and normative in nature.  The metaphysical side of this work attempts to identify central features of games and play.  The normative analysis is constructed on those features.  Insights for both parts of this research are gleaned primarily from the existing literature as well as reflections on personal play and game experiences.  \n\nChapter One provides a critical summary of play and game analyses from the Classical Period, the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the Enlightenment, 20th Century American Pragmatism, and the Modern Era socio-historians and cultural scientists.  From this literature I identify points of possible consensus and disagreement as well as recurring themes that deserve further attention.  Chapter Two is an analysis of the contemporary dialogue on play and games.  I will argue that while considerable progress has been made on the nature and value of play and games, significant questions still remain.  In Chapter Three I address one of those questions.  It is related to the conflation of play and games.  This chapter includes examples of conflation in scholarly writing, an analysis of play and games as both attitudes and activities, and speculations on three sources or causes of conflation.  Chapter Four is a metaphysical and axiological re-conceptualization of play and games.  The metaphysical arguments of the first half of this chapter (play as autotelic, fragile, voluntary, and uncertain, and games as challenges or problems, gratuitous, and conventional) lead to the normative claims that follow.  Play and games so described, I suggest, provide a deeper engagement with the world than that which is afforded by ordinary or normal existence.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1112], "author_name_tesi": "Carlson, Chad Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Carlson", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Chad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Mark Dyreson", "Douglas Ray Hochstetler", "Christopher P Long"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Scott Kretchmar, Committee Chair", "Mark Dyreson, Committee Member", "Douglas Ray Hochstetler, Committee Member", "Christopher P Long, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["play", "games", "sports", "metaphysics", "value"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Associations between Women's Autonomy and Women's Experience of Domestic Violence with Children's Nutritional Status", "id": "21967", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10079", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A mother\u2019s social context plays an important role in determining the health and well-being of her children.

Human language is, however, an extremely complex phenomenon and decades of research have raised at least as many questions as they have answered. In particular, the learning of additional languages has fueled a wealth of research, especially regarding the cognitive underpinnings of adult second language acquisition. This dissertation seeks to shed light on the question of adult language acquisition by exploring learners\u2019 knowledge of fine-grained statistical patterns in Spanish morphophonology. Crucially, it adds to this an exploration of the role of certain kinds of memory and attentional control in modulating adults\u2019 sensitivity to these subtle patterns in their second language grammar.\nTwo areas of recent research are especially relevant to the approach taken here. First, recent findings point to the ability of both adults and children to segment words and extrapolate grammatical rules from statistical patterns in (generally artificial) language input. Second, a large body of psycholinguistic literature shows that adults are sensitive to frequency at a variety of levels of structure, including the positional probability of segments and syllables in words. These findings suggest that at least some grammatical information is resonant in individuals\u2019 experience of language, and that both adults and children have access to statistical learning mechanisms that allow them to capitalize on frequency information in their first language. Findings such as these have led to the development of emergentist and usage-based theories of language that address phenomena from child language acquisition to historical linguistics, and which develop a view of grammar as instantiated in statistical patterns in actual language, dynamically evolving in response to subtle changes in the frequency of particular structures. \nImportantly, such a view of language structure, learning, and representation suggests both a continuity in the mechanisms of language acquisition throughout the lifespan, and also specific reasons for the obvious differences in the course and outcome of language acquisition in children and adults. This opens the door to investigating the contribution of these mechanisms to adult second language learning, and to exploring the differences between child and adult second language acquisition based on the cognitive structures that underlie and modulate frequency-based learning processes.\nIn line with these findings, the present research investigates the sensitivity of adult second language learners to a subtle probabilistic subpattern of Spanish diphthongization in derived words, and compares their performance with that of native Spanish speakers. The Spanish diphthong/mid-vowel alternation may be explained through a highly consistent rule in Spanish verbs, but in suffixed forms such as those examined here, the probability that a given form will conform to the consistent rule varies according to the suffix used. The present experiments measure learners\u2019 processing of neologisms created using real Spanish stems with alternating diphthongs and real derivational suffixes as a way of assessing their sensitivity to the probability of a diphthongized stem in specific morphological contexts.\nThe consequences of this probabilistic pattern in diphthongization are measured in participants\u2019 perception and production on a lexical decision task and a conditional naming task in which participants say palabra \u2018word\u2019 if they hear a real Spanish word, and repeat the nonword items, including the neologisms. Learners are also compared based on Spanish proficiency and on three measures of cognitive capacity accuracy in repeating words from an unfamiliar foreign language (Korean), inhibitory control, as measured on the Simon task, and working memory, based on reading span scores.\nNative speakers performing the same tasks are shown to be sensitive to this subtle probabilistic variability in their processing of neologisms, although the results vary in strength between the lexical decision and conditional naming tasks. Strikingly, learners also appear to be sensitive to this variability, despite the complex morpholexical and paradigmatic knowledge required to detect these patterns. However, learner behavior differs from that of native speakers in interesting ways. The lexical biases of some suffixes appear to be more easily acquired than others, and learner performance differs more dramatically between reaction time and error rate measures, and between lexical decision and conditional naming. This suggests that the morphophonological pattern in question may not affect all levels of lexical processing, and that its effects are also contingent to some extent on task demands. Finally, there is also evidence that phonological memory, and to a lesser extent working memory also modulate learners\u2019 sensitivity to probabilistic variation in Spanish diphthongization, but these effects also vary from one dependent measure to another.\nThe results have important implications for theories of adult second language acquisition, suggesting that adults are sensitive to similar kinds of statistical information in language experience to that exploited in emergentist theories of first language acquisition. This indicates that adult language acquisition may rely on many of the same cognitive processes as does child language acquisition, although adults\u2019 more developed cognitive resources also lead to important differences.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4352], "author_name_tesi": "Carlson, Matthew Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Carlson", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Henry Gerfen", "Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Judith Fran Kroll", "Daniel J Weiss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Henry Gerfen, Committee Chair", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Committee Member", "Judith Fran Kroll, Committee Member", "Daniel J Weiss, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["linguistics", "psycholinguistics", "second language acquisition", "Spanish", "phonology", "diphthongization", "emergent grammar", "usage-based grammar", "working memory"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Using lidar to detect the breeding habitat characteristics of the Cerulean Warbler (setophaga cerulea) and identify potential habitat at the landscape-level", "id": "28808", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11927", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Habitat loss and degradation play a major role in the population decline of many Neotropical migrant birds.  One such Neotropical migrant, the Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea (Wilson, 1810)), is a species of high conservation concern due to its significant and steady decline.  Cerulean Warblers have specific breeding habitat needs, such as a diverse vegetation structure with well-established upper-canopy and understory layers along with canopy gaps.  As an area-sensitive species, management of large tracts of mature forest is essential to any conservation plan.  Field surveys for suitable breeding habitat at the landscape-level, however, are labor intensive and prohibitively expensive.  Light detection and ranging (lidar) is a more efficient tool of describing, in fine detail, the topography and vertical vegetation structure at large scales.  Metrics derived from airborne leaf-off topographic lidar were therefore combined with bird survey data from the latest Breeding Bird Atlas (BBA) to create predictive habitat models at two spatial scales for two physiographic provinces in Pennsylvania.  At both spatial scales, the model demonstrated the importance of elevation, slope, aspect, and vegetative complexity to the habitat selection of Cerulean Warblers.  However, the landscape-level models performed better than those at the territory-level for predicting the habitat where Cerulean Warblers were observed.  At the landscape-level, differences among provinces were also noted.  In the Appalachian Plateau Province study area, birds were positively associated with a denser upper-canopy than midstory, whereas in the Ridge and Valley Province study area a less dense upper-canopy and relatively more dense midstory was preferred.  Overall, Cerulean Warblers were detected in areas with steeper slopes, east-facing aspects, and a more diverse vegetation structure.  The latter was indicated by a greater standard deviation or interquartile distance of lidar return heights, a higher rumple index, or differences in lidar return proportions within various vegetative strata.  The additional information gained from lidar could prove critical to the conservation of Cerulean Warblers and other species that rely on similar habitat by identifying potential habitat at a landscape scale while taking into consideration regional preferences.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11372], "author_name_tesi": "Carlton, Alissa Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Carlton", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Alissa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Zenner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Zenner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cerulean Warbler", "Setophaga cerulea", "lidar", "habitat selection", "habitat model", "suitability", "vegetation structure", "conservation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Algseer: An Architecture For Extraction, Indexing And\nsearch Of Algorithms In Scientific Literature", "id": "18436", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8975", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Algorithms are ubiquitous in the computer science literature.

A submicron alpha-alumina was used as the inorganic component and poly(vinyl alcohol)\u20134\u00a0wt% glycerol was the base binder system. Four compositions were spray dried containing ~2, 3, 4 and 5\u00a0wt% binder (dry weight basis alumina). The resulting powders were classified and the 75\u2013150\u00a0\u00b5m granule size range powders prepared for testing. These powders were conditioned at five different relative humidities to adjust binder Tg to five different values between \u201332\u00b0C and +35\u00b0C. \n\nAll twenty compositions were tested in uniaxial compaction in a 6.34\u00a0mm diameter cylindrical steel die to stresses from ~6\u00a0MPa to ~175\u00a0MPa. Green strengths of the samples produced were measured using the diametral compression test. Compaction curves were constructed and springback on ejection was measured. A selection of similar samples was prepared and dimensional changes after compaction were measured as a function of time. It was found that the compositions with low Tg during compaction resulted in the highest achievable densities and green strengths. However, green strength increased and achievable green density decreased with increasing binder content. Dimensional changes on ejection were found to be dominated by the instantaneous springback in the axial direction (~5\u20138%). Radial springback was generally less than 1% and the total dimensional change due to time-dependent relaxation was generally less than 0.5%.\n\nIt was observed that compaction behavior was affected by sample size. A technique was developed which determines this effect. By measuring two compaction curves of a powder of different sample size, it was possible to calculate the force opposing compaction due to friction at the die wall. This allowed the calculation of the intrinsic compaction curve of the material, i.e., its compaction behavior in a frictionless die. With these two parameters known it became possible to predict compaction curves of the powder for different sample sizes. Compaction curves calculated in this manner predicted experimentally determined compaction curves with correlation coefficients greater than 0.99.\n\nTo aid in the characterization of individual granules and their interaction during compaction, an analysis was developed that calculates granule strength and intergranular bond strength during compaction and the free granule strength. In a series of pellets pressed to a wide range of pressures, granule deformation and adhesion varied greatly between samples. The strengths of these samples were measured by diametral compression and the fracture surfaces were analyzed to determine the relative amounts of intergranular and intragranular fracture. A quadratic curve was found to describe the relationship between the overall green strength of the sample and the area fraction of intergranular fracture. By applying knowledge of the physical process at the 0, 50 and 100% intergranular fracture points along this curve, this curve was deconvoluted to the unique pair of linear functions that track the intergranular bond strength and the intragranular strength throughout the compaction cycle. The 100% intergranular fracture point corresponds to little or no consolidation of the powder; therefore, the value of the determined intragranular strength line is a measure of the free granule strength. The free granule strength measured by this technique results in values much lower than the often-reported granule yield point measurement due to the difference in loading of the granules.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5119], "author_name_tesi": "Carneim, Robert David", "last_name_ssi": "Carneim", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Lynn Messing", "Virendra Puri", "Ian Roland Harrison", "James Hansell Adair", "John Richard Hellmann Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Chair", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Ian Roland Harrison, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "John Richard Hellmann Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["binder", "polyvinyl alcohol", "granules", "compaction", "strength", "compaction curves", "modeling", "friction"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Work Values: Examining Opportunities for Integration and  Differences Across Generation, Race, and Between Gender", "id": "14141kmc452", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14141", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this study, the relation between John Holland\u2019s (1997) career interests and Donald Super\u2019s (1990) work values were examined in order to extend the integrative framework known as the Atlas Model of Individual Differences (Armstrong et al., 2008).

Vegetables are an important source of vitamins and minerals, but they also may be able to combat the onset of obesity by displacing more energy dense foods in the diet. This intervention aimed to increase vegetable intake by creating flavor variety in vegetables served within a meal. Variety has previously been shown to delay sensory specific satiety and to increase food intake. Preschool aged (3-5 years-old) children attended two separate laboratories visit and were given a test-meal of common foods: pasta, applesauce, milk, water, and three servings of carrots. For the \u201cNo Variety\u201d condition, all three servings of carrots were seasoned with the same herb and spice blend. For the \u201cVariety\u201d condition, the three servings of carrots were all seasoned with a different herb and spice blend. Children\u2019s liking of the seasoned carrots was assessed on a hedonic scale, along with a salted control carrot. No differences were found in children\u2019s individual acceptance ratings of the three types of seasoned carrots, or between the seasoned carrots and the salted carrot, but 41% of children selected the salted carrot as their favorite in a rank-order task. Children\u2019s bitter sensitivity was assessed using a suprathreshold solution of 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP). Children did not consume significantly more carrots in either the Variety or the No Variety condition (36.5 \u00b1 40.5 g and 35.9 \u00b1 43.7 g, respectively; T = 0.15, P = 0.88) when directly comparing differences in grams. Carrot intake at the two conditions was also adjusted into a proportion of total carrots consumed at both meals, in order scale significant differences relative to children\u2019s individual intakes rather than the total weight of carrots served. The proportion of carrots consumed at each meal were not statistically different (P = 0.58), but there was a significant interaction between meal condition and PROP status (F1,40 = 5.16, P = 0.03). PROP tasters consumed relatively more carrots in the Variety condition, while PROP nontasters had the opposite response. It is possible that PROP tasters were better able to discriminate the differences between the seasoned carrots in the Variety condition. These findings suggest that seasoning vegetables with a variety of herbs and spices may be an effective strategy to increase vegetable intake in PROP tasters. Once replicated, this form of targeted intervention could be particularly helpful because PROP tasters tend to consume fewer vegetables than nontasters. These results also suggest that PROP status may influence sensory specific satiety and affect an individual\u2019s response to flavor variety. More work is needed to clarify the role of individual herbs and spices on flavor perception and to determine what levels of spice can be used to optimize acceptance.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14237], "author_name_tesi": "Carney, ELIZABETH MARGARET", "last_name_ssi": "Carney", "middle_name_ssi": "MARGARET", "first_name_ssi": "ELIZABETH", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen L.

The hydrothermal vents of the northeast Pacific Ocean and the cold seeps of the Gulf of Mexico serve as the setting for the work in this dissertation.  Populations of the vent tubeworm Ridgeia piscesae at the Juan de Fuca Ridge exhibit a number of diverse phenotypes.  Like all deep-sea tubeworms, R. piscesae relies on a symbiosis with sulfur-oxidizing bacteria within an organ in its trunk region and requires a constant supply of sulfide and oxygen from its surroundings.  Different R. piscesae phenotypes each inhabit distinct microhabitats ranging from low temperature, low sulfide, diffuse flow, basalt substrate to vigorous flow, high temperature, sulfide chimneys.  This study first uses a genome-wide DNA fingerprinting survey to test whether genetic variation undetected by previous studies underlies the two most extreme R. piscesae phenotypes from chimney and basalt environments.  Our results confirm that this is a genetically undifferentiated population, supporting that this tubeworm species displays a high degree of phenotypic plasticity.  Next, focusing on hemoglobin as a candidate gene, this study examines whether chimney and basalt R. piscesae differentially express the chains used to assemble their extracellular hemoglobin molecules, the direct link between the animal and its local environment.  The gene expression analysis shows that R. piscesae on high-flow chimneys express higher levels of globin chains than animals from low-flow basalt environments, and within a phenotype, gene expression varies according to collection sites and different chemical environments.  The genomic DNA sequences of the six globin chains examined in the expression analysis revealed no phenotype-specific nucleotide variation within or upstream of the genes, thus implicating trans-regulation of this tubeworm hemoglobin system.  \n\tIn the Gulf of Mexico, two mitochondrial and six nuclear markers were used to test whether gene flow between populations of the mussel Bathymodiolus childressi is limited over its range of depth, geographic distance, and environmental conditions.

The ultimate goal of literacy interventions is to support an individual to independently read, extract meaning, and learn from connected text (Carnine, Silber, Kame\u2019enui, & Tarver 2010; Duke & Carlisle, 2011). Reading and writing skills are especially important for individuals with complex communication needs (i.e., CCN, speech skills that do not meet their daily communication needs). With literacy skills, individuals can use a range of communication options, fully participate in society, and potentially change attitudinal barriers (e.g., low expectation, lack of inclusion). Knowledge of letter-sound correspondences and sight words are needed in order to read and write and are two important components to early literacy instruction (Carnine et a.l, 2010; Gabig, 2009). Two studies were conducted in order to investigate the impact of adapted instruction on the acquisition of letter-sound correspondences (Study 1) and sight words (Study 2), by older learners, with severe disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, and CCN. A multiple baseline across behaviors (letter-sound sets or sight word sets) research design was used to evaluate the effects of the adapted instructions.

In large part, this is due to new observations that have widened the spectrum of observed fault slip behaviors and recent technological advances that have allowed the sampling of faults from hypocentral depths.  In addition, the debate over the apparent low strength of some large, plate boundary faults continues.  In order to provide insight into the processes and controls that dictate fault strength and slip behavior, detailed laboratory investigations on samples of fault material, both outcrop and borehole, are necessary.  Both material types are available for the San Andreas Fault (SAF) in central California where a borehole crossed the actively creeping fault at a depth of 2.7 km.  I will use results from this case study to make larger determinations about the controls of fault strength and behavior.\n I evaluate the results of a large number of laboratory studies designed to determine, 1) the strength of the crust surrounding the SAF, a large, plate boundary fault, 2) the frictional behavior of materials returned from hypocentral depths, 3) the controls of the observed frictional behavior, and 4) the role of mineralogy in controlling the healing behavior of a variety of tectonic faults.  The results of these experiments give great insight into the processes that control the mode of fault slip, which ranges from steady, aseismic creep to violent, seismic rupture.  \n\tThe San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) project is a fault zone drilling initiative that was undertaken to fully characterize the behavior of materials and determine in situ conditions of the San Andreas Fault in central California at hypocentral depths.  Results from experiments designed to characterize material in the 3D volume surrounding the borehole indicate that crust surrounding the fault is strong.  Samples of granodiorite, arkosic sandstone, and siltstone returned from the borehole, wall rock on either side of the fault, are frictionally strong (\u00b5=0.56-0.66).  These samples come from within ~2 km of the active fault strand.  Additionally, the results from experiments on outcrop samples representative of the lithologies found surrounding the fault at depth also show frictionally strong behavior (\u00b5=0.56-0.68).  A sample of serpentinite, thought to abut the fault at depth, showed low friction, \u00b5 = 0.18-0.26, and velocity-strengthening friction, consistent with observations of fault creep.  The implications of these experiments are that the crust surrounding the fault is strong, whereas material thought to be in (or involved) with the fault at depth is weak. \nTo further investigate fault behavior, I performed experiments on well-located samples of cuttings and core returned from the SAFOD borehole at a vertical depth of 2.7 km.  Material was recovered surrounding and from within 3 active faults penetrated by the SAFOD borehole.  Two strands are actively creeping and were cored recovering intact fault material for analysis and experimental work.  Experiments performed on cuttings from the main creeping strand are the first to indicate that mineralogy, specifically the group of clays, smectite, is responsible for observed behavior.  These experiments showed that material from the fault is weak and exhibits near zero rates of frictional restrengthening or healing.  Frictional restrengthening, along with velocity-weakening friction behavior (unstable slip), are both required for repeated earthquake rupture along the same fault plane or patch.  I also performed experiments on intact and powdered core from the two actively creeping fault strands.  Experiments performed on intact wafers of fault core indicate that the creeping faults are weaker than previously observed, \u00b5 = 0.09.  In addition, this weakness is extremely localized, friction increases to \u00b5 > 0.4 over distances less than 1m outside of each fault.  Furthermore, our results suggest that the faults would likely be weak in the upper 5-8 km of the crust, consistent with long-term observations of fault strength.  Moreover, results from rock surrounding the faults show positive rates of frictional healing and velocity-weakening friction behavior, consistent with observed repeating earthquakes on the downdip extension of one fault and also on a nearby fault strand.  I characterized the behavior of the third intersected fault strand through experiments performed on cuttings.  This fault strand exhibited no active creep, and is the location of two repeating earthquake clusters.  Results from these experiments indicate material surrounding the fault is strong, \u00b5 > 0.4, and exhibits complex frictional stability behavior.  Our results indicate that material near this fault is frictionally unstable over short displacements and frictionally stable over larger displacements.           \n\tThe observation of near zero healing rates in SAFOD material prompted the study of how mineralogy controls healing behavior and how the observed healing behavior relates to observations of fault slip style.  To do this, I performed experiments on 9 natural fault samples and 8 synthetic gouge samples.  Experimental procedure ensured that the only variable in this suite of experiments was the mineralogical composition of the samples used.  Experiments show that phyllosilicate-rich gouges exhibit zero, or near zero rates of frictional healing, indicating the presence of these materials would lead to low fault strength and stably sliding behavior.  Quartzo-feldspathic dominated gouges show positive healing rates whereas calcite-rich gouges show the largest magnitudes of frictional healing.  Results for healing behavior and velocity dependence indicate that the majority of fault samples studies would fail under multiple modes of fault slip. \n\tViewed collectively, the results of these experiments have important implications about the behavior of not only the San Andreas Fault in central California but faults worldwide.  The role of fault restrengthening in the seismic cycle has not been studied as thoroughly as the velocity-dependence of fault material.  However, our results show that fault healing can have a significant impact on overall fault strength and the mode of fault slip.  Additionally, these results show that at least a portion of a major, plate boundary fault, the SAF, is weak, and that this weakness is due to the presence of phyllosilicates.  Phyllosilicates have been found in many faults worldwide so the behavior observed in experiments presented here could be applied elsewhere.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7086], "author_name_tesi": "Carpenter, Brett Matthew", "last_name_ssi": "Carpenter", "middle_name_ssi": "Matthew", "first_name_ssi": "Brett", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chris Marone", "Demian Saffer", "Charles James Ammon", "Derek Elsworth", "Andre Niemeijer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chris Marone, Dissertation Advisor", "Demian Saffer, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Andre Niemeijer, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["friction", "fault mechanics", "San Andreas Fault"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Geochemical Characterization of Obsidian Subsources in Highland Guatemala", "id": "25007", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11208", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis geochemically and geographically identifies obsidian subsources in the Valley of Guatemala and the surrounding region.

Several studies indicate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is activated by UVB and may play an important role in skin tumorigenesis. mTOR exists in two functionally and compositionally distinct protein complexes: the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and the rapamycin-resistant mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Several studies indicate that mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling are activated in response to UVB in keratinocyte cell lines and primary keratinocytes. However, the role of mTOR-dependent pathways in normal keratinocyte function and transformation has not been investigated.\nThese studies were designed to test the hypothesis that the two mTOR complexes play distinct roles in keratinocyte proliferation and pro-survival signaling in response to UVB.  To better understand the role of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in response to UVB we utilized the pharmacological inhibitor of mTORC1, rapamycin, and the mTOR kinase inhibitor, Torin2.  We also generated inducible mTOR-deficient (K5-CreERT2;mTORfl/fl) mice that allow epidermal-specific disruption of mTOR following topical treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT). Rapamycin blocked UVB-induced phosphorylation of S6K1 (S6 kinase 1), the downstream target of mTORC1, and significantly reduced UVB-stimulated epidermal proliferation and cell cycle progression, but had no effect on cell death. In contrast, mTOR deletion, which attenuated UVB-induced phosphorylation of both S6K and the mTORC2 target AKTSer473, significantly increased apoptosis both in vivo and in keratinocyte cultures, in addition to reducing hyperproliferation following UVB irradiation. Torin2 also sensitized keratinocytes to UVB-induced apoptosis. The role of mTORC2 in UVB-induced pro-survival signaling was verified in Rictor-/- MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), which lack functional mTORC2 and were more sensitive to UVB-induced apoptosis than controls. Additionally, Torin2 was able to sensitize wild-type but not Rictor-/- MEFs to UVB-induced cell death. These studies show for the first time that mTORC1 and mTORC2 play unique but complementary roles in controlling proliferation and apoptosis in the skin. Our results support a model where UVB-induced activation of mTORC1 mediates hyperproliferation while mTORC2 activates pro-survival signaling. This work provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in UVB-induced skin cell damage leading to skin aging and skin cancer and underscores the importance of both mTOR complexes in mediating UVB-induced signaling in keratinocytes. \n\tPrevious studies utilizing chemical carcinogenesis have shown that inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin attenuates skin tumor formation.  However, the role of mTORC2 in skin tumor development remains largely unexamined. Because our UVB results suggested that inhibition of mTORC2 signaling may prevent the formation of skin tumors through inhibiting cell survival, we utilized an inducible Rictor-deficient mouse model (K14CreERT;Rictorfl/fl) to investigate the role of mTORC2 signaling in tumor formation and maintenance. Rictor ablation within the basal layer of the epidermis significantly reduced tumor incidence and multiplicity in a chemical carcinogenesis model. Additionally, we demonstrated that inducing rictor deletion in pre-existing tumors inhibited further tumor growth and induced tumor regression. These data provide the first demonstration that Rictor expression is necessary for both skin tumor development and maintenance of established tumors. Moreover, our results provide new insight into the pathogenesis of skin cancer and highlight mTORC2 as a possible target for treatment and prevention of cutaneous SCC (squamous cell carcinoma). \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9024], "author_name_tesi": "Carr, Theresa Diane", "last_name_ssi": "Carr", "middle_name_ssi": "Diane", "first_name_ssi": "Theresa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa M Shantz", "Lisa M Shantz", "Scot R Kimball", "Jiyue Zue", "Diane M Thiboutot", "Edward Joseph Gunther"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa M Shantz, Dissertation Advisor", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Chair", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Jiyue Zue, Committee Member", "Diane M Thiboutot, Committee Member", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mTOR", "mTORC1", "mTORC2", "Raptor", "Rictor", "UVB", "skin cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Ethical Becoming: Adult Ethical Development in Christian Congregations", "id": "11668", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1412", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This is a study of adult ethical development in Christian \ncongregations.

This dissertation focuses on how heterogeneity in disease dynamics drives inequities in disease burden, and how management interventions can be developed with an eye to addressing these inequities.\nTo illustrate the role of management in promoting equity in disease burden, I consider a range of heterogeneities in disease processes and consider how they interact with management policy to determine the distribution of risk through a population. Demographic heterogeneity, variation in access to healthcare and vaccination coverage, and differential levels of vulnerability can all lead to subsets of the population bearing a disproportionate share of disease burden. Management interventions which do not take these underlying disparities in disease risk into consideration may reproduce or exacerbate inequity.\nI find that a crucial aspect of promoting equity in disease management policy is the identification of regions and subpopulations at greatest risk. By preferentially allocating public health resources (particularly vaccination) where they are most needed, management can ameliorate preexisting disparities and result in a more equitable distribution of risk. Adopting this approach not only allows for a more efficient use of public health resources (as shown in chapter 2) but is also necessary to ensure continued maintenance of disease elimination, as I find in chapter 4 that gaps in vaccination coverage anywhere are an impediment to disease elimination everywhere.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16832], "author_name_tesi": "Carran, Spencer Alexander", "last_name_ssi": "Carran", "middle_name_ssi": "Alexander", "first_name_ssi": "Spencer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Joseph Ferrari", "Matthew Joseph Ferrari", "Ottar N Bjornstad", "Katriona Shea", "Ephraim Mont Hanks", "Timothy Charles Reluga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Joseph Ferrari, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Joseph Ferrari, Committee Chair", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Member", "Katriona Shea, Committee Member", "Ephraim Mont Hanks, Outside Member", "Timothy Charles Reluga, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Measles", "Public health policy", "epidemiology", "disease management"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE PROT\u00c9G\u00c9S AND \nTHEIR MENTORING RELATIONSHIPS WITH WHITE MALE MENTORS \nIN MAJORITY CULTURE ORGANIZATIONS\n\n\n", "id": "8301", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6408", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nThis study explores cross-cultural career mentoring experiences of African American male prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and their mentoring relationships with White male mentors in majority culture organizations.

The dissertation proposes that despite the overt religious agenda intrinsically conveyed in these hagiographic representations, they can be read also as historical testimonies of resistance and (anti)imperial sentiments that reflect the ontological anxieties and fragmented identities of colonial subjects regarding their ethnic, cultural, and gender diversity. The main literary objects of study comprise carols from the Colonial Musical Archives of Bogot\u00e1's Cathedral, carols by Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez de Eslava, Colombian popular ballads, and a sonnet by Francisco \u00c1lvarez de Velasco y Zorrilla, among other poetic works.

It takes a post-colonial approach, grounded primarily on Homi Bhabha's notions of \"in-between,\" \"double vision,\" and \"hybridity\" to explain the cultural position from which colonial Hispanic American discourses enunciate their world-views, and the differences between such a position and that from which hegemonic discourses of empire are issued. In conclusion, this study shows how hagiographies in colonial Hispanic America do not efface religious and social paradigms from Europe altogether, but incorporate local outlooks and traditions into dominant discourses, destabilizing them, vindicating the authority of \"otherness,\" and reinforcing alternative notions of collective and individual selfhood in the construction of Hispanic American identity.

OLS and spatial models all showed the same sign and significant coefficients for the variables of interest of this study; i.e, air quality and accessibility to employment centers.

These electronic systems are radically different in terms of performance and functionality than conventional silicon-based devices. A key question is whether the metal deposited on flexible films can survive large strains without rupture. Cumbersome macro-fabrication methods have been developed for functional and bendable electronics (e.g., interconnects) encapsulated between layers of polymer films. However, future electronic applications may require electronic flexible devices to be in intimate contact with curved surfaces (e.g., retinal implants) and to be robust enough to withstand large and repeated mechanical deformations.\n\nIn this research, a novel technique for surface integration of metal structures into polymers (SIMSIP) was developed. Surface embedding, as opposed to placing metal on polymers, provides better adherence while leaving the surface accessible for contacts. This was accomplished by first fabricating the micro-scale metal patterns on a quartz or Teflon mother substrate, and then embedding them to a flexible polyimide thin film. The technique was successfully used to embed micro-metal structures of gold (Au), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu) into polyimide films without affecting the functional properties of the either the metals or the polymers. Experimental results confirm the successful surface-embedding of metal structures as narrow as 0.6 \u00b5m wide for different geometries commonly used in circuit design. Although similar approaches exist in literature, the proposed methodology provides a simpler and more reliable way of producing flexible circuits/electronics that is also suitable for high volume manufacturing.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the flexibility of metal interconnects fabricated using the SIMSIP technique, multiple Au electrodes (5 \u00b5m and 2.5 \u00b5m wide) were tested using the X-&#1138; bending methodology. The X-&#1138; bending test captures data on the electrical resistivity of micro Au electrodes fabricated using the proposed SIMSIP technique by bending them at different angles between 0o and 180o up to 50 times.  The data shows that the electrical resistivity of the Au electrodes remains constant (<1% variation) despite the interconnects being repeatedly subjected to extreme tensile and compressive forces during the X-&#1138; bending test.  These results are significant from the perspective of flexible electronics and biotechnology applications since the fabricated thin films exhibit significant electrical stability, reliability and wear resistance.\n\nThese surface-embedded, flexible, and mechanically stable metal interconnects will enable the further development of new electronic products with applications in biotechnology (e.g., e-skin), space exploration (e.g., satellites), and microelectronics (e.g., flat panel displays). The SIMSIP technique is also a suitable process for the nanofabrication of flexible electronic devices in applications that require intimate contact with bendable curved surfaces (e.g., retinal implants).", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2308], "author_name_tesi": "Carrion-Gonzalez, Hector ", "last_name_ssi": "Carrion-Gonzalez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hector", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Sanjay Joshi", "Sanjay B Joshi", "Stephen Joseph Fonash", "Richard Allen Wysk", "Harriet Black Nembhard", "Md Amanul Haque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Sanjay Joshi, Dissertation Advisor", "Sanjay B Joshi, Committee Chair", "Stephen Joseph Fonash, Committee Chair", "Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Member", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Committee Member", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["flexible electronics", "flexible displays", "flexible antennas", "electronic circuits", "interconnects in polymers", "bending tests"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "STAT3-Deficiency in Bone Marrow Hematopoietic Stem Cells results in Dysfunctional Macrophages and Correlates with Crohn's Disease-like Pathogenesis\n", "id": "11611", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3953", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The most well-known subsets of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s Disease (CD).

Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins play an important role in mediating intestinal cytokine signaling and it is unknown if the loss of these proteins initiate severe downstream modifications that consequently result in CD.  \nWhen compensating for a deficiency in STAT3, STAT1 levels increase, which leads to an increase in IFN\u00e3 signaling, which promotes Th1-cell mediated inflammation.  IL10, which is mediated through STAT3 signaling, is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is secreted from activated macrophages.  IL10 inhibits excessive macrophage activation which suppresses the macrophage induced synthesis of TNF\u00e1, and thus is responsible for down-regulating Th1-cell mediated immune responses.  This suggests that STAT3 mediates mucosal immune tolerance during an innate immune response.  \nBreeding a bone marrow (B)-TIE2 promoter driven Cre recombinase gene- targeted mouse with a STAT3 lox-P (F/F) mouse created a conditional (specific to bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells) STAT3 knock-out.  This tissue specific STAT3 deficient mouse is suitable for in vivo studies because it exhibits a spontaneous Crohn\u2019s-like pathogenesis in the small and large intestines, also characterized by an over production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and excessive macrophage infiltrations.  In addition to these morphological changes, one functional change demonstrated a loss of NADPH oxidase activity, which is an important response induced by the innate immune system to kill phagocytosed materials (Welte et al., 2003).  The overall goal of this project was to determine the role of STAT1 and STAT3 signaling in the development of inflammatory bowel disease.  My working hypothesis was that defective innate immunity in Crohn\u2019s disease may correlate with a loss in STAT3 activity.  My specific hypothesis was that STAT3-deficiency in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells results in dysfunctional macrophages and correlates with Crohn\u2019s Disease-like pathogenesis.\n In conclusion, this study determined that STAT3 signaling is required for normal macrophage functions and that abnormal macrophages critical for the pathogenesis of a Crohn\u2019s-like disease in these mice models.  It was demonstrated that the role of STAT3 activity in monocyte development and function has a regulatory function, for differentiating numbers and phagocytic functional ability.   This study also established that the macrophage mediated cytokine synthesis is abnormal and is involved in this Crohn\u2019s-like pathogenesis.  This project uses a spontaneous mouse model of CD that clinically resembles Crohn\u2019s disease in human patients.  These data support the known theory that abnormal innate immunity is essential in Crohn\u2019s disease.  Therefore, these data suggest that STAT3 proteins and macrophages should be targeted in future therapies and clinical trials.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3926], "author_name_tesi": "Carroll, Melissa Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Carroll", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Samuel Shaomin Zhang", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang", "Colin James Barnstable", "Patricia Mc Laughlin", "Lisa S Poritz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Samuel Shaomin Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang, Committee Chair", "Colin James Barnstable, Committee Member", "Patricia Mc Laughlin, Committee Member", "Lisa S Poritz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["macrophages"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Managing Stable Waterways at Bridges in the Mid-Atlantic", "id": "14793snc5178", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14793", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this study, a methodology is developed for creating stable channel transitions at bridge stream intersections.

This ceramic material exhibits a piezoelectric behavior, which means it is capable of transforming mechanical motion into an electrical charge and vice versa.  In order to enhance its use in structural health monitoring systems, PZT, which is typically available in wafer form, is extruded into fibers and used to fabricate active fiber composites (AFCs).  In a typical AFC, PZT fibers that are aligned side by side are embedded into an epoxy matrix.  Since PZT exhibits both the direct and converse piezoelectric effects, AFCs can be used as actuators, sensors, or both.  In order to exploit its piezoelectricity, interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) are applied to the AFC assembly. Due to the special design of the electrodes, the applied electric field is along the fiber\u2019s length, known as the \u20183\u2019 direction.  Poling of the fibers is accomplished using these IDEs which results in a poling direction along their length; therefore, the directions of poling and mechanical actuation are the same.  This directional manipulation is beneficial because the piezoelectric properties directed along the fiber\u2019s length, or \u201833\u2019 properties, are stronger than those through their thickness, or \u201831\u2019 properties.  The piezoelectric response of AFCs is lower than that of bulk PZT due to various factors.  Many models have been developed to predict the electromechanical behaviors of AFCs, and many studies have been performed on the mechanical properties of the material components in an AFC.  However, very little research has been done on determining the piezoelectric properties of individual PZT fibers in an IDE setup without the presence of the epoxy matrix affecting them.  The goal of this thesis is to characterize individual PZT fiber piezoelectric properties in an IDE setup in order to make recommendations for improving the design of AFCs, further optimizing their performance and applications.  \n\nTo accomplish this goal, special attention is focused on how these fibers behave in an IDE setup in order to understand how they would respond electromechanically in an AFC.  As previously mentioned, very little research has been done to characterize the piezoelectric properties of individual PZT fibers ex-situ using an IDE setup.  To the best of our knowledge, only one research study on electromechanical characterization of individual fibers in an IDE setup has been performed.  In this study, done by a former group member, the values obtained through experimental processes and computer-modeling differed.  The difference was believed to be caused mostly by various issues with the experimental processes developed at the time.  Therefore, this research study extends the previous electromechanical characterization process of individual PZT fibers by improving different aspects of the experimental processes used.  The rationale is that improving the experiments will help close the gap between experimentally obtained and model predicted piezoelectric coefficients.  \n\nThe piezoelectric e\u00ac33 and d33 coefficients are the main focus in this study.  Experimental values for the induced stress coefficient (e33) are determined for individual fibers in both a parallel electrode and IDE configuration.  Various aspects of the experiments are altered in order to improve the reported coefficient values.  Additionally, the induced strain coefficient, d33, of individual fibers in an IDE setup is measured.  Due to a lack of published results in the literature, finite element analysis (FEA) models are developed in order to validate the induced strain responses of a fiber in both a parallel electrode and IDE setup.  Experimentally, e33 values are found to be 4.8 C/m2 in a parallel electrode setup and 3.5 C/m2 in an IDE setup.  The IDE coefficient value was about 73% of the parallel electrode value, which was expected from the design characteristics of the IDE setup.  Computer models of a fiber in a parallel electrode setup and IDE setup predict the d33 coefficients to be 256 pm/V and 185 pm/V respectively.  Again, the IDE value is found to be about 72% of the parallel electrode value.  Experimental results report an IDE d33 value of 166 pm/V.  The main conclusion of this study confirms that the PZT fiber properties differ from those of bulk PZT; therefore, incorporating these fiber properties into AFC models will lead to more accurate predictions of AFC electromechanical behavior, driving the optimization of AFCs forward.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14329], "author_name_tesi": "Carroll, Travis John", "last_name_ssi": "Carroll", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Travis", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Zoubeida Ounaies", "Dr. Timothy Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Zoubeida Ounaies, Thesis Advisor", "Dr. Timothy Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PZT", "fiber", "piezoelectric", "interdigitated", "parallel", "electrodes", "electromechanical", "AFC"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Exploration of methods for analyses of resource selection using location-based data", "id": "28912", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12388", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Resource selection functions (RSFs) are commonly used by wildlife researchers to identify resources necessary for the presence or absence of a species in a given area. Resource selection functions can assist decision-makers in protecting necessary resources that can mean the difference between increasing populations or extinction. Hence, it is important that researchers use appropriate RSFs for differing types of data and study designs. The misuse of RSFs is not uncommon, however, and can have negative effects on experiment wise error (i.e., increases in Type 1 error) or give misleading results that lead to poor management plans.\nI identified three commonly used RSFs (logistic regression, negative binomial, and discrete choice), and more closely examined two (logistic regression and negative binomial) via the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) and count data. I used logistic regression to assess the selection of agriculture by mule deer in southwest Colorado, and in particular their selection of sunflowers. I then used negative binomial to identify the location characteristics of Pennsylvania captive cervid facilities to address the potential risk that the spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) poses to wild deer via captive cervid facilities and vice versa.\nResource selection can be used to identify human-related resources that are selected by wildlife and potentially damaged. In southwest Colorado, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are a popular game animal, and are economically and environmentally important to the local area. Identification of specific crops and conditions that may increase crop damage can provide cost savings for farmers and wildlife managers by protecting crops most likely to be damaged by mule deer. I used GPS data and logistic regression to identify selection of specific crops during 8 seasonal/diel periods. Forest, alfalfa and sunflower had the greatest influence on mule deer resource selection. Identification of these specific crops will help wildlife managers implement crop depredation techniques in areas where they will be most beneficial.\n\tResource selection functions can also be used to identify human selection of resources associated with practices such as placement of captive cervid facilities. Captive cervid facilities in Pennsylvania have a large economic value. They also pose a risk to wild cervid populations via the spread of CWD. I used negative binomial regression to assess the resource selection of captive cervid facility owners in Pennsylvania, and to identify areas where wild deer may come in contact with captive deer and increase the potential for CWD transmission. Agriculture had the most support for areas selected by captive facility owners, and several other covariates had varying effects. Resources that were identified as influential factors to selection by captive facility owners were then used to create a predictive surface of areas most as risk for CWD transmission between captive and wild cervids.\n\tResource selection functions are a versatile tool in wildlife management. When used appropriately they can provide results that help wildlife managers make the most effective and efficient management plans for resources and animals. There are many places where a researcher can make inappropriate decisions regarding study design and RSF selection and thus produce poor results. In my thesis I discuss the many considerations a researcher must account for when choosing a RSF, and I also give two examples of appropriate RSF analysis using logistic regression and negative binomial.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11757], "author_name_tesi": "Carrollo, Emily Megan", "last_name_ssi": "Carrollo", "middle_name_ssi": "Megan", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William David Walter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William David Walter, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Captive cervid facility", "chronic wasting disease", "logistic regression", "mule deer", "negative binomial", "resource selection", "sunflower"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Butter, Guns, and Money:  Political Survival, Government Spending, and Interstate Conflict in Autocracies and Democracies", "id": "12583", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3030", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "How does the social composition of who determines a state's leadership affect policy outcomes?  My dissertation argues that variation in the political power and policy preferences of the public and elite over the distribution of resources results in different optimal policies for incumbency-valuing democratic and autocratic leaders.  I first develop a model of political survival in which an incumbent and her winning coalition hold preferences over the distribution of social and military spending and the representation of the public and elite in a leader's winning coalition varies across regime type.  Consistent with the model's predictions, low military and high social spending are more likely to lead to the removal from office of an autocratic incumbent and high military and low social spending are more likely to lead to the removal of a democratic leader.  Based on these results, I develop an extension to the canonical bargaining model of interstate conflict in which mobilization for war is more politically costly for democratic leaders than it is for autocrats.  The model provides a rational explanation for a number of known empirical regularities (e.g., the democratic peace) and the novel prediction that democratic targets should be more selective in reciprocating a conflict than autocratic targets without relying on the tenuous assumption that democrats are more likely to be punished for losing a war.  The final substantive chapter analyzes the displacement effect of interstate war and how it varies across regime type.  Counter to recent research, I find that contemporary governments extract greater tax revenue and allocate more resources to military spending and social spending after an interstate war than they did before involvement in a war.

A ferromanganese refinery, located in Marietta, OH, is currently the largest source of manganese (Mn) emitted into the atmosphere in the U.S.A. Particulate emissions during production are up to 35% manganese oxide (MnO2) by weight and are dominantly in the size range of 0.05 to 0.4 \u00b5m diameter. Particles of that size are both highly mobile and respirable. In order to understand how emissions of Mn and another emitted metal, Cr, has varied over the lifetime of the refinery, a series of soil cores were collected at sites located from 1 to 47 km from the refinery. Concentrations of soil-surface Mn and Cr are enriched 9 and 3 times that of the parent material within 1.2 km of the refinery, respectively. Total mass of Mn added to soils per unit land area integrated over the soil depth was calculated to be 77 mg Mn cm-2 near the refinery. The geographic extent of Mn deposition due to EMI as indicated by a positive integrated Mn mass flux value extends up to 25 km or possibly even beyond 47 km from EMI, depending on assumed composition of the parent material. Mn deposition rates were also simulated with an atmospheric dispersion model (SCIPUFF) using meteorological data from a local weather station and emission rates for the refinery, though the model under-predicted recent deposition. Soil-derived integrated mass flux values for Mn coupled with recent estimates of Mn deposition in Marietta suggest that deposition rates in the past may have been 3 orders of magnitude greater than today\u2019s rates. Such a higher historic emission rate cannot be tested because no quantitative data are available for emissions earlier than 1988. However, higher emissions in the past are likely given the history of metal production. Decreases in deposition rates are also likely due to emission control technology installed as a response to regulations such as the Clean Air Act (1970): the soil measurements document that the Clean Air Act is the likely cause of more than 166x reduction in deposition per metric ton of Mn alloy used. These results document that soil measurements can help reconstruct past metal deposition rates. In fact, when developed on easily-identified parent material, soil profiles may be more useful indicators of the past behavior of metal-emitting sources over decadal time scales than atmospheric dispersion models.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8837], "author_name_tesi": "Carter, Megan Rene", "last_name_ssi": "Carter", "middle_name_ssi": "Rene", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["soil", "manganese", "heavy metal contamination", "atmospheric deposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE MODELING OF A SIX DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM INDUSTRIAL ROBOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF EFFICIENT PATH PLANNING", "id": "9682", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6182", "abstract_tesi": "In order to compete globally, most manufacturers are looking for ways to reduce costs and, at the same time, are facing increasing demands to become environmentally responsible.

This behavior has been observed to be an efficient, low power method to convert electrical energy into mechanical motion at small scales, effectively acting as a microscale motor. Despite the appeal of these advantages,\nCCEP has received relatively little attention in literature. There remain numerous open questions about the charging mechanism, only a handful of successful strategies\nfor CCEP-based applications, and design challenges such as the spontaneous short circuiting of electrodes in multiparticle CCEP systems. One of the most recent developments, ratcheted CCEP, drives particle transport by incorporating a periodic array of insulating ramps on the electrode surface to redirect or ratchet the oscillatory motion of a particle undergoing CCEP downstream. This demonstration of coupling CCEP to additional mechanisms to drive particle or droplet transport has significant value to the fields of microfluidics and active matter. This dissertation presents systems which modify either the particle or encompassing geometry within a CCEP system to successfully design microfluidic devices and study multiparticle systems for active matter applications. Chapters 1 and 2 provide background on CCEP. Chapter 1 provides a brief historic perspective and the overarching motivation for the development of miniaturized devices. Detailed background is provided specifically for microfluidic and active matter systems with a focus on the sub-fields of microfluidic mixing, droplet microfluidics, and synchronization. Chapter 2 focuses on the relevant background for CCEP, covering the mechanism, physics, application strategies in literature, and observations of collective behavior in multiparticle systems. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on implementing ratcheted CCEP for microfluidic applications. In Chapter 3, ratcheted CCEP is used to develop a microfluidic mixer. Dielectric ramps are used to trap a particle in a small region of a channel preventing it from drifting downstream while the oscillations homogenize fluid flowing past. The effect of particle trajectory, particle size, fluid flow rate, and fluid properties are investigated and discussed for optimal mixing. Chapter 4 presents a microfluidic device containing an electrostatic droplet generator coupled with ratcheted geometry.\nAn applied DC electric field generates and transports droplets through the device independent of bulk fluid flow. The effects of experimental parameters, such as system geometry, fluid properties, and voltage are used to validate scaling analyses for droplet diameter, generation frequency, and transport speed, and are ultimately used to find the optimal system performance.\nAppendix D and chapter 5 focus on modifying CCEP for the design and study of active matter systems. In appendix D, CCEP of heterogeneous particles (metallodielectric Janus particles) are shown to undergo directed motion between parallel plates perpendicular to the electric field in the absence of external biasing forces. Both experiment and model confirm that this translational motion is due to the rotation of Janus particles near the electrodes after charge transfer. Notably, when Janus particles oscillate near one another, their trajectories coordinate with one another as the two oscillators couple together.\nChapter 5 expands on interactions between CCEP oscillators discussed in chapter 4 and appendix D by designing systems which physically constrain particle trajectories to parallel tracks. As the particles undergo CCEP they are observed to synchronize with one another and form traveling waves with the wavelength controlled by the system geometry. As traveling waves are commonly used as a propulsion mechanism at the microscale, chapter 5 explores appealing analogies between the coordinated motion of CCEP motors and artificial \"muscle.\" Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes new questions and proposes applications motivated by this dissertation.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14218], "author_name_tesi": "Cartier, Charles Antoine", "last_name_ssi": "Cartier", "middle_name_ssi": "Antoine", "first_name_ssi": "Charles", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kyle Bishop", "Kyle Bishop", "Darrell Velegol", "Scott Milner", "Ayusman Sen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kyle Bishop, Dissertation Advisor", "Kyle Bishop, Committee Chair", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Scott Milner, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrophoresis", "microfluidics", "active matter", "syncrhonization", "droplet generation", "mixing", "electrostatic motor", "collective motion", "droplet microfluidics", "portable", "charge transfer", "colloids", "electrohydrodynamic", "transport"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Photometric Exoplanet Characterization and Multimedia Astronomy Communication", "id": "14143kms648", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14143", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The transit method of detecting exoplanets has dominated the search for distant worlds since the success of the Kepler space telescope and will continue to lead the field after the launch of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite in 2018. But detections are just the beginning. Transit light curves can only reveal a limited amount of information about a planet, and that information is almost entirely dependent on the properties of the host star or stars. This dissertation discusses follow-up techniques to more precisely characterize transiting planets using photometric observations.\n\nA high-resolution follow-up imaging program using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) searched for previously unknown stars nearby the hosts of small and cool Kepler exoplanets and observed a higher-than-expected occurrence rate of stellar multiplicity. The rate of previously unknown stellar multiples has strong implications for the size and habitability of the orbiting planets. Three systems with newly discovered stellar multiplicity, Kepler-296 (2 stars, 5 planets), KOI-2626 (3 stars, 1 planet), and KOI-3049 (2 stars, 1 planet), were characterized in more detail. In the cases of Kepler-296 and KOI-2626, some of the planets lost their previous habitable zone status because of host star ambiguity.\n\nNext, the ultra-short period, ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-103b was used as a case study to test for the presence of a stratospheric temperature inversion through dayside emission spectroscopy using HST. WASP-103b\u2019s near-infrared emission spectrum is consistent with an isothermal or thermally-inverted atmosphere and shows no significant broadband water absorption feature. Detection of an anomalously strong \u201csuper-Rayleigh\u201d slope in its optical transmission spectrum prompted follow-up transmission spectroscopy of WASP-103b\u2019s atmosphere using the MINiature Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA), which tentatively verified the unexplained \u201csuper-Rayleigh\u201d spectral slope.\n\nThe final follow-up technique for transiting planets presented in this work quantifies the information contained in a sequence of transit depths using a normalized information content metric. The normalized information content metric can distinguish between naturally occurring, regular transits of real exoplanets detected via Kepler (low information content) and simulated artificial beacons whose depth and timing vary in a prime number sequence (high information content).

This large production volume has resulted in high energy consumption and emissions (e.g., CO2) harmful to the environment. In addition, the aging infrastructure in developed countries coupled with shrinking financial resources for repair and renewal of infrastructure has resulted in much greater need to improve the durability and extend the service life of concrete structures. A growing incentive to develop durable, highly recycled, energy efficient and environmentally friendly concrete materials has initiated research on alkali-activated concretes. \n\nAlkali-activated slag (AAS) utilizes blast furnace slag, an industrial byproduct of steel manufacturing, as a full (100%) replacement of Portland cement in concrete. AAS concrete has a low embodied energy, low CO2 footprint, and equivalent or better strengths in comparison with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete. AAS also has better durability against fire, chloride-induced corrosion, and chemical (e.g., acid, sulfate) attack. On the other hand, one of the most significant conundrums impeding the implementation of AAS is their volumetric instability. Specifically, AAS concretes are prone to significant shrinkage as a result of drying, carbonation, and self-desiccation and have shown a high risk of cracking.\n\nThe main objective of this research is focused on characterizing and understanding shrinkage deformations of AAS. It provides an unprecedented detailed study of the development of several AAS mortar mixtures and characterizes their susceptibility to the different types of shrinkage (drying, carbonation, and autogenous).\n \nIt was found that AAS mixtures, with comparable strength to OPC, show a higher autogenous and drying shrinkage. A lower elastic stiffness, higher degree of saturation, and potentially higher chemical shrinkage contribute to the high autogenous shrinkage of AAS. A lower elastic stiffness of mixtures activated solely by NaOH leads to a larger drying shrinkage. At each relative humidity, AAS mixtures lose more mass and have larger drying shrinkage deformations than OPC mixtures, regardless of the drying rate. However, the ultimate drying shrinkage values of AAS are dependent on the drying rate as these materials shrink more when the relative humidity is decreased gradually instead of rapidly. The carbonation of AAS materials increases their drying shrinkage deformations. At high relative humidities (70% RH), creep plays a significant role in the drying shrinkage of AAS. The degree of saturation of AAS mixtures upon drying is lower than that of OPC and does not contribute to high drying shrinkage strains. Finally, after adjusting for the degree of hydration, the average chemical shrinkage of AAS paste is determined as 0.253 ml/gslag. This is 3.95 times larger than the chemical shrinkage of Portland cement, and contributes directly to the large autogenous shrinkage of AAS materials. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9476], "author_name_tesi": "Cartwright, Christopher Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Cartwright", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aleksandra Z Radlinska", "Farshad Rajabipour", "Dr Maria Lopez De Murphy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aleksandra Z Radlinska, Thesis Advisor", "Farshad Rajabipour, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Maria Lopez De Murphy, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["drying shrinkage", "autogenous shrinkage", "chemical shrinkage", "slag", "cement", "mortar"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE IMPACT OF ADOLESCENT SOCIAL EXPERIENCES ON ADULT ADRENOCORTICAL ACTIVITY, AFFECT-RELATED BEHAVIOR, AND NICOTINE RESPONSES ", "id": "14305mjc5038", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14305", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A variety of stress-related psychopathologies including affective disorders such as anxiety, depression, and nicotine use, emerge during adolescence. Development of comorbid affective disorders and nicotine use has been attributed to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) dysregulation associated with chronic stress during adolescent development. However, few studies have simultaneously investigated adolescent stress effects on affective behavior, HPA activity, and nicotine responses in animal models. Rodent models of chronic social stress are ethologically relevant models that may provide valuable insight into mechanisms that underlie adolescent affective disorders and nicotine use comorbidity. However, the results of these studies are inconsistent as they are highly dependent on individual differences in stress susceptibility. \n\nIn the current dissertation, I have shown that baseline individual differences in exploratory behavior (i.e. temperament) in outbred rats modulates the impact of adolescent social experience on adult HPA activity (Chapter 2). These findings suggest that temperament is one factor that contributes to inconsistent findings in adolescent stress literature. Additional sources of variability in the literature include genetic variation among outbred rodents and sex differences in stress-susceptibility. For the next study (Chapter 3), I developed a novel adolescent social stress protocol, referred to as chronic variable social stress (CVSS), to control for these potential sources of variability by exposing inbred male and female mice to multiple temperament- and sex-specific stressors. CVSS included repeated cycles of social isolation and housing with novel social partners. We found that adolescent CVSS increased adult anxiety/depression-related behavior and blunted HPA activity. In the last study (Chapter 4), I replicated and extended these previous findings by simultaneously investigating the impact of adolescent CVSS on anxiety/depression-related behavior, HPA activity, and nicotine responses. I found that male inbred (BALB/cJ) mice exposed to adolescent CVSS exhibited reduced exploratory behavior and altered behavioral and physiological responses to nicotine. However, there was little relationship between anxiety/depression-related behavior and nicotine responses within individuals. \n\nThe studies presented herein may help clarify the factors that contribute to inconsistent findings across rodent adolescent social stress models. Furthermore, identification of the factors that promote maladaptive health trajectories (i.e., development of affective disorders and nicotine use) during adolescence can inform future studies on the biological and environmental determinants of adolescent development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14760], "author_name_tesi": "Caruso, Michael J", "last_name_ssi": "Caruso", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sonia A.

The paper extends the literature\non the application of econometrics to criminal behavior by\ntreating the process of recidivism as a competing risks model\nwhere dependence arises from unobserved heterogeneity.  The\neffects of regressors are estimated in a model that considers the\nnon-monotonic hazards feature of criminal recidivism data sets. An\naccelerated time model is compared to the traditional Cox\nproportional model. The former appears to perform better, and is\nshown to capture some features of recidivism behavior reasonably\nwell. Chapter two evaluates the effect  of a reemployment program for\nex-convicts on their recidivism behavior. The econometric model\nhas to deal with the following institutional aspects of the\nprogram. First, upon release, each ex-inmate looks for a job and\nthis duration is represented by T_{s}. Second, at the same\nrelease-time the ex-criminal could commit a crime and the time of\nrecidivism is represented by T_{c}. Third, the difference\nbetween controls and treatments samples only occurs conditional on\nfinding a job. Hence, the random search duration, T_{s},\nrepresents the timing of receiving the treatment. Finally, the\navailable duration data is grouped.

The EMCH 213 D gives the student an opportunity to better comprehend design by its increased focus and the semester long project.

Using the principles of simplified design this thesis set out to analyze an actual structure where the design analysis presents challenges.  The structure that is chosen is an aircraft fuselage with many stiffeners attached to it.  This is difficult to analyze due to the complicated geometry and singularities that arise.  The method our study undertook was to analyze the stress distribution at the interface, by using a sample representative substructure of an aircraft skin with a perfect adhesively bonded \u2018T\u2019 stiffener.\nFinite element analysis was used which allowed for a variety of representative loading conditions that the aircraft fuselage may be subjected to.  The study on the interface analysis consisted studying the effect that the stiffener material and geometry has on the stress distribution at the interface.  The skin was selected as 2014-T6 aluminum and the stiffener was either the 2014-T6, A36 structural steel or a unidirectional graphite fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP).  The stiffener geometry was changed by tapering the stiffener flanges by either a 1:1 or 1:4 ratio of thickness to length.\nResults showed the effect material discontinuity has on the stress distribution within the skin and stiffener.  Singularities often occurred at the edges of the interface and the skin stress of had higher magnitudes than the stiffener stress.  The GFRP stiffener provided the lowest stresses because of the increased stiffness in the fiber direction. The 1:1 taper did nothing to lower the edge singularities as the change in geometry was still too sharp.  The 1:4 taper did effectively lower the singularities in both the skin and stiffener and allowed for the singularities to be distributed along the contact interface which results in a more uniform stress distribution.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3144], "author_name_tesi": "Carver, Jamal Anthony", "last_name_ssi": "Carver", "middle_name_ssi": "Anthony", "first_name_ssi": "Jamal", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["skin-stiffener", "stress distribution"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Understanding Subtropical Anvil Cirrus: A Coupled Modeling Study\n", "id": "9347", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5372", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research investigates the sensitivity of anvil layer cirrus's\ncharacteristics to its mesoscale environment.

Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation of dynamic, full-scale, three-dimensional bodies in waves is very challenging and computationally expensive, and empirical seakeeping models are often inaccurate under certain conditions. In naval hydrodynamics, there is a need for robust and fast dynamic-meshing methods appropriate for analyzing maneuvering and seakeeping of ships. CFD methods need to be developed to validate viscous roll-damping models, since the ones used in seakeeping codes have been strictly empirical in the past. \n\nA validation study was performed to set the frame-work for understanding viscous dominated flows. These simulations included basic steady and unsteady boundary layer flows for a flat plate and ship-hull geometries. It is critical to prove that the flow solvers are capable of resolving the physics of oscillating flows, boundary layers, and phase lags.  The Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model was used for these turbulent flow computations. \n\nFour types of dynamic-meshing techniques were selected to study. Dynamic-overset meshing will be compared to three other techniques: dynamic remeshing via solution of a Laplace equation; dynamic remeshing using radial-basis functions (RBF); and mesh motion and dynamic remeshing using a generalized grid interface (GGI). An analysis of the four types of dynamic-meshing techniques was done by quantifying the  accuracy, robustness, stability, and speed of each one. While dynamic remeshing via solution of a Laplace equation was robust and GGI was the fastest, overset meshing was found to be the most stable and the most general technique for complex geometries and motions. RBF proved to be too computationally expensive and unrealistic for three-dimensional problems.  These methods will be validated with recent experimental data that has been collected at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) for a two-dimensional, tumblehome section. Simulation results focus on prescribed roll motion in unsteady, two phase flow. This thesis was completed using OpenFOAM and the foamedOver library, the latter of which is a bridging tool that links SUGGAR and DiRTlib to OpenFOAM for overset meshing. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2056], "author_name_tesi": "Casadei, Gina Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Casadei", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Gina", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Eric Paterson", "Dr Eric Paterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Eric Paterson, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Eric Paterson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multiphase", "Dynamic-Meshing Techniques", "CFD", "Turbulence Modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Making Trouble: Profiles of Resistance by Minoritized Counselor Educators", "id": "13843jfc207", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13843", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Faculty diversification continues to be an issue across academia.

The continued homogeneity among faculty at research-intensive predominantly white institutions (PWIs) is preserved by systemic inequalities and structural practices that generate barriers to success for minoritized faculty; most poignantly, institutional forms of social and cultural oppression. Counselor education is not beyond the reach of this reality, with existing literature giving voice to the oppression and marginalization experienced by minoritized counselor educators in counseling departments. While research in both higher education and counselor education describes the coping and survival strategies minoritized faculty utilize to survive the tenure-track, achieve tenure, and succeed in academia, little knowledge exists surrounding the change-making strategies these faculty engage in.\n\nMore than just survival and coping, minoritized faculty also balance resistance to oppressive organizational cultures and pressures to adhere to a marginalizing status quo. Acts of resistance elucidate and challenge structural and interactional forms of oppression that limit the success of minoritized faculty and situate them at the margins of academia. More and more, resistance emerges as a common experience and practice among minoritized faculty, but understanding the role and function of resistance in the lives of minoritized faculty, including minoritized counselor educators, remains unclear.

One part of effective instruction consistently identified in the literature is prompting.  The significance of prompting was also noted by Rosenshine (1995) who recommended that teachers needed to spend more time on this part of direct instruction for students to make academic gains.  While it is difficult to ensure that effective teaching practices such as prompting will be used in the classroom, one solution may be to place an emphasis on effective instruction during the student teaching practicum.   Student teaching experiences have long been considered an important component of teacher education programs (Sudzina & Knowles, 1993).   One promising technique which can be used in student teaching is self-evaluation, a strategy in which the individual observes his/her behavior and rates it according to a predetermined scale (Hughes, Ruhl & Misra, 1989).   For this study, a multiple baseline design across participants design was used to evaluate the effects of a self-evaluation checklist on the quality of student teachers\u2019 scripted lesson plans.  The checklist contained a rubric comprised of nine areas which were summarized from the effective teaching research on guided practice/prompting.

Student teachers rated themselves on a scale of 1-4 for each part of the scripted prompt step.

By considering a wide-range of sources like the Theodosian Code, the Res Getae of Ammianus and epigraphic material, I demonstrate that the centrality of the dioceses does not hinge on their perceived structural stability. Rather, I demonstrate that most of the important state functions, such as, for instance, the collection and disbursement of taxes, the provision of supplies for the armies and record keeping were performed largely at by diocesean administrators (first by the vicarii only but to which were eventually added other officers like the agentes in rebus and the praetorian prefects). Second, the vicarii, as administrators of the dioceses, were in fact a central officer for the provincial administration with wide-ranging administrative roles, until a series of reforms beginning in 354 C.E. and ending in 395 C.E. made the office redundant. The prevailing idea in previous scholarship was that the vicarii were, from their inception, a redundant office. I demonstrate that this redundancy of vicarial jurisdiction did not exist from the creation of the vicaritate, but that it occurred through an increasing number of reforms that sought to place important administrative procedures in the hands of the imperial court.

Presently, the unprecedented production of natural gas from deep, low-permeability, sedimentary rock formations within the continental United States (particularly the northeast) has brought heightened scrutiny to oil and gas well stimulation (i.e., through the hydraulic fracturing process).  Of particular environmental concern is the collection, transportation, storage and ultimate fate of the hypersaline wastewaters from natural gas wells.   \nNatural gas production wells that have been stimulated by hydraulic fracturing release nearly half of the three to five million gallons of fluid used in the process.  This mildly saline water is called flowback.  Although flowback lasts for only a few weeks, for the remainder of its lifetime the well will produce a more saline wastewater called produced brine.  The chemical composition of these wastewaters is complicated, as they contain significant concentrations of organic molecules and radioactive isotopes.  Because the solids content can be over 20% the total solution mass, traditional wet chemistry and conventional desalination techniques (e.g., reverse osmosis, thermal distillation, etc.) are ineffective for remediating these wastewaters.  This has led to deep well reinjection to become the sole disposal option for these wastewaters. \nIn this thesis, an unconventional remediation technique for these hypersaline brines is investigated.  Since the main contaminant in flowback and produced brines is a high concentration of dissolved solids, the author employed surrogate hypersaline brines that were artificially created and experimentally remediated by using a proprietary super-charged pulsed jet combustor technology.  \nIn this research, the super-charged pulsed jet combustor was investigated as a potential technology for separating the salt from water, in solutions near saturation (with respect to sodium chloride).  Pulsating combustors are known for their exceptional fuel efficiency, as well as their ability to produce powerfully turbulent exhaust fields, which enhance convective drying rates.  In this thesis, the experimental, pilot-scale system used was capable of processing brines with total dissolved solids concentrations above 200,000 mg/L \u2013 meeting a current technology gap in the field of flowback and produced brine treatment.  It demonstrated the ability to evaporate nearly one-third the solvent mass of a nearly 0.5 gallons per minute (114 liters per hour) hypersaline brine flow, while retaining almost all the mass of processed solids within a five foot (1.52 meter) diameter round basin located beneath the tailpipe end of the combustor.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10641], "author_name_tesi": "Cash, Colin Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Cash", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Colin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon", "Robert Carl Voigt", "William D Burgos"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Carl Voigt, Thesis Advisor", "William D Burgos, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydraulic fracturing", "brine", "pulse combustor", "pulse jet", "natural gas"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Extensions to the Time Lag Models for Practical Application to Rocket Engine Stability Design\n", "id": "10688", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4154", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The combustion instability problem in liquid-propellant rocket engines (LREs) has remained a tremendous challenge since their discovery in the 1930s.  Improvements are usually made in solving the combustion instability problem primarily using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and also by testing demonstrator engines.  Another approach is to use analytical models.  Analytical models can be used such that design, redesign, or improvement of an engine system is feasible in a relatively short period of time.   Improvements to the analytical models can greatly aid in design efforts.\n     A thorough literature review is first conducted on liquid-propellant rocket engine (LRE) throttling. Throttling is usually studied in terms of vehicle descent or ballistic missile control however there are many other cases where throttling is important.  It was found that combustion instabilities are one of a few major issues that occur during deep throttling (other major issues are heat transfer concerns, performance loss, and pump dynamics).    In the past and again recently, gas injected into liquid propellants has shown to be a viable solution to throttle engines and to eliminate some forms of combustion instability.  This review uncovered a clever solution that was used to eliminate a chug instability in the Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine (CECE), a modified RL10 engine.\n     A separate review was also conducted on classic time lag combustion instability models.  Several new stability models are developed by incorporating important features to the classic and contemporary models, which are commonly used in the aerospace rocket industry.  The first two models are extensions of the original Crocco and Cheng concentrated combustion model with feed system contributions.  A third new model is an extension to the Wenzel and Szuch double-time lag model also with feed system contributions.  \n     The first new model incorporates the appropriate injector acoustic boundary condition which is neglected in contemporary models.  This new feature shows that the injector boundary can play a significant role for combustion stability, especially for gaseous injection systems or a system with an injector orifice on the order of the size of the chamber.  The second new model additionally accounts for resistive effects.  Advanced signal analysis techniques are used to extract frequency-dependent damping from a gas generator component data set.  The damping values are then used in the new stability model to more accurately represent the chamber response of the component.  The results show a more realistic representation of stability margin by incorporating the appropriate damping effects into the chamber response from data.  The original Crocco model, a contemporary model, and the two new models are all compared and contrasted to a marginally stable test case showing their applicability.  The model that incorporates resistive aspects shows the best comparison to the test data.  Parametrics are also examined to show the influence of the new features and their applicability.  The new features allow a more accurate representation of stability margin to be obtained.\n     The third new model is an extension to the Wenzel and Szuch double-time lag chug model.  The feed system chug model is extended to account for generic propellant flow rates.  This model is also extended to incorporate aspects due to oxygen boiling and helium injection in the feed system.  The solutions to the classic models, for the single-time lag and the double-time lag models, are often plotted on a practical engine operating map, however the models have presented some difficulties for numerical algorithms for several reasons.  Closed-form solutions for use on these practical operating maps are formulated and developed.  These models are incorporated in a graphical user interface tool and the new model is compared to an extensive data set.  It correctly predicts the stability behavior at various operating conditions incorporating the influence of injected helium and boiling oxygen in the feed system.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4132], "author_name_tesi": "Casiano, Matthew Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Casiano", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vigor Yang", "Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Vigor Yang", "Richard A Yetter", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Tomas E Nesman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vigor Yang, Dissertation Advisor", "Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Chair", "Vigor Yang, Committee Chair", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "Tomas E Nesman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["concentrated combustion", "helium injection", "time lag models", "combustion stability", "throttling", "damping"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The effect of specific ions on the permselectivity of ion exchange membranes ", "id": "707957642", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12709", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ion exchange membranes are a class of selective barriers that prevent the passage of some aqueous ions (co-ions), while allowing other ions (counter-ions) to pass unimpeded.

Counter-ion binding affinity, charge density and dilute solution mobility were identified as factors influencing membrane permselectivity. Specifically, counter-ions with higher binding affinities to the fixed charge group of the polymer showed lower permselectivities due to counter-ion condensation.

Little research, however, has been conducted on how to best design and implement such training to enhance innovation among employees. With the Osborn-Parnes Creative Problem Solving (CPS) program as the conceptual framework, three online training programs were developed, implemented, and evaluated for their relative effectiveness for enhancing innovative performance. Innovative performance was conceptualized as having two dimensions, creativity and implementation planning, each consisting of two facets (quality and originality and penetration and forecasting, respectively). It was hypothesized that a full CPS training program would have the greatest impact on innovative performance, both at the dimension and facet levels, and that creative personal identity and intrinsic motivation would exhibit moderating, interactive influences. Three hundred and eighty-six participants completed one of three different training regimens (full CPS, ideational skills training only, or control training). An additional experimental condition involving training environment was also tested, creating a repeated measures, 3 X 2 factorial study design whereby training type and training environment functioned as between-subjects factors and pre and post-training innovative performance functioned as the within-subjects dependent variable. Hypotheses were partially supported and two consistent findings emerged: 1) a distinct positive trend for the IDS only condition indicating that online IDS only training may be more effective for enhancing innovative performance, as compared to full CPS or control training, and 2) a strong environment effect indicating that the provision of online creative problem solving training in a more formal, controlled setting results in higher overall innovative performance than does the identical training in a non-lab setting.

The microphase separated domains in these polymers act as physical crosslinks and are expected to strongly influence molecular dynamics.  Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is utilized to quantify microphase separation characteristics and broadband dielectric relaxation spectroscopy reveals the sensitivity of polymer dynamics to the presence of microphase segregation in the polymers studied.  A model ionomer, sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) is chosen to probe the effect of ionic aggregation.   The microphase separation and dynamics in polyurethanes and polyureas, containing strongly hydrogen bonded hard domains, are also examined.\nThe role of ion associations on aggregate morphology and polymer dynamics of SPS is investigated via the systematic variation of sulfonation level, neutralization, and ion type.  Evidence of acid group aggregation was found at 3.5, 6.7 and 9.5 mol% sulfonation. Upon neutralization, spherical aggregates ~2 nm in diameter are revealed from SAXS and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Aggregate size is found to be independent of degree of sulfonation and neutralization level, however, aggregate composition becomes increasingly ionic with increasing neutralization.  The polymer segmental relaxation process is highly sensitive to changes in ion content, neutralization and ion type.  The relaxation time of this process slows with increasing ion content as the number density of ionic aggregates increases, similar to the effect of chemical crosslinking.  The breadth of this process is sensitive to the interaction strength of the neutralizing ion type. For SPS neutralized with Zn2+, two distinct segmental relaxations are observed, a matrix segmental relaxation and a slow segmental process, the strength of which correlates with an increase in volume fraction of the region of restricted mobility.  In addition to polymer dynamics, a process proposed to arise from Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) interfacial polarization is observed in select ionomers and the relaxation time of this process in SPS neutralized with Zn is found to exhibit good agreement with a simple composite model. \nIn addition to the sulfonate polystyrene ionomers, polyurethanes and polyureas based on poly(tetramethylene oxide) soft segments and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate hard segments are investigated.  In polyurethanes, increasing hard segment content is found to slow down, increase the breadth, and decrease the strength of the soft phase segmental dynamics, analogous to the effect of crystalline lamellae.  The strength of the MWS process observed decreases with temperature and correlates directly with an order-to-disorder transition, characterized in a previous publication.  The role of soft segment molecular weight on morphology and dynamics is investigated in polyureas.  The hard domains microphase separate into ribbon like domains.  Phase separation is rather incomplete and its extent decreases with decreasing soft segment molecular weight.  Two distinct soft phase segmental relaxations are observed in these polyureas and are proposed to arise from the soft segment rich phase and segmental motion in the slower restricted mixed phase, similar to the slow segmental process observed in SPS ionomers neutralized with Zn.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7126], "author_name_tesi": "Castagna, Alicia Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Castagna", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Alicia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Ralph H Colby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt, Dissertation Advisor", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer", "ionomer", "Small-Angle X-ray Scattering", "Dielectric Relaxation Spectroscopy", "polyurea", "polyurethane", "molecular relaxation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "MAIZE DEFENSE RESPONSES AND STRATEGIES AGAINST ABOVEGROUND AND BELOWGROUND INSECTS", "id": "13757lic5157", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13757", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation had three main projects. In the first project we studied insect resistance traits against the root herbivore, western corn rootworm (WCR, Diabrotica virgifera) in the insect resistant maize genotype, Mp708 and its susceptible parent, Tx601 using biomechanical, root anatomy, molecular and biochemical analyses. These two maize genotypes differ in susceptibility to fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda), WCR, and corn leaf aphid (CLA, Rhopalosiphum maidis). The data suggested that Mp708 is more resistant to WCR than Tx601 due to strong nodal roots, constant root growth under infestation, constitutive and induced expression of ribosomal protein 2 (rip2), terpene synthase 23 (tps23) and maize insect resistant cysteine protease-1 (mir1), as well high constitutive and inducible levels of MIR1-CP protein, jasmonic acid (JA) and caryophyllene. We concluded that Mp708 showed resistance and antibiosis against WCR and could be used as a model to explore the wide variety of mechanisms and traits involved in plant defense responses.\nIn the second project we explored the use of innovative proteomic and network analyses to understand the global defenses deployed by maize plants infested with the root-feeder, WCR. Using the relatively new technique that employs 10-plex tandem mass spectrometry tags (TMT), we measured protein abundance changes in roots and leaves in response to these pest because metabolic changes in response to herbivory include a wide variety of mechanisms that enable the plant to survive. TMT data were analyzed by using a protein co-abundance and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We detected 4878 proteins of which 863 had significant changes under WCR infestation. Proteins with higher abundance during WCR infestation were involved in the JA pathway and included lipoxygenase 5 (lox5), allene oxidase synthase 1 (aos1), and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 2 (opr2). Other high abundance proteins during infestations were part of biosynthesis and signaling pathways for proteases of serine/cysteine type, abscisic acid, reactive oxygen species, and ethylene (ET). We validated changes in these pathways by analyzing the expression of key genes in each, total protease activity, cysteine and serine-type protease inhibition, JA and ET production. Our data showed promising differences between tissue-specific defense responses in leaves and roots of plants infested by WCR. Also, we suggested a dual insect and microbial plant stress response and postulated that roots infested with WCR are under constant microbial pressure due to the interactions in rhizosphere.\nIn the third project we studied Mp708 tissue-specific responses to FAW by using the same proteomics and analysis techniques used for the second project. In addition we merged our proteomics network data with QTL known regions of resistance in Mp708 against FAW. We detected 4675 proteins of which 794 had significant changes under FAW infestation. Our analyses suggested an increase in the JA biosynthesis, REDOX changes in the glutathione and ascorbate pathways, and increase in ABA and ET biosynthesis and signaling. Infested leaf tissues showed high abundance and enrichment of proteinase inhibitors, cysteine proteases and peroxidases, these are well known plant defense proteins. Validations of total peroxidase activity showed an early activity spike in leaves of Mp708 and no change in the roots during FAW infestation , suggesting an early ROS signaling event that might not involve peroxide or an increase in quinone production mediated by peroxidases. Gene expression and phytohormone analyses showed that JA biosynthesis was activated in leaves and ET production increased only in roots, furthermore, JA and ET appears to control local MIR1-CP and RIP2 accumulation, and ET could be a key regulator of MIR1-CP systemic accumulation. These findings open up new routes in the hormonal control of local and systemic defense signaling that could be similar for other defense proteins and secondary compounds. Using the protein-correlation network with the known QTL regions, we found some proteins that might be part of the defense responses and tolerance against FAW that are involved in plant defenses, development and growth. Growth analyses determined that the insect susceptible maize genotype, Tx601, grew less in height and total root length during FAW infestation. We concluded that Mp708 defense mechanisms could involve lower trade-offs between plant growth and defense responses. \nWe have established an analysis pipeline for proteomics data that includes network biology approaches that can be used with different types of \u201comics\u201d data from a wide variety of organisms to detect tissue-specific defense responses.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13932, 13933, 13934, 13935, 13936, 13937, 13938, 13939, 13940, 13941, 13942, 13943, 13944], "author_name_tesi": "Castano-Duque, Lina M", "last_name_ssi": "Castano-Duque", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Lina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dawn S.

Greater than 1/3 of this human-derived nitrogen reaches surface and ground waters, creating significant environmental problems such as the hypoxic zones in the Chesapeake Bay and Gulf of Mexico and the pollution of drinking waters.  However, human-derived mineral nitrogen is necessary for the maintenance of human health; synthetic ammonia-based fertilizers account for approximately 40% of global human protein consumption.  \nThe vast majority of human-derived mineral nitrogen travels through the soil prior to reaching surface and ground waters.  Within the soil, mineral nitrogen is transformed and transported by a variety of water-dependent mechanisms.

I used a variety of approaches including meta-analysis, laboratory experimentation and field observation.  \nAt the global scale, I demonstrate that within-site spatial variation in soil solution nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen and saturated hydraulic conductivity are similarly related to soil clay content.  Clay content explained greater than 1/3 of within-site spatial variation in nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen and saturated hydraulic conductivity.  These relationships suggest that soil hydrology, as mediated by clay content, may be a significant mechanism affecting variation in soil solution nitrogen.  Moreover, these data show that the heterogeneity of an important resource, soil solution N, is a predictable function of clay content.     \nAcross an artificially drained agroecosystem landscape I examined biogeochemical and hydrological controls on the magnitude and timing of nitrous oxide flux from the soil.  I collected soil columns from three landscape positions that vary in hydrological and biogeochemical properties.  Across all landscape positions, there was a positive linear relationship between total soil nitrogen and the log of cumulative nitrous oxide emissions (r2 = 0.47; p = 0.0132).  Within individual soil columns, nitrous oxide flux was a Gaussian function of water filled pore space and matric potential during drainage.  These data demonstrate that biogeochemical properties control the absolute magnitude of nitrous oxide flux while hydrological properties control the timing of nitrous oxide flux.  The Guassian relationship between nitrous oxide flux and matric potential reveal that water filled pore size is the hydrological property controlling the relative magnitude of soil nitrous oxide flux across all soils; using these data I identified that maximum nitrous oxide flux occurs when pores >40 &#956;m have drained.        \nWithin a northeastern United States deciduous forest, I monitored soil solution ammonium and nitrate concentrations as well as volumetric soil water content across two environmental gradients: a 30 meter catenary hillslope and 300 meter silt-to-sand soil texture gradient.  Across the gradients, soil solution nitrate and ammonium increased downslope and with sand content.  Immobilization of nitrate and ammonium into insoluble organic nitrogen compounds could not explain this pattern.  In contrast, nitrogen mineralization could help to explain this pattern; in situ net ammonification rates were positively correlated with sand content.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4134], "author_name_tesi": "Castellano, Michael  J.", "last_name_ssi": "Castellano", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Michael ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Hangsheng Lin", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer", "Gary Walter Petersen", "John Matthew Schmidt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye, Dissertation Advisor", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Chair", "Hangsheng Lin, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer, Committee Member", "Gary Walter Petersen, Committee Member", "John Matthew Schmidt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrology", "greenhouse gas", "nitrate"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Stipends and schooling: A mixed-methods approach to evaluating Costa Rica's conditional cash transfer education program, Avancemos", "id": "27356", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11985", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Globally, there are over 50 million school-aged children who are not enrolled in school.

Current scientific efforts, both in industry and academia, are focused on developing rational approaches to screen different drug candidates and predict their stability under different conditions. Moreover, aggregation is promoted in highly concentrated protein solutions, which are typically required for subcutaneous injection. In order to gain further understanding about the mechanisms that lead to aggregation, an approach that combined rheology, neutron scattering, and molecular simulations was undertaken. \nTwo model systems were studied in this work: Bovine Serum Albumin in surfactant-free Phosphate Buffered Saline at pH = 7.4 at concentrations from 11 mg/mL up to ~519 mg/mL, and a monoclonal antibody in 20 mM Histidine/Histidine Hydrochloride at pH = 6.0 with 60 mg/mL trehalose and 0.2 mg/mL polysorbate-80 at concentrations from 53 mg/mL up to ~220 mg/mL. The antibody used here has three mutations in the CH2 domain, which result in lower stability upon incubation at 40 C with respect to the wild-type protein, based on size-exclusion chromatography assays. This temperature is below 49 C, where unfolding of the least stable, CH2 domain occurs. \nThis dissertation focuses on identifying the role of aggregation on the viscosity of protein solutions. The protein solutions of this work show an increase in the low shear viscosity in the absence of surfactants, because proteins adsorb at the air/water interface forming a viscoelastic film that affects the measured rheology. Stable surfactant-laden protein solutions behave as simple Newtonian fluids. However, the surfactant-laden antibody solution also shows an increase in the low shear viscosity from bulk aggregation, after prolonged incubation at 40 C.\nSmall-angle neutron scattering experiments were used to characterize the antibody aggregates responsible for this non-Newtonian response. From the neutron scattering data, a weak barrier leading to reversible aggregation is identified. Therefore, proteins aggregate weakly after colliding hydrodynamically, unless they find a favorable contact with high binding energy. Two types of antibody aggregates were identified: oligomers with average radius of gyration of ~10 nm, and fractal aggregates larger than \n~ 0.1 \u03bcm formed by a reaction-limited aggregation process. A characteristic upturn in the scattered intensity at low wavevector and a low shear viscosity increase are observed in aggregated protein solutions. These features are removed by filtering with a 0.2 \u03bcm filter, which also eliminates the submicron fractal aggregates. Biophysical characterization supports the conclusions from the rheology and neutron scattering experiments. \nFinally, molecular dynamics simulations were used to understand the effects of disulfide bonds on the conformational stability of serum albumin. Changes in disulfide bonds in the native structure could lead to partial unfolding, and the formation of aggregates through inter-molecular disulfide bonds. Therefore, it is important to understand the role of each disulfide bond on the structure and dynamics of the protein. After removing disulfide bonds, changes occur in the dynamic correlations between different residues, the secondary and tertiary structure of albumin. However, not all disulfide bonds affect the conformation of the protein. Removal of all disulfide bonds using molecular dynamics is proposed as a practical prescreening tool to identify disulfide bonds that are important for the conformational stability. As a result, some disulfide bonds can be mutated without affecting the conformation of the protein.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10180], "author_name_tesi": "Castellanos Mantilla, Maria Monica", "last_name_ssi": "Castellanos Mantilla", "middle_name_ssi": "Monica", "first_name_ssi": "Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby", "Coray M Colina", "Erwin A Vogler", "Andrew Zydney", "Jai A Pathak"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby, Committee Chair", "Coray M Colina, Committee Chair", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member", "Jai A Pathak, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["protein aggregation", "protein rheology", "neutron scattering", "monoclonal antibody", "molecular dynamics", "viscosity", "yield stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "MICROBIAL ECOLOGY OF BIOFILMS IN SWINE WASTEWATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS FOR ODOR ABATEMENT\n\n", "id": "6468", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2170", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Animal waste odors arising from products of anaerobic microbial metabolism create community relations problems for livestock producers. This dissertation project focused on microbial approaches to odor abatement of swine wastewaters and consisted of two main studies. The first study tested the hypothesis that biological reduction of iron by bacteria in swine manure slurries is accompanied by degradation of odorous compounds and abatement of offensive odors. We showed that FeCl3, a flocculating agent commonly used in municipal wastewater treatment, stimulated dissimilatory iron reduction by bacteria growing in biofilms on limestone gravel in static swine manure microcosms. Biological but not abiotic iron reduction was accompanied by reductions in concentrations of volatile fatty acids and phenols, which were used as odor indicator compounds. Enrichment of dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria in microbial biofilms was also demonstrated by ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer analysis (RISA). Although FeCl3 is widely used to flocculate solids and remove phosphorus from waste waters, our results demonstrate that it also can promote anaerobic respiration for odor abatement.  The second study explored odor abatement in a subsurface flow wetland consisting of four sequential tanks filled with limestone gravel used to treat swine wastewater prior to land application.  Wetland treatment performance was evaluated by comparing influents and effluents during 1) initial operation with undiluted wastewater; and 2) after spring re-establishment of Scirpus spp. with diluted wastewater. Odor abatement was measured by gas chromatography analyses of odor indicator compounds and by human sensory evaluation of headspace gases from the final effluents.  During the first four months of operation with undiluted wastewater, plants did not become established due to excessively high NH4+-N concentrations (1500-1800 ppm). Although the unplanted wetland caused significant reductions in total solids and odor indicator compounds, concentrations of these compounds in the effluents still exceeded human sensory thresholds. Thus, only four out of ten panelists detected significant improvements in odor unpleasantness after wastewater passage through the unplanted wetland, while no panelists detected significant improvements in odor intensity. When influent wastewater was diluted 1:10 to achieve NH4+-N concentrations of 150-200 ppm, Scirpus plants did become established in the wetland within 8 weeks. Following winter dieback and wetland shutdown, plants quickly were reestablished in the spring with wastewater containing 500 ppm NH4+-N. Eight and six of ten panelists, respectively, detected significant improvements in odor intensity and unpleasantness of effluents from the planted wetland. Microbial community composition of biofilms on submerged gravel surfaces was also evaluated using RISA. Since the stability of microbial biofilms was expected to enhance wetland treatment performance, we tested the hypotheses that biofilm communities became more dissimilar to manure microbial communities and more similar to each other over time. Two months after start up, microbial biofilm communities were all highly dissimilar (0-38% pairwise similarity range), and communities at 3-cm depths were more divergent than those at 45-cm depths. Similarities among biofilm communities were higher after three months (9-50%). After plants had regrown in the spring, all microbial biofilm communities had lower species richness than communities from the unplanted phase.  It was also observed that in all biofilm communities from planted tanks during this season, 90% of the populations had been previously detected in biofilms from the unplanted tanks, which indicated temporal persistence of subsets of specific microbial populations in the biofilms. Planted wetlands resulted in microbial biofilms with fewer detectable populations and appeared to abate odors more efficiently than unplanted wetlands. Selected bacteria from wastewater and biofilm samples were also isolated and identified based on 16S rRNA gene sequences.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2150], "author_name_tesi": "Castillo Gonzalez, Hugo Aaron", "last_name_ssi": "Castillo Gonzalez", "middle_name_ssi": "Aaron", "first_name_ssi": "Hugo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maryann Victoria Bruns", "David Russell Dewalle", "Robert David Shannon", "Eileen Eilzabeth Fabian", "Carmen Enid Martinez", "David A Mortensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Chair", "David Russell Dewalle, Committee Member", "Robert David Shannon, Committee Member", "Eileen Eilzabeth Fabian, Committee Member", "Carmen Enid Martinez, Committee Member", "David A Mortensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microbial ecology", "odor abatement", "swine manure", "biofilms"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Antes del Amanecer [Up Before Dawn]: Work-Family Strategies of Asparagus Agricultural Wage Workers", "id": "14599muc288", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14599", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the impacts of the global shifts in agricultural organization and the feminization of labor on the everyday lives of agricultural wage workers in one of the most successful industries in the Non-Traditional Agricultural Exports (NTAE) in Latin America, the Peruvian asparagus industry.

The proposed parameterization is demonstrated by reference to the PC-SAFT equation of state, but can be applied to any molecular-based model. The parameterization\nscheme has been developed in terms of the polymer-solvent interaction parameter and the Hildebrand parameter, which describe the molecular nature and extent of the polymer-solvent interactions. The specification of these macroscopic properties yields a set of polymer parameters that are suitable for the description of thermodynamic properties and phase behavior of polymer solutions. In this way neither extensive experimental data nor complex minimization techniques are necessary, as is required for the current approaches for the estimation of pure-polymer parameters for SAFT-type equations. Using polymer parameters calculated from the proposed parameterization strategy, the PC-SAFT model could satisfactorily predict the phase equilibria, gas solubility and polymer swelling\nbehavior of binary and ternary polymer solutions with different solvents, including nonassociating compounds such as n-alkanes, polar compounds such as ethers, esters and ketones, and associating compounds such as alcohols.\n\nA computational approach for building atomistic models for amorphous polymer networks in order to simulate their pore structure and gas adsorption properties is also presented.

These models were characterized by specific surface area and pore size distribution. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the minimum box size that should be used in adsorption simulations.

The present work demonstrated the applicability and utility of this new computational capability for examining at the molecular level the complex chemistry associated with coal pyrolysis and char oxidation and combustion. In this investigation, Illinois no. 6 Argonne Premium coal, the world\u2019s most well-studied coal, was evaluated using atomistic representations of both the coal and the coal char created for this purpose. Orientation and stacking issues were also explored utilizing molecular representations of several Argonne Premium coals and an anthracite coal.\n\nAn extensive review of the chemical and physical structural features of Illinois no. 6 coal was created covering aromatic and aliphatic components, functional groups and heteroatoms, molecular weight distribution, nature of the cross-linked network, porosity, surface area and density. Illinois no. 6 coal is vitrinite-rich (85%, dmmf) with a normalized elemental composition of C100H77.3O13.1N1.5S1.2 and a high organic sulfur content of 2.5% (dmmf). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reported an aromaticity of 72% with 15 aromatic carbons (three to four fused aromatic rings) and 5 attachments per cluster, and an average cluster molecular weight of 316 Da. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) determined that organic oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur forms are primarily ether and phenolic, pyrrolic and pyridinic, and aliphatic and thiophenic type structures, respectively. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) analyses found that Illinois coal is mostly microporous and 129Xe NMR confirmed that the pore structure of Illinois coal consisted of two distinct regions with average pore diameter of 6 and 10\u00c5.\n\nThese analytical data from the literature were used to construct a large-scale coal molecular model based on an improved automated construction approach in an effort to move toward capturing the continuum structure over a large scale. The model contains 50,789 atoms within 728 diverse molecules and is the largest, most complex coal representation constructed to-date. The aromatic ring size distribution was based on multiple previously published high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) lattice fringe micrographs and was duplicated with automated construction protocols (Fringe3D) in molecular modeling space. Additional structural data was obtained from the abundant literature assessing this Argonne Premium coal. Organic oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur forms were incorporated primarily into the polyaromatic structures according to XPS and X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) data. Aliphatic carbons were distributed among cross-links and pendant alkyl groups based on the combination of laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (LDIMS), ruthenium ion catalyzed oxidation, elemental analysis, and NMR data to agree with literature data. Construction of coal molecules was performed using Perl scripts adapted and improved from earlier work in Materials Studio to eliminate personal bias and improve the accuracy and the scale of the structure generated. The Illinois coal model contained >50,000 atoms (C26860H20897O2502N412S330, atomic H/C=0.778 and O/C=0.093) in 728 cross-linked aromatic and hydroaromatic clusters exhibiting a broad and continuous molecular weight distribution ranging from 100 to 2850 Da with a sharp peak at ~350-400 Da, calculated values for Mn and Mw of 522 and 861 Da respectively, aromaticity of 75%, and a simulated helium density of 1.32 g/cm3 in agreement with experimental data for Illinois no. 6 coal. A theoretical pyridine extraction yield, determined by a group contribution approach, was in agreement with the experimental value. The extract and residue representations were generated from the large-scale Illinois coal model and showed consistency with NMR, elemental analysis and LDIMS trends. The distribution of heteroatomic classes and double bond equivalents of the extract was consistent with extract experimental data from electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) collected and provided by the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. These data further constrain the molecular weight of extractable material and was consistent with limited pyridine extractability and model heteroatom classes.\n\nThe ReaxFF reactive force field was used to perform pyrolysis simulations at 2000 K on the constructed large-scale molecular model for Illinois coal to examine structural modifications and reactions associated with coal pyrolysis. This high temperature enabled chemical reactions to occur within a practical simulation time. The ReaxFF simulation was performed until about 60% of the cross-links had been disrupted primarily through thermolysis. For this coal pyrolysis was mainly initiated by the release of hydroxyl groups, dehydrogenation of hydroaromatic structures, and by cleavage of heteroatom-containing cross-links. The main pyrolysis products were hydrogen, methyl, ethylene, acetylene, formaldehyde, ethynol, alkylphenols, alkylnaphthalenes and alkylnaphthols, in agreement with experimental observation. During pyrolysis the molecular weight distributions shifted to lower values as expected due to thermal decomposition to form smaller fragments. The thermal degradation of sulfurated and oxygenated cross-links was more substantial than that of alkyl linkages, in accordance with their higher reactivity. Analysis of sulfur form distribution showed that aliphatic sulfur decomposed more rapidly while thiophenic sulfur was more thermally stable in agreement with experimental data. The extent of decomposition for heterocyclic 5-membered rings was: 57 % for pyrrolic, 47% for thiophenic, and 29% for furanic type structures. The ReaxFF simulation was repeated on a sulfur-free model to further analyze the role of organic sulfur forms in Illinois coal pyrolysis. ReaxFF results showed that the rate of generation of light gases and tars was higher in the presence of sulfur. Further analysis of ReaxFF simulations showed that aryl and alkyl C-S bonds are weaker than aryl and alkyl C-C bonds. Hence, cleavage of the C-S bonds resulted in more extensive fragmentation leading to larger quantities of aliphatic and aromatic structures that evolved as light gases and tars within Illinois coal model (sulfur containing) compared to sulfur-free model. Therefore, sulfur atoms enhanced the reaction kinetics during coal pyrolysis. \n\nA devolatilized Illinois no. 6 coal char atomistic representation was generated using published HRTEM lattice fringe images and Fringe3D in conjunction with Perl scripts, and coupled with the ReaxFF reactive force field. Fringe3D facilitates the char structure generation process by producing a distribution of aromatic structures based on HRTEM lattice fringe image analyses. Perl scripts were used for incorporating heteroatom and aliphatic components to aid elimination of investigator bias, and facilitate a more rapid construction process. The char structure was constrained by a combination of elemental and NMR literature data. Chemical and physical parameters were found to be consistent with the experimental data. The ReaxFF force field for hydrocarbon combustion was used to perform simulations to examine the structural transformations and chemical processes associated with char combustion. In this initial work, very high temperatures (3000-4000 K) were selected for ReaxFF simulation under stoichiometric, fuel lean and rich combustion conditions. These elevated temperatures were chosen to observe chemical reactions proceed to completion within a computationally practical simulation time. It is expected that with computational gains longer simulations at more reasonable combustion temperatures could be obtained. The char oxidation process was mainly initialized by either thermal degradation of char structure to form small fragments, that were subsequently oxidized, or by hydrogen abstraction reactions by oxygen molecules and O and OH radicals. A more rapid oxidation and combustion of the polyaromatic structures occurred at fuel lean (oxygen rich) conditions compared with fuel rich combustion. Char transitions included 6-membered ring conversion into 5- and 7-membered rings that further decomposed or reacted with mostly O and OH radicals. \n\nTo further evaluate the applicability of HRTEM as the basis for structural model generation molecular slice models for several Argonne Premium coals (Beulah-Zap, Illinois no. 6, Upper Freeport, Pocahontas no. 3) were also constructed to predict the pair distribution function (PDF) and to evaluate the fine detail of the frequency spectra via examination of intermolecular and intramolecular contributions. Atomistic representations were generated directly from published HRTEM lattice fringe images using Fringe3D and constrained by elemental analysis and NMR data from the literature. The constructed coal models were partially geometry-optimized to achieve realistic bond lengths but without displacement of coal molecules enabling the distribution of fringe length, stacking, and orientations to be duplicated in 3D modeling space. The resulting coal slice models, devoid of cross-links, captured a distribution of turbostratic crystalline dimensions with an average cluster size of about 1 nm, an average interlayer spacing ranging between 0.37 and 0.39 nm, and an average stacking number of ~2-3 in accordance with HRTEM and XRD literature data for Argonne coals. Simulated PDF agreed with experimental data obtained from Argonne National Laboratory. Analysis of the simulated intermolecular PDF contribution showed stronger intensities with increasing coal rank in agreement with the growth in the stacking number and stack height observed from low- to high-rank coals. The simulated intramolecular PDF contribution showed shorter peak amplitudes for low-rank coals in comparison to high-rank coals in agreement with the slight increase in stack width with coal rank in the bituminous range with more extensive increases for anthracite. To further examine these contributions, lattice models composed of pyrene molecules were also constructed via Fringe 3D and manipulated to directly investigate the effect of aromatic orientation distributions and stacking on the simulated PDF. Peak intensities of simulated intermolecular PDFs at the average interlayer spacing increased with the degree of alignment, consistent with the slight increase in the stacking number observed from low- to high-rank coals with a more dramatic transition for anthracite.\n\nThe automated construction protocol enabled generation of large-scale coal molecular models and aided in capturing a wider range of the complex distribution of coal structural features. Linking high-accuracy, large-scale coal model construction approaches improved here with a computational method for large systems with dissociation and formation of chemical bonds enabled obtaining a versatile simulation platform that provided the ability to evaluate the complex chemistry associated with coal pyrolysis and char combustion. The work performed here was aimed at demonstrating the capability of this approach for examining the complex chemistry involved in coal pyrolysis and char oxidation and combustion.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7962], "author_name_tesi": "Castro Marcano, Fidel  ", "last_name_ssi": "Castro Marcano", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fidel ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan P Mathews", "Jonathan P Mathews", "Ljubisa R Radovic", "Caroline Elaine Clifford", "Robert John Santoro", "Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan P Mathews, Dissertation Advisor", "Jonathan P Mathews, Committee Chair", "Ljubisa R Radovic, Committee Member", "Caroline Elaine Clifford, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["coal structure", "coal pyrolysis", "char combustion", "molecular modeling", "ReaxFF", "reactive molecular dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Assessing Problem-Solving Skills in Construction Education with the Virtual Construction Simulator", "id": "08612n52b", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12277", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ability to solve complex problems is an essential skill that a construction and project manager must possess when entering the architectural, engineering, and construction industry. Such ability requires a mixture of problem-solving skills, ranging from lower to higher order thinking skills, composed of cognitive and metacognitive processes. These skills include the ability to develop and evaluate construction plans and manage the execution of such plans. However, in a typical construction program, introducing students to such complex problems can be a challenge, and most commonly the learner is presented with only part of a complex problem. To support this challenge, the traditional methodology of delivering design, engineering, and construction instruction has been going through a technological revolution, due to the rise of computer-based technology. For example, in construction classrooms, and other disciplines, simulations and educational games are being utilized to support the development of problem-solving skills. Previous engineering education research has illustrated the high potential that simulations and educational games have in engaging in lower and higher order thinking skills. Such research illustrated their capacity to support the development of problem-solving skills. This research presents evidence supporting the theory that educational simulation games can help with the learning and retention of transferable problem-solving skills, which are necessary to solve complex construction problems.\nThe educational simulation game employed in this study is the Virtual Construction Simulator (VCS).

To further evaluate the benefits on problem-solving skills, a new version of the VCS(4) was developed, with new building modules and assessment framework. The design and development of the VCS4 leveraged research in educational psychology, multimedia learning, human-computer interaction, and Building Information Modeling. \nIn this dissertation the researcher aimed to evaluate the pedagogical value of the VCS4 in fostering problem-solving skills. To answer the research questions, a crossover repeated measures quasi-experiment was designed to assess the educational gains that the VCS can provide to construction education. A group of 34 students, attending a fourth-year construction course at a university in the United States was chosen to participate in the experiment. The three learning modules of the VCS were used, which challenged the students to plan and manage the construction process of a wooden pavilion, the steel erection of a dormitory, and the concrete placement of the same dormitory. Based on the results the researcher was able to provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the chosen sample of construction students were able to gain and retain problem-solving skills necessary to solve complex construction simulation problems, no matter what the sequence with which these modules were played. In conclusion, the presented results provide evidence supporting the theory that educational simulation games can help the learning and retention of transferable problem-solving skills, which are necessary to solve complex construction problems.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12265], "author_name_tesi": "Castronovo, Fadi ", "last_name_ssi": "Castronovo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fadi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Messner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Messner, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["construction education", "engineering education", "serious games", "educational games", "simulation games", "architectural engineering", "problem-solving"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Incorporating Cover Crops and Diversified Weed Management to Improve Cropping System Productivity", "id": "13946kec5254", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13946", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To address the need for diversified weed management and innovative methods of cover crop incorporation, two distinct experiments were performed. The first, was based in a diverse, no-till dairy cropping systems study was established in 2010 seeking to produce enough feed, forage, and fuel to supply a 65-cow, 97 hectare dairy farm in Pennsylvania while minimizing off farm inputs. A 6-year diverse crop rotation, the Pest Management rotation, evaluated strategies that attempted to reduce herbicide inputs and the risk of herbicide resistant weeds. The rotation was composed of a sequence of annual crops, cover crops, and a perennial hay crop. A Reduced Herbicide (RH) treatment was compared to a Standard Herbicide (SH) treatment that was more reliant on chemical weed control. Both treatments utilized Integrated Weed Management where the RH treatment incorporated more cultural and mechanical methods of control. Management was altered in 2013 to address challenges faced in the first three years and results of 2013-2015 are analyzed here. Weed management was evaluated for the corn silage and soybean portion of the rotation as this is where the most intensive weed management occurs. The RH and SH treatments were compared based on crop yield, weed biomass, and net return to the farm enterprise. Both the RH and SH treatments generally maintained adequate weed control during 2013-2015 but biomass was generally greater in RH. Soybean yield varied between the treatment in one year, but these differences were not attributed to weed biomass. A greater net return to the farm was seen under SH management in soybean and RH in corn silage. \nThe second study sought to address cover crop adoption in the Northeast, that has been slow and limited due to a number of factors. Farmers are faced with a constricted time window for cover crop planting following harvest and before weather conditions prevent fall growth. Multiple methods have been evaluated to expand this restricted planting window including aerial seeding, underseeding and relay intercropping. All of these methods face additional challenges in no-till production systems. Researchers at Penn State developed an innovative cover crop interseeder to address establishment restrictions in no-till grain production. After design of the machine was completed, a number of successful intseeder cover crops needed to be selected. A successful interseeded cover crop may require traits that are not normally associated with post-harvest established cover crops. These species need to tolerate low light and moisture conditions while being able to establish. Annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) has been shown to be a strong candidate for interseeding in earlier studies and a trial was conducted to test different varieties for interseeding ability. A Species Trial was conducted to evaluate different grass and legume species in either corn or soybean. These trials were conducted in Pennsylvania (PA), New York (NY), and Maryland (MD). Several species were shown to be better candidates for interseeding based on fall and spring biomass. These species were: Medium Red Clover (Trifolium pretense), Annual ryegrass, and Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.). The annual ryegrass trial showed similar performance across varieties with few performing better than others. A better understanding of appropriate cover crop selection can be used in conjunction with ongoing work with herbicide selection to create recommendations for farmers.

Development of the Quantum Mechanics Visualization Instrument (QMVI) occurred across four successive semesters in 1999-2001. During this time 213 undergraduate and graduate students attending the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) at University Park and Arizona State University (ASU) participated in this development and validation study. Participating students were enrolled in four distinct groups of courses: Modern Physics, Undergraduate Quantum Mechanics, Graduate Quantum Mechanics, and Chemistry Quantum Mechanics. \nExpert panels of professors of physics experienced in teaching quantum mechanics courses and graduate students in physics and science education established the core content and assisted in the validating of successive versions of the 24-question QMVI. Instrument development was guided by procedures outlined in the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA-APA-NCME, 1999).\nData gathered in this study provided information used in the development of successive versions of the QMVI. Data gathered in the final phase of administration of the QMVI also provided evidence that the intended score interpretation of the QMVI achievement test is valid and reliable. A moderate positive correlation coefficient of 0.49 was observed between the students\u2019 QMVI scores and their confidence levels. Analyses of variance indicated that students\u2019 scores in Graduate Quantum Mechanics and Undergraduate Quantum Mechanics courses were significantly higher than the mean scores of students in Modern Physics and Chemistry Quantum Mechanics courses (p < 0.05). That finding is consistent with the additional understanding and experience that should be anticipated in graduate students and junior-senior level students over sophomore physics majors and majors in another field. The moderate positive correlation coefficient of 0.42 observed between students\u2019 QMVI scores and their final course grades was also consistent with expectations in a valid instrument. In addition, the Cronbach-alpha reliability coefficient of the QMVI was found to be 0.82, a relatively high reliability coefficient for an achievement test. \nThis study also provided data from which preliminary findings were drawn on students\u2019 understanding of introductory quantum mechanics concepts. The data included limited information about students\u2019 visual understanding of quantum mechanics concepts. Data suggested that the construct of quantum mechanics understanding is most likely multidimensional and the Main Topic defined as \u201cQuantum Mechanics Postulates\u201d may be an especially important factor for students in acquiring a successful understanding of quantum mechanics. Students\u2019 difficulties with concepts including momentum-space and time-dependence were observed. Limited data on visualization indicated that students were able to relate their mathematical and verbal knowledge with visual representations of quantum mechanics concepts. However, data also suggested that students did not perform as well, in general, when they had to connect conceptual ideas with quantitative interpretation.\n\tThe results of this study suggest recommendations for further development of the QMVI, for development of understanding of introductory quantum mechanics, and for possible applications of the QMVI. The recommendations have potentially important implications for the teaching of introductory quantum mechanics and for the development of text and technology resources.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1884], "author_name_tesi": "Cataloglu, Erdat ", "last_name_ssi": "Cataloglu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Erdat", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent Norman Lunetta", "Peter A Rubba Jr.", "Richard Wallace Robinett", "Hoi Kin Suen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent Norman Lunetta, Committee Chair", "Peter A Rubba Jr., Committee Member", "Richard Wallace Robinett, Committee Chair", "Hoi Kin Suen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["College students", "Validation", "Psychometrics", "Science Education", "Quantum Mechanics", "Test Development", "Physics Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "POLYMER SOLUTIONS AND SOLVENT-SUPERCRITICAL CARBON DIOXIDE STUDIES APPLIYING PC-SAFT\n", "id": "11912", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "260", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nIn this thesis is presented the phase equilibria predictions for several polymer solutions and polymer-solvent-solvent systems with the presence of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) applying Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT). Two main studies were presented to calculate vapor-liquid, liquid-liquid and supercritical fluid-phase equilibria.\nIn the first study, the capabilities and usefulness of several cubic equations of state (PR, SRK, SOF-PR, SOF-RK) as well as a molecular-based equation of state, PC-SAFT were explored. Specifically, the two phase fluid-fluid regions (VLE, LLE) of several demanding binary mixtures of aromatics as well as dichlorobenzoates (alkyl and semi-fluorinated) with supercritical CO2 were evaluated. Group contribution approaches were used to estimate the pure fluid parameters for the alkyl and semi-fluorinated dichlorobenzoates needed for each equation of state. We showed that these models can capture many important features of the complex phase behavior of highly asymmetric systems composed of supercritical CO2 and alkyl (nonfluorinated or semi-fluorinated) 2, 5-dichlorobenzotes.\nIn a second study, the anti-solvent effects of supercritical carbon dioxide in the polystyrene-cyclohexane-carbon dioxide ternary system were predicted with the PC-SAFT model. The results, using polymer parameters calculated with a recently proposed parametrization strategy, satisfactorily predict the phase equilibria behavior of the ternary system and achieve good agreement with experimental data available in literature. Additionally, the swelling behavior of the ternary system as a function of pressure was calculated and several other derivative properties such as the coefficient of isothermal compressibility (\u00e2T), the coefficient of isobaric thermal expansivity (\u00e1P) and the heat capacity, Cp, were evaluated.\nConventional problems in many industrial applications and engineering research areas have been solved with cubic equations of state with reasonable results. However, a powerful advance for industrial applications of polymer solutions and solvent \u2013 solvent mixtures under the influence of scCO2 have been presented in this work. The results using PC-SAFT, a molecular-based equation of state, can also help in the development and study of new polymeric materials.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [257], "author_name_tesi": "Catano-Barrera, Alma Maria", "last_name_ssi": "Catano-Barrera", "middle_name_ssi": "Maria", "first_name_ssi": "Alma", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Coray M Colina", "Coray M Colina", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Coray M Colina, Thesis Advisor", "Coray M Colina, Thesis Advisor", "James Patrick Runt, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["phase equilibria", "supercritical carbon dioxide", "polymer solutions", "pc-saft"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "An Examination of Factors Influencing\nretention of Volunteer Firefighters\nin the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania", "id": "26296", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11366", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, nearly 90% of all firefighting personnel are volunteers.

Linear mixed effects modeling analyses indicated residents with more aged physiognomic cues were associated with weaker ratings of independence and hearing proficiency, and to stronger ratings of wisdom.  Residents with more infirm physique characteristics were related to weaker ratings of independence, wisdom, healthiness, and hearing proficiency. A poorly groomed, unkempt, unfashionable appearance was related to weaker ratings of healthiness.  Younger caregivers associated residents more strongly with the positive dimension of the wisdom stereotype.  ALF beliefs were unrelated to activation of age-related stereotypes.  Caregivers used fewer features of normal speech with residents who were associated less strongly with the positive dimension of the hearing proficiency stereotype.

Due to its historical significance, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission decided to make forward-looking efforts to preserve this structure.  This task was performed by the Pennsylvania State University, Department of Architectural Engineering.\n\nThe scope of the Cornwall Iron Furnace preservation project entailed an investigation into the following main topics:\n\no\tCorrosion in Embedded Iron Members\no\tEfflorescence and Organic Growth\no\tMasonry\n\nAs the project evolved with building preservation as a primary goal, it acquired additional, notable intellectual content.  By using basic engineering principles to apply a variety of less frequently employed tests to a structure, the effectiveness of the project\u2019s solutions was increased.  The motivation, investigation, and application of this project to future endeavors is described in the following pages, as a master\u2019s thesis document.\n\nThis thesis is sectioned into three main parts, titled \u2018Motivation and Thesis Scope,\u2019 \u2018Study of the Cornwall Iron Furnace Condition and Conservation Report,\u2019 and \u2018Application,\u2019 as Parts I, II, and III:\n\n\u2022\tPart I \u2013 Motivation and Thesis Scope:  The Motivation section introduces a study involving the historical preservation of the Cornwall Iron Furnace, and outlines the academic content that developed throughout the course of the project.  Using other published sources, this section provides necessary background information, as the motivation to this study, prior to the presentation of the detailed Cornwall Iron Furnace investigation.  These published studies describe similar deterioration mechanisms to those found in the Cornwall Iron Furnace, and are necessary to understand the development Cornwall Iron Furnace investigation.\n\n\u2022\tPart II \u2013 Study of the Cornwall Iron Furnace Condition and Conservation Report:  The Study section presents the investigation into each deterioration mechanism found in the Cornwall Iron Furnace in depth.  This section comprises the bulk of this document, and presents information pertaining to the intricacies of each scope item within the case study.  In the final pages of Part II, recommendations to resolve each deterioration mechanism within the building are established.\n\n\u2022\tPart III \u2013 Application:  The Application section relates the information presented in Part I and Part II of this report by explaining the significance in the development and findings of the Cornwall Iron Furnace case study in relation to other similar projects.\n\nBy employing less frequently used investigative techniques, the current state of the building was determined and corrective measures were proposed.  In general, it was found that moisture intrusion is the primary cause of most of the problems observed in Cornwall Iron Furnace.  As it interacts with the structural systems of the Furnace, moisture acts as a partial catalyst that corrodes iron members, supports efflorescence and organic growth, and continues masonry deterioration.  Because a complete elimination of moisture within the building envelope is impractical, the proposed solutions to the problems within the Cornwall Iron Furnace incorporate a balanced look at each interdependent deterioration mechanism.  The proposed solutions were then offered as efficient corrective measures.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1096], "author_name_tesi": "Caudill, Christopher Phillip", "last_name_ssi": "Caudill", "middle_name_ssi": "Phillip", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Boothby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Boothby, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["DETERIORATION", "MORTAR", "CORROSION", "PRESERVATION", "HISTORIC", "FURNACE", "IRON", "CORNWALL", "EFFLORESCENCE", "ORGANIC"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Damage Mitigation for Rotorcraft through Load Alleviating Control", "id": "23708", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10713", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A control method was developed to reduce the fatigue damage caused to critical rotorcraft hub components.

In particular, we concentrate on inferring the related businesses, i.e., are there groups of companies that are highly correlated through some measurement (metric)?\nWe argue that business relationships derived from general literature (i.e., newspaper articles and news items) may help us create a network of related companies (business networks). On the other hand, relative movement of stock prices can give us an indication of related companies (asset graphs).\nHence, our research addresses the problem of construction and analysis of the networks of business organizations, i.e., asset graphs and business networks, and exploring the relationships between these two types of networks.\nWe start with the asset graphs. An asset graph is a network model of a stock market constructed based on pair-wise stock price correlations. Adapting the methodology from the literature, we present implementations with some extensions, such as consideration of different correlation metrics, global stock markets etc. A new asset graph model is also presented to capture the short term stock market dynamics and general market trends so that we can observe the effects of business events on the asset graphs.\nThe second problem this study addresses is about business networks. We define a novel business network model that captures business events. Business networks are constructed based on the occurrences of company names in general literature, such as daily news. Our extended business network model captures not only the business relationships between several companies (co-occurrences two or more company names in the same document) with the links between the corresponding companies, but the business events which is about one particular company (occurrence of the company name in a document) by representing them with self-links or loops in the network.\nFinally, we combine our approaches mentioned above, asset graphs and business networks, to explore the relationships between these two kinds of networks, and hence, the relationships between the business events, and financial systems. Our approaches include finding the graph intersections, analyses on the stocks with strong negative correlations and 1-neighborhood similarity analysis. Graph intersections illustrate the companies with significant stock correlations and the business events or relationships, which might be considered as the possible reasons for these strong correlations. Analysis about strong negative correlations assumes that if a company\u2019s stock price strongly negatively correlated with many others, then, a business event or relationship might be the reason for that, and hence, it might be captured in corresponding business networks. Finally, the analysis about the 1-neigborhoods shows how similar these neighborhoods are in the asset graphs and corresponding business networks. Our results illustrate the relationships between these two kinds of networks.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1973], "author_name_tesi": "Cavdur, Fatih ", "last_name_ssi": "Cavdur", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fatih", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Ling Rothrock", "Tao Yao", "C Lee Giles", "Lyle Norman Long"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara, Dissertation Advisor", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Chair", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "C Lee Giles, Committee Member", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["networks", "network mining", "asset graphs", "business networks", "financial systems", "stock markets"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Radiation Sensitivity of Graphene Field Effect Transistors and Other Thin Film Architectures", "id": "24270", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10902", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An important contemporary motivation for advancing radiation detection science and technology is the need for interdiction of nuclear and radiological materials, which may be used to fabricate weapons of mass destruction. The detection of such materials by nuclear techniques relies on achieving high sensitivity and selectivity to X-rays, gamma-rays, and neutrons. To be attractive in field deployable instruments, it is desirable for detectors to be lightweight, inexpensive, operate at low voltage, and consume low power. To address the relatively low particle flux in most passive measurements for nuclear security applications, detectors scalable to large areas that can meet the high absolute detection efficiency requirements are needed.\nGraphene-based and thin-film-based radiation detectors represent attractive technologies that could meet the need for inexpensive, low-power, size-scalable detection architectures, which are sensitive to X-rays, \ufffdgamma-rays, and neutrons. The utilization of graphene to detect ionizing radiation relies on the modulation of graphene charge carrier density by changes in local electric field, i.e. the field effect in graphene. Built on the principle of a conventional field effect transistor, the graphene-based field effect transistor (GFET) utilizes graphene as a channel and a semiconducting substrate as an absorber medium with which the ionizing radiation interacts. A radiation interaction event that deposits energy within the substrate creates electron-hole pairs, which modify the electric field and modulate graphene charge carrier density. A detection event in a GFET is therefore measured as a change in graphene resistance or current. Thin (micron-scale) films can also be utilized for radiation detection of thermal neutrons provided nuclides with high neutron absorption cross section are present with appreciable density. Detection in thin-film detectors could be realized through the collection of charge carriers generated within the film by slowing-down of neutron capture reaction products.\nThe objective of this dissertation is to develop, characterize, and optimize novel graphene-based and thin-film radiation detectors. The dissertation includes a review of relevant physics, comprehensive descriptions and discussions of the experimental campaigns that were conducted, computational simulations, and detailed analysis of certain processes occurring in graphene-based and thin-film radiation detectors that significantly affect their response characteristics. Experiments have been conducted to characterize the electrical properties of GFETs and their responsivity to radiation of different types, such as visible, ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma\ufffd-ray photons, and alpha particles. The nature of graphene hysteretic effects under operational conditions has been studied. Spatially dependent sensitivity of GFETs to irradiation has been experimentally investigated using both a focused laser beam and focused X-ray microbeam. A model has been developed that deterministically simulates the mechanisms of charge transport within the GFET substrate and explains the experimental finding that the effective area of the GFET significantly exceeds the size of graphene.

The sensor consists of two environmental chambers made of UV-transmitting Teflon film continuously exposed to the solar radiation, a unit to convert NO2 to O3, and a modified ozone monitor. In the sample chamber, photolysis processes and radical chemistry produce ozone just as it happens in the atmosphere. In the second chamber, called the reference chamber, a UV-blocking film prevents radical formation in a way that only the photostationary state component of ozone formation is retained. High-efficiency conversion of NO2 to O3 accounts for differences in the NOx photostationary state between both chambers. An ozone monitor operating without its ozone scrubber detects the ozone differential between the sample and the reference chamber. By doing so, the photostationary state component of ozone formation is canceled out and the ozone produced via radical chemistry is detected. The ozone differential is divided by the exposure time of the air in the chambers to find the rate of ozone production. Radical abundance measurements, wall loss tests and radiometric measurements demonstrate the feasibility of the technique.\nThe MOPS was deployed in a rural environment, on the campus of Penn State University (September 2008), and in an urban environment, in Houston during the Study of Houston Atmospheric Radical Precursors SHARP (15 Apr to 31 May, 2009). The MOPS retrieved the first experimental plots of ambient P(O3) vs. NO in both locations.  In addition, the sensitivity of ozone production in these two environments was studied by adding NOx mixtures to the ambient air and looking at the response in the production of ozone. The results presented in this work demonstrate how an extended use of the MOPS can contribute to the improvement of air quality regulations by quantifying ozone production and ozone transport at a regional scale. Another practical benefit is to be able to improve and validate chemical box models. Finally, our current understanding of the chemistry of ozone production can be verified or revisited as additional experimental evidence is retrieved in future field campaigns with the MOPS.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4449], "author_name_tesi": "Cazorla, Maria ", "last_name_ssi": "Cazorla", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Henry Brune", "William Henry Brune", "Anne Mee Thompson", "James Kasting", "Scott James Richardson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Henry Brune, Dissertation Advisor", "William Henry Brune, Committee Chair", "Anne Mee Thompson, Committee Member", "James Kasting, Committee Member", "Scott James Richardson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ozone pollution", "air quality", "atmospheric chemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "CREATING A NARRATIVE OF LIFE: PUBLIC HEALTH THROUGH THE EYES OF DR.

New York was likewise home to a rapidly growing population of immigrants made vulnerable to disease through the unlivable conditions of tenement housing and poverty. Living from 1873-1945, Dr. Sara Josephine Baker was director of New York City\u2019s Bureau of Child Hygiene: the first woman to be appointed a municipal public health official in the United States. Baker witnessed the professionalization of the field of public health and participated in its transition from municipal sanitation to preventative medicine. Baker is chiefly remembered in scholarship for her role in the apprehension of typhoid carrier Mary Mallon (\u201cTyphoid Mary\u201d) and for using preventative health to reduce infant mortality. However, Baker\u2019s perspective on the meaning of her work and the larger role of public health in American society has not been examined, and is relevant to twenty-first century preventative health strategies for mothers and infants.\nIn this study Baker\u2019s perspective on the role of public health in society is examined through her autobiography and public writing, couched within the cultural context of progressive reform, the professionalization of the fields of public health and medicine, and the national discussion surrounding individual vs. state and expert vs. non-expert responsibility for child welfare. Key issues to the development of public health are examined, putting Baker\u2019s voice in conversation with other public health officials, reformers, physicians, and politicians of her time. Through Baker\u2019s perspective the role of public health in society clearly emerges as a \u201cnarrative of life.\u201d Utilizing Baker as a lens, this study argues that as a new field public health had an opportunity to help define modern industrial American society as one that demonstrated its value for life through the protection of its most vulnerable citizens: infants. Baker recognized that a public service requiring the cooperation of federal and local governments, families, public health workers, nonprofits and medical experts required a narrative that made the work meaningful to all stakeholders. For publicly funded preventative health to maintain the long-term support of those groups and to remain relevant to those it served, Baker believed that the narrative would have to be rewritten for each new generation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13331], "author_name_tesi": "Cecala, Rebecca Karoline", "last_name_ssi": "Cecala", "middle_name_ssi": "Karoline", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "American Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles David Kupfer", "Charles David Kupfer", "Simon Josef Bronner", "John Rogers Haddad", "Anne Carver Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles David Kupfer, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles David Kupfer, Committee Chair", "Simon Josef Bronner, Committee Member", "John Rogers Haddad, Committee Member", "Anne Carver Rose, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sara Josephine Baker", "public health", "infant welfare", "new york city", "history of science"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A Quantitative Assesment of the Effects of Base Level Fall and\nbasin Depth on River-dominated Deltas", "id": "23075", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10486", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A better understanding of how deltas form and their resulting morphologic and\nstratigraphic characteristics is needed to improve geoscientist\u2019s abilities to manage deltas\nand their wetland systems as well as explore and develop hydrocarbon resources.\nInherently, deltas form as shoreline regressions, making sea level cycle interpretation\ndifficult. Here we seek to quantify the effects of relative base level fall (BLF) and basin\ndepth on the morphology and internal geometry of river-dominated deltas in order create\na model that can be applied to distinguish between deltas experiencing forced regressions\nand normal regressions. Doing so will allow us to more accurately interpret the sequence\nstratigraphic record. We propose measuring the relative influence of BLF and basin\ndepth on delta formation through the shoreline trajectory. The shoreline trajectory is\ndefined as the locus of points defined by the shoreline in the vertical plane. We find that\nas basin depth increases, the number of active distributaries decreases because river\nmouth bars take longer to aggrade leading to fewer bifurcations. Increased basin depth\nincreases the avulsion period because it takes longer for enough sediment to be deposited\nsuch that a distributary channel becomes super-elevated and can avulse. Fewer active\ndistributaries and longer avulsion periods lead to deposition being focused in one region\nfor greater periods of time which results in more rugose shorelines and more variability in\nforeset dip directions. Deeper basin depths are associated with smaller average lobe areas\nbecause more sediment is required to form a lobe of equal areal extent in a deep basin\nthan in a shallow basin. We find that the greater volume of sediment required in deeper\nbasins outweighs the more focused deposition also associated with a deeper basin,\nthereby forming smaller delta lobes on average. We find that the thickness of topset\niv\ndeposits varies little with basin depth while the foreset thickness varies greatly. This\nleads to decreased volumetric topset/foreset ratios in deeper basins. Deeper basins have\ndelta fronts that are less affected by tractional sediment transport resulting in larger\nclinoform average dip magnitudes. Higher rates of BLF results in elongate a deltas with\ngreater topset roughness caused by down-stepping lobes. Higher rates or BLF are also\nassociated with larger total topset areas. Twelve deltas simulated deltas are formed under\ndifferent rates of BLF and basin depths using Delft3D, an engineering-grade, 2D\nvertically integrated hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model.

These nanowires, which are typically 6 microns in length and ~300 nm in cross-sectional diameter, can be synthesized with a barcode pattern by modulation of Au/Ag segment length, and have thus been used as solid supports for different types of multiplexed bioassays in previous works.  Chapter 2 details characterization of the immobilized hairpin probes for bioassays and provides investigations of optimal loop and stem length.  Ionic strength during the hybridization process was found to be of importance due to the mechanism of hairpin-oligonucleotide target binding and signal elucidation.  Finally, a successful three-plex assay using barcoded nanowires was demonstrated, and this was built upon in Chapter 3, where a successful five-plex assay was demonstrated.\nIn Chapter 3, hairpin probe surface coverage was found to be a critical parameter for bioassay performance and could be modulated by ionic strength during the nanowire immobilization process.  Probe sequence, and therefore extent of folding, also dictated surface coverage to a certain extent, with probes predicted by melting curves to exhibit a higher footprint on the nanowire surface grafting with lower densities, even when challenged with higher concentrations.  Kinetics of probe assembly were independent of sequence and almost immeasureably fast due to the particulate nature of the nanowires.  \nChapter 4 expanded upon the findings of Chapter 3 by investigating the impact of probe density upon hybridization efficiency.  Probe accessibility was greatly affected by surface coverage, with hybridization efficiencies maximized at intermediate coverage, but diminishing at coverage extremes.  The inclusion of short oligoethylene glycol spacers increased hybridization efficiency somewhat at the lowest coverages evaluated due to a reduction in nonspecific binding.\nChapter 5 provided a more in-depth investigation into assay sensitivity, a concept first introduced in Chapter 2, through the investigation of the effects of nanowire population reduction on sensitivity and dynamic range.  Nanowire population reduction aided sensitivity to a point, after which thermodynamics of target binding solely dictated performance.  These studies were aided by receiver operating characteristic curves and Monte Carlo simulations.  \nAs immobilized structured probes gain popularity with the rise of aptamer technology, it has become increasingly important to characterize their behavior at the solid-solution interface.  The studies contained herein highlight a number of differences between surface-immobilized structured DNA probes as compared to surface-immobilized linear DNA probes, which are designed not to contain secondary structure, and provide design and fabrication guidelines for future assay design.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3342], "author_name_tesi": "Cederquist, Kristin Baine", "last_name_ssi": "Cederquist", "middle_name_ssi": "Baine", "first_name_ssi": "Kristin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Philip C.

In media with uniform wettability distribution, the shape of the saturation profile after subsequent cycles of injection was determined by the development of preferential flow paths. The strength of wettability also affected the magnitude of average saturations at the end of drainage and imbibition cycles.

The most available memory architectures today have sub-micrometer transistor dimensions. The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), a continuation of Moore\u2019s Law, predicts that Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) will have an average half pitch size of 50 nm and Microprocessor Units (MPU) will have an average gate length of 30 nm over the period of 2008-2012.\n\nDecreases in the dimensions satisfy the producer and consumer requirements of low power consumption, more data storage for a given space, faster clock speed, and portability of integrated circuits (IC), particularly memories. On the other hand, these properties also lead to a higher susceptibility of IC designs to temperature, magnetic interference, power supply, and environmental noise, and radiation. Radiation can directly or indirectly affect device operation. When a single energetic particle strikes a sensitive node in the micro-electronic device, it can cause a permanent or transient malfunction in the device. This behavior is called a Single Event Effect (SEE). SEEs are mostly transient errors that generate an electric pulse which alters the state of a logic node in the memory device without having a permanent effect on the functionality of the device. This is called a Single Event Upset (SEU) or Soft Error. Contrary to SEU, Single Event Latchup (SEL), Single Event Gate Rapture (SEGR), or Single Event Burnout (SEB) they have permanent effects on the device operation and a system reset or recovery is needed to return to proper operations. The rate at which a device or system encounters soft errors is defined as Soft Error Rate (SER). The semiconductor industry has been struggling with SEEs and is taking necessary measures in order to continue to improve system designs in nano-scale technologies. Prevention of SEEs has been studied and applied in the semiconductor industry by including radiation protection precautions in the system architecture or by using corrective algorithms in the system operation. Decreasing 10B content (20 % of natural boron) in the natural boron of Borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) layers that are conventionally used in the fabrication of semiconductor devices was one of the major radiation protection approaches for the system architecture. Neutron interaction in the BPSG layer was the origin of the SEEs because of the 10B (n,&#945;) 7Li reaction products. Both of the particles produced have the capability of ionization in the silicon substrate region, whose thickness is comparable to the ranges of these particles.\n\nUsing the soft error phenomenon in exactly the opposite manner of the semiconductor industry can provide a new neutron detection system based on the SERs in the semiconductor memories. By investigating the soft error mechanisms in the available semiconductor memories and enhancing the soft error occurrences in these devices, one can convert all memory using intelligent systems into portable, power efficient, direction-dependent neutron detectors. The Neutron Intercepting Silicon Chip (NISC) project aims to achieve this goal by introducing 10B-enriched BPSG layers to the semiconductor memory architectures. This research addresses the development of a simulation tool, the NISC Soft Error Analysis Tool (NISCSAT), for soft error modeling and analysis in the semiconductor memories to provide basic design considerations for the NISC. NISCSAT performs particle transport and calculates the soft error probabilities, or SER, depending on energy depositions of the particles in a given memory node model of the NISC.\n\nSoft error measurements were performed with commercially available, off-the-shelf semiconductor memories and microprocessors to observe soft error variations with the neutron flux and memory supply voltage. Measurement results show that soft errors in the memories increase proportionally with the neutron flux, whereas they decrease with increasing the supply voltages. NISC design considerations include the effects of device scaling, 10B content in the BPSG layer, incoming neutron energy, and critical charge of the node for this dissertation. NISCSAT simulations were performed with various memory node models to account these effects. Device scaling simulations showed that any further increase in the thickness of the BPSG layer beyond 2 &#956;m causes self-shielding of the incoming neutrons due to the BPSG layer and results in lower detection efficiencies. Moreover, if the BPSG layer is located more than 4 &#956;m apart from the depletion region in the node, there are no soft errors in the node due to the fact that both of the reaction products have lower ranges in the silicon or any possible node layers. Calculation results regarding the critical charge indicated that the mean charge deposition of the reaction products in the sensitive volume of the node is about 15 fC. It is evident that the NISC design should have a memory architecture with a critical charge of 15 fC or less to obtain higher detection efficiencies. Moreover, the sensitive volume should be placed in close proximity to the BPSG layers so that its location would be within the range of &#945; and 7Li particles. Results showed that the distance between the BPSG layer and the sensitive volume should be less than 2 &#956;m to increase the detection efficiency of the NISC. Incoming neutron energy was also investigated by simulations and the results obtained from these simulations showed that NISC neutron detection efficiency is related with the neutron cross-sections of 10B (n,&#945;) 7Li reaction, e.g., ratio of the thermal (0.0253 eV) to fast (2 MeV) neutron detection efficiencies is approximately equal to 8000:1. Environmental conditions and their effects on the NISC performance were also studied in this research. Cosmic rays were modeled and simulated via NISCSAT to investigate detection reliability of the NISC. Simulation results show that cosmic rays account for less than 2 % of the soft errors for the thermal neutron detection. On the other hand, fast neutron detection by the NISC, which already has a poor efficiency due to the low neutron cross-sections, becomes almost impossible at higher altitudes where the cosmic ray fluxes and their energies are higher. NISCSAT simulations regarding soft error dependency of the NISC for temperature and electromagnetic fields show that there are no significant effects in the NISC detection efficiency. Furthermore, the detection efficiency of the NISC decreases with both air humidity and use of moderators since the incoming neutrons scatter away before reaching the memory surface.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1217], "author_name_tesi": "Celik, Cihangir ", "last_name_ssi": "Celik", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cihangir", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu", "Kenan Unlu", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Tim Z Hossain"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Chair", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Member", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Tim Z Hossain, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Boron", "Geant4", "Simulation and Modeling", "Memory", "Soft Error", "BPSG"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Predictive gait simulations for investigation of musculoskeletal structure and locomotor function   ", "id": "22646", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10279", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Human locomotion is often assumed to be governed by optimality principles. To the extent that this is true, it should be possible to reproduce various human gaits (walking, running, sprinting) with a predictive approach employing some sort of optimality criterion in an optimization framework. While there are many instances of humans using aperiodic gaits in everyday life and sporting activities, previous simulations of bipedal locomotion have focused almost exclusively on periodic gaits. The main purpose of this dissertation is to implement model-based optimal controls approaches to create novel bipedal gait simulations that are both periodic and aperiodic. Those simulations are used to investigate new optimality criteria for normal human walking and to characterize relationships between musculoskeletal architecture and human sprinting performance.\n\tIn our first study, a novel computational model and a simulation framework were developed to create the first simulation of aperiodic sprinting from rest. The model used was a modified spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) biped driven by torque actuators at the hip and force actuators on retracting legs. The direct multiple shooting method was used to formulate the optimization problem in which the time to traverse 20 m from rest was minimized. The initial guess to the simulation was a \u201cjogging\u201d simulation obtained using a proportional-derivative feedback to control trunk attitude, swing leg angle, and leg retraction and extension. Although the model was very simple, it exhibited a number of features characteristic of human sprinters, such as forward trunk lean at the start, straightening of the trunk during acceleration, and a dive at the finish.\n\tIn our second study, a muscle driven computational model was developed to create simulations of normal bipedal walking using the direct multiple shooting method and evaluation of optimality criteria. We implemented a set of optimality measures derived from muscle activation, mechanical energy expenditure, or metabolic energy expenditure to represent effort; and trunk angle as well as vertical ground reaction force (GRF). Initial guesses to the optimizations were generated using a feedforward control that relied on muscle reflex loops. The simulations converged to distinct gait cycles for different optimality criteria. The additional trunk angle and vertical GRF terms helped to alleviate some undesired behaviors observed in predictive simulations of normal walking such as spikes in GRF and excessive trunk excursion. \n\tIn our third study, maximum speed sprinting simulations were created with a muscle-actuated bipedal model and the direct multiple shooting method. The simulation framework and model successfully reproduced salient features of human sprinting once maximum speed has been attained. We perturbed several musculoskeletal architecture parameters of the plantarflexors in isolation (maximum isometric force, optimal fiber length, tendon stiffness, and moment arm) to investigate how variations in musculotendon architecture affect maximum speed bipedal sprinting performance. We found that increases in each parameter analyzed in the study enhanced maximum speed bipedal sprinting performance. \n\tIn our fourth study, we used the computational model and simulation framework developed in the third study to investigate how variations in the maximum isometric force parameter of each major muscle group affect sprinting performance. The maximum isometric force parameter of each musculotendon actuator in the model was perturbed in isolation. The results showed that increasing each muscle\u2019s force-generating capacity enhanced sprinting performance, but hip flexors and quadriceps were found to have the most and least potential, respectively, to increase sprinting speed. The model employed mechanisms similar to those observed in human sprinters to attain higher speeds. Additional plantarflexor and hip flexor force increased speed primarily by enhancing stride length and stride frequency, respectively.\n\tIn conclusion, this dissertation is the first study to create an aperiodic bipedal sprinting simulation from rest. We demonstrated that additional optimality criteria, vertical GRF and trunk angle, have the potential to eliminate some undesired behaviors and increase fidelity of predictive walking simulations. Contrary to the experimental findings showing that sprinters have smaller plantarflexor moment arms, we found that larger plantarflexor moment arms favor sprinting performance in the maximum speed sprinting phase. The results suggest that special attention should be given to strengthening hip flexor and plantarflexor muscles to increase maximum sprinting speed. The models and simulation frameworks described in this thesis can be used to simulate other bipedal gaits with only minor modifications. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9958], "author_name_tesi": "Celik, Huseyin ", "last_name_ssi": "Celik", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huseyin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Ashok D Belegundu", "Joseph Paul Cusumano", "H Joseph Sommer Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza, Dissertation Advisor", "Ashok D Belegundu, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member", "H Joseph Sommer Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Predictive gait simulations", "modeling", "musculoskeletal structure", "locomotor function", "sprinting", "plantarflexor moment arm"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Salting Public Traces with Attack Traffic to Test Flow Classifiers\n\n", "id": "12196", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6953", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We consider the problem of using flow-level data for detection of botnet command and control (C&C) activity.

We present a method to calibrate the timing-based features of the simulated botnet traffic by estimating eligible RTT samples from the background traffic. We then salt C&C traffic, and design flow classifiers under four scenarios: with and without calibrating timing-based features of C&C traffic, without using timing-based features, and calibrating C&C traffic only in the test set. In the flow classifier, we strive to use features that are not readily susceptible to obfuscation or tampering such as port numbers or protocol-specific information in the payload header. We discuss the results for several supervised classifiers, evaluating botnet C&C traffic precision, recall, and overall classification accuracy. Our experiments reveal to what extent the presence of timing artifacts in botnet traces leads to changes in classifier results, and we show that the presence of timing artifacts in botnet traces can lead to changes in classifier/network intrusion detection system (NIDS) results.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6950], "author_name_tesi": "Celik, Zeynel Berkay", "last_name_ssi": "Celik", "middle_name_ssi": "Berkay", "first_name_ssi": "Zeynel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George Kesidis", "George Kesidis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George Kesidis, Thesis Advisor", "George Kesidis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["security", "classification", "botnet detection", "netflow", "intrusion detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Productivity Patterns in the U.S. Food and Kindred Products Industries: A Plant Level Analysis, 1972-1995", "id": "6097", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4994", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project presents the measurement of total factor productivity growth (TFP) and its components for the U.S. Food and Kindred Products industry by focusing on each food sub-industry separately with the available establishment level data from 1973-1995.  The objectives of this thesis are: a) to estimate models measuring total factor productivity growth and its components, scale and technical change effects at the plant-level; b) to evaluate the average TFP, scale effect, technical change effect, input bias of technical change, and returns to scale to gauge the performance of each sub-industry in the food and kindred products industry through time; c) to analyze the impact of age and size effects on productivity growth patterns and its decomposition; d) to document the nature of plant level investment (smooth or lumpy) in each sub-industry and in all food and kindred products industry.  \n\nPersistent productivity differentials across establishments are observed in the Food and Kindred Products Industry as well as movement at the plant level across productivity groups over time. For the food industry in aggregate, productivity dispersion throughout the time period indicate no significant trend, implying the gap of 20.5% between the highest and lowest quartile plants is constant over time.  The scale effect offers a greater contribution to the TFP growth measurement than the technical change for the plants that are mostly in the lowest TFP quartile group (rank 0) and the highest TFP quartile group (rank 3) across sub-industries and all food manufacturing plants together, while the exogenous technical change effect has the most significant contribution to TFP growth measurement for half of the sub-industries for the plants in TFP rank 1 and all of the sub-industries for the plants which are in TFP rank 2.  \n\nTechnical change is biased toward the capital, energy and material inputs, in general, with technical change being biased toward the labor input in 5 sub-industries and biased away from labor in aggregate.  The contribution of the largest investment episodes to aggregate investment across all sub-industries and all food plants pooled together is evaluated and the lumpiness of plant-level investments in each sub-industry is documented.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4971], "author_name_tesi": "Celikkol, Pinar ", "last_name_ssi": "Celikkol", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pinar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou", "James William Dunn", "Jeffrey R Stokes", "Mark John Roberts"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Chair", "James William Dunn, Committee Member", "Jeffrey R Stokes, Committee Member", "Mark John Roberts, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Total Factor Productivity Growth", "Lumpiness of Plant Level Investments", "Productivity Growth Patterns", "Aggregation", "Input Bias of Technical Change", "Food Industry"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Extending Reliability Evidence for Adjustment Scales for Preschool Intervention (ASPI) Scores Among At-Risk Rural Preschoolers", "id": "13776csc181", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13776", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Behavior problems are a primary concern in educational settings, and early identification and intervention are key to addressing them. The purpose of this study was to provide evidence of psychometric integrity of the Adjustment Scales for Preschool Intervention (ASPI; Lutz, Fantuzzo, & McDermott, 2002) scores using an at-risk rural preschool sample. This study extended previous research that has established acceptable inter-rater reliability evidence of the ASPI for use with an urban sample (Bulotsky-Shearer & Fantuzzo, 2004). Teachers and assistant teachers of 57 preschoolers from a rural Head Start Center in Pennsylvania completed ASPI behavior rating scales on their students. Resulting scores were analyzed to establish inter-rater and internal consistency reliability of scores. Across multiple reliability estimates, all scales were statistically significant (p < .05); however, all five problem behavior domains did not consistently indicate acceptable internal consistency evidence of at least .70 and acceptable inter-rater reliability evidence in the form of intraclass correlations of .75 or greater and interclass agreement of .80 or greater. Ratings of Overactive behaviors, especially aggression and oppositionality, demonstrated stronger reliability evidence than Underactive behaviors.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14075], "author_name_tesi": "Cells, Caitlin Siobhan", "last_name_ssi": "Cells", "middle_name_ssi": "Siobhan", "first_name_ssi": "Caitlin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "School Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Schaefer", "Barbara Schaefer", "Shirley Woika", "Paul Morgan", "Scott Gest"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Schaefer, Dissertation Advisor", "Barbara Schaefer, Committee Chair", "Shirley Woika, Committee Member", "Paul Morgan, Committee Member", "Scott Gest, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rural", "preschool behavior", "behavior problems"]}]
