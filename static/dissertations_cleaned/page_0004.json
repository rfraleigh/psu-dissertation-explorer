Unlike many of his contemporaries who only describe this miserable human condition, Conrad offers guidance to rehabilitate the individual. His presentation of Western and native cultures focuses on their practices of cultural ritual, game, and gender relationships. His target is the Western mind, which needs to be decolonized by being reminded of the fundamental equality of all human beings. Once such a bond between the white and the native is established, each can learn and benefit from one another. His heroes who have come to accept the fundamental equality of all human beings are capable of achieving peace and tranquility in their lives. As a result of their interactions with the natives they are able to cherish a sense of belonging and sharing  that can repair the damage caused by their painful experience of alienation. By marrying to the members of  the native cultures, Conradian heroes and heroines learn how to exist as both individuals and social beings. A mutually respectful and complementary companionship between a male and a female becomes the backbone of a society of emotional solidarity and shared meaning Conrad . Conrad\u2019s female characters, especially those who are exposed to injustices and exploitations, play a very crucial role in the establishment of such a society. They are strong and capable enough to decenter the self-evidence of the binary opposition between the male as the superior and the female as the inferior. They bring balance not only into social environment but also into the power struggle between cultures. Conrad\u2019s juxtaposition of  the native woman\u2019s presence and active participation in social life against the complete exclusion of the Western woman from social life is the most significant binary opposition he points out between the West and the native. Although Coppola bases his Apocalypse Now upon Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness and announces the end of Western civilization once patriarchal and imperialistic ideologies become invincibly dominant,  he cannot see that Conrad offers a solution to prevent this undesirable end. Conrad\u2019s remedy is that once the male and the female can relate to each other without engaging in a power struggle, they will be able to taste peace and happiness. This mutual and complementary relationship becomes the symbol of the social order Conrad\u2019s art encompasses.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5907], "author_name_tesi": "Altinkaynak, Sevda ", "last_name_ssi": "Altinkaynak", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sevda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sanford Ray Schwartz", "John Thomas Harwood", "Linda Woodbridge", "Abdullah Yavas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sanford Ray Schwartz, Committee Chair", "John Thomas Harwood, Committee Member", "Linda Woodbridge, Committee Member", "Abdullah Yavas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rehabilitation", "social alienation", "Conrad"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Indocyanine Green-Encapsulating Calcium Phosphosilicate Nanoparticles: Bifunctional Theranostic Vectors for Near Infrared Diagnostic Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy\n", "id": "11060", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1775", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The American Cancer Society projected 1.5 million new cancer cases to be diagnosed in 2009. Of these diagnoses, a mere 20% were expected to be detected in their early, localized stage. With such advantageous early detection comes various low risk and highly effective treatment options, resulting in 5-year relative survival rates of over 90%. Unfortunately, the remaining diagnoses were expected in a later stage of the progressive disease, where treatment requires infusions of toxic pharmaceuticals and blasts of brutal radiation, and the prognosis is as miserable as the experience itself. Thus, the advantages associated with timely detection and treatment has generated interest in a simultaneous approach to early diagnosis and therapy, a combined modality termed theranostics.  \n\nRecently, the concept of multifunctional nanocarriers that can concurrently perform these distinct tasks has emerged and is attracting increased attention. The full potential of a theranostic strategy lies in the ability to engineer such a bifunctional vector with both of the optical and therapeutic properties necessary to complete the separate functions. Specifically, much interest has been initiated on fluorescent photosensitive agents that respond in the near infrared (NIR) by concurrently emitting intense and sustained fluorescence signals for deep tissue imaging, as well as generating a photodynamic response to trigger localized cell death for minimally invasive, molecular-scale therapy. \n\nThe synthesis, laundering, and properties of calcium phosphosilicate nanoparticles (CPSNPs) that encapsulate the NIR fluorophore indocyanine green (ICG) related to multifunctional fluorescent photosensitization is presented. Imaging with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the well dispersed state of the nanoparticles, the spherical morphology, and the log normal mean particle diameter of 16 nm. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping identified a Ca:P:Si ratio of 1:1.72:0.41 and a homogeneous composition without evidence of an element rich or deficient architecture. Zeta potential of the as-synthesized, citrate-functionalized CPSNPs was -29 \u00b13 mV. A theoretical solids loading of 1.9 x 1013 CPSNP/mL was calculated for a standard suspension. The mean ICG content per suspension is 2 x 10-6 M, which equates to approximately 63 fluorophore molecules encapsulated per CPSNP. \n\nFor imaging and diagnostic considerations, the doped CPSNPs exhibited significantly greater intensity at the maximum emission wavelength relative to the free constituent fluorophore. The quantum efficiency of the fluorescent agent is 200% greater at 0.053\u00b10.003 over the free fluorophore in PBS. Also, photostability based on fluorescence half-life of encapsulated ICG in PBS is 500% longer under typical clinical imaging conditions relative to the free dye. These performance enhancements are attributed to the matrix shielding effect of the NP around the internalized fluorophore molecules.\n\nThe in vivo emission signal stability from ICG-CPSNPs was compared to the free fluorophore by whole animal NIR imaging. The duration of fluorescent signal from the ICG-CPSPNPs was extended to up to four days post-injection, highlighting the potential for long-term imaging and sensitive tracking applications using ICG when encapsulated within the protective matrix of CPSNPs. The surfaces of the ICG-CPSNPs were covalently bound with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The pharmacokinetic behavior of the PEGylated ICG-CPSNPs revealed that ICG-CPSNP-PEG passively localize within solid tumor xenografts within 24 hours of systemic administration via the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect.\n\nTo impart tissue specificity, the ICG-CPSNP-PEGs were bioconjugated with gastrin-10 with the intention of targeting BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells by specifically binding the over expressed receptors for this hormone. In vitro assessment acknowledged the faculty of this functionalization to preferentially target the cells of interest; fluorescence microscopy visually revealed this targeting capacity, while flow cell cytometry explicitly characterized the preferential cellular uptake of the ICG-CPSNP-PEG-Gastrin-10 by BxPC-3 cancer cells. An NIR whole animal imaging study further verified that gastrin functionalization provides a direct means for targeting orthotopic pancreatic tumors in vivo, with emission signal intensities from excised tumors measuring higher relative to the controls. This result highlights the ability of targeted ICG-CPSNPs to provide the high in vivo selectivity needed for the most effective diagnostics imaging.\n\nLikewise, the therapeutic capacity of the ICG-CPSNP nanocomposites is greater when comparing the ex situ generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) to that from the unencapsulated sensitizer. The photoactivation of singlet oxygen in a hypoxic aqueous environment was found to be 60% higher from the ICG molecules upon encapsulation within the CPSNP matrix. \n\nInitial in vitro toxicity trials were conducted in four distinct cell lines to identify an ICG-CPSNP-PEG dosing limit. It was revealed that acute toxicity is subject to the particle number concentration (LD50 of 2 x108 CPSNP/cell) and not the dose of encapsulated ICG. Next, cell viability was examined as a function of photodynamic therapy (PDT) dose. An unmistakable drop in cell viability in vitro relative to the control was observed for all cell lines. The significance of these results rests in the drastically low applied fluence (1 J/cm2), which suggests a plausibly greater efficacy in cell lethality at significantly higher, more customary laser powers.\n\nThis enhancement in photodynamic response was supplemented by the exceptional in vivo PDT effect on tumor growth. ICG-CPSNP-PEGs arrested human breast adenocarcinoma tumor growth over 36 days after only a single, low dose systemic administration (44 nM) and laser activation (12.5 J/cm2). Such heightened photodynamic cell lethality with ICG-CPSNPs emphasizes the tremendous potential this composite nanovector has for low dose PDT applications, particularly considering the non-optimized nature of the preliminary experimentation. \n\nCoupled with the demonstrated improvements in bioimaging performance, the efficient in vivo therapeutic execution of ICG-CPSNPs serves as a convincing validation of the apposite bifunctionality of these vectors. Together with the established biocompatibility and favorable pharmacokinetics of calcium phosphates, these composite nanoparticles possess the potential to serve as a model theranostic agent in the early stage diagnosis and treatment of disease.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1760], "author_name_tesi": "Altinoglu, Erhan I", "last_name_ssi": "Altinoglu", "middle_name_ssi": "I", "first_name_ssi": "Erhan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair", "James Hansell Adair", "Mark Kester", "Carlo G Pantano", "Gary Lynn Messing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair, Dissertation Advisor", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Chair", "Mark Kester, Committee Member", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member", "Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["photodynamic therapy", "diagnostic imaging", "near infrared", "encapsulation", "nanoparticles", "indocyanine green", "calcium phosphate"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Migradollars and Meat: Food Expenditures in Mexican Migrant-Sending Households\n", "id": "10046", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "965", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using the 2002 Mexican Family Life Survey, a nationally representative survey of individuals, households, and communities, I examined the relationship between receipt of remittances and exposure to US migration from relatives living in the US on the one hand, and monthly household food expenditures on the other hand, in 7,740 households. A series of OLS regression models shows that exposure to migration is associated with greater household expenditures on food each month.  Additionally, migrant-sending households spend more on Westernized foods such as animal proteins and processed foods than other households in Mexico, even after controlling for household wealth, remittances, and household composition. The results further suggest that the relationship between migration and food expenditures operates primarily through the transmission of American ideas about food consumption rather than through remittance income. Food expenditures were more strongly associated with having relatives in the US than with remittance income; this was particularly the case for households with the lowest wealth. Among the wealthiest households, those without migration exposure expend more each month on food. Overall, the results from the analyses provide consistent support for the ideation mechanism, but inconsistent support for the income mechanism. Households with relatives in the US may receive remitted money, but dietary preferences appear to be more important for stimulating changes in food expenditures. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [958], "author_name_tesi": "Altman, Claire Estelle", "last_name_ssi": "Altman", "middle_name_ssi": "Estelle", "first_name_ssi": "Claire", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Lynne Van Hook", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Thesis Advisor", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nutrition transition", "remittances", "International migration", "mobility transition"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "High Fertility Among Mexican Immigrants To The United States: Myth Or Reality?", "id": "18945", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "9089", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this research is to assess the fertility behaviors of foreign-born Mexican women in the U.S. compared to Mexican resident or U.S.-born Mexican women.

The results confirm that Mexican immigrant women have higher than replacement fertility with lifetime fertility between 3.2 and 3.4 children. They also have the highest Total Fertility Rate (TFR) and Children Ever Born of any race/ethnic nativity group. The findings are consistent across data sources and measures. Also, Mexican women residing in migrant-sending households have higher fertility than their non-migrant peers and levels similar to Mexican immigrant women. \nThe second analytic chapter evaluates the joint role of timing and selection on Mexican immigrant fertility. Across the models, all of the country-duration groups have significantly lower hazards of a first birth compared to Mexican foreign-born women, especially those with less than two years of residence in the United States, but higher hazards of a second birth. The use of a novel method to adjust for selection into migration accounts for half of the difference in the hazard of a birth between Mexican residents and Mexican immigrants. \nThe final paper assesses whether tempo distortions have a lasting impact on completed fertility using a new method to translate event history coefficients into multistate life tables. In all of the simulations, foreign-born Mexican women have the highest lifetime TFR. Age at migration only influences the age patterning of fertility, not cumulative childbearing. Second after correcting for the likelihood of residing in a migrant-sending household and including covariates, Mexican resident women have only one-half of a child less (rather than one whole child less) than foreign-born Mexican women. Third, the controlled period simulations produce TFRs that closely align with the TFR from a cohort model of women 35 and older.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8915], "author_name_tesi": "Altman, Claire Estelle", "last_name_ssi": "Altman", "middle_name_ssi": "Estelle", "first_name_ssi": "Claire", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Lynne Van Hook", "Nancy Landale", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa", "Leif Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Dissertation Advisor", "Nancy Landale, Committee Member", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mexico", "fertility", "immigrants", "binational", "Mexican-American"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "An Adaptive Framework for Synchronization of Distributed Simulations", "id": "6491", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "883", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-11-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Increased complexity of simulation models has created the need for distributing the execution of simulations on multiple processors. While distributed simulation promises rapid sub-model development and faster execution speeds, it poses two challenging problems: (a) synchronization of distributed simulations and (b) rapid development and deployment of integrated distributed simulation systems. In this doctoral research, a new adaptive synchronization framework was developed to address both of the aforementioned problems. Formal models of distributed discrete-event simulation were created based on the finite-state machine representations of discrete-event systems. These models were used for: (a) analyzing the requirements of distributed simulation synchronization and (b) creating an automated synthesis mechanism for rapid development and deployment of distributed simulation systems. The developed synchronization framework features a novel synchronization protocol, which is based on adaptive pacing of the execution of distributed simulations during interactions. This new synchronization protocol, called Adaptive Partial Pacing (APP) synchronization, relies on synchronized real-time clocks at distributed simulations for coordinated pacing and also features an adaptive pace determination scheme for greater synchronization efficiency. The developed synchronization framework also features an automated synthesis mechanism which allows rapid creation of a synchronization system from simulation models. This capability allows users with limited specific knowledge of distributed simulation synchronization to create and run distribute simulation systems in a short amount of time. The synchronization framework was successfully implemented using the ArenaTM simulation package from Rockwell Automation. The research shows that for loosely coupled simulations, a significant speed-up of the system can be realized.

The fracture morphology was characterized under dry conditions and at different confining stress using high-resolution x-ray computed tomography. Multi-phase fluid distributions in the fracture were mapped between limits of the mobile saturation range using controlled fractional flows. These distributions were correlated with flow rate and pressure drop measurements. We observed order of magnitude differences in effective permeabilities under conditions of nearly constant overall fracture saturations. These differences in permeability are associated with re-arrangement of the physical distribution of the phases.

As the century advanced and as modernistas changed the rules of literary production and reception, gothic transformed, adapting its traditional motifs and its overall format to the new market conditions. Toward the 1940s, when writers like Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares undertook the purgative and reformative project known as literatura fant\u00e1stica, gothic was perceived as an uncomfortable and undignified influence tainting the origins of Spanish American literary prose, and was consequently elided.

Chapter two is devoted to the analysis of the image of a glass of water that constitutes the essence of the first half of the poem, and serves as the root of three new contradictory sub-dichotomies: light/wakefulness/life versus darkness/ sleep/death. Chapter three focuses on the image of both the static and the tireless wanderer, frequently used by Gorostiza and the other members of Contempor\u00e1neos, as another representation of the tension that constitutes the essence of desire.

Although these three terms were in general used as designations of the \u201cRoyal Palace,\u201d each one has specific reference to a particular type of royal structure with its own structure and purpose. This study concentrated in detail context and significance on these terms as they use during this period. Evidences were drawn from a variety of texts including commemorative autobiographical, narrative, and religious texts, besides pictured scenes from tombs, temples, etc. These evidences proved that the Royal Palace C\u1e25 was functioned as a royal residence of the king and headquarter of the kingship where the king lived and practiced his authority as the legitimate ruler of Egypt. Stp-s3 was definitely an essential component of the Royal Palace associated with the king duties as a ruler. Unlike the pr-nsw which seems to be connected with the vizier and government.\nIn additional to the three overarching terms for the Royal Palace informing the discussion adumbrated above, I conducted a taxonomic break-down of the physical components of the Royal Palace. These included architectural elements such as gateways, doors, window of appearance used to frame the power and authority of the ruler during his public appearance. In addition, the identity and arrangements of halls, courts and chambers were investigated along with their functions. That included all the essential parts of the Royal Palace, both the residential area and headquarters of the kingship (stp-s3). The design and plan of the Royal Palace was purposely thought to provide segregation between the public and private areas of the Royal Palace while providing the king and inhabitant of the Royal Palace with all the means of luxury life.

This process requires an effective and appropriate strategic workforce plan (SWP) that meets the organization\u2019s short-and long-term goals. SWP is considered one of the most critical functions determining an organization\u2019s performance and sustainability. It is a process used to align an organization\u2019s human capital strategies and practices to its current and emerging mission and strategic goals to ensure that the organization has the right people, in the right place, at the right time, and at the right cost. Based on several studies, almost every organization regardless of size engages in some sort of SWP, but too often SWP fails to achieve the desired results. \nThe purpose of this qualitative single case study is to explore, describe, and interpret how managers perceived strategic workforce planning and organizational alignment as aspects of human capital management (HCM) in the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and its Group of Companies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The conceptual framework guiding this study is the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) model \u201cHuman Capital: A Self-Assessment Checklist for Agency Leaders.\u201d Of this model\u2019s five key areas, the study focuses on strategic planning, organizational alignment, and talent because of their relevance to SWP. The data, which were triangulated with documents and archival records, were collected via face-to-face interviews with employees working as line managers for ADNOC and its Group of Companies. Content analysis was used to understand and interpret the findings. The analysis of the data resulted in the emergence of nine major themes: (1) defining and communicating a shared vision, (2) nationalizing human capital (Emiratization), (3) integrating and aligning policies and practices, (4) identifying current and future workforce needs, (5) promoting engagement and collaboration, (6) evaluating and benchmarking, (7) recruiting and hiring strategies, (8) investing in education, training, and professional development, and (9) offering attractive compensation and benefits. These themes were synthesized into three areas of discussion: strategic planning, organizational alignment, and talent.\nThe study provides significant evidence verifying how line managers perceive SWP and organizational alignment as aspects of human capital management within their respective organizations. The study found that the areas of strategic planning, organizational alignment, and talent are integrated in ADNOC and its Group of Companies, although a few areas requiring further improvement and implementation were identified. Moreover, the study shows that the organization has logical and well-organized human capital policies and practices that are incorporated and aligned well in support of its strategic goals such that they help the organization maintain a competitive advantage.\n\tThe overall conclusion is that any organization must constantly monitor and evaluate all its practices to ensure that its SWP is aligned with its strategic goals so that its mission and vision can be fulfilled. Findings from this study can be used as a basis for furthering understanding of human capital system development and identifying the key business factors in organizations of a similar size and/or with other similar characteristics that may make their SWP more effective.\n\nThe study provided significant evidence verifying how line managers perceived SWP and organizational alignment as aspects of human capital management within their respective organizations. The findings led to a deeper understanding and exploration of the procedures and practices employed by ADNOC and its Group of Companies to align the organization\u2019s human capital management system with its SWP in order to maximize value and manage risk. The study found that the areas of strategic planning, organizational alignment, and talent are integrated in ADNOC and its Group of Companies. Moreover, the study shows that the organization has coherent human capital policies and practices that are integrated and aligned to support its strategic goals and sustain a competitive advantage.\n\tThe overall conclusion is that any organization must constantly monitor and evaluate all its practices to ensure that its SWP is aligned with its strategic goals so its mission, goals and objectives can be fulfilled.

Scientific information extraction from these documents into a structured knowledge graph representation facilitates automated machine understanding of the documents. Knowledge graphs model information as entities that are semantically related. Thus, in order to restructure a scholarly document into such a representation, we must identify meaningful entities and relationships that capture the scientific facts within the articles as accurately as possible. In this thesis, we propose a suite of algorithms that are designed precisely for the task of semantic structuring of scientific content in scholarly documents. The thesis addresses two main areas of this problem. The first is concerned with algorithms capable of automatically understanding scientific charts in documents. These charts play an important role in scholarly documents as their content, most often than not, contains key facts that are not mentioned elsewhere in the document text.\nScientific charts are an effective tool to visualize numerical data. They appear in a wide range of contexts, from experimental results in scientific papers to statistical analyses in business reports. The abundance of scientific charts in the web has made it inevitable for search engines to include them as indexed content. However, by relying solely on the meta data tags to understanding the charts the facts represented in the charts can not be fully available to information retrieval tools. Unfortunately, most applications, such as search indexing, use  image meta-data to describe these charts rather than the information the graphic was initially designed to display. \n\n\nMany studies exist to address the extraction of data from scientific diagrams in order to improve search results. Specifically, the problem of understanding digital charts found, specifically, in scholarly documents and inferring useful textual information from their graphical components is the focus of numerous studies. \n\nIn our approach to achieving this goal, we attempt to enhance the semantic labelling of scientific charts by using the original data values that these charts were designed to represent. In this work, we describe a framework to automatically read chart data, specifically bar charts, and provide the user with a textual summary of the chart. The chart reading process is fully automated using image processing and text recognition techniques combined with various heuristics derived from the graphical properties of bar charts to extract the original data values. The proposed framework follows a knowledge discovery approach that relies on a versatile graph representation of the chart. This representation is derived from analyzing a chart's original data values, from which useful features are extracted. The data features are in turn used to construct a semantic-graph. To illustrate the portability of the semantic graph structure we use a common natural language application, summary generation.  To generate a summary, the semantic-graph of the chart is easily mapped to appropriately crafted protoforms, which are linguistic constructs based on fuzzy logic. We verify the effectiveness of our framework by conducting experiments on bar charts extracted from over 1,000 PDF documents. Our preliminary results show that, under certain assumptions, 83% of the produced summaries provide plausible descriptions of the bar charts.\n The second focus area of this thesis, is that of automatically understanding a document's scientific text itself. Specifically, we address the problem of constructing a knowledge graph from a set of scholarly documents that contains a large set of concepts found in scientific research content that can not be found in a general purpose knowledge base. Traditional information extraction approaches, that either require training samples or a pre-existing knowledge base to assist in the extraction, can be challenging when applied to such repositories. Labeled training examples for such large scale are difficult to obtain for such datasets. Also, most available knowledge bases are built from web data and do not have sufficient coverage to include concepts found in scientific articles. In this thesis, we aim to construct a knowledge graph from scholarly documents while addressing both these issues. We propose a fully automatic, unsupervised system for scientific information extraction that does not build on an existing knowledge base and avoids manually-tagged training data. We describe and evaluate a constructed knowledge graph resulting from applying our approach to 10k documents.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14776], "author_name_tesi": "Alzaidy, Rabah Aboulrahman", "last_name_ssi": "Alzaidy", "middle_name_ssi": "Aboulrahman", "first_name_ssi": "Rabah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C.

Supraglacial melt lakes play a significant role in ice sheet hydrology and mass balance as they have the propensity to  catastrophically drain. Such episodic drainage events inject surface meltwater to the ice sheet\u2013bedrock interface, lubricating the bed, and provide a mechanism for a dynamic response in ice flow.

In contrast to the major corpus of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Decadence, which portrays decadence fundamentally as the subjectively constructed refutation of modern material and cultural conditions, the writers of decadent literature in Italy and Japan employ the concept of decadence differently in their process of rendering the modern self and subjectivity in literary discourse.  While mainstream fin-de-si\u00e8cle Decadence generally treats the subject as an a priori condition for its aesthetics, these writers on modernity\u2019s periphery incorporate heterogeneous spectrums of human consciousnesses into their narratives, and thereby express their own perspectives on the complexities inherent in the formation of modern subjectivity.\nExamining historical as well as cultural causalities attributable to the conditions of decadence, such as psychological or mental degeneration, immorality, and excessive self-indulgence, this project argues that the perennial phenomena of decadence reflect  the prevalence of a regulatory or totalitarian superstructure whose effect is to stifle, and, paradoxically, to promote the birth of self-awareness as modern individualism.  The literary discourse of decadence by the latecomers to modernity clearly replaces any fixed singularity of subjectivity by multiplicities of consciousnesses. \nThis dissertation analyzes morphologies of decadent subjectivities in selected works of Italian and Japanese decadent literature of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  In the formation of the subject, these works commonly engage issues of the reevaluation and valorization of anti-modern and non-utilitarian thoughts, and the incorporation of cultural and ontological heterogeneities into indigenous literatures.  These characteristics shed new light on decadent literature\u2019s hermetic mission.  The multifarious phases in decadent subjectivities help to articulate modern individuals\u0081Edisquietudes about the totalitarian tendencies in modern social life. Under the regulatory framework of the scientific objectification of human beings, these Italian and Japanese discourses of decadence, constructed from the perspectives of the socio-cultural periphery, facilitate our understanding of individuals\u0081Econsciousnesses of modernity.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2462], "author_name_tesi": "Amano, Ikuho ", "last_name_ssi": "Amano", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ikuho", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Reiko Tachibana", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Veronique Marion Foti", "Maria Rosa Truglio"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Reiko Tachibana, Committee Chair", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member", "Veronique Marion Foti, Committee Member", "Maria Rosa Truglio, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Italian Decadentism", "late Meiji narrative", "modern Japanese", "decadence", "anti-modernity"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Reading as Ritual: Desire for Textual Community in Works by Jeremias Gotthelf, Izumi Ky\u014dka,yanagita Kunio and Annette von Droste-h\u00fclshoff \n\n", "id": "21444", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10002", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation proposes that reading non-religious, literary texts from modern Europe (Germany and Switzerland) and Japan through the interpretive lens of ritual provides a discursive method for linking premodern, subnational traditions and notions of what constitutes the literary to the emergence of a national literary culture identified as such. Studies of ritual texts or the ritual experience of reading have been conducted predominantly in the pre-modern religious context. The present study is concerned with modern secular texts and examines them from a sociological perspective. By focusing on four works spanning the period from the mid-nineteenth to the beginning of the twentieth century, I consider how ritual experience is produced through an interactive process between the text and the reader. Specifically, I consider two Japanese texts (Kusa-meiky\u016b by Izumi Ky\u014dka and T\u014dno monogatari by Yanagita Kunio), one Swiss text (Die schwarze Spinne by Jeremias Gotthelf), and one German text (Die Judenbuche by Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoff).\nThe theoretical framework of the study draws on existing theories of reading, fiction, and ritual performance. Though theories of reading tend to emphasize the subjective experience of the individual reader, my study focuses on the communal aspects of reading. By attending to the major features of ritual\u2014formality, performativity, symbolism, and group identity\u2014I define the concept of ritual reading as inhering in a public act of prioritizing the textual world through the reader\u2019s compliant subjection to its fictional order. Through an immersive experience of the text (i.e., by accepting its norms, beliefs, and worldview), the reader achieves a sense of belonging to the inter-subjective community of the text beyond spatio-temporal boundaries. Exploration into the social dimension of reading by integrating two central but seemingly incompatible ideas\u2014reading as an individual, private act and ritual as a collective, public event\u2014I argue, opens a new possibility for understanding reading experience.  \n     Through a comparative investigation of the four texts, I define what constitutes the ritual textuality of the books\u2014the historical context, the cultural background, and the worldview underpinning the construction of each. The choice of these texts from different historical and cultural backgrounds is informed by the fact that they all constitute a critical response through the literary form to the impact of modernity\u2014dissolution of local communities in the wake of industrialization and urbanization, emphasis on values of individualism, and a sense of social alienation. Through this research, I highlight a key feature common to all four texts: the instantiation of a textual community of shared values to counter the homogenizing/abstracting force of the modern nation-state. In essence, these works each constitute a modern ritual undertaking, as each refers to extraordinary experiences in the virtual space of the text while involving the physicality of each individual reader in the creation of community.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9714], "author_name_tesi": "Amano, Yuka ", "last_name_ssi": "Amano", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuka", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charlotte Diane Eubanks", "Charlotte Diane Eubanks", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Reiko Tachibana", "Martina Kolb"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charlotte Diane Eubanks, Dissertation Advisor", "Charlotte Diane Eubanks, Committee Chair", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member", "Reiko Tachibana, Committee Member", "Martina Kolb, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["reading", "ritual", "textual community", "performance", "Japanese literature", "German literature", "modernity"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Identifying CBM Writing Indices for Eighth Grade Students\n", "id": "8183", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2876", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Curriculum-based measurement (CBM) is an alternative to traditional assessment techniques. Initially CBM was developed so that teachers could monitor elementary students\u2019 growth in basic skill areas. Thus, most of the CBM research was conducted at the elementary school level. Recently, educators have become interested in applying CBM at the secondary level. Therefore, technical work has begun in order to identify CBM writing indices that are psychometrically sound for purposes of monitoring older students\u2019 growth. CBM is thought to be a valuable assessment tool in writing due to the ease with which educators can produce and score CBM probes. Additionally, CBM is a direct assessment of written expression. That is, CBM requires students to formulate a written product. This is in contrast to most traditional measures. The present study examined the predictive validity of the following CBM writing indices: total words written, words spelled correctly, percentage of words spelled correctly, number of correct word sequences, percentage of correct word sequences, number of correct minus incorrect word sequences, number of sentences, number of correct capitalization, total punctuation marks, and number of correct punctuation marks. Regression analyses revealed simple fluency measures are not sufficient for assessing secondary students\u2019 writing ability. Results indicated that a more complex fluency measure, the number of correct punctuation marks, and an accuracy-based measure, the percentage of correct word sequences, were the best predictors of a well-designed written expression test for eighth grade students.

MECs have been studied extensively that use phosphate buffered solutions and platinum (Pt) cathodes. However, the costs associated with these materials could make scale up expensive and impractical. Several different metal catalysts have been tested in MECs to try to reduce the costs of the cathode, while other buffers have been examined in order to avoid the need for high concentrations of phosphate.\nIn this study, MECs using a stainless steel 304 (SS304) mesh #60 cathode and a bicarbonate buffer solution were determined to perform comparably to those having a Pt cathode and using a phosphate buffer solution, in terms of hydrogen production per batch cycle, electrical energy efficiency and overall energy efficiency. MEC performance was determined using a new method to evaluate gas production called the gas bag method (GBM). The GBM produced an average error of 5.0 % for known quantities of gasses in the gas bag. The GBM does not require any additional gas flow instruments for gas measurement, which reduces the costs of monitoring MEC performance. Hydrogen production per cycle for 30 mLs of solution at 1 g/L sodium acetate was similar for different MEC conditions, with 26.6 \u00b1 1.8 mL using a SS304 mesh cathode and bicarbonate buffer, 26.4 \u00b1 2.8 mL using a Pt cathode and bicarbonate buffer, and 26.8 \u00b1 2.5 mL with a Pt cathode and phosphate buffer. Electrical energy efficiency was highest with a SS304 cathode and bicarbonate buffer at 159 \u00b1 17 %, when compared to 126 \u00b1 14 % for a Pt cathode and bicarbonate buffer, and 134 \u00b1 17 % for a Pt cathode and phosphate buffer. Maximum hydrogen production rates were lowest with SS304 and bicarbonate at 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 m3 H2-m-3d-1, and Pt and bicarbonate at 1.2 \u00b1 0.3 m3 H2-m-3d-1, compared to 1.7 \u00b1 0.4 m3 H2-m-3d-1 with a Pt cathode and phosphate. Lower hydrogen production rates resulted in increased cycle times, which means a longer time required for treatment as well as more time for hydrogen loss due to the growth of methanogens. These results show that the GBM can be used to compare performances across different MEC setups and that SS304 mesh cathode with a bicarbonate buffer performs comparably to a platinum cathode with a phosphate buffer.   \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2948], "author_name_tesi": "Ambler, Jack ", "last_name_ssi": "Ambler", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jack", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microbial Electrolysis Cells", "MEC", "Stainless Steel", "Bicarbonate Buffer", "Gas Bag Method", "GBM", "Gas Characterization", "Gas Measurement"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "The Roles of Molecular Motors and Microtubule Dynamics in Assembly and Function of the Higher Plant Mitotic Spindle ", "id": "6946", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2579", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The directional axes of cell division and expansion are fundamental determinants of plant cell morphogenesis. Microtubules (MTs) assume cell cycle-specific organizations that play a fundamental role in the control of these processes. Understanding how higher plants form and transition between different MT arrays is elemental in our understanding of plant development. This thesis focuses on the formation and function of the higher plant mitotic spindle, the MT array responsible for segregation of chromosomes during cell division. In chapter one, the pathways and molecular aspects of spindle structure and function are discussed.\nIn chapters two and three, the role of the kinesin ATK5 in mitotic spindle formation and function is investigated. ATK5 is a minus end-directed kinesin-14 family member that facilitates organization of the mitotic spindle via MT-MT sliding. ATK5 is located predominately in the spindle midzone, where it provides inward forces during spindle formation, and later contributes to spindle integrity, most likely via promoting lateral MT interactions. The combination of mutant analysis with high resolution imaging of ATK5 has also revealed the existence of multiple pathways of spindle formation, which act redundantly to facilitate accurate and efficient mitosis. Chapter four explores the contributions of these pathways of spindle formation. I show that the preprophase band of MTs influences spindle development, specifically via the MTs connecting it to the spindle. Secondly, I describe a previously undocumented process I term \u2018capture and coalignment\u2019, wherein MTs with discordant orientation to the spindle axis become properly aligned during spindle formation. The third pathway is apparent in the absence of prophase spindle bipolarity, where MTs become sorted during prometaphase, resulting in a bipolar spindle. Hence, several different pathways augment one another to varying degrees during spindle formation.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2559, 2560, 2561, 2562, 2563, 2564, 2565, 2566, 2567, 2568, 2569, 2570, 2571, 2572], "author_name_tesi": "Ambrose, Jonathan Christian", "last_name_ssi": "Ambrose", "middle_name_ssi": "Christian", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Cyr", "Hong Ma", "Simon Gilroy", "William O Hancock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Cyr, Committee Chair", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Simon Gilroy, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mitosis", "kinesin", "molecular motor", "cytoskeleton", "microtubule", "spindle", "cell"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Measuring Two-step Algebra Equation Fluency of Secondary Participants", "id": "25084", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11362", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mathematical fluency is the speed and accuracy of basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

While tales of suffering at the hands of cruel dictators set in isolated jungle locales still attracted a healthy readership, these writers attempted to push back against the tropes of magical realism in search of an alternate voice that might connect with domestic and global audiences. This dissertation explores three such efforts in inter-American fiction of the period, attempting to answer the question: How do you construct a literary generation in the age of neoliberalism? \nI begin by analyzing the McOndo movement, led by the Chilean writer Alberto Fuguet in the mid 1990s. Its name is a play on Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s fictional town of Macondo from One Hundred Years of Solitude. McOndian stories are set in societies permeated by hegemonic cultural forces seeping in from the North, where local particularities take a back seat to globalized reality. Then, I trace the rise of what I call the M.F.A. generation, a cohort of foreign-born, U.S.-educated writers led by Junot D\u00edaz and Edwidge Danticat. Their narratives are directly born out of the expansion of U.S. Latino/a Studies and the legacy of multiculturalism, and their notoriety peaks in 2007 with the publication of D\u00edaz\u2019s Pulitzer-prize winning novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.

Traditionally these systems use forward scanning sensor technology such as RADAR or LIDAR to measure the distance between the equipped vehicle and other vehicles/obstacles ahead. The U.S. Army is using such technology on their ground vehicles but has noticed its performance is sometimes compromised due to environmental effects (caking of debris on sensors). This thesis presents the work of developing a FCWS that instead uses Global Position Satellite (GPS) technology and the available information associated as an alternative approach for collision avoidance in convoy situations. This approach however requires a vehicle to vehicle (V2V) network infrastructure to share local GPS data among vehicles. \nSponsorship from U.S. Army and Penn State\u2019s own Applied Research Laboratory (ARL) led to the fabrication of three low-cost, embeddable prototype units that were fielded on three Army Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks (HEMTTs) vehicles navigating through desert test courses in convoy formation. These experiments proved the feasibility of such an alternative collision detection system. \nThe primary goal of this thesis is to evaluate how measurement errors/uncertainty affects performance of a GPS-based convoy collision avoidance system. A simple analytical framework is presented for merging system sensitivity analysis and measurement input error characterization results to determine the uncertainty in the output. The resulting metric is a dimensionless parameter corresponding to a range in the probability of collision. To test this approach, field data were analyzed and applied within the proposed framework. \nA secondary focus of this thesis is to address a specific concern regarding the feasibility of GPS-based collision avoidance approach due to concerns about GPS accuracy. This thesis includes identification of dominant GPS stochastic error sources using Allan Variance analysis. The research experimentally compares inter-vehicle distance accuracy, which is a core measurement of the system, between the GPS proposed approach and the traditional LIDAR-based approach in an attempt to address accuracy concerns. As vehicular communication systems such as vehicle to vehicle (V2V) emerge in the near future, a GPS-based FCWS will naturally provide a lower-cost alternative, or even supplemental, solution to the scanning technologies currently implemented. This work thus offers an immediate and substantial opportunity to save lives. While the target application of the work discussed here was for rear-end collisions such as might be encountered in military convoy operations, the solution could be adopted for the civilian commercial sector via straightforward application of existing technology.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5751], "author_name_tesi": "Amin, Sanket R", "last_name_ssi": "Amin", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Sanket", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean N Brennan", "Sean Brennan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sean N Brennan, Thesis Advisor", "Sean Brennan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Allan Variance", "sensitivity analysis", "LIDAR", "collision warning system", "GPS", "friction coefficient estimation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Reliability Assessment of Roof Sheathing Performance for Typical North American Roofs Subjected to Wind Pressure\n\n", "id": "11457", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4259", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Low-rise buildings encompass the majority of\nresidential structures in the United States. Predominantly, this\ncategory of structures is constructed with dimension lumber.\nInvestigations after natural disasters report that during high\nintensity wind pressures, low-rise buildings with wood-frame\nconstruction are at immense risk of damage with the first sign of\ndamage initiated at the roof. Developing a comprehensive\nunderstanding of low-rise structures' behavior when exposed to\nwind loads is essential for maintaining public safety and\npreserving structural integrity during high winds. This study\ndevelops a better understanding of wind load distribution on the\nroofs of classified low-rise structures and presents a methodology\nfor reliability assessment of roof sheathing performance for\ntypical North American roofs in light wood frame structures\nsubjected to wind pressures.\n\nThe first part of the study focuses on analyzing wind pressure\ndistribution on the roof surface of a typical North American\nstructure. Experimental data is obtained from a full-scale\nfacility located at the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton,\nCanada. Two dimensional surface fitting is used to fit higher\norder curves to predict pressure variation across the roof of\nclassified low-rise structures. Later, pressure coefficients are\ncomputed from the predicted pressure time histories and are then\nfitted with probability density functions (PDF). The developed\npressure coefficients can be used for any location for which wind\nspeed data is available in order to compute the roof wind loads.\n\nThe second part of the study consists of developing a methodology\nfor reliability assessment of typical North American roofs and\nbuilding shapes. This methodology can be used as a tool to predict\nand evaluate the performance of low-rise structures during high\nwind events. Stochastic finite element models of selected roof\ntypes are constructed for analytical Monte Carlo simulations.\nProbabilistic analyses are used to assess the effects of\nuncertainties which can have various possible sources. Employing\nprobabilistic analysis allows us to account for the effects of\nuncertainties that influence the outcome of an analysis based on a\nset of input variables. Random input variables for this project\ninclude the nail withdrawal capacity, number and location of\nmissing nails on roof panels due to workmanship, wind induced\npressure coefficients, and wind speed and direction. Statistical\ndistributions are used to describe and quantify the uncertain\ninput variables.\n\nNext the probability of roof failure is computed for a selected\nconstruction quality. Roof failure is defined by exceeding a\nmaximum limiting displacement based on a construction quality. It\nshould be noted that the computed probabilities of failure are\nbased on the global geometric parameters selected for this study.\nThe applicability of the developed methodology is evaluated by\nemploying the presented methodology to predict the probability of\nroof failure for an inventory of low-rise structures subjected to\nwind speeds reported during Hurricane Andrew. Finally, the\npredicted probabilities of failure are compared with the\nprobabilities of roof failure reported after Hurricane Andrew.\nHigher predicted probabilities of failure are obtained with the\ndeveloped reliability assessment methodology. In the stochastic\nfinite element simulations, all the structures are exposed to the\nmaximum observed peak gust speed, whereas not all the structures\nin the region experienced the maximum reported wind speed during\nHurricane Andrew; therefore, lower probabilities of failure are\nrecorded for Hurricane Andrew.\n\nSimilarly, the developed reliability assessment methodology is\nutilized to compare the probability of roof sheathing failure for\nthe computed pressure coefficients for the full-scale experimental\nstructure and the ASCE/SEI7-10 pressure coefficients. ASCE/SEI7-10\npressure coefficients resulted in lower probabilities of failure\nthan the experimental pressure coefficients.\n\nThe presented reliability assessment methodology can be used as a\ntool by Federal Emergency Management Agency 'FEMA' or insurance\ncompanies to evaluate/predict the performance of low-rise\nstructures during high wind events for a set of predefined random\ninput variables such as fastener capacity, fastener workmanship,\nand wind pressure coefficients, velocity and direction.

These systems o\ufb00er significant technical and operational advantages such as higher capacity, virtually unlimited reuse, unregulated spectrum and robustness to electromagnetic interference. Optical wireless communication (OWC) can be used both indoors and outdoors.\nPart of the dissertation contains novel results on terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) communications. FSO communication is a line-of sight technique that uses lasers for high rate wireless communication over distances up to several kilometers. In comparison to RF counterparts, a FSO link has a very high optical bandwidth available, allowing aggregate data rates on the order of Tera bits per second (1 Tera bits per second is 1000 Giga bites per second). However, FSO suffers limitations. The major limitation of the terrestrial FSO communication systems is the atmospheric turbulence, which produces \ufb02uctuations in the irradiance of the transmitted optical beam, as a result of random variations in the refractive index through the link. The existence of atmospheric-induced turbulence degrades the performance of FSO links particularly with a transmission distance longer than 1 kilometer. The identification of a tractable probability density function (pdf) to describe atmospheric turbulence under all irradiance \ufb02uctuation regimes is crucial in order to study the reliability of a terrestrial FSO system. This dissertation addresses this daunting problem and proposes a novel statistical model that accurately describes turbulence-induced fading under all irradiance conditions and uni\ufb01es most of the proposed statistical models derived until now in the literature. The proposed model is important for the research community working on FSO communications because it allows them to fully capitalize on the potentials of currently used FSO systems. Furthermore, utilizing this new statistical channel model, closed-form expressions for the diversity gain and the error rate performance of FSO links with spatial diversity are derived. \nIn addition to addressing ways to improve outdoor FSO communication systems, this dissertation addresses some major challenges in indoor visible light communication (VLC). VLC is an advantageous technique that is proposed for wireless indoor communications. In VLC systems, the existence of multiple paths between the transmitter and receiver causes multipath distortion, particularly in links using non-directional transmitters and receivers, or in links relying upon non-line of-sight propagation. This multipath distortion can lead to intersymbol interference (ISI) at high bit rates. Multicarrier modulation usually implemented by orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can be used to mitigate ISI and multipath dispersion. Nevertheless, the performance of VLC systems employing OFDM modulation is significantly a\ufb00ected by nonlinear characteristic of light-emitting diode (LED) due to the large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of OFDM signal. In other words, signal amplitudes below the LED turn-on-voltage and above the LED saturation point are clipped. This dissertation targets these important issues and successfully addresses them by developing some techniques to reduce high PAPR of optical OFDM signal and determining the optimum operating characteristics of LEDs for combined lighting and communications applications.\nVLC can also provide a practical solution for indoor positioning as global positioning system (GPS) does not provide an accurate and rapid indoor positioning since GPS radio signals are attenuated and scattered by walls of large buildings and other objects. A practical VLC system would be likely to deploy the same con\ufb01guration for both positioning and communication purposes where high speed data rates are desired. This dissertation also proposes a novel OFDM VLC system that provides a high data rate transmission and can be used for both indoor positioning and communications where the multipath reflections are taken into account.\nDescription of an experimental demonstration is also part of the dissertation where a software defined radio (SDR) was employed as the primary hardware and software interface to verify some of the results of the topics discussed earlier.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11804], "author_name_tesi": "Aminikashani, Mohammadreza ", "last_name_ssi": "Aminikashani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mohammadreza", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad", "Timothy Joseph Kane", "Julio Urbina", "Jamal Rostami"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad, Dissertation Advisor", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Committee Chair", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "Jamal Rostami, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Optical wireless communications", "free-space optical communication", "visible light communication", "OFDM", "indoor navigation"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Fracture Properties of Fiber Reinforced Concrete\n", "id": "9707", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3571", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fracture properties of four different steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) mixtures are determined in the present study.

The equivalent, feq, and residual, fR, flexural tensile strength parameters, proposed by RILEM TC 162-TDF (RILEM, 2002a), to characterize and simulate the post-cracking behavior of SFRC have been evaluated and compared for the various concrete mixtures.

The optimization algorithm was developed as a three step process calculating the modulus of elasticity, E, in Step 1 and the tensile strength, ft, and the slope of the first leg of the bilinear &#963;-w curve, a1, in Step 2. Finally the parameters defining the second leg of the bilinear &#963;-w curve, a2 and b2 are calculated in the third and the final step.

One promising technology, Broadband over Powerlines (BPL), uses electric powerlines as a high speed digital data channel to connect a group of private users to a very high data rate backbone, such as fiber optic. The lines in power delivery network can be categorized based on several criteria. Depending on line voltage, HV (high voltage), MV (medium voltage), and LV (low voltage) grids are typically defined. Most HV/MV transformers locations are equipped with a high-speed fiber connection. Therefore, MV lines can act as the first pipeline of high-speed connection from backbone to the home users.\nIn this dissertation, we explore the potential of this technology and then examine the system performance enhancement for such channel environment using different modulation and coding techniques.\nAlthough for nearly a century some elementary transmission models of these lines have been available, no serious attempt has gone into a comprehensive BPL channel modeling for high frequency spectra. In this research we use a new modeling of multi-conductor wave propagation in overhead lines, considering transient effects. The model identifies independent wave modes for overhead lines and it is useable over a wide range of frequencies. The proposed model incorporates realistic ground admittance, appropriate for higher frequencies used by broadband over powerline communications. By calculating the lossy ground impedance for multi-conductor lines, we derive a transfer function for these networks. By applying water filling in spectral domain, we were able to express the channel capacity of powerline networks, using the developed transfer function. The powerline channel suffers from multipath fading and frequency selectivity. Nevertheless, the calculated channel capacity limit promises very high data rates over this channel. \nFurthermore, LV powerline channels suffer from impulsive bursty noise. In this dissertation two models for this noise are presented and discussed. One of the major burdens of BPL is the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of this technology to other wireless systems. Since electric wires might radiate electromagnetic waves at high frequencies, precautions need to be employed in order to avoid any interference to other wireless devices. This issue is also investigated in this research briefly.\nThe well-known multi-carrier technique, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), is considered as the modulation scheme for BPL by most researchers. By the application of OFDM, the most distinct property of power-line channel, its frequency selectivity, can be easily coped with.  Moreover, OFDM can perform better than single carrier modulation in the presence of impulsive noise. In this dissertation the bit error rate (BER) performance of the OFDM system under impulsive noise and frequency fading is theoretically analyzed and closed form expressions for this performance is derived. In order to make a very efficient use of the allocated bandwidth and energy in OFDM, adaptive allocation algorithms should be employed. These algorithms are studied comprehensively in this thesis. Additionally, an iterative algorithm is proposed to predict and cancel the impulsive noise in the OFDM system over powerline channels.\nEnhancement techniques, such as coding can help an OFDM system to achieve the capacity limit as close as possible. A theoretical upper bound on the performance of coded OFDM system is obtained, given perfect interleaving. The effect of the interleaver length on coding performance is also studied. Simulations show that the upper bound is quite tight for the case of employing a longer interleaver.  The effect of interleaver size on the system performance is studied, as well. In this dissertation we also employ Digital Fountain codes, which are a new class of erasure detecting codes. These codes are considered the state-of-the-art discovery in coding theory due to their simplicity and performance. \nIndoor wireless connectivity is always appealing to consumers because of its ease of use. For this reason, indoor optical wireless communications through lighting LEDs has been investigated in this research. A suitable channel model is proposed for this system and the corresponding transmission capacity values are calculated. It is shown that the combination of BPL and white LED technology makes an efficient method for fulfilling the premise of broadband access for home networking, while providing efficient and low-cost lighting.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4941], "author_name_tesi": "Amirshahi-Shirazi, Pouyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Amirshahi-Shirazi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pouyan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad", "Dr David Miller", "Lynn A Carpenter", "Osama O Awadelkarim", "Dr Nadine Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad, Committee Chair", "Dr David Miller, Committee Member", "Lynn A Carpenter, Committee Member", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member", "Dr Nadine Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Powerline communications", "Broadband communications", "BPL"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A Three-Phase Methodology for Evaluating a Pay-for-Performance Plan to Reduce Healthcare-Associated Infections ", "id": "21505", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9764", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) impose a considerable strain on the nation\u2019s healthcare system. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 out of every 20 hospitalized patients contract some form of a HAI. In addition to the resulting morbidity and mortality, HAI have contributed significantly to the escalating cost of hospital care.  A CDC economist estimates the overall direct medical costs of all HAI in the United States to be in the range of $28.4 to $33.8 billion in 2009 after a Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustment for urban consumers and $35.7 to $45 billion after a CPI adjustment for inpatient hospital services (Scott, 2009). \nSince approximately 70 percent of HAI are preventable, there has been substantial attention to the benefits and approaches for prevention. In the evolution of managed care, a pay-for-performance (P4P) plan is increasingly used to incentivize improvement. As insurance providers move towards more deployment of the plan, evaluating the incentives for hospitals to participate is an important aspect of assessing a broader implementation. As costs in the healthcare economy rise, firms and consumers are propelled to make more rigorous decisions. This exposes many opportunities to evaluate and improve HAI prevention models using financial incentives and novel reimbursement structures. \nThis thesis explores a specific type of HAI \u2013 Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSI) \u2013 and analyzes how insurers and hospitals may reassess decisions tied to P4P incentives to mitigate its occurrence.\nWe propose and use a three-phase methodology to study these financial incentives, The Exploratory Phase addresses the data requirements and the identification of Key Performance Indicators (KPI). The Operational Phase addresses the Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Return on Investment (ROI). The Evaluation Phase addresses efficiency using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and results interpretation. \nA proof-of-concept and refinement the methodology is developed through two case studies. In the first case study, the performance on CLABSI by five hospitals is simulated using data reported publically by hospitals to the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Contain\u00acment Council (PHC4). In the second case study, the performance on CLABSI of 59 hospitals is analyzed using data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).  \nThrough these cases, we are able to examine the costs that accrue over time for hospitals that meet their quality performance goals and for those who do not. Moreover, we can determine precisely what is necessary for non-efficient hospitals to become more efficient at averting CLABSI through a better use of monetized resources. Based on this study, we also identify avenues for future research in evaluating financial incentives on HAI mitigation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9515], "author_name_tesi": "Amirtharaj, Dominic Savio", "last_name_ssi": "Amirtharaj", "middle_name_ssi": "Savio", "first_name_ssi": "Dominic", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Healthcare-Associated Infections", "DEA", "Financial Incentives", "CLABSI."]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "SKELETONIZATION OF TUBULAR\nOBJECTS USING SUPERQUADRIC\nELLIPSOIDS\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "10469", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5674", "abstract_tesi": "Anatomical structures contain various types of curvilinear or tube-like structures\nsuch as blood vessels and bronchial trees.

Skeletons reduce the complex\n3D pixel-based representation of an object into a simpler 1D spatial line while pre-\nserving its boundary and region information.

Seven former interns that were experiencing their beginning years of teaching participated in this study. The participants in this study were all classroom teachers who had learned to teach in the context of an elementary professional development school partnership.

This hinders our understanding of the mutational properties of microsatellites, which are among the most variable genomic sequences and implicated in numerous diseases.\n\nIn this dissertation, I develop and use reproducible bioinformatics- and statistical tools to study various facets of rate variation and co-variation of mutations along the human genome using whole genome primate alignments (Chapters 1 and 2) as well as to identify and model the mutational behavior of microsatellites in human populations using the 1000 Genomes Project data (Chapters 3 and 4). I ask and provide answers to the following detailed questions:\n1. How do rates of different mutation types co-vary in the human genome? And what determines their co-variation? Rates of substitutions, short insertions and short deletions show strong linear co-variation and genomic landscape features influence the structure and strength of this co- variation. Microsatellite mutability varies orthogonally.\n2. Can we define and characterize typical states of mutation rate variation? I identified six states with various combinations of elevated or depressed mutation rates -- these states differ in their prevalence, lengths, genomic locations, and associations with genomic landscape features, and influence the localization of genes and functional marks.\n3. When does a short tandem repeat (TR) turn into a highly mutable microsatellite, and what factors influence this switch? Not only the absolute levels of polymorphism, but also the rate of exponential growth of polymorphism incidence with repeat number influences the propensity of a TR to turn into a microsatellite. The change points occur at repeat numbers 9, 5, 4, and 4 for mono-, di-, tri- and tetranucleotide TRs respectively.\n4. What are the main sources of errors associated with identification and genotyping of TRs from short-read data? And are these errors influenced by a TR\u2019s intrinsic properties? PCR slippage errors might constitute a large part of TR-associated errors. Error rates are strongly influenced by intrinsic properties of TRs including (i) motif size, (ii) motif composition,\nand (iii) repeat number.\n\nResults from this dissertation contribute to understanding the mechanisms and rate variations of multiple mutation types, and have important implications for identification and screening of functional elements and disease-causing mutations.

Human exposure to ozone and its reaction products may also adversely affect health and comfort. Ozone uptake to indoor surfaces has been characterized for many building materials; however, limited information is available on how ozone reaction with human surface is influenced by human surface reactivity and airflow around human body. The objectives of this study are 1) to investigate ozone reaction with human surfaces depending on indoor ventilation conditions; 2) to examine the breathing zone concentration of ozone considering reactivity of human skin oil and clothing; and 3) to explore the effect of reaction probability on ozone mass transfer rate.\n A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was verified and validated with previously published chamber experiments. The validated CFD models were applied further to examine the ozone reaction with the human surface in varying airflow conditions. Effects of varying degrees of human surface reactivity on the breathing zone concentration were examined. \nFor typical indoor environments with air change rate < 5 h-1, the ozone mass transfer rate (deposition velocity) was in the range of 8-10 m/h with perfect sink condition. Parametric analysis results reveal that surface reactivity of the human body has a larger influence than air change rate and ventilation pattern. The breathing zone ozone concentration is also strongly influenced by surface reactivity. With a supply ozone concentration of 100 ppb and a transport-limited rate at the human surface (such as human skin oil), the breathing zone concentrations are in the range of 81-97 ppb, while the range is 96-99 ppb with lower surface reaction rate. \nThese results imply that the reaction probability of the human surface has a significant impact on human exposure to ozone and reaction byproducts.

However, each of the two groups classified as solid-state storage methods suffers from limitations. On the one hand, physisorption has extremely low storage capacity at near ambient temperature because of the low enthalpy of hydrogen sorption, but it is reversible. On the other hand, chemisorption has high heat of hydrogen binding ensuing significant uptake capacity associated with irreversibility at moderate temperatures, which necessitates providing heat to release absorbed hydrogen. Hence, developing intermediate technologies, integrating promising properties of both groups, has primary importance to realize hydrogen economy. Dihydrogen complexes are well known for their ability to reversibly interact with H2. Transition metal complexes with an unsaturated metal center are among compounds interacting with H2 through so called Kubas interaction. This kind of interaction involves side on donation of hydrogen \u03c3 bond electrons to an empty d-orbital of the metal center subsequently stabilized by back donation from the filled d-orbitals to the \u03c3* orbital of H2. Such materials attract hydrogen with an enthalpy intermediate between that of physical and chemical sorption (ca. 60-85 kJ/mol for stable transition metal complexes and 15-40 kJ/mol for the weakly bound dihydrogen systems at high pressure). The major drawback of such systems is the redundant weight imposed by co-ligands which are necessary to arrest dihydrogen structure and prevent bond rupture. This, in turn, adds to system weight which reduces the overall uptake capacity. Dihydrogen complexation is the first step in H2 activation process by metal complexes. In other words, any hydrogenation catalyst potentially can form dihydrogen complex. Pioneering works on H2 activation by Halpern and coworkers introduced Cu(II) complexes (e.g. cupric acetate) as active catalysts able to heterolytically break dihydrogen via homogeneous mechanism. These complexes were able to reduce more reactive materials such as Cr2O72- or para-benzoquinone but not less reactive olefins. Halpern deduced in the latter case that the reverse reaction producing the initial complex and dihydrogen defeats hydrogen transfer from the hydride to the substrate. This was the incentive for the current study, that is these materials react with dihydrogen in a reversible manner and further they are lighter than conventional Kubas compounds. This entices seeking a way to stabilize dihydrogen complexes of such compounds at reasonable conditions for use as a storage medium. Recently, researchers have come up with a novel technique called nanoconfinement to alter thermodynamics and/or kinetics of chemical hydrides. Based on this method, reducing the size of storage medium to nm range via its confinement in porous scaffolds could alter its behavior. This is mainly due to increased surface energy induced by decreasing the particle size that renders molecules more reactive. Moreover, nanoconfinement could arrest dihydrogen structure by steric hindrance as it does not let proton and hydride separate enough upon H2 cleavage. Therefore, the goal of this study was to employ nanoporous carbon scaffolds as a host for nanosized, lightweight, under-coordinated Cu complexes in order to tailor their behavior so that they reversibly interact with H2 at ambient temperature. This novel class of storage media offers benefits from both ordinary chemisorption and physisorption systems at the same time.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9821], "author_name_tesi": "Andalibi, Mohammad Reza", "last_name_ssi": "Andalibi", "middle_name_ssi": "Reza", "first_name_ssi": "Mohammad", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry C Foley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry C Foley, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydrogen adsorption", "Kubas binding", "Hydrogen Activation", "Heat of adsorption"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Rhetoric for Becoming Otherwise: Life, Literature, Genealogy, Flight", "id": "9889", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "61", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\"Rhetoric for Becoming Otherwise\" begins with the Isocratean premise that thought, speech, writing are best understood as bridges between the already said of language and the emerging circumstances that are the occasions for their production.

Studies of landbirds in Europe and North America have shown effects of climatic variation on productivity and survival. However, such effects have been seen to translate to changes in population densities in only a few studies of European landbirds. Thus, the extent to which global warming has the potential to cause population declines in North American landbirds has remained unclear. In the research presented here, I model 39 years of climatic data, including indices of the North Atlantic Oscillation and El Nin\u00deo Southern Oscillation, and distribution-wide Breeding Bird Survey data on 21 North American landbird species, to examine potential relationships between large-scale climate change and changes in avian population densities. Results of these analyses indicate geographic variation in strength of the effect of climate on population densities, with stronger effects in regions in which climate has stronger effects on local temperatures. Results also indicate that for species exhibiting long-term declines, there is a relationship between strength of the effect of local temperatures on population densities and magnitude of population decline. Additional analyses indicate that Neotropical-Nearctic migratory species are more negatively affected by warm winter temperatures than are closely-related North American residents. These results support the hypothesis that differences in climatic effects on migrants and residents may follow from greater trophic mismatch for species that are unable to time migration in response to earlier peaks in food availability. Finally, results of this work show that species are more highly affected by densities of sympatric congeners in areas in which they are also affected by climate, indicating that increased effects of climate on food resources may increase the effects of competition between congeners. Overall, results of this research indicate that North American landbird densities are affected by annual changes in large-scale climate, such that continued increases in global temperatures have the potential to affect long-term changes in landbird population densities across the continent.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [61], "author_name_tesi": "Anders, Angela Dawn", "last_name_ssi": "Anders", "middle_name_ssi": "Dawn", "first_name_ssi": "Angela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric S Post", "Duane R Diefenbach", "Ottar N Bjornstad", "Christopher Barry Goguen", "Matthew Marshall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric S Post, Committee Chair", "Duane R Diefenbach, Committee Member", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Member", "Christopher Barry Goguen, Committee Member", "Matthew Marshall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["North Atlantic Oscillation", "climate change", "Breeding Bird Survey", "population dynamics", "landbird", "El Nino Southern Oscillation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A New Electrically Detected Magnetic Resonance Approach: Spin Dependent Charg Pumping Applied to the 4H-Silicon Carbide/Silicon Dioxide Interface", "id": "14272maa5297", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14272", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this work is to develop and investigate a new electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) technique called spin dependent charge pumping (SDCP) for the investigation of semiconductor/dielectric heterointerfaces. In this work, it is applied to the 4H-SiC/SiO2 interface in 4H-SiC MOSFETs. In chapter 1, background information on 4H-SiC MOSFETs is presented. In chapter 2, background on EDMR and the various EDMR techniques we utilize in this dissertation is presented. In chapter 3, the charge pumping (CP) and SDCP response as a function of some gate waveform parameters is investigated. The SDCP response does not quantitatively follow the CP, as one would expect. That is, when plotted versus charge pumping frequency and gate waveform amplitude, the SDCP amplitude is not proportional to the CP amplitude. The differences observed are explained, at least in part, by coupling of charge carrier spins to the paramagnetic trapping centers. This coupling undoubtedly involves spin diffusion, but other factors may also play a role. In chapter 4, SDCP is utilized with other EDMR approaches to develop a new EDMR approach and investigate the role of nitrogen at the 4H-SiC/SiO2 interface. N alters the interface in many ways. First, it reduces the interface trap density. Second, it alters the energy levels of some the interface traps. Third, it introduces significant disorder to the interface. In chapter 5, SDCP is utilized to address the assumption that carbon dangling bonds dominate the SiC MOSFET interface. It is found the carbon dangling bonds do not play a dominating role at the interface.

As conceived in this dissertation, youth may be provided a number of opportunities for delinquency not only through personal or contextual characteristics, but potentially through the social contexts of their peers. The school context is the social context used because of the role of the school as a central organizing force in the lives of youth. Schools pull together same-aged youth, release them at the same time of day, and allow many youth to see friends. Research finds that delinquency is often a group event, with other youth serving as useful co-offenders, which points to the potential importance of the school context. The contextual characteristics examined in this dissertation are physical characteristics of the residential neighborhoods of the students, the \u201csocial disorganization\u201d of the student population, and family characteristics. The individual opportunity characteristics examined are two characteristics of the family and three opportunity factors, two of which have not been examined in past research (access to disposable income and access to private transportation). The data comes from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the statistical software package used was HLM. In addition to examining total effects, a series of interactions were tested to determine 1) whether physical characteristics of residential neighborhoods were more important when particular family factors were in play, and 2) whether unstructured time use was more important in combination with the \u201ccorrelates of crime.\u201d A final set of analyses determined whether time use mediates the family characteristics. Some highlighted findings include 1) significant effects of the additional individual-level opportunity factors on various forms of delinquency, 2) a significant contextual effect of unstructured time use, 3) contextual effects had significant explanatory power for explaining between-school variance in delinquency, and 4) support for the presence of the interactions proposed by social disorganization theory.

The plate must possess a very high bending stiffness while maintaining low mass to achieve optimal results.

Even though some data matches theory well, a practical material has yet to be found that possesses optimal material properties.  To the author\u2019s knowledge, this thesis represents the first attempt to advantageously utilize a plate to provide angular dependent sound transmission filtering above the plate\u2019s critical frequency (the supercritical frequency region).\n\n\nTheoretical analysis, numerical analysis, and extensive experimental results have been performed and a comparison will be presented in this thesis.  The angular dependence of sound transmission through a plate is reviewed, followed by design considerations to optimize a plate for angular filtering.  The optimal thickness for a plate depends on the plate\u2019s material properties.  Equivalent circuit modeling and finite element modeling was applied, and is compared to.  Extensive experimental results conducted with bars and a plate will be shown.  Good agreement with theory and modeling is achieved for an alumina bar bonded to transducer elements.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [661], "author_name_tesi": "Anderson, Brian Eric", "last_name_ssi": "Anderson", "middle_name_ssi": "Eric", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Jack Hughes", "Courtney Brice Burroughs", "Stephen A Hambric", "Nadine Barrie Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Jack Hughes, Committee Chair", "Courtney Brice Burroughs, Committee Member", "Stephen A Hambric, Committee Member", "Nadine Barrie Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["grating lobe", "array", "transducer", "transducer array", "supercritical", "coincidence", "plate", "structural acoustics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Contested Identities and Common Narratives: A Study of Racial Representation in State Social Studies Content Standards\n", "id": "11759", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "942", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study is a thematic textual analysis of United States History standards in light of how they represent the historical experiences of people of color within broader national narratives, as well as how they integrate controversial or contested elements of race relations in America into their overall national narratives.

The standards also typically avoid politics and controversy by using omniscient and vague language and generate a safe multicultural narrative that accentuates the cultural contributions of people of color within a framework of linear progress on race relations.  The standards ultimately perpetuate a contributory model of racial inclusion and a normative narrative of American progress and exceptionalism within U.S. History curricula.  The resultant compromise curriculum seeks to advance a consensus notion of how race has shaped American history, but its overemphasis on superficial content coverage limits the potential for teachers and students to think more critically about historical and present-day issues of social identity.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [934], "author_name_tesi": "Anderson, Carl Bohning", "last_name_ssi": "Anderson", "middle_name_ssi": "Bohning", "first_name_ssi": "Carl", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott Alan Metzger", "Scott Alan Metzger", "David Alexander Gamson", "Stephanie Cayot Serriere", "Jeanine M Staples"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott Alan Metzger, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott Alan Metzger, Committee Chair", "David Alexander Gamson, Committee Member", "Stephanie Cayot Serriere, Committee Member", "Jeanine M Staples, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["racial representation", "history curriculum"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "HOW DOES ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE INFLUENCE COLLABORATIVE LEARNING AND INTEGRATED SERVICES IN THE NON-ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES IN THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF UNIVERSITIES IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA:  A MULTIPLE CASE STUDY", "id": "14929csa140", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14929", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to explore how organizational structure is perceived to influence collaborative learning and integrated services in the non-academic department of human resources in three different types of universities in central Pennsylvania. The study focused narrowly on nine respondents, three heads and six middle management employees. Using the theoretical framework of Galbraith\u2019s star model (strategy, structure, processes, people, and rewards) to guide the research, offered a systemic framework. The study deployed a case study method to answer three research questions: (a) how was the department of human resources structured to deliver collaborative learning and integrated services, (b) what organizational features facilitated collaborative learning and integrated service and, (c) what was considered to be the most critical features to achieve collaborative learning and integrated services. The researcher performed a qualitative thematic analysis, a cross-case analysis, online document review, and kept observational field notes. \nThe findings of this study broadly comport with the published literature related to the topic. As others have noted, the complex, bureaucratic system continues to serve as the dominant model of academic administration. Consequently, the extent to which the responses of the participants suggest an entrenched system reflects a predictable state. \nFrom the analysis, the researcher discovered that the three universities had diverse organizational structures, attributes, varying practices, and features they considered most important for collaborative learning and integrated services. There was an authentic interest in achieving horizontality but there are barriers built into the structure such that it cannot happen without fundamental change. The implications of the results on the future of research related to collaborative learning and an integrative service in the department of human resources in higher education is substantial. In the academy, a lack of fluidity in the structure that supports the work of scholars can create a culture and a climate with unintended and unexpected attributes.

Senates were created by faculty in reaction to conditions on campus, such as faculty dissatisfaction with their role in institutional governance, or were created by presidents as a means to proactively modernize the functions of the university. In some cases, the conditions that lead to the creation of a senate were dramatic crises that immediately brought to light the limitations of the campus governance system. A major cause for the creation of senates was the growth of the faculty of the university, which created a need for a representative body to replace meetings of the faculty as a whole. At the time of instituting senates, universities were also making improvements in the quality of the faculty and becoming increasingly focused on research. This study employed theories of political power (agenda setting) to demonstrate how the creation of a senate took place. The creation of a senate was advocated by an entrepreneur who took advantage of existing conditions during a window of opportunity to advocate for a change in the role for faculty in university governance. The creation of faculty senates at 151 universities was investigated and historical case studies were conducted at six institutions: the University of Utah, the Pennsylvania State University, the University of Virginia, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pennsylvania, and Carnegie Mellon University. The study is divided by era, examining senates created in the university building period, during World War II and the post-war period, and during the 1960s and 70s. Universities that have not created a university-wide senate are also discussed. Ultimately, senates were created proactively to improve the campus organization or reactively, in response to conditions or crises that drew attention to inadequacies in the governance structure.

The horseshoe vortex (HSV) system is a flow structure which is associated with individual pin fins. The system forms upstream of the pin-fins, in the endwall junction region. The present study utilized time resolved, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry to examine the behavior of the HSV system within a pin-fin array at rows 1, 3, and 5; at Reynolds numbers of 1.0e4, 2.0e4, and 5.0e4; and at streamwise spacings of 1.73*Diameter, and 3.46*Diameter.\nFor both spacings, the first row behavior was found to be the same. Increases in Reynolds number resulted in the time average HSV system moving closer to the pin, and both TKE and vorticity became more concentrated. In downstream rows, the shape of the time averaged HSV system showed reduced variation with both Reynolds number and row location. For the more loosely packed array spacing of 3.46*Diameter, vorticity contours in the downstream rows were very similar across all Reynolds numbers. For the more tightly packed spacing, vorticity was found to vary with Reynolds number and row location. Bimodal distributions of the streamwise component of velocity, representative of two modes, were found for each case. These distributions were used to perform conditional averaging on the flow. The HSV system\u2019s oscillation between these two modes were found to cause regions of high streamwise and wall-normal components of turbulence. The spanwise component of turbulence in the HSV region was found to be dominated by upstream wake fluctuations instead of the HSV motion. The shape of the turbulent kinetic energy contours were driven by these regions of high turbulence.

This dissertation describes how girls\u2019 education policy discourses were constructed diffused during the MDGs explains explain policy actors\u2019 complex negotiation of these discourses during the SDG transition. \nAs policy discourse, empowerment is constructed as an achievable outcome of education.

The \u201cparticular end\u201d of MDG 3 is explicitly framed as women\u2019s participation in economic and political spheres (Tembon & Fort, 2008). When applied to empowerment-focused discourses, power is at a premium. By exclusively focusing on parity enrollment as an indicator of access, the structural barriers that limit girls\u2019 mobility to secondary and tertiary education were obscured. \nThe policy targets advanced by MDG 3 aimed to shift the focus away from primary to secondary and tertiary education through the inclusion of \u201call levels\u201d. Still, girls\u2019 access and opportunity to and in secondary education were not specifically referenced.

This dissertation demonstrates how policy actors in girls\u2019 education policy and international development critique and coexist with girls\u2019 education discourses as they implement school and community-based empowerment programs comparatively and internationally.

In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Tepeaca was the capital of an Aztec tributary province called Tepeacac that had been conquered by Motecuhzoma Ilhuicamina.  Tepeaca enjoyed a strategic location in a natural geographic constriction on an ethnic frontier between the Nahua-speaking populations of the central plateau and the Mixtec-speaking populations to the southeast in Oaxaca.  Because of this, it was used as an important military strongpoint and node for interregional trade for the Aztec Empire and later Cort\u00e9s during his conquest of Mexico.  \nUntil the mid-1990s, the only information available about Tepeaca came from ethnohistoric sources.  From 1994 to 1997, Penn State archaeologists Ken Hirth and James Sheehy undertook an ambitious program of surface survey, test excavation, and cave exploration within a 560 km2 area around the present-day community of Tepeaca.  The survey portion was conducted as a full-coverage reconnaissance.  Team members systematically surveyed 100% of the survey area, making surface collections wherever substantial scatters were found and marking the location of each collection on aerial photos.  These photos were subsequently digitized and incorporated into a geographic information system (GIS).  The sherds from surface collections and excavations were analyzed in a laboratory located in Tepeaca and encoded in a digital database.  The result is a census-like record of all prehispanic settlement remains within the survey area.  To date, these data are arguably the most extensive, fine-grained survey data available anywhere in Central Mexico.  \nIn 2002, Ron Castanzo used the survey and excavation data to build a ceramic chronology and reconstruct settlement for the Formative Period (ca. 950 BC \u2013 AD 200).  From modest beginnings in the Middle Formative, Castanzo showed that the Terminal Formative was a time of pronounced growth in terms of overall population size and the maximum size of the largest settlements.  In this dissertation, I fill in the rest of the prehispanic settlement history by reconstructing settlement patterns for the Classic (AD 200 \u2013 600), Epiclassic (AD 600 \u2013 900), Early Postclassic (AD 900 \u2013 1200), and Late Postclassic (AD 1200 \u2013 1519) periods.  To facilitate the present settlement study, I used stratigraphic information from test excavations conducted within the survey area in conjunction with cross-dates from known sequences in adjacent areas to construct the first ceramic chonology for these periods.  Following Castanzo, I used the distribution, proximity, and density of ceramic scatters to reconstruct prehispanic settlement.  \nAs I demonstrate in Chapter Five, the marked population and settlement growth Castanzo documented for the Terminal Formative did not continue in the Classic Period.  In fact, the Classic Period in the Tepeaca area was a time of stagnation or decline in population growth and general settlement dispersal.  Although the trend of settlement dispersal continued into the Epiclassic Period, population growth resumes during that period and remains steady throughout the Early and Late Postclassic.  The Late Postclassic is the most problematic of the phases, however, because the ceramic chronology for this period is incomplete.  Because the only reliable diagnostic ceramics for the Late Postclassic are polychrome service wares, the settlement patterns and population estimates I reconstruct for the centuries leading up to the Spanish Conquest underestimate the true extent and magnitude of prehispanic occupation.  Ethnohistoric sources indicate that the population within the PAT survey area was at its greatest during this period.  \nIn all time periods, settlement was markedly dispersed.  Small, isolated residences and hamlets of 100 inhabitants or less constituted the overwhelming majority of settlement types from AD 200 to 1519.  Larger communities were rare, but became more frequent in the Epiclassic and later periods.  The configuration of these larger settlements also underscores the dispersed nature of settlement patterns in the Tepeaca area.  Even the largest settlements in terms of estimated population size tended to grow in area as they grew in number of inhabitants instead of nucleating and concentrating more people into a small, densely populated area.  This stands in marked contrast to the pattern evident in the Basin of Mexico, and constitutes one of the most dispersed, stable settlement patterns evident anywhere in Central Mexico.\nTo investigate some of the basic causal factors driving the settlement patterns, I use a simulation model to investigate maize productivity within the survey area.  I employ a model developed by the United States Department of Agriculture called the Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC).  EPIC uses soils, weather, and management input data to simulate the effect of soil and nutrient loss on agricultural productivity.  I develop two measures, initial and sustained productivity, to characterize the landscape in terms that would have been important to prehispanic farmers.  Initial productivity refers to the high yields farmers could have expected in the first few years of cultivation, before nutrient and soil loss from repeated cropping reduced soil fertility.  Sustained productivity refers to the amount of time a plot of land could be farmed before annual productivity decreased below the threshold necessary to sustain a farming household for one year.  \nAs I show in Chapter 7, the Tepeaca landscape is a very risky one from the perspective of a prehispanic subsistence farmer in terms of initial and sustained productivity because of marked interannual rainfall variability.  Even cultivating the best lands within the survey area, most households would have had to reduce the amount of maize in the diet in order to harvest enough maize to satisfy their immediate requirements and retain enough surplus for storage and consumption in lean years.  \nAs I discuss in Chapter 8, the riskiness of maize agriculture and the benefits of a supplementary source of calories other than maize such as maguey may have been major causal factors in producing the dispersed settlement patterns evident in the Tepeaca area.  If cultivated in the familiar infield/outfield configuration documented ethnographically in other parts of Mesoamerica, the inclusion of an infield with each constituent household within a community would have forced larger communities to grow in area as they grew in population size.  Although I do not have positive evidence for this practice in the Tepeaca area, this practice has been linked to highly dispersed settlement patterns elsewhere in Central Mexico, notably the Teotihuacan Valley.  In sum, the stability of the dispersed settlement patterns in the Tepeaca area in the face of regional political changes like the rise and decline of Teotihuacan, the political fragmentation and reorganization during the Epiclassic Period, and the advent of the Aztec Empire is best explained as the result of a very stable accommodation by prehispanic farming households to a risky agricultural landscape.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2686], "author_name_tesi": "Anderson, J.

While this decision to write in German as non-native authors of the language is in itself of interest, the reasons either author gave for their decision to write in German as opposed to their native languages inspired and shaped this dissertation. Both authors explained in various interviews that their debut novels could not have been written in their respective native languages of Arabic and Spanish. For Khider, writing in German allows him to build an emotional buffer between himself and the challenging events of his past; Barbetta described the language as a magic cloak, a Tarnkappe that allowed her to revisit the Buenos Aires of her memory, seemingly immune to its effects. The content of Khider\u2019s and Barbetta\u2019s first novels is strongly influenced by their respective experiences of dictatorship in Bagdad and Buenos Aires, experiences I have argued as traumatizing in this dissertation, in that they have a profound impact on the identity development of either author. After analyzing the intersections of Khider\u2019s and Barbetta\u2019s debut novels, I have concluded that traumatic experiences serve as both catalyzing as well as figurative influences in the writing process, both initiating and shaping the writing. The writing generated takes the form of a trauma narrative, a first-person account, marked by challenges to traditional boundaries between fantasy and reality and to time. Treating Khider\u2019s and Barbetta\u2019s novels as trauma narratives provides a context for understanding the capacity for writing to heal, or at the very least, address the symptoms of trauma. Whereas writing the narrative provides a framework for processing trauma, the process of writing in a foreign language, and writing in German as a foreign language in particular, provides perspective distance to the event, a venue for reinventing identity after trauma, and an avenue for healing play. My decision to compare and analyze Khider\u2019s and Barbetta\u2019s works in this dissertation was initially informed by student testimony in response to foreign language journal writing, by author interviews, and finally by the contextual factors that brought about this writing, including the controversial Chamisso Prize. In this dissertation, I bring together trauma research from the field of psychology and from literary theory to establish the contexts through which the catalyzing and formative influence of trauma on the text, the restorative capacity of the texts as trauma narratives, and finally the dynamic of foreign language acquisition in facilitating the writing and recovery processes became apparent.

Chapters on the Italian Renaissance and the Petrarchan sonnet describe important intellectual discourses and local debates into which notions of the renaissance and the sonnet were drawn during the early Republican period (1911-1930s).  Research on the New Rome and the Decameron analyzes how the figures of Dante, Boccaccio, and Risorgimento heroes were employed in competing models for modernity in the late Qing (1900-1911) and Communist periods (1949-). \n \nThese case studies verify the importance of borrowings from Italian culture in Chinese modernity.  More importantly, they contribute to a fuller understanding of China\u0081fs modern literary history.  In order to see Chinese modernity more clearly, it is imperative to look through the Italian lenses that Chinese intellectuals had once chosen to help perceive themselves as subjects in a modern world system.  This study demonstrates how Chinese writers articulated and elevated the regenerative power of the Renaissance, the patriotism of Dante Alighieri and Risorgimento heroes, the normalizing function of the Petrarchan sonnet, and the Decameron\u0081fs lessons in sexuality and nationalism, as integral parts of their projects for China\u0081fs cultural modernization.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3356], "author_name_tesi": "Anderson, Kyle David", "last_name_ssi": "Anderson", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexander C Y Huang", "Alexander C Y Huang", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt", "On Cho Ng", "Robert R Edwards"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexander C Y Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Alexander C Y Huang, Committee Chair", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt, Committee Member", "On Cho Ng, Committee Member", "Robert R Edwards, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cultural borrowing", "New Rome", "Liang Qichao", "Marco Polo", "Petrarch", "Boccaccio", "Dante", "Modernity", "Chinese Renaissance", "Jiao Naifang", "Decameron", "sonnet", "nationalism", "agency"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "\"Thousands of miles fresher\": Deconstructing the local in farm-to-school\n\n", "id": "11864", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3806", "abstract_tesi": "In the United States, opposition to the current food system has inspired several movements, including sustainability, community food security and reducing the loss of small family farms.

Emerging farm-to-school (FTS) programs, which connect \u201clocal\u201d farmers to nearby schools, are at the convergence of these issues. An important feature of the FTS program is that it represents the move to \u201cre-localize\u201d and create more sustainable, small-scale food systems that promote regional economies by buying local food for cafeterias while providing fresher, healthier meals for children. While these goals are significant to many FTS programs in the country, there is not a consensus on how to define \u201clocal\u201d and, thus, why buying local food is important for schools and farming economies. This thesis draws on empirical research from the Appalachian region of North Carolina to examine how key actors within FTS programs define local food, along with perceived benefits and barriers of buying local food for schools. It addresses the spatiality of food systems, including the reification of local as an alternative to the globalized food system. I argue that tensions exist in defining local, which reflects the nature of local as a flexible concept and a practice. This has implications for the realities of being able to buy locally and how these realities are challenged by the ways in which local is imagined within these programs.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3783], "author_name_tesi": "Anderson, Lauren Meredith", "last_name_ssi": "Anderson", "middle_name_ssi": "Meredith", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian King", "Brian King"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian King, Thesis Advisor", "Brian King, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["farm-to-school", "local food", "North Carolina"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Effective Text Communication During a Campus Crisis", "id": "13847lca5073", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13847", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research focuses on media, particularly text messages and social media, during campus crises in hopes to better understand and improve communication methods and validate information for emergency management (EM) departments.

The main objective was the development of the \u201cmolecular ruler\u201d process, which utilizes self-assembled multilayers as nanoscale resists for the definition of metal electrode structures with precise nanogap spacings in the 10-100 nm regime.  These self-assembled multilayers were composed of alternating, coordinated mercaptoalkanoic acid molecules and Cu (II) ions.\n\n  The molecular ruler process begins with a lithographically defined gold structure, henceforth called the \u201cparent\u201d.  Subsequently, the self-assembled multilayers are grown selectively on this parent structure to form a type of lift-off resist.  After metal deposition, this resist is removed chemically leaving behind only the newly created \u201cdaughter\u201d structure and the lithographic parent structure.  The width of the gap between the created daughter structure and the parent structure is measured out precisely by the tailored thickness of the multilayer resist.  Gaps of differing sizes between parent and daughter structures can be generated through changing both the number of molecular ruler layers deposited as well as by altering the length of the molecular ruler itself.  This process has been characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, and gap sizes have been demonstrated routinely in the 10-50 nm range.\n\n  The molecular ruler process has been extended to fabricate complex hierarchical architectures. Tertiary structures (granddaughters) have been created by depositing multilayers on the daughter structures as well as the parent structures.  Removing a sacrificial parent and/or daughter structure by selective chemical etching can isolate the tertiary structures.  Using reactive ion etching and the parent and daughter structures as an etch mask, nanogaps can be transferred into the underlying substrate to create precise recessed features.  The molecular ruler process has also been combined with nanosphere lithography to display the versatility of the molecular ruler resists around nonplanar edges. \n\n  Aligned microstructures with precisely defined nanometer-scale spacing and edge resolution were produced by combining multiple levels of photolithography with the molecular ruler process.  Photolithography was used to define the structures\u2019 orientations and self-assembled multilayer resists were used to tailor the structures\u2019 spacings precisely.  This work opens the door for future device fabrication by demonstrating the compatibility and robustness of hybrid strategies employing molecular rulers with conventional photolithographic fabrication processes.\n\n  The integrity of the nanoscale gaps produced by this hybrid technique has been investigated by electrical and structural characterization.  The primary failure mode that caused shorting in these structures was identified.  Methods for improved lithographic processing were developed and optimized to eliminate the identified failure mode and to create high quality structures.\n\n  Another important aspect of the hybrid strategies incorporating molecular rulers is that the lithographic resist must be robust enough to withstand the deposition of self-assembled multilayers without compromising their formation.  The use of a lithographic resist compatible with self-assembly has opened an avenue for directed chemical patterning of multi-component self-assembled films.  A major advantage of this technique is that the different components of the film are shielded by the resist against displacement and intercalation.  Additional benefits of this process over other unconventional methods for chemical patterning are the ability to have multiple levels of alignment, reproducible one-to-one feature size transfer, and parallel processing.\n\n  This thesis research has focused on addressing precision for the creation of nanostructures.  Self-assembly and lithographic processing have been used in tandem for the formation of tailored, lithographically defined metal electrodes.  Necessary for the development of hybrid strategies, the compatibility between the materials requirements for chemical self-assembly and conventional lithographic processing has been investigated and demonstrated.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4049], "author_name_tesi": "Anderson, Mary Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Anderson", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Mary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss", "Mark William Horn", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss, Committee Chair", "Mark William Horn, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanolithography", "self-assembled monolayers", "molecular rulers", "chemical patterning", "photolithography"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CONTROLLING THE ADSORPTION OF PROTEINS ON POLY(P-XYLYLENE) POLYMERIC THIN FILMS", "id": "10764", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4209", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In order to control the interactions of biomolecules and surfaces, first the adsorption of proteins to that surface must be controlled.

To this end, many ectotherms, including insects, have evolved the ability to invoke a behavioral fever; upon sensing an infection, the host will alter its thermoregulatory behavior to maintain a body temperature above its normal thermal optimum. This behavior imposes a sub-optimal thermal environment on the pathogen, and may enhance the efficiency of the host immune system, thereby reducing the virulence of the infection. However, the actions required to reach and maintain a higher body temperature can simultaneously impose significant fitness costs on the host. In the context of biological control, these dynamics can have major influences on the efficacy of a biopesticide. Using the house fly (Musca domestica L.), a major economic pest of intensive animal units, we explore the nature and consequences of behavioral fever to flies infected with entomopathogenic fungi.  We began by investigating how dose and growth kinetics of different isolates of entomopathogenic fungi impacted virulence to house flies. We found that virulence was positively correlated with dose, and that growth kinetics were qualitatively similar between isolates. The most virulent of these isolates, Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuillemin, was then used to examine the effects of fungal infection on the thermoregulatory behavior of house flies. Using thermal gradient assays, flies infected with B. bassiana were found to invoke a behavioral fever by remaining at higher temperatures than uninfected flies. We found that fevering benefitted infected flies by extending their survival and allowing them to lay more eggs, while simultaneously imposing costs in terms of reduced egg viability. To explore how house flies might limit the costs associated with fevering, we characterized the thermoregulatory behavioral fever of flies that were exposed to different doses of B. bassiana spores on free-choice thermal gradients. Infected flies were found to invoke a behavioral fever, the degree of which was positively correlated with dose. Moreover, both uninfected flies and cultures of B. bassiana were shown to suffer fitness costs when subjected to simulated fly fever temperatures. Lastly, we investigated the role of fungal infection and the resultant behavioral fever on the vector competence of house flies by measuring the frequency and bacterial loads in excreta collected from infected flies under both forced-fever and constant temperature conditions. Fungal infection was found to significantly decrease the frequency of fly excretion in the time before death, although fever delayed this reduction by one day. Fevered flies also showed a general increase in the levels of bacteria in their excreta over time, indicating that fever may serve to increase fly vector competence. These results add insight into the adaptive value of behavioral fever in insects and highlight how the efficacy of biological control agents can be mediated by environmental temperature and insect behavior.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5115], "author_name_tesi": "Anderson, Robert Derek ", "last_name_ssi": "Anderson", "middle_name_ssi": "Derek ", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Matthew Thomas", "Matthew Brian Thomas", "Andrew Fraser Read", "Kelli Hoover", "Edwin George Rajotte", "Gretchen Anna Kuldau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Matthew Thomas, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Brian Thomas, Committee Chair", "Andrew Fraser Read, Committee Member", "Kelli Hoover, Committee Member", "Edwin George Rajotte, Committee Member", "Gretchen Anna Kuldau, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Musca domestica", "Beauveria bassiana", "Metarhizium anisopliae", "behavioral fever", "thermoregulation", "fungal entomopathogens"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Acoustic Cavitation Localization in Reverberant Environments", "id": "16103", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8142", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cavitation detection and localization techniques generally require visual access to the fluid fi\feld, multiple high-speed cameras, and appropriate illumination to locate cavitation.

The ongoing interplay between data collection and data analysis enabled the further development and generation of categories for analysis.  \n\nThe findings were presented in three sections.  The first focused on the participants and their understandings of themselves as distance students; the second on their perception of interaction in their course and its effects on both cognitive and affective dimensions of their work; the third on control in interaction in terms of personal agency, control exercised by others, and the wider institutional, social and technological impacts.  \n\nI found that while an asynchronous computer mediated communication environment does afford the possibility of positive valued collaborative interaction for learning between students and faculty, and between students, that form of interaction between students is most likely to occur where students are interacting in an environment that enables the creation of hyperpersonal interaction (Walther, 1996). The asynchronous computer mediated communication environment affords lecturers greater possibility of control over the nature and content of student messages, but students also tailor their own involvement in interaction to minimize the impact of the lecturer\u2019s gaze, to maximize the benefit they gain for learning and to reduce the distraction of messages that might confuse or obfuscate that learning.  \n\nI also argue that as full time distance students, participants are more likely to engage in interaction with their peers than part-time distance students because of their relative isolation from other support networks, and thus they are drawn to form a community of learners that provides valuable affective support. Finally, the data indicate that use of a single technology places limits on the interaction possibilities available to students who act to extend the range of interaction capabilities supporting their education.  The process of the research is discussed and limitations of the study are noted. Finally I provide recommendations for further research.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6506], "author_name_tesi": "Anderson, William George", "last_name_ssi": "Anderson", "middle_name_ssi": "George", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Grahame Moore", "Gary Kuhne", "Steve L Thorne", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Grahame Moore, Committee Chair", "Gary Kuhne, Committee Member", "Steve L Thorne, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["asynchronous", "control", "computer-medicated communication", "interaction", "distance education", "higher education", "teacher edcuation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Statistical Examination of Tornado Report and Warning Near-Storm Environments", "id": "14307aka145", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14307", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study makes use of a 13-year dataset of 14,814 tornado events and 44,961 tornado warnings in the continental United States, along with near-storm environmental data associated with each of these tornado events and warnings, to build a methodology that can be used to create nuanced climatologies of near-storm environmental data. Two key parameter spaces are identified as being particularly useful in this endeavor: mixed-layer convective available potential energy (MLCAPE) versus 0--6-km vector shear magnitude (SHR6) and mixed-layer lifting condensation level (MLLCL) versus 0--1-km storm-relative helicity (SRH1). In addition, the Significant Tornado Parameter (STP) is identified as a useful composite parameter that can highlight near-storm environments that are particularly favorable for the development of significant tornadoes. Two particular statistical methods for the analysis and characterization of near-storm environments are described and applied: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), which is applied to bulk (proximity sounding-like) parameter values associated with each event or warning, and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), which are applied to fully two-dimensional plots of STP in an area surrounding each event or warning.\n\nThe KDE approach characterizes and identifies differences in the environments of tornadoes forming in quasi-linear convective systems versus those forming in right-moving supercells; specific environmental traits are also identified for different geographical regions, seasons, and times of day. Tornado warning performance is found to be best in environments with particularly large values of MLCAPE and SHR6. The early evening transition (EET) period is of particular interest: MLCAPE and MLLCL heights are in the process of falling, and SHR6 and SRH1 are in the process of increasing. Accordingly, tornadoes rated 2 or greater on the enhanced Fujita scale (EF2+) are also most common during the EET, probability of detection (POD) is relatively high, and false-alarm ratio (FAR) is relatively low. Overall, when comparing the distribution of environments for events versus those for warnings, there is no \"smoking gun\" indicating a systematic problem with forecasting that explains the high overall false-alarm ratio, which instead seems to stem from the inability to know which storms in a given environment will be tornadic.\n\nThe SOM approach establishes nine statistically distinct clusters of spatial distributions of STP values in the 480 km x 480 km region surrounding each tornado event or warning. For tornado events, distinct patterns are associated more with particular times of day, geographical locations, and times of year, and the use of two-dimensional data rather than point proximity sounding information means that these patterns can be identified and characterized with still more detail; for instance, the archetypal springtime dryline environment in the Great Plains emerges readily from the data. Although high values of STP tend to be associated with relatively high POD and relatively low FAR, the majority of tornado events occur within a pattern of low STP, with relatively high FAR and low POD. The two-dimensional plots produced by the SOM approach provide an intuitive way to create distinct climatologies of tornadic near-storm environments.\n\nHaving established a methodology through the use of KDE and SOM, this research then examines the topic of tornado outbreaks [defined as ten or more (E)F1+ tornadoes that occur with no more than 6 h or 2,000 km between subsequent tornadoes]. Outbreak tornadoes in a given geographical region have greater SRH1 and SHR6 than isolated tornadoes in the same region, and also have considerably higher POD than isolated tornadoes. When SOMs are created for all (E)F1+ tornadoes, the percentage of outbreak tornadoes in a given node is found to depend more strongly on the magnitude of the STP surrounding the tornado than its orientation. For the SOM of outbreak tornadoes, outbreaks occurring in environments with higher magnitudes of STP will generally also have the highest casualty rates, regardless of the specific two-dimensional pattern of STP. Two specific tornado outbreaks are then examined through this methodology, which allows the events to be placed into their climatological context with more nuance than typical proximity sounding-based approaches would allow.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14894], "author_name_tesi": "Anderson-Frey, Alexandra Kate", "last_name_ssi": "Anderson-Frey", "middle_name_ssi": "Kate", "first_name_ssi": "Alexandra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yvette Pamela Richardson", "Yvette Pamela Richardson", "Paul Markowski", "David Jonathan Stensrud", "Andrew Mark Carleton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yvette Pamela Richardson, Dissertation Advisor", "Yvette Pamela Richardson, Committee Chair", "Paul Markowski, Committee Member", "David Jonathan Stensrud, Committee Member", "Andrew Mark Carleton, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tornado", "quasi-linear convective system", "supercell", "convection", "forecasting", "self-organizing maps", "kernel density estimation", "near-storm environment"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Mechanical Properties of Particle Systems Using a Molecular Dynamics Approach Inspired by Continuum Homogenization", "id": "6589", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4860", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The topic of this dissertation is the study of the mechanical properties of solid material systems at the nanoscale.  At such length scales, materials can be viewed as particle systems, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations help one understand their behavior as well as quantify their properties.  However, mechanical concepts such as strain, stress and moduli were originally developed in continuum models, which are typically applied in space scales that range from the microscopic to the macroscopic.  For this reason, a careful translation of ideas from continuum scales to the nanoscale is necessary.\n\nIn essence, this thesis reviews and refines the continuum notions of average mechanical properties, such as stress and strain, and the meaning of such notions when MD is used to compute them.  A Lagrangian-based approach is utilized for the purpose of determining the stress-deformation behavior of continua as well as of particle systems.  At the continuum level, the mentioned Lagrangian-based approach is applied within homogenization theory for developing a nonlinear continuum homogenization model, which includes a novel constitutive relation for the stress.  At the nanoscale, an MD method is presented as the extension of the continuum homogenization model.  This MD method is able to simulate the behavior of particle systems under a given type of deformation as well as to generate stress-strain curves.  In the process of developing the MD method, some concepts and techniques commonly used in MD, such as the virial stress and the Parrinello-Rahman method, are clarified.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4837], "author_name_tesi": "Andia, Pedro C.", "last_name_ssi": "Andia", "middle_name_ssi": "C.", "first_name_ssi": "Pedro", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Francesco Costanzo", "Gary L Gray", "Lawrence H Friedman", "Russell Messier", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Francesco Costanzo, Committee Chair", "Gary L Gray, Committee Chair", "Lawrence H Friedman, Committee Member", "Russell Messier, Committee Member", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multi-scale materials modeling", "molecular dynamics", "continuum mechanics", "homogenization theory", "effective stress", "effective strain"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "STUDY OF MITIGATION OF TURBINE BLADE TIP LEAKAGE FLOWS  USING TIP LEAKAGE INTERRUPTER", "id": "14469vka5038", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "14469", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The gap between the turbine rotor blade tip and turbine casing surface is essential to prevent rubbing of these two components. Due to presence of this gap, the differential pressure across the blade tip drives fluid flow from pressure side to suction side of the blade tip. This fluid flow is called tip leakage flow and is an important sources of multidisciplinary problems. The aerodynamic losses due to tip leakage flows in a turbine blade accounts for about one third of the overall aerodynamic loss of a present day turbine stage. The tip leakage fluid in general do not go through a significant expansion and work generation process. The solid surfaces in the tip area encounter the fluid areas with the highest absolute total temperature existing in the rotor frame of reference. The tip leakage flows also increase the thermal stresses, induce further thermal oxidation on the blade tip surfaces and on the casing surface. In addition, they may cause significant structural problems and also induce unsteadiness in the turbine flow field. Hence understanding of these tip leakage flows and reducing them are of outmost importance for improving energy efficiency, lifetime and reliability of any future turbine design.\nThe current study uses Tip Leakage Interrupters (TLI) to mitigate some of the adverse effects of the tip leakage flows and improve the efficiency of the turbine stage.  The TLI introduced in this study has the ability to alter the tip region flows on the airfoil surfaces. They operate by inducing controlled vortical structures originating from strategically shaped/oriented multiple and sub-miniature vortex generators. The TLIs in this investigation were attached on the suction side of the rotating blade tip sections in the Axial Flow Turbine Research Facility (AFTRF). The AFTRF is a high-pressure, single- stage cold-flow turbine with a 29 bladed rotor at the Department of Aerospace Engineering in the Penn State University. Three different experimental studies were completed on the TLI in which three different parameters such as the mounting location of TLI on the airfoil tip region, the number of TLIs mounted on the blade and the specific orientation of TLI were varied. The influence of the TLI on the leakage flow system was experimentally observed and interpreted using turbine exit total pressure maps obtained with very high spatial resolution. The time accurate and phase-locked total pressure data from the downstream of the modified turbine blade was collected by a high-time-response total pressure probe using a (100 KHz) dynamic pressure sensor. High resolution total pressure maps in a just downstream location of the AFTRF rotor provided detailed scans of the turbine exit field for further interpretations of flow field physics resulting from tip region flows and TLI induced flow systems. The current span-wise measurement resolution is about one percent of the blade span of 123 mm. The system generates 6000 equally spaced measurement points along one revolution of the rotor at a selected span-wise position. A phase-locked measurement system fills the 6000 bins during each revolution of the turbine rotor using a mil-spec optical shaft encoder with high encoding resolution.  Each measurement bin occupies a 0.06 degrees in the circumferential direction. The system can collect about 206 data point along one blade pitch in one of the 29 rotor passages.\nThe results obtained from these experiments was used to draw conclusion about the effectiveness of TLIs in reducing the tip leakage flows in the turbine tip region flow field. The ultimate goal of the TLI installations is to increase the total-to-total efficiency of axial flow turbines via the suppression or mitigation of individual tip vortices from each rotor blade.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15250], "author_name_tesi": "Andichamy, Veerandra Chakkarava", "last_name_ssi": "Andichamy", "middle_name_ssi": "Chakkarava", "first_name_ssi": "Veerandra", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Turbine blade tip", "Tip leakage flows", "leakage vortex", "Leakage vortex mitigation", "turbine blade tip design", "blade tip modification"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Cultural Dimensions of Foreign Language Learning: A Sociocultural Perspective", "id": "6479", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2226", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is an empirical research documenting the development of a reflective approach to language and culture by four American undergraduate students enrolled in a third semester French class. Commonly, culture has been conceived as a knowledge that can be acquired and distinctly separate from the language itself.  However, current approaches have moved away from culture teaching as pre-established fact to a more dynamic model based on a dialogic process in which students have a reflective engagement.  The objective is to teach language as culture and develop the students\u2019 abilities to think analytically and critically about another culture as well as their own culture (s).  \n\nDrawing from the theoretical paradigms of sociocultural theory, this research adopts a genetic approach to reflect the inquiry process that is language and culture learning.  In line with activity theory, the study investigates the activity of learning as grounded in a social, historical and cultural context. It explores the contributions the learners bring to their own learning, highlighting the unique profile of each learning process.  It examines the students\u2019 agency and considers the culture learning as a personal growth. \n\nThe research is descriptive and qualitative in nature, focusing on the participants\u2019 perspectives.  The outcomes derive from the analysis of a variety of sources of data with an emphasis on the development of cultural awareness.  Relying on four case studies, I tell the stories of Julie, Mary, Lucy, and David\u2019s development.\n\nThe study is significant in various aspects.  First, unlike research in second language acquisition, this study is concerned with language use and the sociocultural dimensions of language learning.  In addition, the study considers the language learner as a social being with agency. Thus, it illustrates the contributions students bring to their learning experience and explores the participants\u2019 personal growth.  Second, the study is an inquiry that explores, describes and understands the complex cultural dimensions of foreign language learning.  Finally, the cross-cultural dialogue that exists in the class as well as the inquiry process that has taken place brings interesting research and pedagogical implications. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2207], "author_name_tesi": "Andrawiss, Helene ", "last_name_ssi": "Andrawiss", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Helene", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Celeste S Kinginger", "Jeannette Danielle Bragger", "James Lantolf", "Meredith Christine Doran", "Steve L Thorne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Chair", "Jeannette Danielle Bragger, Committee Member", "James Lantolf, Committee Member", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Member", "Steve L Thorne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Crosscultural learning", "Foreign language learning", "French", "Sociocultural Theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CHARGE PASSAGE AND pH REACTION-DIFFUSION DYNAMICS OF IRIDIUM-OXIDE-COATED STIMULATION ELECTRODES\n", "id": "11210", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1460", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Electrical stimulation in the brain is commonly used to interact with neural activity.

Charge-passing dynamics are mediated by surface reactions in the iridium oxide, chemical diffusion, electric flux, and chemical reactions in the surrounding environment. We use a novel pH-sensitive fluorescent imaging method to observe charge-passage under the hypothesis that hydrogen is a byproduct of the electrochemical surface reactions. We have developed a computational model of the reaction-diffusion dynamics using the Nernst-Planck and Butler-Volmer equations.\nUsing experiments and computational simulations we have proved that electrical stimulation causes two separate hydrogen and hydroxide producing reactions in the iridium oxide coating. We have shown that increasing current amplitude or decreasing frequency of stimulation increases the amplitude and propagation distance of pH waves. Increasing frequency also increases the propagation rate of pH waves. We have also established that the initial phase of a waveform drastically influences the overall pH dynamics that it creates. Furthermore, we have discriminated between electric field and diffusion effects, and have shown the influence of chemical reactions in the bulk. These findings contribute to a greater understanding of neural stimulating electrodes, which ultimately will improve their performance and thus improve clinical treatments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1446], "author_name_tesi": "Andre, Dana Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Andre", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Dana", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Gluckman", "Bruce Gluckman", "Corina Stefania Drapaca"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Gluckman, Thesis Advisor", "Bruce Gluckman, Thesis Advisor", "Corina Stefania Drapaca, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluorescent imaging", "brain", "pH", "iridium oxide", "Electrical stimulation", "electrode", "electric field", "diffusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Synthesis and Characterization of Zn1-xmnxse and Bi2se3 Nanowires and Nanoribbons", "id": "16357", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8108", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One-dimensional nanoscale semiconductors combined with the extra degree of freedom provided by electron spin show great promise for use in novel spintronic devices.

A survey and case study were utilized in this mixed methods research approach to explore teaming\u2019s impact on exemplary middle schools.

This phenomenon has profound negative implications for the physical and psychological well being of today\u2019s youth. Residential environmental education provides one avenue to connect children to nature. One purpose of this study was to investigate the role of Outdoor School, a residential environmental education program, on ecological knowledge, children\u2019s connection to nature, school belonging, outdoor play attitude, environmental stewardship attitude, outdoor play behavior, and environmental stewardship behavior, as reported by participants. \n\nA quasi-experimental research design was utilized in the study. A total of 228 fifth grade students (156 treatment, 72 control) from central Pennsylvania participated. The results of the program evaluation indicated that Outdoor School was successful in achieving significant, positive gains in the areas of ecological knowledge, connection to nature, outdoor play behavior, and environmental stewardship behavior. No change was found from pretest to post-test in outdoor play attitudes, environmental stewardship attitudes, and school belonging.\n \nAdditionally, the study addressed gaps in the literature regarding the relationship between connection to nature, environmental stewardship, and outdoor play using two different approaches. An adaptation of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used to predict outdoor play behavior in children. In this model, favorable attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control lead to intentions to perform a given behavior. Intention to perform the behavior is the best predictor for behavior performance. For this study, participants\u2019 feeling of connection to nature was added as an affective independent variable. This model explained 45% of the variance in outdoor play. The hypothesis that a connection to nature would be a significant predictor of both attitudes toward outdoor play was supported by testing of the model.\n  \nFinally, nature connection was tested as a full mediator of the relationship between outdoor play and environmental stewardship. There is support for the idea that direct experience in the outdoors facilitates environmental behaviors, but more research is needed to understand this relationship. Testing of the model failed to demonstrate that nature connection fully mediated the relationship between outdoor play and environmental stewardship; however, a feeling of connectedness to nature augmented the influence that outdoor play behavior exerts on environmental stewardship behavior.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5151], "author_name_tesi": "Andrejewski, Robert G", "last_name_ssi": "Andrejewski", "middle_name_ssi": "G", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation and Parks", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Justin Mowen", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Rama B Radhakrishna", "George Richard Vahoviak"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Justin Mowen, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Justin Mowen, Committee Chair", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Member", "Rama B Radhakrishna, Committee Member", "George Richard Vahoviak, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nature Connection", "Outdoor Play", "Residential Environmental Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Coupling Dissolved Organic Carbon and Hydropedology in the Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory", "id": "11350", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1480", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "During the last three decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

The overall objective of this dissertation was to use DOC to couple hydropedology (integration of pedology and hydrology to better understand soil-water interactions at multiple scales) and biogeochemistry in an attempt to understand the factors that control DOC at different spatiotemporal scales at the Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (CZO).\nSpecifically, a field scale research project was initiated to: (1) investigate the impact of combined soil and landscape features on the spatial variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and soil pore water DOC concentration, (2) evaluate the influence of precipitation, discharge, and temperature on stream water DOC concentration and export, (3) investigate how soil and landscape features combined influence C and nitrogen (N) concentrations along two contrasting hillslopes (swale versus planar hillslopes), (4) assess the importance of DOC and pH in controlling metal concentrations, and (5) examine soil redox potential (Eh) dynamics along two transects (hillslope and valley floor) using automated and continuous (10-minute interval) monitoring.\nResults showed that in the two north-facing slopes investigated, average soil pore water DOC concentrations were noticeably higher along the swale (range: 5 \u2013 25 mg/L) as compared to the planar hillslope (range: 5 \u2013 15 mg/L). Elevated soil pore water DOC at the soil-bedrock interface at the ridgetop and at the Bw-Bt horizon interface at the valley floor are consistent with transport-driven \u201chot spots\u201d (solute concentrations are >20 % than in surrounding areas) of soil pore water DOC at these restrictive interfaces. Swales appeared to be hot spots for C storage and DOC export. Clay content was the single best predictor of SOC storage, explaining > 70 % of SOC storage variability within the catchment. Stream water DOC (range: 0.6 \u2013 28.6 mg/L) was significantly correlated to stream discharge and water temperature, reflecting combined controls of flushing (linked to discharge) and biological activity (related to temperature). Transport-driven \u201chot moments\u201d (short periods during which solute concentrations are significantly greater than that during the intervening time) of stream water DOC were observed during the periods of snowmelt and late summer/early fall wet-up, which contributed to ~55% of DOC exported. \nResults for objective (3) showed that along both hillslopes, SOC (0.1 to 3.0 %) and TN (0.1 to 0.2 %) exponentially decreased with increasing soil depth, with a 60 % decrease across the A - B soil horizon interface. Soil pore water DOC also exponentially decreased with soil depth for both hillslopes, while nitrate (NO3\u2013, range of 0.01 to 8.7 mg/L) did not show an obvious exponential decrease within the soil profile. Soil pore water DOC (but not NO3-) concentrations were significantly correlated to soil pore water pH, SOC, soil TN, C:N ratio. However, soil pore water concentrations of DOC and NO3- were consistently elevated at restrictive soil horizon interfaces. Elevated concentrations of stream water DOC and NO3- (range of 0.0 to 2.4 mg/L) during snowmelt and rainfall events during the early fall period are consistent with flushing of shallow soil pore waters (high concentrations) to the stream during those times. \nThis study also found that soil pore water concentrations of DOC, and total Al (range of 0.01 \u2013 0.72 mg/L), Fe (range of 0.01 \u2013 3.86 mg/L), and Mn (range of 0.01 \u2013 10.49 mg/L) generally decreased with increasing soil depth, while pH slightly increased with depth. This depth distribution was especially evident in the swale where soils are much thicker and thus an exponential decline with depth was observed. Regardless of landscape position and soil depth, the variability in soil pore water metal concentrations was best predicted by the combined effect of soil pore water DOC and pH (R2 = 0.76). Stream water DOC and total metal concentrations (Al: range of 0.01 \u2013 0.15 mg/L, Fe: range of 0.01 \u2013 5.99 mg/L, and Mn: range of 0.01 \u2013 3.79 mg/L) were synchronized in this catchment during the late summer/early fall wet up period such that elevated stream water concentrations of both DOC and metals (especially Fe and Mn) were observed. These results are consistent with DOC and metals being strongly correlated in this acidic forested ecosystem. Moreover, results are consistent with the inference that DOC will significantly facilitate metal transport in catchments impacted by acid deposition. \nFurthermore, the 6- months monitoring of soil Eh showed a range of -240 to +750 mV from April to October 2010. A combination of landscape position, soil depth, and season explained 72% of soil Eh variability within the catchment. Soil Eh varied with topographic position where the ridgetop site was strongly oxidized (> 400 mV), while the valley floor was in general moderately to strongly reduced (< 200 mV). Differences in soil Eh at each landscape position reflected variability due to seasonal differences in soil moisture, soil temperature, and water table levels, which combined, explained 20 to 90 % of soil Eh variation. This study demonstrated that spatiotemporal variation in soil Eh in upland forested ecosystems is best interpreted in conjunction with landscape position, soil depth, and seasonal differences in soil temperature, soil moisture, and water table level, rather than water table levels only as observed in wet/anaerobic environments.  \nThe overall findings of this dissertation demonstrated that explicit consideration of both soil physiochemical properties and hydrological characteristics can elucidate the main factors that are consistently correlated to DOC spatiotemporal patterns. Results provided a better link between hillslope soil pore water DOC and stream water DOC. Preferential flow pathways along restrictive soil horizon interfaces are associated with elevated soil pore water concentrations which is likely the major contributor to the elevated stream water concentrations during snowmelt and the late summer/early fall wet-up period, as groundwater and rainfall concentrations are very low.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1465], "author_name_tesi": "Andrews, Danielle Monica", "last_name_ssi": "Andrews", "middle_name_ssi": "Monica", "first_name_ssi": "Danielle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry Lin", "Henry Lin", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Dr Kamini Singha", "Dr Michael Gooseff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry Lin, Dissertation Advisor", "Henry Lin, Committee Chair", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member", "Dr Kamini Singha, Committee Member", "Dr Michael Gooseff, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dissolved organic carbon", "hydropedology", "biogeochemistry", "critical zone observatory", "hillslopes", "soils", "solute transport", "soil redox potential"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Unum et Pluribus: Walt Whitman's Philosophy of Democracy", "id": "27398", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11949", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "At the heart of the American experience is a twin ideology\u2014strong nationalism and strong individualism. Walt Whitman, an ardent devotee of both, may be taken as a representative American ideologue. From that position, he is susceptible to, but also levels his own ideology critique. In so doing, Whitman illustrates a new sort of critique, not by hegemonic wrangling or deconstruction of the One on behalf of the many, but by an ongoing effort to reconstruct our ideal nation more in keeping with the national motto, \u201cfrom many, One.\u201d Close readers will discern in Democratic Vistas and other of his works a Whitman who is capable of both assimilating differences toward his ideal One, and accommodating differences on behalf of every individual in celebration of the many. As a matter of language, he anticipates Kenneth Burke\u2019s terminological politics of inclusion (merger) as an alternative to the politics of exclusion (division). Conceiving of the term \u201cthe People\u201d in such varied modalities means that as Whitman reconstructs the relationships which make up the American experience\u2014he reconstructs, as part of his larger philosophical project, its dynamic social ontology. \nCharacterizing in detail the body politic (not to mention his own body and his body of work), Whitman offers a terminology that recommends new relationships for the People. Whitman argues\u2014contra many sociological thinkers\u2014on behalf of, and in so doing He recommends an organic (part-whole) view toward people of each and every conceivable class (species-genus). To borrow a contemporary term from biology, each entity is a \u201cmicrobiome,\u201d a hybrid of organicism and atomism that avoids the potential dangers of both worldviews taken singly. Whitman then applies his \u201cmicrobiomic\u201d treatment to the individual, thereby developing in full an original axiology, Personalism. Not a single, overarching morality, in this ethic each individual is a synecdochic representation for the nation (if not the universe), and the way he or she should approach any other is as the same. If \u201ceach and all\u201d were taken as divine in their own right, our critical disagreements would surely defer to \u201ccomradeship,\u201d \u201cadhesiveness,\u201d or love. Democratic Vistas teaches us that when Whitman thinks of himself as \u201cuniversal,\u201d as a \u201cKosmos,\u201d \u201cenfolding\u201d all, he intends that each American eclectically do the same.

The three studies in this dissertation investigated the application of the Five Cs PYD framework (Caring, Character, Competence, Confidence, and Connections) beyond the United States, specifically among ethnically diverse youth in urban Malaysia. Participants were 1,470 adolescents in early secondary school between ages 13 and 14. In Chapter 1, results from structural equation modeling showed that a five-factor measurement structure corresponding to the Five Cs had a significantly better fit than a uni-dimensional or two-level factor structure, and was invariant across boys and girls. Gender differences were observed in several positive dimensions, as girls reported higher Caring, Character and Connections, and boys higher Confidence. \n\nIn Chapter 2, the relationship between the Five Cs and youth positive functioning (prosocial Contribution), and substance use were examined. Four Cs were significantly and positively associated with Contribution, explaining 18% of its variance. Only Connections was significantly and negatively associated with cigarette and alcohol use, after controlling for gender and SES. Together, the Five Cs explained 3% to 4% of the variance in cigarette and alcohol use.  \n\nChapter 3 describes an exploratory qualitative study to examine how the Five Cs are conceptualized, and to identify culture-specific positive traits in this Asian context. Fifteen youth professionals (i.e. teachers, lecturers, counselors, community professionals) were interviewed. Using qualitative content analysis, informants\u2019 ideas and examples of positive traits were analyzed and categorized into higher-order themes. In general, themes identified for Caring, Character, Competence, Confidence, and Connections transcended culture. Several themes more culturally specific to Asia include being courteous, peaceful, responsible in social roles (themes under Character), and language proficiency (Competence). Spiritual values and practice was also considered important to complement the Five Cs framework. \n\nTogether, these studies support the relevance of the Five Cs framework beyond the United States, particularly in Malaysia. Findings can inform future PYD measurement research in this region, and intervention efforts aimed at promoting positive functioning; toward furthering the study of positive indicators and the promotion of human flourishing.   \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4367], "author_name_tesi": "Ang, Mei-Mei ", "last_name_ssi": "Ang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mei-Mei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["J Douglas Coatsworth", "J Douglas Coatsworth", "Edward A Smith", "Eric Loken", "Jennifer Lianne Maggs", "Karen Linn Bierman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["J Douglas Coatsworth, Dissertation Advisor", "J Douglas Coatsworth, Committee Chair", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member", "Eric Loken, Committee Member", "Jennifer Lianne Maggs, Committee Member", "Karen Linn Bierman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["prosocial behavior", "adolescent psychology", "positive development", "Asian culture", "measurement", "substance use"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE SOUND OF SILENCE:\nSACRED PLACE IN BYZANTINE AND POST-BYZANTINE DEVOTIONAL ART\n\n\n", "id": "12169", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6416", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study explores the representation of holy places in devotional images from the early Christian era to the post-Byzantine period. I delineate five phases of this development. The first phase (300s-500s) was connected to the rise of Christian sacred sites. Christian ideas about sacredness of locations built upon the Greek and Roman cults, and the Jewish religion but reflected Christianity\u2019s own practices. Despite the variety of Christian holy places, only biblical sites appeared in religious images. This tendency changed in the post-Iconoclastic period. After the 900s, non-biblical sacred places gradually populated icons. All of these were monastic. The roots of this iconographic development must be sought in the standardization of the representation of saints. The Menologion of Basil II (976-1025) exemplifies the first systematic association of saints with specific locations. In this illuminated church calendar the eremitic desert or a cityscape suggests a saint\u2019s occupation. The manuscript provided an important source to iconographers of devotional images that showed non-biblical holy places in the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries. These places\u2014the church of the Miracle at Chonae and the eremitic desert of the Koimesis of St. Ephrem\u2014specifically acclaimed ascetic virtues and praxis. The next step towards the representation of non-biblical sacred sites came in the early 1300s with the icon of the Virgin from the Zo&#333;dochos P&#275;g&#275; monastery in Constantinople. This new image bound devotion to a miracle-working spring in the Byzantine capital, yet it became popular in the neighboring countries. My study examines the reasons for this popularity through the decorative program of Archangel Michael at Lesnovo (1349). I argue that the Virgin Zo&#333;dochos P&#275;g&#275; effectively evoked Byzantine imperial power, and Christian doctrine and thus served the Serbian ruling class to legitimate its patriarchal church. The advertising potential of icons of places was fully appreciated in the post-Byzantine period. At this time icons expanded the holy sites conferring sacredness to ordinary monasteries. A case study of the Rila monastery paper icons attributes the wide distribution of these icons to the printing medium, and to the economic and political circumstances of Ottoman rule.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6417], "author_name_tesi": "Anguelova, Vessela Nikolova", "last_name_ssi": "Anguelova", "middle_name_ssi": "Nikolova", "first_name_ssi": "Vessela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Cutler", "Anthony Cutler", "Elizabeth Bradford Smith", "Brian A Curran", "Garrett Fagan", "Annemarie Weyl Carr"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Cutler, Dissertation Advisor", "Anthony Cutler, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Bradford Smith, Committee Member", "Brian A Curran, Committee Member", "Garrett Fagan, Committee Member", "Annemarie Weyl Carr, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["paper icons", "Byzantine art", "icons", "post-Byzantine", "devotional art"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Hybrid Semi-mechanistic Well Performance Modeling and Prediction ", "id": "21869", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9424", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A well performance prediction method is developed with the advantage of increased time efficiency relative to reservoir simulation in single well reserves assessment and hydraulic fracture design optimization. Mechanistic limitations of decline curve analysis are also overcome.\n\nA theory of internal decline resistance is proposed and coupled with the concept of loss ratio linearity to characterize the decline exponent based on the physics of production decline. Components of internal decline resistance are identified as transient contacted volume and dynamic decompression effects which together justify a hyperbolic time dependent decline exponent model. As the arising differential equation cannot be solved in terms of elementary functions, parametric equivalence and direct substitution are used to arrive at a reduced order production decline model rooted in the Gaussian hypergeometric functional class \u2013 hypergeometric production decline (HG) model. Representative validation of the HG model is performed using simulated production data from simple to complex single well reservoir models. The condition necessary for hypergeometric production decline is also identified.\n Rate transient identities are developed from analytical solutions and coupled with a customized multi-variable non-linear regressional optimization algorithm. The result is a mechanistic model calibration framework within which the GHG model parameters are given as functions of reservoir system properties. In the generalized case of radial flow, the quadratic tendency of the loss ratio in transient flow justifies a linear time dependent decline exponent model. This linear decline exponent model is combined with the hyperbolic decline exponent model resulting in a quasi-hyperbolic decline exponent and the generalized hypergeometric production decline (GHG) model. The GHG production decline model coupled with the mechanistic model calibration framework constitute a reduced order well performance prediction method \u2013 the GHG method.

Pallets may be made of wood, plastic or corrugated paper. There are over 2 billion pallets currently in circulation within the United States, with a majority of it being wood (NWPCA, 2010). The market share of plastic pallets is on the rise. Thus the carbon footprint produced by the pallets is a critical factor. Plastic incurs larger carbon footprint owing to its production methods and raw materials used. Wooden pallets are however prone to pest infestation and require to be treated. Heat treatment and Methyl Bromide fumigation are the two currently approved treating methods used to kill pests in wooden packaging materials (WPM\u2019s). With rise in global trade, the use of these treatment methods has also increased. Methyl Bromide is a Class I ozone-depleting substance and affects the atmosphere adversely.

In addition to the source parameters, it is also necessary to back-calculate meteorological forcing parameters because they govern the subsequent transport of a contaminant.  One aspect that has not been addressed previously is ascertaining the height of the atmospheric boundary layer.  The capping inversion at the top of the boundary layer traps the puff by reflecting contaminants back towards the surface, directly impacting surface concentrations.  Because the depth of the atmospheric boundary layer varies with time of day, stability, and the horizontal and vertical wind, it is generally difficult to determine.

Each framework has its advantages and disadvantages.  An advantage of the Eulerian or field framework is that the governing variables are space filling, and describe the entire concentration and velocity field.  Thus, the evolution of these variables are governed by a coupled system of partial differential equations and an equation of state.  Although these equations in their full form can be solved only by numerical approximation, describing flow field evolution by a set of equations allows one to grasp how forces change flow field properties at specific points.  The Lagrangian framework, in contrast, concentrates on entity state evolution where the superposition of such entities describes the concentration field.  An advantage of the Lagrangian framework is that under certain circumstances, both the evolution of the flow and the concentration field can be described by a system of ordinary or partial differential equations that determine entity state evolution.  These equations can be simpler than the Eulerian counterpart.  This is illustrated in the thesis for both forward and inverse atmospheric transport and dispersion modeling.  Specifically, a Lagrangian source term estimation algorithm is developed to determine the source location of a contaminant.

Recent attempts at integrating these various viewpoints of narcissism have led to the proposal of a single dimension on which pathological and normal variants of narcissism co-exist.  However, this construction of narcissism assumes adaptive and maladaptive typologies are categorical in that they represent only a portion of this proposed narcissism continuum.  The current study proposes an alternative two dimensional model of narcissism consisting of adaptive and maladaptive narcissism dimensions.  In order to determine the structure of the narcissism construct, 982 participants completed a variety of personality self-report measures related to narcissism, self-esteem, dependency, shame, empathy, and personality organization.  Principal components analysis confirmed previous findings that identified grandiose and vulnerable components across narcissism measures.  Items were submitted for multidimensional scaling analysis to clarify questions regarding the structure of the two components and the congruence of the proposed model with item content.  Results suggest that the best balance between descriptive parsimony and complexity is a two dimensional structure of narcissism consisting of adaptive and maladaptive dimensions which are theoretically congruent and consistent across analyses.  The adaptive expressions of narcissism dimension ranges from confident self-esteem to hypersensitivity and dependency. The maladaptive expressions of narcissism dimension ranges from empathic understanding to aggression, entitlement, and exploitation.  Overall, these results assert that the structure of narcissism requires two key elements to adequately describe the construct: 1) a dimensional approach to the spectrum of healthy and pathological narcissism, and 2) adaptive and maladaptive expressions of narcissism as separate and orthogonal dimensions integrated into a parsimonious but structurally meaningful space.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1706], "author_name_tesi": "Ansell, Emily B", "last_name_ssi": "Ansell", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aaron Lee Pincus", "Craig S Edelbrock", "Elizabeth C Pinel", "William Ray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aaron Lee Pincus, Committee Chair", "Craig S Edelbrock, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Pinel, Committee Member", "William Ray, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["narcissism", "personality", "multidimensional scaling"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Reliable Extraction of Text from Video\n", "id": "5864", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5637", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The detection and extraction of scene and caption text from\nunconstrained, general-purpose video is an important research problem\nin the context of content-based retrieval and summarization of visual\ninformation.

There are however, individual differences in sweet taste perception that are often overlooked in studies that investigate the intensity perception and hedonics of sweet taste. The objective of this thesis is to investigate human sweet taste perception through psychophysical and physiological responses to sweet stimuli. The present work includes a discussion of the issues concerning the measurement of human physiological and psychophysical responses to sweet taste including methodological inconsistencies, individual differences, and genetic variability. This thesis takes a modern approach to investigating sweet taste perception by using contemporary psychophysical scaling methods. Major experimental findings include: Study 1: Sucrose did not increase cold pain tolerance or threshold times in adult males even when controlling for hand temperature and hunger state. These results agree with reports that sucrose analgesia is an age dependent phenomenon. Study 2: Unlike previous reports, sucrose was found to have a sigmoidal dose- response function. Notably, most non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) elicited a lower maximal sweetness than sucrose and other nutritive sweeteners. The decrease in NNS sweetness appears to be dependent on mixture suppression due to increasing bitterness. Study 3: Four hedonic groups for sucrose were identified: \u2018Slope +\u2019, \u2018Slope \u2013\u2018, \u2018Horizontal Line\u2019, and \u2018Inverted-U\u2019.

The fast growth of the broiler chick is offset by poor breeding performance of the broiler breeders (parent lines). In the adult broiler breeder hen, excessive feed consumption causes severe ovarian dysfunction and results in superfluous follicle growth and double preovulatory hierarchies, leading to reduced fertility and egg production. Modern management practices involve severe restriction of feed to help minimize reproductive dysfunction and maintain productivity. However, little is known about the effects of overfeeding or feed restriction on ovarian function in the prepubescent hen. The objective of this thesis was to identify differences in morphology, gene and protein expression within the ovarian cortex that distinguish the follicular growth environments of full-fed (FF) and restricted-fed (RF) prepubescent hens. Current work was performed on ovaries of 10-and 16-week-old-hens. Results showed, at both ages, heavier ovaries in FF hens, with a shift towards greater proportion of larger (>0.3 mm) cortical follicles and fewer smaller (<0.1 mm) cortical follicles as compared to RF. Expression of proteins and mRNA of factors known to be involved in follicular development were measured. Increased follicular development seen in FF was not associated with changes in mRNA of TGF-\u03b2 ligands (AMH, BMP6, BMP15, or GDF9) or protein of their signaling transcription factors (SMAD1/5/8 or SMAD2/3). Nor were there differences in immunolocalization of the modified histone proteins associated with transcription activity; trimethylated histone H3K4, acetylated histone H3K9, or trimethylated histone H3K27. However, serine phosphorylation, which localized to the oocyte cytoplasm, revealed vesicle-like structures in the RF hens, while tyrosine phosphorylation localized more prominently to the surface of granulosa cells from RF hens. Exploration of possible pathways and genetic markers associated with follicle growth using microarray analysis of the ovarian cortex transcriptome of the 16-week-old hens uncovered differentially expressed genes (DEG) involved in steroidogenesis and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Transcripts with greater abundance in the full-fed hens included those involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (HMGCR and DHCR24) and transport (STAR and STARD4), steroid biosynthesis (CYP11A1, HSD3\u03b22, HSD17\u03b21 and CYP19A1), and G protein-coupled receptor VIPR2. Two transcripts with less abundance in FF at 16 weeks were adenylyl cyclase inhibitors CHRM5 and DRD4. This pattern was also seen at 10 weeks but with less DEG represented in each group. DEG with greater abundance at 10 weeks included DHCR24, STAR and STARD4, CYP11A1 and CYP19A1, as well as VIPR2. One adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, DRD4, had less abundance in FF at 10 weeks. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and its receptors (VIPR1 and VIPR2) had become factors-of-interest in this thesis because of their role in steroidogenesis in mammalian ovaries and in larger follicles of adult hens. But little is known about the role of VIP in the chicken cortex. The final group of experiments in this thesis focused on cortical follicle culture to test effects of VIP on STAR mRNA expression. The results showed that STAR abundance was maintained in follicles treated with VIP equal to that of fresh samples, but follicles cultured with no steroidogenic activator could not maintain STAR. Unexpectedly, abundance of VIPR2 also was not maintained, while that of VIPR1 was 5 fold higher than that of fresh in the VIP-treated follicles. The roles of these receptors within the cortex have not been determined, and most likely the expression of each changes as follicles develop, suggesting greater expression of VIPR1 during proliferation and VIPR2 during differentiation. But taken together, our observations suggest that excessive energy intake leads to increased follicle growth and abundance of transcripts involved in steroid biosynthesis and neuronal activity in ovaries of immature broiler breeder hens and that VIP promotes activation of steroidogenic transcripts in cortical follicles.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14283], "author_name_tesi": "Anthony, Kate Lordan", "last_name_ssi": "Anthony", "middle_name_ssi": "Lordan", "first_name_ssi": "Kate", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Francisco Javier Diaz", "Alan Leslie Johnson", "Ramesh Ramachandran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Francisco Javier Diaz, Thesis Advisor", "Alan Leslie Johnson, Committee Member", "Ramesh Ramachandran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ovary", "follicle", "chicken", "broiler breeder hen", "microarray", "DAVID", "steroidogenesis", "neural", "prepubescent", "feed", "gene expression", "VIP", "vasoactive intestinal polypeptide"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The effect of an argumentation diagram on the self-evaluation of a creative solution.", "id": "14688", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7513", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Creative problem solving during which individuals generate novel and effective ideas or products is an essential 21st century skill that is most successful when learners are able to analyze, evaluate and refine their own ideas in order to improve and maximize their creative efforts (Partnership for 21st Century Skills).

One new application for micro-scale or meso-scale (10\u2019s microns to 100\u2019s microns) devices is surgical instruments designed to enter the body, perform a host of surgeries within the body cavity, and be extracted with no external incisions to the patient.  This new concept in surgery, called natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), requires smaller and more functional surgical tools.  Conventional processing routes do not exist for making these instruments with the desired size, topology, precision, and strength.  A process, called lost mold-rapid infiltration forming (LM-RIF), was developed to satisfy this need.   A tetragonally stabilized zirconia polycrystalline material (3Y-TZP) is a candidate material for this process and application because of its high strength, chemical stability, high elastic modulus, and reasonably high toughness for a ceramic. \n\tModern technical ceramics, like Y-TZP, are predicated on dense, fine grained microstructures and functional mesoscale devices must also adhere to this standard.  Colloid and interfacial chemistry was used to disperse and concentrate the Y-TZP nanoparticles through a very steep, yet localized, potential energy barrier against the van der Waals attractive force.   The interparticle interaction energies were modeled and compared to rheological data on the suspension.  At high concentrations, the suspension was pseudoplastic, which is evidence that a structure was formed within the suspension that could be disrupted by a shearing force.  The LM-RIF process exploits this rheological behavior to fill mold cavities created by photolithography.  The premise of the LM-RIF process is to process the particulate material into a dense ceramic body while the unsintered mesoscale parts are supported en masse by a substrate.  Numerous challenges were overcome that relate to the application of photoresist on a refractory substrate capable of withstanding the high temperatures needed to sinter the ceramic parts. Strength of approximately 1 GPa was achieved for the first parts produced, which demonstrated the feasibility of the LM-RIF process.\n\tAlthough respectable, a 1GPa strength is not as strong as would be predicted based on the small size (332 x 26 x 17 micron) of the parts.  An effort to identify and eliminate the largest flaws in the specimen produced by the LM-RIF process was undertaken, which ultimately increased the average strength to 2.35 GPa.  Geometric defects, previously unreported in ceramic microfabrication techniques, were degrading the strength of the early parts.  An in-depth characterization of these defects by optical profilometry and then eliminating the underlying cause was the key to obtaining this high strength.  One interesting phenomena discovered in this work was the role that the substrate plays in the sintering of the ceramic part through the enhanced diffusion pathways created by the more intimate contact of the mesoscale parts compared to macroscale analogs.  Impurities of alumina and silica were found to adversely affect the sintering kinetics of mesoscale parts causing localized grain growth or exaggerated grain growth depending on the sintering conditions.\n\tThe role that the microstructure, specifically the grain size, plays in determining the strength versus the role that the surface flaw population plays, as characterized by the surface roughness, was determined through isothermal sintering experiments.  It was found that the strength of mesoscale ceramics lies in the transition region between the flaw-dominated stress intensity effect and the Hall-Petch microstructural effect.  This proves that processing science and microstructural refinement about equally determine the strength of particulate based mesoscale materials.\n\tThe hierarchical approach that was used to marry the development of the LM-RIF process to the mechanical design and optimization of surgical instruments is described.  This approach used nested iteration loops to refine both the design and fabrication processes to create and test surgical instrument prototypes.  These prototypes as well as some of the unique shapes possible with the LM-RIF process are presented.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4609], "author_name_tesi": "Antolino, Nicholas Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Antolino", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair", "James Hansell Adair", "Gary Lynn Messing", "Christopher L Muhlstein", "Eric M Mockensturm"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair, Dissertation Advisor", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Chair", "Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Member", "Christopher L Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["abnormal grain growth", "grain size", "rheology", "brittle failure", "processing", "strength", "forming", "microfabrication", "mesoscale", "ceramic", "TZP", "zirconia", "sintering"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "\nNONPARAMETRIC IMPUTATION AND (MID-) RANK TESTS FOR MIXED EFFECTS MODELS WITH MISSING DATA\n", "id": "6333", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1852", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The first part of this thesis deals with factorial designs where each subject is observed at several time points with part of the data missing. A\nnonparametric approach for estimating the marginal cumulative distribution function at each time point is proposed and used to test for factor effects and interactions. Estimation uses more general and flexible donor sets which leads to a new type of nonparametric imputation. In particular, the donor sets allow use of univariate kernel methods even with higher dimensional data, avoiding thus the curse of dimensionality. The classical missing at random assumption is not tailored for the present nonparametric analysis.\nThe notion of the missingness conditionally at random Comparisons with ML indicate that the\nproposed method fares well when the data are normal and homoscedastic, and outperforms it in other cases.\n\nThe second part of this thesis considers testing for covariate-adjusted main effects and interactions in the context of the fully nonparametric ANCOVA model. The test procedures of Akritas, Arnold and Du (2000) are based on consistent estimation of the conditional distributions and as such they involve the cumbersome task of bandwidth determination. The proposed methodology does not require such consistent estimation. Asymptotic theory and numerical results, indicate that nearest neighbor windows of fixed(small) size perform well.

PsaC is presumed to have evolved from a soluble bacterial ferredoxin. It has a high sequence similarity to dicluster ferredoxins in the vicinity of two iron-sulfur cluster consensus binding sites CxxCxxCxxxCP. PsaC has an additional sequence insertion between the binding sites for the two clusters as well as a C-terminal extension. The g-tensor orientation of FA- and FB- is believed to be correlated to the preferential localization of the mixed-valence and equal-valence (ferrous) iron pairs in each [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster. Previous studies of ferrodoxins show that the preferential position of the mixed-valence and equal-valence pairs could be inferred from the study of the temperature dependence of contact-shifted resonances, belonging to bCH2 and Ha protons of cysteines ligating iron-sulfur cluster, by 1H NMR spectroscopy. For this, a sequence-specific assignment of these signals is required. Despite its relative instability, 1H NMR spectra of fully reduced, unbound PsaC could be recorded and a self-consistent, sequence-specific and stereospecific assignment of all 18 observable hyperfine-shifted signals through a model-based 1D NOE analysis was obtained. This enabled me to assign sequence-specifically the signals of three cysteines from each of the two reduced [4Fe-4S] clusters and to obtain the preferential localization of mixed- and equal-valence pairs in FA- and FB-. In FA- the mixed-valence pair is ligated by cysteines 47 and 53; the equal valence pair is ligated by cysteines 20 and 50. In FB- the mixed-valence pair is ligated by cysteines 10 and 16; the equal valence pair is ligated by cysteines 13 and 57. From the position of the equal- and mixed-valance pairs, the orientation of the g-tensor in [4Fe-4S] centers FA and FB was inferred. The magnetic properties of the two [4Fe-4S] clusters in unbound, reduced PsaC are essentially indistinguishable, though they are quite different in PsaC bound to PS I. From the changes in the g-tensor of FA- and FB- that occur upon binding of PsaC to the PS I core, it is likely that the protein undergoes significant structural changes upon binding to PS I. To study these changes, it is necessary to know the three-dimensional structure of both bound and unbound PsaC. The Clostridium acidi urici ferredoxin structure has served as a model for the refinement of a portion of the electron density map in a \n4 \u00c5 resolution X-ray structure of PS I (Klukas, O., Schubert, W.D., Jordan, P., Krauss, N., Fromme, P., Witt, H.T. and Saenger, W. (1999) J. Biol. Chem., 274, 7351-60). Thus a model for PsaC bound to PS I exists. However, no X-ray structure of unbound PsaC was available. In this work the three-dimensional NMR solution structure of recombinant, oxidized, unbound PsaC from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was determined. Constraints are derived from homo- and heteronuclear, one-, two- and three-dimensional NMR data. The overall quality of the NMR solution structure is equivalent to approx. 3 \u00c5 resolution by X-ray crystallography. PsaC is only the third two [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing, low-potential, iron-sulfur ferredoxin-like protein whose structure has been determined in solution. Moreover, PsaC is the rare case of a protein tightly bound to a membrane protein complex, whose structure is known in both the bound and unbound states. It is the only dicluster ferredoxin-like protein studied in such a context. Significant differences are observed between the unbound PsaC structure presented here and the available X-ray structure of bound PsaC as an integral part of the whole cyanobacterial PS I complex. These differences mainly concern the arrangement of the N- and C-termini with respect to the [4Fe-4S] core domains. In the NMR solution structure of PsaC, the C-terminal region assumes a disordered helical conformation. This is clearly different from the extended coil conformation, which is one of the structural elements that anchors PsaC to the PS I core polypeptides. The N-terminal end of PsaC bends and slides in between the coiled-up C-terminus and the iron-sulfur core of the protein. These structural changes result in a concerted movement of the N- and C-termini of PsaC away from the FA binding site. The same regions are positioned much closer to FA in a near parallel arrangement to each other in PsaC bound to PS I. The observed structural features in solution may be relevant for the proposed stepwise assembly of the stromal PsaC, PsaD and PsaE subunits to the PS I core heterodimer. Cysteine 13 and cysteine 50, which ligate FB and FA respectively, were each changed to a serine, aspartate, alanine, or glycine in unbound PsaC in the previous work. It was proposed that 2-mercaptoethanol, a reagent used for iron-sulfur cluster reconstitution, serves as an external rescue ligand in the absence of a biological ligand to the fourth iron (Yu, L.A., Vassiliev, I.R., Jung, Y.S., Bryant, D.A., Golbeck, J.H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem., 270, 28118-28125). Instead of the expected [3Fe-4S] cluster, chemical rescue by an external thiolate ligand allows for formation of a [4Fe-4S] cluster in the alanine and glycine mutants. To support this hypothesis, C13G/C33S PsaC was reconstituted using 2-mercaptoethanol, 4-fluorothiophenol and 2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanethiol as the rescue ligands to FB. Resonance Raman and EPR data provide strong evidence that only the [4Fe-4S] clusters are assembled in C13G/C33S PsaC in the absence of a suitable biological ligand. Upon reconstitution of the mutant PsaC with 4-fluorothiophenol or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanethiol, it was possible to detect hyperfine contact-shifted 19F resonances by NMR spectroscopy showing that a thiolate ligand is bound to FB in C13G/C33S mutant PsaC, when Cysteine II is changed to amino acid that can not ligate iron-sulfur cluster. This proves the chemical rescue hypothesis. The results presented here show that both aryl and acyl thiolates can serve as external thiolate ligands to protein-bound [4Fe-4S] clusters.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4202], "author_name_tesi": "Antonkine, Mikhail L.", "last_name_ssi": "Antonkine", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Mikhail", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John H Golbeck", "Donald Ashley Bryant", "Christain J Falzone", "B Tracy Nixon", "James Gregory Ferry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John H Golbeck, Committee Chair", "Donald Ashley Bryant, Committee Member", "Christain J Falzone, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "James Gregory Ferry, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ferredoxin", "Photosystem I", "NMR", "conformational change", "paramagnetic", "iron-sulfur protein", "solution structure", "PsaC", "iron-sulfur clusters"]}]
