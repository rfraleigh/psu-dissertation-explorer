However, in terms of digital games and the opportunities they offer for learning through reflection, most research focuses on the reflection that occurs as a game player consciously and purposefully applies ideas in each phase of problem solving. Relatively few studies focus on the deep reflection that occurs during players\u00a1\u00a6 emotional engagements, narrative experiences, and identity construction within game play, and whether such reflection leads meaningful learning.\nUsing the digital game The Sims 2 (TS2) as an example, this study was designed to advance understanding of how digital game play provides an interactive narrative interface through which players may play, explore, and express themselves. Ultimately, the goal of the study was to discover whether the experience of narrative play and sharing in TS2 encourages reflective learning and the construction of identity. \n\tBased on the analysis of the research data collected from various resources, this qualitative case study revealed that the digital game TS2 provides an interactive narrative interface (INI) that enables players to construct their own play experiences through gameplay, narrative, sharing, discussion, and reflection. These narrative play experiences, at the same time, inspire players to construct and uncover dimensions of their identities. Further learning by recapturing and sharing narrative play experiences through self-reflection, storytelling, and reflective dialogue with others provide players with new understandings and meanings through which they may examine the meaning behind their narrative play. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2255], "author_name_tesi": "Hsiao, Hui-Chun ", "last_name_ssi": "Hsiao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hui-Chun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Treat Keifer Boyd", "Patricia Marie Amburgy", "Wanda B Knight", "William Kelly"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Treat Keifer Boyd, Committee Chair", "Patricia Marie Amburgy, Committee Member", "Wanda B Knight, Committee Member", "William Kelly, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["reflective learning", "The Sims", "digital game", "identity construction", "video game", "videogame"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Identification of dietary patterns and relationship with weight and health outcomes in older adults", "id": "15213", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7622", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The proportion of older adults (\u2265 65 years old) is dramatically increasing. The first of the Baby Boomer generation (adults born between 1946 and 1964) turned 65 years old in 2011. The prevalence of obesity among this age group is higher than ever. According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008, 34% of women and 37% of men aged \u2265 60 years old are obese. Obesity is clearly related to a number of adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn). However, the role that diet plays related to these outcomes in an aging population is less clear. The prevalence of nutrition-related chronic disease outcomes is higher among low socioeconomic and rural populations. These at-risk populations are not readily sampled in national nutritional surveys. Studies characterizing populations of rural, older adults are needed to better understand the role of dietary patterns and health disparities. In particular, limited data are available for the old-older person aged 80 years and above. Data that are available suggests that many obese older adults consume poor quality diets and that dietary practices may influence health outcomes even in populations of old-older individuals.\n\nAdvances in dietary pattern research have focused on investigation of the association between specific dietary patterns and disease outcomes. Commonly used methodologies for deriving dietary patterns include both a priori (e.g., diet indices, such as the Healthy Eating Index-2005) and a posteriori methods (e.g., factor or cluster analysis). More recently, other techniques such as reduced rank regression and finite mixture modeling have also been employed.\n\nThe objectives for this dissertation were three-fold: 1) to explore the association between dietary patterns and obesity-related health outcomes; 2) to examine the association between dietary patterns and diet quality in relation to obesity and weight change; and 3) to explore the use of a novel approach, finite mixture modeling, in determining dietary patterns in a sample of older adults. The first two objectives were carried out using data from the Geisinger Rural Aging Study (GRAS) and the third using data from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Study of Aging.\n\nThe GRAS is a longitudinal cohort of > 20,000 community-dwelling older adults (\u2265 65 years old) living in rural Pennsylvania, initiated to examine the relationship between health outcomes and nutritional status. Cluster analysis, utilizing data from 24-hour dietary recalls, was used to derive dietary patterns in a subset of 449 participants from the GRAS (mean age: 76.5 \u00b1 5.1 years). Prevalence (5-year follow-up) of CVD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and MetSyn and weight measurements were extracted from the outpatient electronic medical records using a validated data extraction process. Logistic regression, adjusting for relevant covariates, was used to examine the associations between dietary patterns and health outcomes. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the relationship between weight change and dietary patterns.\n\nThe \u2018Sweets and dairy\u2019, \u2018Health-Conscious\u2019, and \u2018Western\u2019 dietary patterns were identified at baseline. Compared to the \u2018Health-Conscious\u2019 pattern, those in the \u2018Sweets and dairy\u2019 pattern had increased odds of hypertension; adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.17 (1.11-4.27). Only after stratification by gender was there a significant association between weight change and dietary pattern. Women characterized by the \u2018Sweets and dairy\u2019 and the \u2018Western\u2019 dietary pattern were three and two times more likely to lose 10 pounds, respectively, compared to those in the \u2018Health-conscious\u2019 dietary pattern.\n\nIn the UAB Study of Aging (n = 416), finite mixture modeling identified three dietary patterns: a \u2018Low produce, high sweets\u2019, a \u2018Western-like\u2019, and a \u2018More healthful\u2019 dietary pattern. The most notable finding was the significant interaction found between body mass index (BMI) and gender for probability of dietary pattern membership which suggested that there was a stronger relationship between BMI and dietary pattern for women compared to men.\n\nIn conclusion, finite mixture modeling was able to identify dietary patterns in a sample of older adults. Additionally, dietary patterns in the GRAS subset were significantly associated with hypertension, but not the other obesity-related outcomes of interest. The GRAS dietary patterns were also significantly related to weight loss, but only after stratifying by gender. The gender interaction seen in both the GRAS and UAB Study of Aging samples highlight that the relationship between weight and dietary pattern varies between the sexes. Unfortunately, due to sample size, we were limited in the ability to analyze meaningful subgroups for dietary pattern identification, such as gender. Additionally, our study was unable to address the potential benefits of adopting a prudent diet earlier in life.\n\nResearch presented in this dissertation furthers the body of knowledge on older adults, dietary patterns and relationship to health outcomes and weight. Findings suggest that clinicians may be warranted to consider prescription of more liberalized, rather than overly-restrictive diets, for some old-older persons, especially when food intake may be inadequate. Future research should ensure investigation of larger samples of old-older adults, paying special attention to analysis by gender and measurement of dietary patterns longitudinally.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7557, 7558, 7559], "author_name_tesi": "Hsiao, Pao ", "last_name_ssi": "Hsiao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gordon Lee Jensen", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Sharon M Nickols Richardson", "Donna Coffman", "Martin John Sliwinski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gordon Lee Jensen, Dissertation Advisor", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Dissertation Advisor", "Sharon M Nickols Richardson, Committee Member", "Donna Coffman, Committee Member", "Martin John Sliwinski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dietary patterns", "older adults", "obesity", "diet", "aging"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "CATIONIC POLYMER LUBRICANT (CPL): A NEW BOUND AND MOBILE\nBOUNDARY LUBRICANT WITH SELF-HEALING CAPABILITIES\n\n", "id": "12061", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1914", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The boundary film formation and lubrication effects of low-molecular-weight silicone molecules with cationic side groups were studied.

The mobile species are the reduced tertiary amine form of CPL. \n      The hydrophobic but hygroscopic properties of CPL are also investigated with SFG and ATR-IR. The CPL-coated surfaces are hydrophobic which prevents the detrimental effects of humidity on wear of silicon. In addition, the hygroscopic nature of CPL allows humidity to be absorbed into the film, which enhances the self-healing capabilities. \n      Finally, by texturing the silicon surface with nanowells, self-healing is enhanced when the nanowells are filled with CPL. The nanowells serve as CPL reservoirs that are readily available for self-healing within the wear track for faster cycle intervals. However, the nanowells deteriorate the self-healing from surrounding the contact region due to the refilling of the empty nanowells.&#8195;\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1896], "author_name_tesi": "Hsiao Liao, Erik ", "last_name_ssi": "Hsiao Liao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Erik", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim", "Seong Han Kim", "Themis Matsoukas", "Joseph Manuel Perez Sr.", "Evangelos Manias"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim, Dissertation Advisor", "Seong Han Kim, Committee Chair", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Joseph Manuel Perez Sr., Committee Member", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Self-healing", "Lubricant", "Polymer", "Tribology", "AFM"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Practices and Strategies of Self-Initiated Language Learning in an Online Social Network Discussion Forum: A Descriptive Case Study", "id": "16161", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8122", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The proliferation of information and communication technologies and the prevalence of online social networks have facilitated the opportunities for informal learning of foreign languages. However, little educational research has been conducted on how individuals utilize those social networks to take part in self-initiated language learning without guided instruction. The main purpose of this descriptive case study was to understand the strategies, practices, and knowledge that were shared by forum members during the self-directed learning process. I reviewed forum topics that remained actively discussed over a six-month time frame (from the beginning of September, 2011 to the end of February, 2012). Among those active forum topics, only topics with 30% or more popularity were studied. A total of ten forum topics qualified both selection requirements. Only those that exchanged questions and information pertaining to knowledge of language learning were analyzed. \n\nBy examining a total of two hundred and eighty-three discussion messages from the ten selected topic threads, twenty-eight codes with their operational definitions were generated to analyze the selected discussion messages into thirteen sub-themes, and eventually to summarize them into main themes. The results of the data were categorized into four themes that illustrated the main practices and strategies used by participants in the social network to help each other learn new languages: (1) self-initiated learning strategies, (2) self-initiated learning priorities, (3) reflections on the complexities of practices, and (4) knowledge building. These four themes suggested that this online language learning social network Website provided an open space for registered forum participants to exchange resources and information for language learning, to share their past learning experiences, to discuss their personal learning problems with other members, to contribute their language learning strategies and skills to the knowledge repository, and to build up their individual knowledge based on others\u2019 distributed knowledge and the dispersed knowledge within the social network shared by other forum members (Gee, 2004). \n\nThrough forum members\u2019 social practices of group interaction, communication, discussions, clarification, and negotiation on different subject matters, self-initiated learning and sharing of group meanings were evidenced in the threaded discussions.

There were 45 participants in the program, and 38 participated in my study. \n\tIn order to better understand the content and pedagogy of art museums\u2019 summer teacher programs, I first conducted a survey of five major art museums\u2019 summer teacher programs in the United States and did a pilot study of the 2006 VAST Program at the PMA. These two studies focused on how art museums develop content and pedagogy for summer teacher programs in terms of meeting their participants\u2019 expectations and needs. \n\tMy study of the 2007 VAST Program addressed two main questions and two sub-questions:\n1. How does the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) execute its summer teacher program, VAST (Visual Arts as Resources for Teaching), to meet its participants\u2019 expectations and needs? \n\ta. How does the PMA develop and execute the VAST Program to meet its mission, the goals of the VAST Program, and its program participants\u2019 expectations and needs?\nb.

At the outset of the study, I surveyed 38 participants to gain information about how they wanted to participate in the 2007 VAST Program, namely their needs and expectations. At the end of the program, I surveyed them again to gain their opinions of the program. I then analyzed these data and discussed the effectiveness of the 2007 VAST Program from both the institution\u2019s and the participants\u2019 perspectives in terms of whether the content and pedagogy that the PMA provided for the participants met their expectations and needs. \nAfter the study, I found that the program effectiveness was related to fulfilling the program participants\u2019 expectations and diverse needs. I concluded that the 2007 VAST Program provided the program participants with opportunities to learn something new, meet art professionals, gain teaching resources, and earn continuing education credits, all of which met the program participants\u2019 expectations and needs. I conclude this dissertation with recommendations for the PMA and for art museum summer teacher program development in general. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3658], "author_name_tesi": "Hsieh, Kevin ", "last_name_ssi": "Hsieh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wanda Knight", "Patricia Marie Amburgy", "Dr David Ebitz", "Jamie Myers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wanda Knight, Committee Chair", "Patricia Marie Amburgy, Committee Member", "Dr David Ebitz, Committee Member", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Teacher Education", "Art Museum", "Needs", "Art Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Profitability and Compatibility Factors Explaining Faculty's Post-adoption Behaviors of Teaching and Learning Innovations in Research One Universities \n", "id": "7821", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4490", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to create predictive models to systematically explain the impact of 6 profitability factors\u2014Organizational Support, Collegiality within Department, Collegiality above Department, P&T Focus on Teaching and Research, Influence of Course Changes on P&T, and P&T Feedback Received about Course Changes and 4 compatibility factors\u2014Positive Department Culture, Student-centered Teaching Philosophy, Innovation Philosophy, and Teaching Motivation on the sustaining, transferring, and diffusing of a teaching and learning innovation. \n\nFrom December 2005 to January 2006, a total of 163 faculty participants from a Research I university completed an online survey whose responses were used for data analysis.

The essence of the speed-accuracy relation is that with an increase in movement speed there is concomitant decrease in movement accuracy.  Different descriptions and explanations of the speed-accuracy relation have been proposed for characterizing time matching and time minimization movement tasks.  Nevertheless, these accounts have emphasized the spatial dimension of the phenomenon providing a limited assessment given that human movement takes place in both space and time.  It follows that there is a potential for both spatial error and temporal error in motor task.  \nHancock and Newell (1985) proposed a space-time framework of the movement speed-accuracy relation that is based on the space-time principle that the spatial component of movement is always measured with respect to time and that the temporal component of movement is always measured with respect to space (Minkowski, 1908).  However, although the spatial and temporal error was considered as complementary features, they were still considered separately, as function of other features.  This dissertation investigated this problem considering the joint entropy as a way to examine the movement variability of different tasks while also integrating the space-time properties of the movement.  Three experiments were conducted to investigate two hypotheses: that when space and time are integrated in one measure \u2013 the joint entropy \u2013 the phenomenon will be characterized by a U-shape function \u2013 revealing an optimal region of time/space variability; and that when space and time are integrated, different descriptions of speed-accuracy trade-off phenomenon are not necessary given that the constraints are the same.  \nExperiment 1 was set-up to investigate the space-time entropy of movement outcome as a function of a range of spatial (10, 20 and 30 cm) and temporal (250 to 2,500 ms) criteria in a discrete aiming task.  The joint space-time entropy was lowest when the relative contribution of spatial and temporal task criteria was comparable (i.e., mid-range of space-time constraints), and it increased with a greater trade-off between spatial or temporal task demands, revealing a U-shaped function across space-time task criteria.  \nIn Experiment 2, two sub-experiments in an isometric single finger force task investigated the joint force-time entropy with: a) fixed time to peak force and different percentages of force level; and b) fixed percentage of force level and different times to peak force.  This was done to test whether the U-shape would be generalizable across different tasks.  The findings show that force error and timing error are dependent but complementary when considered in the same framework with the joint force-time entropy at a minimum in the middle parameter range of discrete impulse.  \nIn Experiment 3, time matching and time minimization movement tasks were used to test whether these different task descriptions of speed and accuracy were due to different temporal and spatial task constraints.  The results showed that the joint space-time entropy of outcome did not change across tasks and conditions \u2013 revealing a common level of space-time entropy between these two categories of aiming tasks.  \nOverall, these results showed that the joint information entropy analysis revealed the structure of movement accuracy masked by the distributional analysis of movement data when either the spatial or temporal dimensions of movement error considered alone and independently.  The main contribution of this study was the cohesion of the methodological approach developed in terms of joint information entropy that provides an alternative perspective and a more complete account from which to describe and explain the speed and accuracy trade-off phenomenon.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10986], "author_name_tesi": "Hsieh, Tsung-yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Hsieh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tsung-yu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell", "Karl Maxim Newell", "John Henry Challis", "Kristina A Neely", "Runze Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell, Dissertation Advisor", "Karl Maxim Newell, Committee Chair", "John Henry Challis, Committee Member", "Kristina A Neely, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Speed-accuracy trade-off", "movement entropy", "space-time constraints", "force-time constraints", "isometric force task"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS AND PROCESS OF USING DIFFERENT STORY-INDEXING STRATEGIES WITHIN A CASE LIBRARY ON COLLEGE STUDENTS' ABILITY TO SOLVE ILL-STRUCTURED PROBLEMS\n\n", "id": "6746", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6581", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe emphasis on and importance of solving realistic and complex problems have increased in both education and industry. Realistic problems are usually ill-structured due to the lack of a convergent solution, unclear problem statement, or incomplete information for solving the problem (Chi & Glaser, 1985). Therefore, educators are exploring how to engage students in solving authentic and ill-structured problems through techniques such as anchored instruction, apprenticeship learning, problem-based learning, cased-based learning, goal-based scenario, and so on. \nMost students fail to apply what they learn from school contexts to the problems they encounter (Bransford et al., 1987). Since students have difficulties in transferring knowledge, supports should be provided to students during problem-solving processes.\nCase-based reasoning (CBR) focuses on analogy in the context of solving real-world problems \u00a1\u00a7.... by encoding, retrieval, and adaptation in analogical reasoning process\u00a1\u00a8 (Kolodner, 1997, p. 57). It is suggested that learners build their own case libraries of experiences through working with \u00a1\u00a7expert\u00a1\u00a8 experiences. The evidence indicates that stories within a case library significantly help learners improve their skills in solving ill-structured problems (Hernandez-Serrano, 2001). However, Gick and Holyoak (1980, 1983) found that students failed to apply knowledge from one context to another without providing them with explicit clues.\nIndexing is the process of organizing experiences so that people know where they can find relevant information when needed (Schank, Berman, & Macpherson, 1999). The ways that people interpret a story will affect the ways that they index the stories into memory and reuse the story in the future (Kolodner, 1997).\nNovices may have difficulties in indexing and reusing their experiences well because they lack a good understanding of how to encode their experiences. In contrast, experts can index their experiences in many ways and retrieve the right story to solve new problems (Schank et al., 1999). If we help novices make connections between experiences by providing them with pre-generated story indices, they may develop stronger understandings of problems and interpret cases similar to experts.  \nThe purposes of this study are to investigate the effects and process of using the following story-indexing strategies within a case library to support college students\u00a1\u00a6 abilities in solving ill-structured problems: (1) no story-indexing strategy, (2) surface-indexing strategy, and (3) thematic indexing strategy. A mixed-method design is conducted to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. Eighty-nine students participated in the experimental design and six subjects (3 freshmen and 3 seniors) participated in the qualitative design\u0192{\u0192{a think-aloud activity. \nThe results of the quantitative data analysis showed no significant differences in using the thematic-indexing strategy to help college students solve ill-structured problems and engage in analogical reasoning. No significant difference was found for the three sub-skills (identify problems, define problems, and explore solutions) of problem-solving ability among the control, comparable, and treatment groups.\nThree findings from the qualitative data analysis are described below. \n1.\tIn different stages of problem solving, students tend to look for stories with appropriate functions that achieve their goals.\n2.\tStudents vary the complexity of their analogies in different stages of problem solving. \n3.\tThe complexity of students\u00a1\u00a6 analogies changes as they change their problem solving goals and seek for stories with different functions. \n\nThe results of the quantitative data indicated that students did not use the story indexes provided. Through closer analyses of the qualitative data, students tended to look for stories that helped them achieve their problem-solving goals. That is, if they had to summarize problem issues, they looked for surface-level features in stories. If they had to engage in higher-order thinking such as justifying a decision, they looked\ndeeper within the case library to pull out relevant stories. This suggests that pre-generated story indices need to account for more than the content of a story: They must also suggest ways that cases can be used to solve problems by analogy. Since problem solving\ntakes on many forms, the indices may need to also describe the ways that cases can be used to make different types of analogies. \nSince people vary their analogy when using stories to solve problems, the indices have to be flexible enough to cover most ways that people use stories in a case library. Therefore, case libraries must allow students to ask questions that serve as multiple indexes and help them browse related stories. The multiple indexes should be built upon the abstract task knowledge that can serve as the common ground between the students and the teachers (Ferguson, Bareiss, Birnbaum, & Osgood, 1992). \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6579], "author_name_tesi": "Hsieh, Wen-Lan ", "last_name_ssi": "Hsieh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wen-Lan", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian K Smith", "Francis M Dwyer Jr.", "Susan M Land", "Spiro E Stefanou", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian K Smith, Committee Chair", "Francis M Dwyer Jr., Committee Member", "Susan M Land, Committee Member", "Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["story telling", "problem solving", "story index", "case library", "experts and novices", "Case-based reasoning"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "An Exploratory Study of L2 Teachers' Pedagogical Decisions on Technology Activities", "id": "16195", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8121", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As information communication technologies (ICTs) evolve at a rapid speed, language teachers in the 21st century are facing a new challenge in their teaching: integration of technology into their classroom.

However, as Stockwell (2007) suggested, questions remain regarding how technologies have been used to achieve learning objectives. By focusing on technology-using L2 teachers\u2019 pedagogical design of technology activities, this study aimed to explore those teachers\u2019 pedagogical decision on technology activities in their respective classroom contexts.\n\nSpeci\ufb01cally, this study sought to answer the question of how technology-using L2 teachers utilize web-base computer technologies and resources to achieve learning objectives supporting English language learners\u2019 language/literacy development with three sub research questions: 1a) How do technology-using L2 teachers integrate and design their technology activities?; 1b) What types of student engagement are triggered by these L2 teachers\u2019 technology learning activities in classroom or virtual space?; 1c) How do technology-using L2 teachers approach modifying technology activities based on their perceived activities\u2019 outcomes?\n\nMultiple-case embedded research design was used to address the proposed research questions.

Since the dialysis process does not change or affect the surrounding fluid, it is viewed as a tool for continuous monitoring of human metabolites for diabetes treatment. In diabetes treatment, microdialysis probes have been used as sampling systems coupled to a glucose biosensor but struggle to obtain high recoveries of analytes while the sampling housing, probes, and glucose sensors are fabricated as separate pieces and then assembled resulting in a large dead volume. An in-situ combination of a miniaturized microdialysis probe with an integrated glucose sensor allows both a high glucose recovery and frequent glucose sampling for continuous patient monitoring. \nA microdialysis chip with flow-through electrochemical glucose sensing capabilities is presented here. The system was fabricated by bonding a 6 um thick polycarbonate track-etch membrane with varying pore sizes onto microfluidic channels with the sensing electrodes patterned within the microchannels. A complete fabrication protocol for this device was developed with a non-leaking and reproducible bond between the microfluidic channels and the membrane. The integrated sampling and sensing components were both based on the same thin-film fabrication methods, which can reduce the dead volume and enhance microdialysis recovery with better time resolution.\nAs the first step toward the on-chip integration of a microdialysis system and a glucose sensor, impedance electrodes sputtered within the microchannels were used to characterize conductivity of a dialyzed phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, which is a function of PBS concentration. The permeability of the membrane to the salt ions was obtained as 0.246 um/s (15 nm diameter pores). Subsequently, experiments measuring PBS dialysis in the time-domain at 64.4% recovery were conducted.\nNext glucose microdialysis with continuous sensing was demonstrated, the permeability of glucose to the polycarbonate membrane with 100 nm diameter pore size was obtained to be 5.44 um/s. Glucose recovery of 99% was observed using this microdialysis system at a perfusion flow rate of 0.5 ul/min. Experiments monitoring glucose concentration in the time-domain were also performed. The electrochemical sensing component was able to continuously track concentration changes in the reservoir. This system is expected to have the proper sensitivity to track physiologically relevant concentration changes of glucose (maximum change rate ~4 mg/dl-min with periodicity of 1 hour or greater) with minimal lag time and amplitude reduction for continuous glucose monitoring for diabetes treatment.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6751], "author_name_tesi": "Hsieh, Yi-Cheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Hsieh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi-Cheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey D Zahn", "Arnold Anthony Fontaine", "Nadine B Smith", "Michael V Pishko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey D Zahn, Committee Chair", "Arnold Anthony Fontaine, Committee Member", "Nadine B Smith, Committee Member", "Michael V Pishko, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microfluidics", "glucose sensing", "microdialysis", "impedance sensing"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Temporal progression of oil spill impact on a cold-water coral community", "id": "18849", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8970", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-01-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Usually found in deep and cold marine environments around the world, azooxanthellae cold-water corals (CWCs) are not as well studied as their tropical reef counterparts. However, the diversity of biological communities on hard scleractinian cold-water coral reefs have been compared to that of tropical reefs (Cordes et al. 2008), and dense assemblages of soft gorgonian corals near the Aleutian Islands have been described as coral \u201cgardens\u201d (Stone 2006). They are slow growing and long lived, sometimes up to thousands of years old (Roark et al. 2009), suggesting they and the habitats they support might take a long time to recover from major disturbances, if at all. Historically, those disturbances include fishing and trawling (Hall\u2013Spencer et al. 2002; Davies et al. 2007). Also, cold-water corals are being affected by thermal stress (Cerrano et al. 2000), changes in surface primary productivity (Roberts et al. 2009), and ocean acidification (Guinotte et al. 2006) as a result of anthropogenic induced climate change. In recent years, mining and energy production activities have expanded into increasingly deeper waters, including cold-water coral habitats (Roberts et al. 2009). A major accident that occurred as a result of those activities was the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in April 2010 in the deep Gulf of Mexico.\nOn 3 November 2010, a coral community 11 km southwest of the site of the Deepwater Horizon blowout was discovered at 1,370 m with gorgonian corals partially covered by a brown flocculent material (\u201cfloc\u201d) and commensal brittle stars with abnormal coloration and behavior (White et al. 2012). This thesis will describe the work that quantified the visible changes in impact to the corals, where images of individual branches of each colony were digitized and categorized based on their condition after four repeat visits. Most of the floc was absent from the corals by the first 2011 visit, and there was a decrease in the median proportions of the colonies showing obvious signs of impact between the November 2010 and later visits. During the second visit in 2010, early onset of hydroid colonization on impacted coral branches was observed and it increased over the course of the study. The probability of impacted portions of the coral dying and being colonized by hydroids by March 2012, was positively correlated with the proportion of the colony covered by floc in late 2010. Similarly, the probability of impacted portions of the coral showing signs of recovery and persisting through March 2012 was negatively correlated with the proportion of the coral covered with floc in late 2010. A notable feature of the impact at all time points was its patchy nature, both with and among colonies, suggesting the impacting agent was not homogenously dispersed during initial contact with the corals. While the median level of visible impact decreased over time, the conservative method used to categorize branches as obviously visibly impacted only when they were covered in floc, dead, or dripping tissue ignored more subtle indications of impact such as polyp condition and coloration. As a result, it is likely that future visits will reveal additional deterioration in the condition of these normally very long-lived corals.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8807], "author_name_tesi": "Hsing, Pen-yuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Hsing", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pen-yuan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cold-water corals", "Paramuricea", "multiple imputation", "oil spill impact", "time series", "Deepwater Horizon", "Gulf of Mexico"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The role of the Kar2p/BiP chaperone in ER quality control\n\n", "id": "8512", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1169", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an interorganellar signal transduction pathway that monitors endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. Whole genome transcriptional analysis in budding yeast has revealed 381 genes regulated by the UPR. About half of those genes encode functions throughout the secretory pathway including protein folding and modification, protein quality control, lipid synthesis, protein trafficking, and vacuolar (lysosomal) proteases. Previous experiments have shown that the UPR is essential for ER stress tolerance but how the upregulation of individual genes contributes to stress tolerance is unknown. To answer this question, I devised an approach that uncouples the expression of individual target genes from UPR regulation. \nThe KAR2 gene was selected as the first target for analysis. KAR2 encodes Kar2p/BiP, a highly conserved protein belonging to the Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones. Kar2p is the first UPR target discovered and plays multiple functions in the ER including protein translocation, protein folding, ER associated degradation (ERAD) and karyogamy. These essential functions (protein translocation and folding) raise an interesting conundrum. Since half of UPR targets encode proteins that enter the secretory pathway, Kar2p is, in fact, an essential facilitator of the UPR at its last stage, the synthesis of target proteins. How then, is it possible to activate the UPR when a key facilitator is also a target gene that is immediately needed to deal with the misfolded products of stress (ERAD)? \nTo address this question and to study the contribution of individual target genes to the ER stress response, we engineered a strain that specifically uncouples Kar2p regulation from the UPR without compromising the activation of other target genes. Under stress, Kar2p upregulation was essential for cell viability. I showed that Kar2p upregulation was required to rid aberrant proteins through both the ERAD pathway and the ER-to-vacuolar overload pathway. Surprisingly, the essential functions of protein translocation and folding were unaffected when Kar2p levels became limiting under stress. This strategy allows Kar2p to temporarily dispense with its role in ridding misfolded proteins to facilitate the UPR until homeostasis is restored. The physiological importance of this  triage  mechanism was apparent because a temporary disruption of Kar2p essential functions was lethal. In contrast, cells could fully survive a temporary disruption of Kar2p's quality control functions.\nOn the other hand, if Kar2p was limiting for prolonged periods, cells would die. I demonstrated that under stress, the clearance of misfolded proteins is essential. Accordingly, in the strain defective in upregulating KAR2 expression by the UPR, cells eventually died because they could not efficiently degrade misfolded proteins in the ER, this resulted in the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, which caused cellular toxicity. In addition, I also found that a potential export signal in misfolded proteins was formed despite the misfolding of proteins and function in an ER export event. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1157], "author_name_tesi": "Hsu, Chia-Ling ", "last_name_ssi": "Hsu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chia-Ling", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wesley Tsoekjen Ng", "Sarah Ellen Ades", "David Scott Gilmour", "Douglas Cavener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wesley Tsoekjen Ng, Committee Chair", "Sarah Ellen Ades, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ER sress tolerance", "unfolded protein response", "ER quality control", "Kar2p/BiP"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INFERENCE OF ORTHOLOGS, WHILE CONSIDERING GENE CONVERSION, TO EVALUATE WHOLE-GENOME MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENTS ", "id": "10267", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1240", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The problem of computing a multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) is very important for the analysis of biological sequences. An equally critical problem is to evaluate the quality of an alignment. In the preliminary project described here, alignments produced by Multiz and ROAST of the human genome to other vertebrate genomes are evaluated using orthologous genes in 13 gene clusters from 6 mammalian species, which are identified using maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree reconstruction methods. Analysis of the &#945;- and &#946;-globin gene clusters show that inferred ortholog relationships are accurate. The orthologous &#946;-globin genes from over 14 species are used to evaluate the performance of four MSA programs (MLAGAN, MAVID, TBA and ROAST). The results show that the performance of ROAST is superior to the others. Furthermore, differences among gene clusters and among species are studied.

Furthermore, we analyze 1,112,202 highly conserved pairs of human genomic intervals, and detect a conversion event for about 13.5% of them. Properties of the putative gene conversions are analyzed, such as the distributions of the lengths of the converted regions and the spacing between source and target.

Topological states of matter describe new quantum states of matter that cannot adiabatically connect to conventional states of matter even though they share the same symmetry. Thus, the discovery of topological states of matter has opened a new research era and attracted intensive research interests in recent years. This dissertation is devoted to the theoretical and numerical study of transport properties of topological states of matter, mainly focusing on two topological systems, time reversal invariant topological insulator nano-structures and the quantum anomalous Hall insulators.\nThe first system studied in this dissertation is time reversal invariant topological insulator, which is an insulating material behaving as an insulator in its interior but with conducting channels on its surface. The conducting surface states of a topological insulator are known as \"helical states\" due to the spin texture in the momentum space and protected by time reversal symmetry. Helical surface states have been observed in surface sensitive experiments, such as angular-resolved photon emission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. However, signatures of topological surface states in transport measurements are complicated by the dominating conduction from bulk channels and strong disorder effect. Therefore, in this dissertation, we numerically study transport in disordered topological insulator nano-structures, e.g. nanowires and nanotubes, which possess a larger surface- to-volume ratio compared to bulk systems. For a topological insulator nanowire, it is found that a gapless mode with linear dispersion, which is refered to as a topological state in the main text, arises when a half-integer magnetic flux quantum is inserted along the nanowire. We find that topological states possess a longer localization length than other non-topological states. Thus, for a long nanowire or nanotube, a larger conductance appears for half-integer magnetic flux, leading to magnetoconductance oscillations with a period equivalent to one magnetic flux quantum. Our numerical simulation of the magnetoconductance oscillations is supported by experimental observations in resistive Bi2Te3 nanotubes.\nAnother system that we study is the quantum anomalous Hall insulator. Similar to the quantum Hall effect, the Hall conductance is quantized and the longitudinal resistance drops to zero in the quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, the quantum anomalous Hall effect is realized in a magnetic system in absence of external magnetic fields and the associated Landau levels. The quantum anomalous Hall effect was first proposed in magnetically doped HgTe quantum wells. However, one obstacle is that this system is paramagnetic, and thus external magnetic fields are required to polarize magnetization and inevitably leads to Landau levels. In this study, we focus on the role of in-plane magnetic fields and find that the quantum anomalous Hall effect can be realized by a purely in-plane magnetic field when there is strain in the system. Symmetry analysis is adopted to provide more theoretical insight of the underlying physics. Without any strain, we explore how to extract the role of magnetization in the standard transport measurement of Hall resistance by rotating magnetic fields. Our results provide a guidance to the recent experiments in Mn doped HgTe quatnum wells with rotating magnetic fields. Besides these studies, we also investigate anisotropic magneto-conductance in magnetically doped\n(Bi,Sb)2Te3 films.\nThe studies in the dissertation are in a close collaboration with transport\nmeasurements of experimental groups, including magneto-conductance oscillation observed by Qi\u2019s group at Penn State and the study of the Hall conductance in Mn doped HgTe quantum wells with rotating magnetic fields by Molenkamp\u2019s group at Wuerzburg University.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11327], "author_name_tesi": "Hsu, Hsiu-chuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Hsu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hsiu-chuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chaoxing Liu", "Chaoxing Liu", "Jainendra Jain", "Nitin Samarth", "Venkatraman Gopalan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chaoxing Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Chaoxing Liu, Committee Chair", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["quantum anomalous Hall effect", "magnetoconductance", "topological insulator nanotube"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR MOBILE AD HOC NETWORKS", "id": "9025", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2271", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mobile Ad Hoc Networks are networks composed of autonomous resource scare mobile nodes, built upon open media accessible to anonymous nodes, and operating in an isolated environment where each node has to defend itself without trustworthy gateways.

Mitophagy, the selective degradation of mitochondria, is required for clearing damaged mitochondria. A decrease in mitophagy is observed with aging and is associated with an increase in aging-related diseases, but the mechanism of this is uncertain. Cardiolipin (CL) is a mitochondria-specific phospholipid that is necessary for optimal mitochondrial function. CL remodeling is required for the maturation of CL into healthy tetra-linoleoyl CL. However, pathological remodeling by ALCAT1, an acyltransferase located at the mitochondria-associated membrane, occurs in response to oxidative stress and aging. This remodeling results in dysfunctional mitochondria with leaky electron transport chain and increased oxidative stress. However the mechanism by which CL remodeling leads to accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in aging-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, is unknown. The hypothesis is that CL remodeling associated with aging and oxidative stress reduces mitophagy, and links CL remodeling with accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. With a genetic model that silences CL maturation, CL remodeling is specifically required for the recognition of mitochondria by the autophagy machinery in mitophagy. The results demonstrate in an ALCAT1 knockout mouse model that blocking pathologic CL remodeling reduces vascular oxidative stress and renders mice resistant to obesity-induced hypertension. Lastly, the unexpected role of CL remodeling and mitochondrial dysfunction in cellular inflammatory response is explored. Unexpectedly, overexpression of ALCAT1 results in upregulation of type I interferon signaling secondary to mitochondrial DNA release into the cytoplasm. These data support the well-established link between oxidative stress and aging-related diseases and suggest involvement of pro-inflammatory mechanisms. Overall, the results show that pathological CL remodeling is an underlying mechanism that drives acceleration of oxidative stress and aging-related disease. Furthermore, they indicate that CL remodeling, specifically ALCAT1 inhibition, may be a druggable target to reduce the burden of oxidative stress and inflammatory response as well as aid in the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13046], "author_name_tesi": "Hsu, Paul ", "last_name_ssi": "Hsu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yuguang Shi", "Yuguang Shi", "Leonard Jefferson", "Hong-Gang Wang", "Jennifer Baccon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yuguang Shi, Dissertation Advisor", "Yuguang Shi, Committee Chair", "Leonard Jefferson, Committee Member", "Hong-Gang Wang, Committee Member", "Jennifer Baccon, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mitophagy", "Cardiolipin", "Barth Syndrome", "Hypertension", "Type I interferon"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "A case study of the change process of integrating technology into an elementary science methods course", "id": "6359", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5001", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this qualitative case study was to provide a detailed description of the change process of technology integration into a science methods course, SCIED 458, as well as to interpret and analyze essential issues involved in the change process and examine how these factors influenced the change process.

Somers, I develop an approach to personal writing specifically attuned to how (re)contextualization can assign new value to one\u2019s story in service of different individual or institutional goals\u2014for example, how an autobiography that once changed a homogenous literary landscape might later be tokenized as evidence of multiculturalism in lieu of systemic change. Rather than speculating about the individual intents of authors and their stories, I examine how these narratives network into communal traditions, beliefs, and practices, and how their value is continually reassigned at different sociocultural moments. In examining personal writing as relational rhetoric, I build on rhetoric and composition\u2019s historic commitment to deliberative democracy as well as its more recent return to issues of social justice.  \n\nThrough a commentary on the life writing of Gloria Anzald\u00faa and Richard Rodriguez, I examine how their (very different) narratives have been used to reshape normative conceptions of gender, ethnicity, sexuality, and spirituality\u2014 and how critical responses to these narratives continually refigure their value for public debates surrounding institutional practices and discrimination. Turning from the professional discourse of English studies to its pedagogical practice, the fourth chapter asks and answers: what is the work we ask students to do with their personal narratives, and how does that differ from the work we do as writers and scholars? Finally, I narrativize my own experience within different institutional contexts in order to explore first the limitations of the genres we are given for self-articulation, and second how a relational view of personal writing might allow us to expose those limitations, and to connect our experiences with others who have also been isolated by those barriers. My conclusion then reflects on how we might discuss, write, and teach personal writing with an eye toward its relationality\u2014with an understanding that the value of any given story is less an inherent trait than a product of its deployment, continually (re)constituted by evolving sociocultural contexts and conversations.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13528], "author_name_tesi": "Hsu, Vicki Chenyi", "last_name_ssi": "Hsu", "middle_name_ssi": "Chenyi", "first_name_ssi": "Vicki", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Debra Hawhee", "Debra Hawhee", "Suresh Canagarajah", "Ebony Coletu", "Rosemary Jane Jolly"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Debra Hawhee, Dissertation Advisor", "Debra Hawhee, Committee Chair", "Suresh Canagarajah, Committee Member", "Ebony Coletu, Committee Member", "Rosemary Jane Jolly, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rhetoric", "Composition", "Diversity", "Personal", "Narratives", "Multiculturalism"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF SELF-EXPLANATION AND METACOGNITIVE INSTRUCTION ON UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS\u2019 LEARNING OF STATISTICS MATERIALS CONTAINING  \nMULTIPLE EXTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS IN A \nWEB-BASED ENVIRONMENT\n\n", "id": "10307", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6913", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%;\">Students\nin the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields are\nconfronted with multiple external representations (MERs) in their learning\nmaterials. The ability to learn from and communicate with these MERs requires\nnot only that students comprehend each representation individually but also\nthat students recognize how the representations are related to one another.\nPast research has indicated that this integration of MERs is not automatic, and\nstudents need instructional support to master the learning and integration of\nMERs. Several researchers have investigated learning environments that included\npre-integrated MERs or interactive capability, but results have been mixed in\nterms of the effectiveness of these learning environments on enhancing\nlearning. Other researchers have indicated that students need support to guide\ntheir cognitive and metacognitive processes while learning with and integrating\nMERs, so they can engage in deeper learning.

It is possible that the lack of\nintervention effect resulted from ineffective instruction or prompts provided\nto the intervention groups. Another possible explanation is the requirement to\ntype thoughts for the control group engaged learners in self-explanations\nand/or MER integration, which helped the control group perform equally well as\nthe intervention groups on learning outcomes. The descriptive analysis\nindicated that there was a ceiling effect that the majority of participants in\nthis study received near maximum scores, which could fail to reveal the true\nvariability in scores and therefore the true effects of the interventions.\nSuggestions for future research and improvement in instructional design are\nprovided. The emerging hypotheses regarding the effects of interventions and\nmere requirement of typing thoughts on learning outcomes are worth further\ninvestigation for refining the design of the intervention. In addition, this\nstudy contributes to the area of researching MER integration by developing a\nreliable statistics test that requires integrating MERs in the question stem\nand the corresponding choices in order to score.

Researches have demonstrated the strong correlation between airborne particulate concentration and human health. Micron-sized particulate sources are commonly found in the enclosed indoor environment. Human activity is considered the main reason causing indoor particle resuspension, which leads to human secondary exposure to PM. However, no general rules have been established to empirically relate airborne particle concentration from resuspension with specific types of human activity. \nThis work studies the effects of electrostatic field, generated by human walking, a common human activity, on indoor particle resuspension. Particle resuspension forces, generated by human walking on indoor surface particles, can mainly be decomposed into three types: mechanical vibration, aerodynamic drag and electrostatic forces. A parametric study is carried out to compare the magnitudes of different particle resuspension force components, as well as the particle-surface adhesion force. The comparison shows that electrostatic force is a significant particle resuspension force, while the theoretically calculated particle adhesion force is much larger than each of the resuspension force components. This work suggests that real particle adhesion force is much smaller than the theoretically calculated values due to imperfect contact and thus the resuspension forces, introduced by human activity, can overcome the adhesion force to resuspend particles into the air. To testify this idea, experiments are designed to measure the real adhesion force between different particles and flooring materials with the electrostatic detachment method. \nThis work uses particle resuspension chamber as the major facility to systematically study the walking-induced electrostatic effects on particle resuspension. Experiments are designed to measure the floor surface electrostatic field strength that can be generated by human walking in indoor environment. The measured field strength profile is used for the electrostatic field simulation in the resuspension chamber experiments. The validity of the chamber experiments is testified by comparing the resuspension coefficients concluded from the resuspension chamber experiments with the results reported from field experiments. The results of chamber experiments show that the electrostatic fields introduced by human walking can have a significant influence on indoor particle resuspension. The electrostatic effects are strongly related with such factors as particle type, flooring type, relative humidity and field polarity. \nBesides, this work also studies the applicability of multizone airflow and contaminant dispersion model in simulating particle resuspension and dispersion in indoor environment with a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [797], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Bin ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Freihaut", "Stanley Allan Mumma", "William P Bahnfleth", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Freihaut, Committee Chair", "Stanley Allan Mumma, Committee Member", "William P Bahnfleth, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["particle resuspension", "walking", "electrostatic effect", "indoor environment"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Development of A Radio-Frequency Front-End for An Ice-Penetrating Radar", "id": "25364", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11159", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A radio-frequency (RF) front-end was developed for an ice-penetrating software-de\fned radar, which operates with a chirp frequency that ranges from 140-160 MHz generated by a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP).

These cells rapidly secrete IFN&#61543; upon stimulation with IL-12/IL-18 and are involved in innate responses to infection with Listeria monocytogenes.  The signals regulating these cells are unclear.  The Tec kinase Itk regulates T cell activation, and we report here that a majority of the CD8+ T cells in Itk null mice have a phenotype of CD44hi similar to memory like innate T cells. These cells are observed in mice carrying an Itk mutant lacking the kinase domain, indicating that active Tec kinase signaling suppresses their presence. These cells carry preformed message for IFN&#947; and are able to rapidly produce IFN&#61543; upon stimulation in vitro with IL-12/IL-18, and endow Itk null mice the ability to effectively respond to infection with L. monocytogenes or exposure to LPS by secretion of IFN&#61543;.  Transfer of these cells rescues the ability of IFN&#61543; null mice to reduce bacterial burden following L. monocytogenes infection indicating that these cells are functional CD8+CD44hi T cells previously detected in vivo.  These results indicate that active signals from Tec kinases regulate the development of memory like CD8+ T cells with innate function.\nIn addition to regulating the development of conventional and innate CD8+ T cells, the Tec family kinase Itk also regulates the development of CD4+ T cell lineages. We show here that Itk null mice have increased percentage of CD62LLoCD44Hi memory phenotype CD4+ T cells compared to WT mice. These cells can arise directly in the thymus, but do not require this organ for their development.  Instead MP CD4+ T cell development is bone marrow derived MHC Class II dependent, and independent of MHC Class II expression on the thymic epithelium.  These cells express high levels of transcripts for the T-bet and IFN&#947; and are able to produce IFN&#947; directly ex vivo in response to stimulation. Itk deficiency greatly decreases the number of CD4+ T cells with CD62LHiCD44Lo na\u00efve phenotype, but has no effect on the number of memory phenotype CD4+ T cells, indicating that the development of memory phenotype CD4+ T cells is Itk independent. We further show that the development of the na\u00efve phenotype CD4+ T cells is dependent on active Itk kinase signals and can be rescued by expression of Itk specifically in T cells, but not the Txk overexpression. Itk is required for functional TCR signaling in these cells, but not for the innate function in response to IL-12/IL-18 or L. monocytogenes stimulation. These results indicate that CD62LHiCD44Lo \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and CD62LLoCD44Hi \u201cinnate memory phenotype\u201d CD4+ T cells may be independent populations that differ in their requirement for Itk\u2019s signals for development.  Our data also suggest that CD4+CD62LLoCD44Hi memory phenotype T cells have innate immune function.  \nWe have also examined whether CD4/CD8 lineage choice is affected by a combination of TCR affinity and Itk by analyzing mice lacking Itk and carrying the low affinity TCR transgene OT-II, specific for a peptide in Ovalbumin. Our results show that OT-II/Itk-/- thymocytes receive reduced TCR signals, with a reduction in CD4+ T cell development. Surprisingly, these mice develop significant numbers of MHC class II restricted TCR transgenic CD8+ T cells that resemble non-conventional or innate memory phenotype CD8 T cells.  We also show that the development of these class II-restricted innate memory phenotype CD8+ T cells is bone marrow intrinsic, and may be the result of reduced TCR signaling in the absence of Itk resulting in reduced expression of the transcription factor, Th-POK, a master regulator of CD4 commitment. All together, these data suggest that Itk plays an important role in CD4/CD8 commitment by regulating signal thresholds for the lineage commitment.  Our data also suggest that the lower level of TCR signaling that occurs with a low affinity TCR in the absence of Itk can redirect MHC class II restricted CD4+ T cell to develop into class II-restricted CD8+ innate memory phenotype T cells.\nOverall our results suggest that loss of Itk differentially affects the development of conventional vs. non-conventional MP T cells and also plays important roles in CD4/CD8 lineage commitment.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3158], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Jianfang ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jianfang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Avery August", "Biao He", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Robert Paulson", "Na Xiong", "Wendy Hanna Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Avery August, Committee Chair", "Biao He, Committee Member", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Na Xiong, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Innate T cell", "Memory phenotype T cell", "Itk", "Tec family kinases", "Listeria Monocytogenes", "CD4/CD8 lineage commitment"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "ORCHESTRATING THE COMPILER AND MICROARCHITECTURE FOR REDUCING CACHE ENERGY", "id": "6286", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3269", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cache memories are widely employed in modern microprocessor designs to bridge the increasing speed gap between the processor and the off-chip main memory, which imposes the major performance bottleneck in computer systems.

First, a detailed cache behavior characterization for both array-based embedded applications and general-purpose applications was performed. The insights\nobtained from this study suggest that (1) different applications or different code segments within a single application have very different cache demands in the context of performance and energy concerns, (2) program execution footprints (instruction addresses) can be highly predictable and usually have a narrow scope during a particular execution phase, especially for embedded applications, (3) high sequentiality is presented in accesses to the instruction cache. Second, a technique called compiler-directed cache polymorphism (CDCP) was proposed. CDCP is used to analyze the data reuse\nexhibited by loop nests, and thus to extract the cache demands and determine the best data cache\nconfigurations for different code segments to achieve the best performance and energy behavior.\nThird, this thesis presents a redesigned processor datapath to capture and utilize the predictable execution footprint for reducing energy consumption in instruction caches.

To counteract these assaults, cells evolve a guarding system to regulate the DNA damage response, ranging from the sensing of DNA stresses to the activation of repair factors. Up to date, an increasing number of proteins have been reported to regulate DNA damage response and decide the life and death of cells. In this PhD dissertation, I will report my studies on the biological functions of two proteins involved in modulating the DNA damage response. The proteins are hepatoma-derived growth factor related protein 2 (HDGF2) and ovary, kidney and liver protein 38 (OKL38).\n\nHDGF2 belongs to the HDGF protein family with a conserved N-terminal PWWP domain and non-conserved C-termini. Many PWWP domain-containing proteins have been reported to recognize DNA and histone methyl-lysine residues, and regulate diverse biological events, such as transcription, DNA replication and repair. Here, I discovered that HDGF2 is a chromatin-associated factor during the whole cell cycle, and the PWWP domain of HDGF2 is responsible for its interaction with chromatin by binding to DNA and nucleosomes. In addition, HDGF2 regulates cell growth under both normal and DNA damage conditions. In cells without DNA damage induction, the deletion of HDGF2 accelerates cell growth while the increase in HDGF2 inhibits cell growth. During DNA damage, HDGF2 plays a protective role for cell survival and inhibits H2A.X phosphorylation associated with DNA double-strand breaks. Furthermore, mass spectrometry studies showed that HDGF2 can interact with proteins previously reported to regulate DNA damage repair, including the CK2 kinase, the FACT complex, and the HBO1 HAT complex. In sum, this study not only provides solid evidence on HDGF2 as chromatin factor, but also identifies its novel functions in regulating cell growth and the DNA damage response.\n\nIn addition to the HDGF2 project, I also characterized a novel downstream target of p53, OKL38, which relocates from nucleus to mitochondria upon forced expression to induce apoptosis. However, the mechanism underlying OKL38 targeting to mitochondria and apoptosis induction was unclear before my work. I found that OKL38 interactes with p53 to regulate mitochondria function. During DNA damage, OKL38 colocalizes with p53 to mitochondria in U2OS cells. Moreover, p53 and OKL38 are targeted to mitochondria in synergy: forced expression of OKL38 leads to p53 localization to mitochondria while the expression of a mitochondria enriched p53 polymorphic variant, p53R72, leads to OKL38 enrichment in mitochondria. Biochemical analyses revealed that OKL38 and p53 interact in vivo and in vitro via multiple domains. In cell biological assays, multiple regions of OKL38 mediate its mitochondria localization and induce mitochondria morphology changes. OKL38 induces formation of megamitochondria and increases cellular levels of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, OKL38 induces cytochrome c release upon incubation with mitochondria. In sum, our studies suggest that OKL38 regulates mitochondria morphology and functions during apoptosis together with p53.\nTaken together, my studies found that HDGF2 and OKL38 are regulators of DNA damage response, leading to cell survival or apoptosis, respectively. These data will enrich our knowledge to mechanisms underlying the determination of cellular outcomes when DNA damage occurs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8776], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Jing ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yanming Wang", "Yanming Wang", "David Scott Gilmour", "Ying Gu", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Na Xiong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yanming Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Yanming Wang, Committee Chair", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Ying Gu, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Na Xiong, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HDGF2", "OKL38", "Cell growth", "Apoptosis", "DNA damage response"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "APPLICATION OF A LOCAL GRID REFINEMENT PROTOCOL TO ANALYZE THE PERFORMANCE OF RESERVOIR SYSTEMS WITH COMPLEX WELL ARCHITECTURES\n\n", "id": "12607", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3927", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Complex architecture multi-lateral wells are relatively new applications in oil and gas field developments because they increase the productivity, reduce the cost of the development, and decrease the footprint and ultimately leading to increased profitability of unconventional oil/gas field projects.

The limited resources, such as exhaustible battery life, moderate processing ability and finite bandwidth, restrict the system\u2019s ability to simultaneously accommodate all missions that are submitted by users. In order to achieve the optimal profit in such dynamic conditions, the value of each mission, quantified by its demand on resources and achievable profit, need to be properly evaluated in different situations.\n\nIn practice, uncertainties may exist in the entire execution of a mission, thus should not be ignored. For a single mission, uncertainty, such as unreliable wireless medium and variable quality of sensor outputs, both demands and profits of the mission may not be deterministic and may be hard to predict precisely. Moreover,\nthroughout the process of execution, each mission may experience multiple states, the transitions between which may be affected by different conditions. Even if the current state of a mission is identified, because multiple potential transitions may occur each leading to different consequences, the subsequent state cannot be confirmed until the transition actually occurs. In systems with multiple missions, each with uncertainties, a more complicated circumstance arises, in which the strategy for resource allocation among missions needs to be modified adaptively and dynamically based on both the present status and potential evolution of all missions.\n\nIn our research, we take into account several levels of uncertainties that may be faced when allocating limited resources in dynamic environments as described above, where the concepts of missions that require resources may be matched to those as in certain network applications. Our algorithms calculate resource allocation solutions to corresponding scenarios and always aim to achieve high profit, as well as other performance improvements (e.g., resource utilization rate, mission preemption rate, etc.).\n\nGiven a fixed set of missions, we consider both demands and profits as random variables, whose values follow certain distributions and may change over time. Since the profit is not constant, rather than achieving a specific maximized profit, our objective is to select the optimal set of missions so as to maximize a certain percentile of their combined profit, while constraining the probability of resource capacity violation within an acceptable threshold. Note that, in this scenario, the selection of missions is final and will not change after the decision has been made. Therefore, this static solution only fits in the applications with long-term running missions.\n\nFor the scenarios with both long-term and short-term missions, to increase the total achieved profit, instead of selecting a fixed mission set, we propose a dynamic strategy which tunes mission selections adaptively to the changing environments. We take a surveillance application as an example, where missions are targeting\nspecific sets of events, and both demands and profits of a mission depend on which event is actually occurring. To some extent resources should be focused on those high-valued events with a high probability of occurring; on the other hand, resources should also be distributed to gain an understanding of the overall condition of the environment. We develop Self-Adaptive Resource Allocation algorithm (SARA) to model mission execution as Markov processes, in which the states are decided by the combination of occurring events. In this case, resources need to be allocated before the events actually occur, otherwise, the mission will miss the event due to lack of support. Therefore, a prediction as to which events are about to occur is necessary, and when the prediction fails, in exchange of the loss of profit, the mistakenly allocated resources collect information to assist prediction in the future.\n\nWhen the transitions between mission states can be controlled by taking certain maneuvers at the proper time, the probability of the cases when missions transit to lower profit states may be decreased. As a consequence, sometimes a loss of profit may be avoided. We model this problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process, and\npropose Action-Drive Operation Model With Evaluation of Risk and Executability (ADOM-ERE) to calculate optimal maneuvers. One challenge is that the state transitions can be affected not only by states and actions, but also by external risks and competition for resources. On one hand, external risks (e.g., a DoS attack) may change the existing transition probabilities between states; on the other hand, taking actions to avoid lower profit states may require special constrained resources.\n\nAs a result, sometimes lower profit missions may not choose its optimal action because of resource exhaustion. ADOM-ERE considers all of states, actions, risks and competition when searching for the optimal allocation solution, and is available for both scenarios in which resources for actions are managed either centralized or managed in a distributed way.\n\nNumerical simulation are performed for all algorithms, and the results are compared with several competitive works to show that our solutions are better in terms of higher profit achieved in corresponding settings.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13287], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Nan ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas F Laporta", "Thomas F Laporta", "Patrick Drew Mcdaniel", "Sencun Zhu", "Costas D Maranas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas F Laporta, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Chair", "Patrick Drew Mcdaniel, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Costas D Maranas, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stochastic resource allocation", "markov decision process", "uncertainty", "sensor network"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Phase-field Models of Microstructure Evolution in a System with Elastic Inhomogeneity and Defects", "id": "6229", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5960", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nSolid state phase transformations are often utilized to control materials microstructures and thus properties. Quantitative understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of phase transformations and the accompanying microstructure evolution can provide a scientific basis for designing advanced materials. In this thesis, the phase-field approach is employed to study the effect of elastic inhomogeneity and structural defects on phase separation kinetics and morphological evolution in bulk and film systems, the precipitation of theta prime phase (Al2Cu) in Al-Cu alloys, and solute strengthening of alloys.\n\n An accurate and efficient iteration method is proposed to solve the mechanical equilibrium equations in a solid with elastic inhomogeneity.  By combining the iteration method for calculating the elastic energy and a semi-implicit spectral method for solving the Cahn\u00e2\u20ac\u201cHilliard equation an extremely efficient phase-field model is developed for studying morphological evolution in coherent systems with large elastic inhomogeneity. The morphological dependence of isolated particles as well as a phase separated multi-particle system on the degree of elastic inhomogeneity is systematically studied.\n\nThe iteration method is further extended to a thin film system with the simultaneous presence of dislocations, compositional strains and a substrate constraint. Spinodal decomposition in a thin film with periodically distributed arrays of interfacial dislocations is simulated. The results show that the periodic stress field associated with the array of interfacial dislocations leads to a directional phase separation and the formation of ordered microstructures. It is demonstrated that when the period of the dislocation array becomes small, the wave length of the ordered microstructure tends to be the same as that of the dislocation array. The results have important implications that an ordered nanostructure could be designed by controlling the interfacial dislocation distribution.\n\nThe metastable theta prime (Al2Cu) precipitates are one of the primary strengthening precipitates in Al-Cu alloys. They are of a plate-like shape with strong interfacial energy and mobility anisotropies. A phase-field model which can automatically incorporate the thermodynamic and kinetic information from databases is developed. The relationships between phase-field model parameters and material thermodynamic and kinetic properties are established. Systematic simulations of   growth in 1D, 2D and 3D are carried out. The growth of a single   precipitate in 1D exactly reproduces the results from analytical solutions. The equilibrium shape simulated in two dimensions is in good agreement with that predicted by the Wulff construction based on the interfacial energy anisotropy. 2D and 3D simulations produce typical precipitate morphologies and precipitate configurations that are observed in prior experiments. The simulation results on the growth of an isolated precipitate in 2D show that the lengthening is diffusion-controlled, and follows the   growth law whereas the thickening follows the   growth law. The elastic energy associated with the lattice mismatch between the precipitate and the matrix was shown to speed up the lengthening while decrease the thickening and coarsening process. The phase-field model can serve as a basis for quantitative understanding of the influence of elastic energy, interface energy anisotropy and interface mobility anisotropy on the precipitation of theta prime in Al-Cu alloys. \n\nPrecipitates and solutes are commonly used to strengthen alloys. A phase field model of dislocation dynamics, which employs 12 order parameter fields to describe the dislocation distribution in a single fcc crystal, and one composition field to describe the solute distribution, is developed for a binary alloy. This model is able to simulate phase transformation, solute diffusion, dislocation motion as well as their interaction under applied stresses. A new functional form for describing the eigenstrains of dislocations is constructed, which eliminates the dependence of the magnitude of the dislocation Burgers vector on applied stresses and provides a correct dislocation stress field. A relationship between dislocation velocity and applied stresses is obtained by theoretical analysis, which can be used to determine phase-field model parameters with kinetic data of dislocation mobility. The effect of dislocation velocities on Cottrell atmosphere, and the dynamic dragging force of Cottrell atmosphere on the dislocation motion are simulated. The results demonstrate that the phase-field model correctly describes the long-range elastic interactions and short-range interaction that determines dislocation reactions. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5954], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Shenyang ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shenyang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen", "David John Green", "Qiang Du", "Zi Kui Lui"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen, Committee Chair", "David John Green, Committee Chair", "Qiang Du, Committee Member", "Zi Kui Lui, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Phase-field model", "microstructure evolution", "precipitation in alloys", "interfacial energy anisotropy", "interface mobility anisotropy", "dislocations", "thin film and elastic inhomogeneity."]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Essays in Pure and Applied Game Theory\n", "id": "9896", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6288", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of three chapters.\n\nChapter 1 presents an axiomatization of expected utility from the frequentist perspective. It starts with a preference relation on the set of infinite sequences with limit relative frequencies. We consider three axioms parallel to the ones for the vN-M expected utility theory. Limit relative frequencies correspond to probability values in lotteries in the vN-M theory. This correspondence is used to show that each of our axioms is equivalent to the corresponding vN-M axiom in the sense that the former is an exact translation of the latter.  As a result, a representation theorem is established: The preference relation is represented by an average of utilities with weights given by the relative frequencies.\n\nChapter 2 reconsiders solutions to the problem of coexistence of money and higher-return substitute of media-of-exchange using imperfect recognizability. Most of the literature on imperfect recognizability focuses on pooling equilibrium and some of it assumes a zero cost of counterfeiting. We replace the zero-cost assumption with a positive cost of counterfeiting, and place the analysis within a signalling game framework in which the intuitive criterion is invoked. With these assumptions, there is no equilibrium in which only money is traded. In particular, if the cost of counterfeiting the substitutes is small, then there is no monetary equilibrium. Therefore, the counterfeiting of substitutes for money can be a threat to monetary systems. This result provides a new rationale for legal restrictions that prohibit substitute media-of-exchange.\n\nChapter 3 gives a new theory of mixed strategies in zero-sum games. Unpredictable behavior is central for optimal play in many strategic\nsituations because a predictable pattern leaves a player vulnerable to exploitation. A theory of unpredictable behavior is presented in the context of repeated two-person zero-sum games in which the stage games have no pure strategy\nequilibrium. Players are endowed with sets of feasible functions to generate their strategies. Two dimensions of complexity of these feasible functions are considered: one considers the computability relation and the other considers Kolmogorov complexity. Equilibrium existence is shown under a sufficient condition called mutual complexity. A close characterization of unpredictable strategies is obtained using the criterion stochasticity. In particular, this characterization implies that the failure of some statistical properties of randomness does not justify rejection of equilibrium play.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6288], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Tai-Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tai-Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Neil Wallace", "Edward James Green", "Stephen George Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Dissertation Advisor", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Neil Wallace, Committee Chair", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "Stephen George Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["effective randomness", "zero-sum game", "mixed strategy", "frequency theory of probability", "objective probability", "Kolmogorov complexity", "signaling games", "monetary system", "cash-in-advance", "counterfeiting", "game theory", "decision theory", "expected utility"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "EVOLUTIONARY AND FUNCTIONAL STUDIES OF \nA ZINC FINGER HOMEODOMAIN PROTEIN FAMILY\n\n", "id": "6850", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6613", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Genomic and reverse genetic approaches were used to identify and study new genes important for plant development. Initially, a subtractive Arabidopsis floral cDNA library was characterized by sequencing and analyzing a subset of 1579 EST sequences that represented 1209 unigenes. These ESTs provided new evidence for the expression of putative or hypothetical genes and helped refine the transcript annotation for some genes. 86 regulatory genes including transcription factors and protein kinases were identified from this EST dataset. Expression of these floral genes was further characterized using home-designed and \u00a8Cprinted cDNA microarray chips. It showed that many floral genes were expressed at low levels. Furthermore, 97 genes were identified as flower-preferential ones in comparison to the leaf.\n\n\nThe above work led to the identification of a novel plant-specific family of zinc finger homeodomain proteins (ZHD). Proteins of this family were also reported from the C4 plant Flaveria. ZHD proteins have an N-terminal putative zinc finger, and a C-terminal atypical homeodomain distantly related to all known homeodomains. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the ZHD family originated as early as from the non-vascular plant Physcomitrella, and could be divided into 6 clades, with Clade I, II and III most conserved, Clade IV mid-level divergent, and Clade V and VI most divergent.  A new subfamily named as MINI ZINC FINGER (MIF) was also identified that has only the N-terminal zinc finger domain of the ZHD proteins. Current evidence suggested that the MIF proteins were derived from the ZHD proteins by loss of the homeodomain and then evolved separately. In addition, examination of evolutionary relationship, gene duplication, gene expression and mutant screening of Arabidopsis ZHD genes implied a high level of gene functional redundancy among this family.\n\n\nThe function of three Arabidopsis MIF genes was characterized by gain-of-function approaches. Constitutive overexpression of MIF1 caused dramatic developmental defects, including dwarfism, reduced apical dominance, extreme longevity, dark-green leaves, altered flower morphology, poor fertility, reduced hypocotyl length, spoon-like cotyledons, reduced root growth, and ectopic root hairs on hypocotyls and cotyledons. In addition, 35S::MIF1 seedlings underwent constitutive photomorphogenesis in the dark, with root growth similar to that in the light. 35S::MIF1 seedlings were further demonstrated to be non-responsive to gibberellin (GA) for cell elongation, hypersensitive to the GA synthesis inhibitor PAC and abscisic acid (ABA), and hyposensitive to auxin, brassinosteroid and cytokinin. Consistent with these observations, genome-scale expression profiling revealed that 35S::MIF1 seedlings exhibited decreased expression of genes involved in GA, auxin and brassinosteroid signaling as well as cell elongation/expansion, and increased expression of ABA-responsive genes. 35S::MIF2 and 35S::MIF3 transgenic plants exhibited similar phenotypes of 35S::MIF1 plants. On the basis of these results, it was proposed that the MIF proteins or the protein(s) with which they interact are involved in mediating the regulation of plant development by multiple hormones. \n\n\nOverexpression of MIF1 or MIF3 also disrupted the determinate growth of leaves by inducing ectopic shoot meristems along leaf margins. We demonstrated that the ectopic meristems occurred specifically in the marginal region corresponding to the serration sinus of late rosette leaves in an ERECTA-dependent manner. Expression of STM was activated in these ectopic meristems. Altered GA and auxin response and/or level were implicated in the occurrence of ectopic meristems. Thus, this study provided insights for the sinus of leaf margin as a suppressed domain that maintains the potential for regenerating meristems. Furthermore, 35S::MIF1 and 35S::MIF3 transgenic plants may provide a new genetic system for dissecting the molecular mechanisms that suppress indeterminate growth in leaves and for understanding the interactions between hormones and meristem activity.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6611], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Ma", "Claude W De Pamphilis", "Teh Hui Kao", "Paula C Mc Steen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Ma, Committee Chair", "Claude W De Pamphilis, Committee Member", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Paula C Mc Steen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["floral ESTs", "MIF", "ZHD", "zinc finger homeodomain proteins", "gene family evolution", "plant hormones", "seedling development", "shoot meristem", "leaf serration", "Arabidopsis"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH MEDIAN RELATED CRASH FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY\n\n", "id": "10988", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6615", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study analyzed the frequency and severity of three median-related crash types, including: cross-median and rollover crashes on rural highways with earth-divided, traversable medians and no median barrier, and median barrier crashes on rural highways with longitudinal median barriers. Data from multi-lane, limited-access, rural highway segments in Pennsylvania and North Carolina over a five-year period were used for the analysis. This study included analysis employing data regarding  median barrier offset from the edge of the traveled way, median barrier type, and the cross-slopes of the median, which traditionally have not been available for consideration in past median-related crash frequency and severity models.\n\nBoth five-year aggregated and yearly crash frequencies were analyzed. To account for road segment random effects (unobserved heterogeneity) and serial correlation in the yearly crash frequency data, random-effects Poisson and negative binomial (NB) regression models were estimated, as were pooled Poisson and NB models. Also, Gaussian process-based spatial generalized linear models (SGLM) were estimated to account for the potential spatially dependent random effects in modeling crash frequencies along adjacent roadway segments. Crash severities were estimated using binary, multinomial, and nested logit models.\n\nThe modeling results confirmed the importance of median design characteristics, such as median foreslopes, median backslopes, median width, and median barrier placement and type on median-related crash frequency and severity. While flatter and narrower medians were associated with an increase in cross-median crash frequency and severity, steeper median side-slopes significantly increased rollover and median barrier crash frequency and severity. Although the presence of median barriers resulted in more median-related crashes, it likely prevented more severe crashes from occurring, such as cross-median and rollovers crashes. \n\nThe modeling results also showed that curved road segments and higher daily traffic volumes led to more median-related crashes. Left shoulder rumble strips were associated with fewer median-related crashes. For median-related crash severity, the use of seatbelts significantly decreased the probability of high-severity outcomes given a crash. The presence of interchange entrance ramps and horizontal curves were associated with increased probabilities of higher-severity outcomes.\n\nSimulations were performed to compare the predictive capabilities of the estimated SGLMs and the classical/panel count models. The simulation results showed that SGLMs generally predicted crash frequencies that were closer to the observed values with narrower prediction intervals than the classical count models, by borrowing information from neighboring road segments. It was found that SGLMs could be utilized to detect road sites with crash frequencies significantly higher than adjacent road segments. \n\nTransferability tests were performed to test the transferability of the estimated crash frequency models between the two states.

Solution-gated silicon (Si) nanowire field effect transistors (NWFETs) were investigated to add new functionality to Si complementary metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuits. Axially doped n+-p--n+ Si nanowires grown by the vapor-liquid-solid technique were integrated and optimized for robust and reliable operation in a buffer solution. The stability of the electrical response at a constant pH value as well as the sensitivity to changes in pH were significantly improved by using a stack of thermal silicon dioxide (SiO2) and atomic layer deposited aluminum oxide (Al2O3) as the gate dielectric as compared to a SiO2 gate dielectric alone. These devices exhibited reproducible response, consistent threshold voltage, low subthreshold swing, long-term stability, high pH sensitivity, and gate voltage dependent dynamic range. The integration and measurement strategy described in this thesis lays the groundwork for future multiplexed nanobiosensor chips based on arrays of Si NWFETs.\n\n\n  A new nanofabrication technique was developed to convert high-aspect-ratio Si nanowires into free-standing one dimensional (1D) arrays of Au nanoparticles encapsulated in a SiO2 shell. The diameter and the interparticle spacing of the Au nanoparticles in the array were defined by tailoring the sidewall profile of the starting Si nanowire to have a scalloped pattern with controllable peak-to-valley distances (or scalloping wavelength). During the thermal oxidation of Au-coated Si nanowires, the Au migrates to the core of the oxidized Si wire to form a Au wire with a diameter that follows the undulation of the original scalloped profile. With increasing thermal treatment, the Au wire breaks into separate teardrop-shaped segments in the regions of the wires having the smallest diameter, and is converted from a teardrop shape into a spherical particle to reduce the total surface area and thus the surface energy of the entire nanostructure. This powerful new synthesis method enables the fabrication of free-standing 1D Au nanoparticle array encapsulated in a uniform SiO2 shell with controlled Au particle diameter and interparticle spacing. This opens the door to many new plasmonic optical devices based on noble metal nanoparticle arrays.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6582], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Wenchong ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenchong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Douglas Henry Werner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Dissertation Advisor", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Chair", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cumtomizable gold nanoparticle array", "field effect transistor", "silicon nanowire", "pH sensor", "stabililty"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "THIRD-PARTY LIBRARY SECURITY MANAGEMENT FOR MOBILE APPLICATIONS", "id": "13459wxh180", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13459", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, the Android operating system has had an explosive growth in the number of applications containing third-party libraries for different purposes. In this thesis, we identify three library-centric threats in the real-world Android application markets: (i) the library modification threat, (ii) the masquerading threat and (iii) the aggressive library threat. These three threats cannot effectively be fully addressed by existing defense mechanisms such as software analysis, anti-virus software and anti-repackaging techniques. The limitation of existing mechanisms is that the existing mechanisms ignore the fact the library and applications coexist, but are from different stakeholder in the ecosystem.\nFor existing libraries, related security problems in applications, we propose a library integrity verification tool for Android applications at application stores. This is non-trivial because the Android application build process merges library code and application-specific logic into a single binary file. Our approach uses reverse-engineering to achieve integrity verification. The evaluation results also provide empirical insight into the library integrity situation in the wild.\nIn addition, third-party libraries are detected to contain potentially malicious behaviors. With the Android security model, the core logic and the third-party library share permissions. Solutions are provided to enforce library isolation. Unfortunately, libraries in the isolation still share some permissions with the core logic. In order to generate distinct policies for third-party libraries, we need to know which part of libraries works for the core logic.\nExisting analysis tools cannot differentiate libraries' behaviors assisting for the application's main functionality from libraries' behaviors for itself because of two limitations: 1) the analysis cannot do backwards analysis; 2) the analysis cannot distinguish different stakeholders within one application. This shortcoming leads to the difficulty of creating a precise policy for library isolation solutions. The missing part is the intra-app cross-stakeholder data-flow analysis. To address it, we propose a callsite-aware bidirectional static analysis tool. The tool enables to classify the Android framework APIs in libraries into six categories. The classification information can be used to generate polices.

Smartphones have become the primary computing platform for users to check emails, browse webpages, watch videos, etc. Most of these applications rely on data access through wireless interfaces. However, if the wireless interfaces were not properly used, they would drain out the battery quickly. Therefore, it is an urgent call to study the power characteristics of wireless interfaces and reduce their energy consumption.\n\nThe specific goal of this dissertation is to optimize the energy consumption of smartphones in wireless networks. Specifically, this dissertation has four foci. First, we design a traffic aggregation algorithm to reduce energy for the cellular networks. The cellular interface has to spend an extra amount of energy (called the tail energy) after each data transmission. Aggregating multiple tasks together helps to amortize the tail energy, but the aggregation opportunity is rare on a single user since tasks are sparse in general. To solve this problem, our solution is to do traffic aggregation on multiple users. We introduce a heuristic algorithm to search for the optimal aggregation schedule offline, and then design an efficient online algorithm, which can be deployed on smartphones directly. Second, we propose a quality-aware traffic offloading framework to save energy. In cellular networks, different cellular carriers generally provide different service quality (in terms of signal strength and throughput) in the same location. Based on this finding, we propose to offload the traffic to neighboring nodes with better service quality. This framework is implemented on Android platforms and supports the upper layer applications transparently. Third, we reduce the energy for mobile video streaming, which is the largest traffic on smartphones. Most video streaming solutions prefer to buffer lots of content and then turn the wireless interface off to save energy. However, if a user skips this solution may waste energy and bandwidth. In contrast, using a small buffer can reduce the bandwidth wastage, but may consume more energy as the wireless interface is frequency used. We propose a solution to detect the user skipping by listening to the screen touching events, and then select the most energy efficient buffer size based on user behaviors. Finally, we propose a mobility-assisted user contact detection (MAUC) algorithm to save energy for Bluetooth. Bluetooth is widely used to scan for the appearance/disappearance of nearby users (called user contacts). To get accurate results, frequent scans should be used, but consume lots of energy. We notice that the changing of user contacts is caused by user movements and then analyze the relationship between these two events from real measurement. Based on the findings we design the MAUC algorithm. In MAUC, energy-friendly accelerometer is used to detect the user movement, and Bluetooth scan is only used when the user movement has a high possibility to impact the user contact.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11701], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Wenjie ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenjie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Guohong Cao", "Sencun Zhu", "Peng Liu", "Le Bao", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Dissertation Advisor", "Guohong Cao, Committee Chair", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Peng Liu, Committee Member", "Le Bao, Committee Member", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Energy", "Smartphones", "Wireless Networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATION OF HEAT SHOCK RESPONSES IN VARIOUS CELL LINES\n\n", "id": "11983", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6583", "abstract_tesi": "Subjecting cells to elevated temperature induces heat shock responses including the inhibition of general protein synthesis and induction of specific heat shock proteins functioning mostly in cytoplasm. It was found out that severe heat stress (45 degrees) elicited phosphorylation of eIF2alpha which was enough to shut down translation while little or no eIF2alpha phosphorylation was detected under mild heat stress (41-42 degrees), indicating that the adaptive response in the latter involved more complicated mechanisms. Preliminary results of AD293 cells at 40 degrees showed Bip induction and instant eIF2alpha phosphorylation for the first time, which led us to further investigate possible connections between heat shock and ER stress. The two stress systems share many similarities including the regulation process and two specific groups of chaperones may play important roles in development physiologically besides their functions in stress response. Our study of heat shock on other cell lines showed consistent induction of GADD34 mRNA which was dependent on eIF2alpha phosphorylation as well as the activation of IRE1 pathway which may be separately induced. In summary, we hypothesized that two patterns of response exist in mild heat stress and instant eIF2alpha phosphorylation may be a possible explanation why it was not detected in earlier researches. Our work is helpful revealing the physiological mechanisms of the adaptive response because the temperature we used in the study is 40 degrees, a temperature even lower than what was applied experimentally to induce mild heat stress but fits the normal febrile-range hypothermia (37.5-40.0C). \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6581], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Wenli ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenli", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heat shock", "cell lines"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "DATA MINING ON CORPORATE FILLING BASED ON BAYESIAN LEARNING APPROACH", "id": "25731", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11347", "abstract_tesi": "Most of the researches on corporate filling mainly focus on qualitative analysis.

The inherent system variability and perturbations from external environment continuously challenge the central nervous system (CNS) during the control of movement. The general purpose of this study is to investigate the role of variability (both internal and external to the system) in the control of movement and motor learning. A virtual throwing task was adopted as a model task where different movement executions lead to the same task performance. Subjects manipulated a lever arm with a single-joint elbow movement and released a virtual ball that traversed a concentric force field to hit a target. From basic mechanics, release angle and velocity at ball release fully determined the ball trajectory and hitting success. Based on this task a nonlinear solution manifold representing the set of all solutions to the task was calculated. Experiment 1 tested whether subjects were sensitive to motor variability and find solutions in the solution manifold with least error-sensitivity and whether subjects preferred solutions with minimum velocity. Results showed that with practice solutions became aligned with the solution manifold and concentrated at the most error-tolerant locations. The individually chosen velocities at release covered a wide range suggesting that subjects did not gravitate to minimum velocity. Even with prolonged practice, subjects still had substantial variability in error-sensitive dimension. Experiment 2 investigated whether the control of movement accuracy and variability could benefit from the enhancement of potentially perturbing information. Based on stochastic resonance (SR), detection of sensory signals can be enhanced in the presence of externally added noise. Error-dependent noise was added to the angle of ball release; this essentially enhanced the result variability of throws via visual feedback to the subjects. In addition, the threshold signaling successful hits was lowered. Results showed that subjects significantly improved accuracy and reduced motor variability with enhanced error information compared with controls. This improved performance was retained for a prolonged period even after removal of the enhanced error information. These results showed that the CNS can alter its motor strategy to compensate for perturbations from the internal system and external environment. The control of movement can be enhanced by external noise via SR. Experiment 3 examined different magnitudes of noise to examine whether SR was present. Four different levels of error-dependent noise were added to the angle of ball release. The results showed that an optimal level of noise best enhanced the control of movement accuracy and variability comparing with three other noise levels. This work indicated that with externally added optimal level of noise, the CNS could adapt and further decrease its internal noise. Taken together, the three studies provided insight on how the CNS selects control strategies in the present of sensorimotor variability and perturbations from the environment. It extended our understanding on the role of intrinsic and extrinsic variability during the control of movement. It suggested possible intervention protocols for motor learning and rehabilitation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6669], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Xiaogang ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaogang", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell", "Dagmar Sternad"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell, Thesis Advisor", "Dagmar Sternad, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Motor control", "Motor learning", "Variability"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "CONSTRAINTS, REDUNDANCY, AND PATTERNS OF FORCE COORDINATION\n\n", "id": "12084", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13290", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation used a bimanual asymmetric force coordination task to investigate the interactive influence of multiple categories of constraints on the organization of redundant force coordination.  The force asymmetry was manipulated by imposing different coefficients on the finger forces such that the relative contribution of the individual force to the total force could be changed.  The amount of visual information of the force output was manipulated in different conditions.  Three primary questions were addressed in the dissertation.  (1) Whether and how the relative influence of the different categories of constraints are modified and consequently new force coordination patterns are formed when the task asymmetry is changed.  (2) Whether the influence of visual information on the force coordination patterns is dependent on the settings of the task asymmetry.  (3) How aging processes reorganize the influence of the constraints on force coordination and control patterns.  The results revealed that there was a decrement in performance outcome when there was an asymmetric task constraint, less visual information, and with advanced age.  The results also showed flexible force coordination patterns in response to the changes in constraints.  (1) The young adult participants adapted the force coordination patterns to the task asymmetry flexibly.  The models of constraints indicated that a coefficient-dependent efficient strategy rather than a minimum-variance strategy was used.  (2) The amount of visual information had a moderate influence on force coordination, which depends on the conditions of task asymmetry.  (3) With less visual information, the elderly exhibited reduced adaptability to the task asymmetry; however, they had the same extent of adaptability as the young group when enhanced visual information was provided.  The models of constraints reveal that the goal of the system is not to find solutions that lead to a perfect task performance but to find solutions that satisfy the constraints from different categories.  Overall, the results support the proposition that redundant force coordination and control patterns are organized by the interactive influence of different categories of constraints.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12836], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Xiaogang ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaogang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl M.

Bioabsorbability has become one of the most important factors needed to be considered when screening materials to design these devices. There is a pool of bioabsorbable materials available for medical uses. Some of them originate from synthetic polymers, such as polyesters including poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), and some of them originate from naturally derived polymers, such as collagen and chitosan. Most of these materials have been commercially used in diverse implantable medical devices including surgical sutures, vascular grafts, blood vessels, drug delivery, and orthopedic devices. However, deficiencies still existed in these materials. For example, some acidic degradation products from polyesters might be able to impact local pH resulting in adverse consequence in tissue regeneration. Some naturally derived polymers, such as collagen, might give rise to immune rejection response when the xenograft occurs. Accordingly, novel materials for making next-generation implantable medical devices need to be developed. \n    Bacterial cellulose (BC), a polymer of glucose, is becoming one of the most effective candidates for medical uses due to its predominant ability of fluid exchange, benign degradation product and very good biocompatibility. However, non-bioabsorption of BC in the human body limits its application in implantable medical devices.  Our current work, accordingly, is focused on altering non-bioabsorbable bacterial cellulose to in-body bioabsorbable bacterial cellulose (BBC). \n    To achieve in-body bioabsorption of BC, an enzymatic incorporating technique was used in studies to engineer a novel BC. The enzymatic incorporating technique was accomplished via a double lyophilizing process. Two methods, incorporating cellulases to BC without or along with buffer ingredients, were subsequently used to examine in-vitro biodegradability of BBC materials. The first method screened various single cellulases and their combination in terms of lifetime of cellulases in an environment presenting a suboptimal pH value (6.5-7.0). Results revealed that BBC samples containing acidic cellulases presented relatively good degradability in environments with different pH values from 4.5 to 7.4, while those BBC samples containing neutral/alkaline cellulases exhibited inverse results, suggesting that pure neutral/alkaline cellulases might not be able to work on pure BC because their substrates are usually alkali celluloses, such as carboxylmethylcellulose. The second method related to the use of buffer ingredients. Here, the incorporation of buffer ingredients to BBC material was expected to manipulate wound local pH preserving the optimal activity of cellulases. Results showed that incorporated buffer ingredients appeared to have helped form an optimal pH microenvironment for cellulases and the released glucose was accordingly increased from approximately 30% without incorporated buffer ingredients to 97% in the presence of buffer ingredients in an environment with a pH value of 7.4. Meanwhile, the use of simulated tissue padding in the study played an important role, which showed that it could improve degradation performance of almost all BBC samples and enhance glucose release up to 97%. Most of BBC samples lost 80% of their integrity after 2 days, however, it is believed that the degradation rate of BC may be manipulated by varying cellulase loads as long as the incorporated cellulases are still active. In addition, BBC samples containing cellulases and buffer ingredients exhibited very good wet mechanical properties including high strength (18.65 MPa), good extensibility (7.04%) and reasonable stiffness (Young\u2019s modulus 0.381 GPa), suggesting that the mechanical properties of BBC materials would be able to meet requirements of materials as the temporary substitute for human tissues in future clinical uses. \n    Results from subsequent in-vitro and in-vivo biocompatibility assays of BBC samples revealed a very good biocompatibility between cells examined (human fibroblast and human osteoblast) and both unmodified BC and BBC. The resulting BBC samples appeared to be more appropriate for facilitating the growth of human osteoblast, suggesting a future application of BC in bone-type tissue engineering or scaffolds. The assessment from an in-vivo animal model study revealed that BBC samples in the presence of high cellulase load (6 mg/a piece of BBC; 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 cm) and buffer ingredients with pH 4.0 exhibited better wound healing performance and achieved better progressive degradation than sample pieces with low cellulase load. The load of cellulases did not appear to impact wound healing as compared to control samples. \n    Next, a unique spherelike structure of BC synthesized by specific cellulose producing bacterial strain (Gluconacetobacter xylinum JCM 9730) was evaluated and characterized. Cell assays of human osteoblast on these spheres exhibited good cell viability, which makes it being considered to use spherelike BC in developing specific biomedical materials, such as bone-type tissue scaffolds. These cellulose spheres varied in size from approximately 0.5 to 8 mm under different cultivation rotational speeds. The observation under field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) revealed that cellulose spheres obtained at 150 rpm orbitally rotational speed (ORS) were hollow with a layered outer shell, while cellulose spheres obtained at 125 rpm ORS showed a layered outer shell and an unlayered, cellulose fiber filled center. Many extraneous factors could affect the formation of spherelike BC other than the rotational speed. The results revealed that cellulose fibers left in the initial inoculum did not play a role in the formation of cellulose spherical structure. In addition, more inoculum in the initial medium failed to cause spheres to grow in size, and the use of different initial glucose concentrations did not dramatically impact size or number of cellulose spheres. The optimal fermentation parameters, in order to obtain more cellulose spheres, were 2 ml inoculum ((1.6 \u2013 4.6 )\u00d7105 CFU/ml) and 20 g/L initial glucose concentration at 125 rpm ORS in a 250 ml of Erlenmeyer flask. \n    Undoubtedly, the application of BC is always limited by its low yield and high cost. The last study, accordingly, focused on cellulose production. 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), a potent inhibitor of plant growth, was first used in this study to investigate its effect on the yield of Gluconacetobacter xylinum and its cellulose production. Results revealed that a higher biomass yield was achieved when using culture medium excluding 1-MCP while bacterial cellulose yield was low in this case. Cellulose with 15.6% more production (1-MCP added on day 1) and 25.4% more production (1-MCP added on each assigned day) was achieved when using culture medium containing 1-MCP while biomass yield was low in this case. This suggested that 1-MCP was able to impact cell activity probably because it can maintain vigorous growth of bacterial cells resulting in the enhancement of cellulose production up to 25.4% over controls.\n    Finally, a summary is presented, and future work is envisioned as well. These efforts expand the application of BBC materials and improve its structure. Typical work includes using hydroxyapatite to functionalize BBC, optimizing the porosity of bacterial cellulose and investigating the macroassembly of bacterial cellulose with the help of calcofluor, a fluorescent dye.    \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6911], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Yang ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Ali Demirci", "Erwin A Vogler", "Nicole Robitaille Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Chair", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member", "Nicole Robitaille Brown, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bacterial cellulose", "bioabsorption", "Spherelike", "Hydrogel", "Tissue Scaffolds"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "HEALTH INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET: \nINFLUENCE OF ONLINE SOURCES ON\nCREDIBILITY AND BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS\n\n", "id": "7842", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6761", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Drawn from Sundar and Nass's source typology, this dissertation examines the influences of online health information sources on users' perceived credibility of information and behavioral intentions towards information.

Specifically, the first essay uses firm-level panel data from Chinese enterprises to examine how regional differences influence the impact of technology spillovers on firms\u2019 productivity. This essay contributes to the existing literature in the following aspects: providing regional evidence that vertical channels are more important than horizontal channels to generate positive spillovers; providing empirical evidence on how regional differences, including geographical endowments, economic factors, and government policies, affect within-region and outside-region spillovers; providing empirical evidence to support the fact that China\u2019s \u201cGrand Western Development Program\u201d helped to reduce the economic disparity between the Western region and Coastal region. We find within-region spillover effects improve the productivity of firms in the Eastern region, which may due to the \u201cCoastal Development Strategies\u201d and the Eastern region\u2019s geographical advantages; firms in the Northeastern region receive significant cost-increasing outside-region spillover effects, which is in some extent caused by the low performances of SOEs in the Northeast; firms in the Southwestern region, which has the lowest GDP among five Chinese regions, receive significant cost-saving within-region and outside-region spillover effects, which may be a result of the fact that Coastal region has bigger positive impacts on the Western region after the implementation of \u201cGrand Western Development Program\u201d. The second essay investigates the factor-bias spillover effect of FDI in China. Specifically, we examine how domestic enterprises guide their technology development direction in response to FDI in their horizontal industry, upstream industry, or downstream industry. Moreover, we will investigate the impact on FDI spillovers, resulting from China\u2019s joining of the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our empirical results show that foreign capital invested in upstream industries results in the use of more materials; foreign capital in downstream industries induces the use of more capital, but less labor; and foreign capital in horizontal industries induces saving in capital, but using in materials. Competition from foreign firms in the same industry spurs domestic firms to reduce their production cost by more intensively utilizing their relative factors endowment, which is capital-scarce, labor- and material-abundant. FDI in upstream industry produces higher quality outputs inducing Chinese firms to outsource more. Benefiting from technology transferred from downstream foreign consumers, local suppliers exhibit technical change with capital-using, labor- and material-saving factor bias. The third essay investigates how R&D expenditures and FDI, as well as other factors, influence the energy intensity in four Chinese high energy consumption industries. Results suggest that China\u2019s increased openness to the world and R&D expenditures only bring benefits a couple of industries in improving their energy efficiency, while rising energy costs and China\u2019s industrial policy\u2014\u201cgrasping the large, letting go off the small\u201d are significant contributors to the decline in energy intensity in all four industries.

This thesis investigated some of the crystalline defects and precipitate phases in the W-based and Fe-based alloys via first-principles approaches in order to advance and advocate the design of these alloys for structural applications at elevated temperatures. \nThe poor formability of BCC (body-centered cubic) W at low temperatures is one of the major obstacles limiting its range of applications, such as the structural components for nuclear fusion reactors. The primary alloying element for increasing the ductility of W is recognized to be Re which is scarce and extremely expensive. Therefore, in order to identify alternative alloying elements for the development of W-based alloys with similar or improved mechanical properties, it is desirable to gain a fundamental and systematic understanding of alloying effects on the elasticity and plasticity of W as a function of temperature and alloying content. In this dissertation, the influence of various transition alloying elements on the elastic properties of W-based alloys via first-principles calculations is investigated first. Nineteen transition metal alloying elements  are considered: Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Hf, Ta, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt. It is found that (i) the bulk modulus of the dilute W-X alloy decreases with increasing its equilibrium volume, particularly, for the alloying elements in the same period; (ii) the earlier and later transition elements (e.g., Y, Zr and Pd) have stronger effects on the shear moduli than the other elements (e.g., Cr and Mo) which have the same number of valence electrons as W; and (iii) the largest decrease of elastic properties of W is due to alloying with Y. In addition, it is shown that the changes of elastic properties of W caused by the alloying elements are traceable from the electron charge density distribution, resulting in a bonding distortion between W and the alloying atoms. Using the quasi-static approach based on the Debye model, the elastic properties of these W-X alloys at finite temperatures are predicted. \nIn addition to the alloying effects on the elasticity of W, the solute-induced softening and hardening effects in BCC W for twenty-one substitutional alloying elements (Al, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Hf, Ta, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt) are also examined to search for possible Re-substitutes that will result in a similar softening effect in W. The changes in the energy barriers and stress scales of dislocation motion caused by the solute-dislocation interactions are directly computed via first-principles approaches with special dislocation boundary conditions. The solute effects on critical resolved shear stress of the \u00bd <111> screw dislocation in BCC W at room temperature is quantitatively predicted, as a function of alloy concentration, via an improved mesoscopic solid-solution model by using first-principles results as input parameters. It is found that the solute elements, which induce large reductions in the shear modulus or bulk/shear moduli ratio, do not necessarily decrease the plastic/flow strength of BCC W. Al and Mn are proposed to be promising substitutes for Re as these two elements introduce a similar softening effect as Re in BCC W. In addition, the trends, regularities of the solute-dislocation interactions, and their correlations to the dislocation core structure geometries are discussed. \nFerritic alloys are among the most important structural engineering alloys in our society. Application of ferritic alloys in extremely harsh environments as structural components, such as high-pressure steam piping and nuclear reactors, require strength capabilities at elevated temperatures. By drastically reducing the grain size (< 100nm), grain boundary (GB) strengthening can be an efficient way to enhance the hardness and strength of ferritic alloys. However, the additional energy associated with large amount of GB area induces a strong driving force for grain growth, resulting in loss of GB strengthening at high temperatures. Segregation of specific solute elements at GBs is perceived to be one of the most effective ways to mitigate grain growth at high temperatures in nanocrystalline ferritic alloys. It is believed that the GB energy could be remarkably reduced via solute segregation and thus the capillary driving force for grain growth. In this part of the dissertation, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are performed to understand the atomistic mechanisms of the solute-GB interactions. The segregation effects of six transition metal elements (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zr, Ta and W) on the \u03a33 (111)[11 \u03050] tilt boundary in BCC Fe are systematically investigated by examining the GB energy, GB area, solute segregation energy and GB cohesion. It is found that the GB energy reduction is more related to the solute segregation energy than the GB area extension. The solute segregation energy is verified to be composed as a combination of the strain and chemical contributions, even for the solute elements with large atomic volumes. The dynamic changes in atomic and electronic structures in response to the applied strains are investigated to provide physical insight into the effects of solute segregation on the GB cohesion.\nAlternatively, creating and maintaining precipitates coherent with the host matrix, under service conditions is one of the most effective approaches for successful development of alloys for high temperature applications. In this part of the dissertation, a new, nano-sized superlattice (NSS) phase in ball-milled Fe alloys, which maintains coherency with the BCC matrix up to at least 913\u00b0C, has been discovered. As a result, a new, nano-scale coherent precipitate strengthening phenomenon is observed in this class of ferritic alloys. First-principles calculations using various exchange-correlation functionals are performed to investigate the crystal structure and stabilization mechanisms of these clusters. It is proposed that this phase is metastable and has a chemistry of Fe3O and a D03 crystal structure. In addition to elucidating the crystal structure, the role of Zr in stabilizing this as-observed precipitate phase is understood by the analysis of chemical bonding between Zr and O atoms. \nOverall, the present thesis provides an in-depth study of the effects of alloying elements on the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of W-based alloys and Fe-based alloys. The results and conclusions would enable the future development of these two alloys systems for applications at elevated temperatures. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12654], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Yongjie ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yongjie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi-Kui Liu", "Zi-Kui Liu", "Allison Michelle Beese", "Hojong Kim", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Laszlo J.

The first part focuses on the studies of the low-field magnetoresistance (LFMR) properties of strained manganite thin films, namely, La0.67A0.33MnO3 thin films (A=Ca, Sr, Ba) and Pr1-xSrxMnO3 thin films (x=0.2, 0.25, 0.33 and 0.4). In the second part, we discuss the studies of the high field magnetoresistance anisotropy properties of the strained thin films. The observed large anisotropic magnetoresisance cannot be explained by the existing theories. In the last part, we presented some preliminary data on the manganite nanostructures.\n\n\nChapter 1 briefly overviews the studies of the colossal magnetoresistance in the manganite materials, and the low-field magnetoresistance in manganite thin films. It also gives an overview of the theories involved in this dissertation, which covered the conventional theories and recently proposed theory on the domain wall resistance in ferromagnetic materials, and the theories on the magnetoresistance anisotropy.\n\nChapter 2 describes the experimental methods to prepare the high quality manganite thin films, i.e., the pulse-laser deposition technique, and the characterization of the structural, electrical and magnetic properties of the films using X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and other measurements. \n\n\nChapter 3 focuses on the low-field magnetoresistance properties of the strained La0.67A0.33MnO3 and Pr1-xSrxMnO3 thin films. First, strain-induced large low-field magnetoresistance (LFMR) has been systematically studied in La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 (LCMO), La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) and La0.67Ba0.33MnO3 (LBMO) thin (50-200 \u00c5) films grown on different substrates, such as LaAlO3(001) (LAO), NdGaO3(110) (NGO) and SrTiO3 (001) (STO). Due to the lattice mismatch between the films and the substrates ranging from -2.6% to +1%, compressive and tensile strains were imposed to the films grown on LAO and STO substrates, respectively. Large LFMR was observed in LCMO and LSMO thin films on LaAlO3 substrates, and positive magnetoresistance was observed in most of the films grown on SrTiO3 substrates. The large LFMR is strongly dependent on the film thickness, temperature and the composition of the manganites. Second, strain-induced large LFMR has been systematically studied in Pr1-xSrxMnO3 (x=0.2, 0.25, 0.33, 0.4) ultrathin films (45-300 \u00c5) grown on LAO and STO substrates. The films are under compressive (grown on LAO substrates) or tensile (grown on STO substrates) strain imposed by the lattice mismatch with the substrates. Large LFMR was observed in all compressive-strained Pr1-xSrxMnO3 films when the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the film plane, but the LFMR ratio is larger for the films with lower carrier concentration (x). Large LFMR was identified as domain wall resistance in the compressive strained LCMO, LSMO and Pr1-xSrxMnO3 thin films. The effect will be discussed based on strain-induced magnetic anisotropy and unconventional domain walls.\n\n\nChapter 4 is devoted to the high field anisotropic magneto-transport properties of strained manganite thin films. A systematic study of the out-of-plane (magneto-crystalline) anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) has been conducted for the differently strained Pr1-xSrxMnO3 (x=0.2, 0.25, 0.33, 0.4) ultrathin films (40-300 \u00c5). The compressive- and tensile- strained ultrathin Pr1-xSrxMnO3 films show anomalously large out-of-plane AMR, but with opposite signs. In contrast, the almost strain free Pr1-xSrxMnO3/NGO films with the same thickness show much lower out-of-plane AMR. As the thickness increases, the AMR of all the films becomes small. In addition, the field dependence of the out-of-plane AMR shows a crossover at the metal-insulator transition temperatures for all three types of the films. The in-plane AMR of the films are smaller regardless of the film thickness and the substrate. Out-of-plane AMR on strained La0.67A0.33MnO3 thin films was also presented, and the large out-of-plane AMR was observed in tensile strained films in this series. The anomalous AMR results in the strained Pr1-xSrxMnO3 thin film are explained in terms of the orbit ordering and spin-orbit coupling. It is originated from the energy band splitting of the manganese eg level and the differential occupation probability of the dx2-y2 and the d3z2-r2 orbital due to the static Jahn-Teller distortion. However, the large AMR, indicating an enhanced spin-orbital coupling due to strain, have not been discussed in the current theories.\n\n\nIn chapter 5 we presented some preliminary data on the manganite nanostructures. We found that, while the manganite nanostructure maintains all the LFMR and DWR properties as in the un-patterned manganite thin films, it shows the nonlinear I-V characteristics below and well above Tc. And the I-V curves were fitted very well with the Simmons tunneling model, which indicates that tunneling is a dominant factor in the transport property. \n\n\nAt last, we conclude the results of this dissertation and outline the future works in chapter 6.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6833], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Yufeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yufeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qi Li", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Nitin Samarth", "Tom Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qi Li, Committee Chair", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Tom Mallouk, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["manganite", "Strain", "low-field", "magnetoresistance", "anisotropy", "magneto-transport"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ATOMISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS-QUANTUM MECHANICAL METHODS TO MODEL SURFACE-ENHANCED NONLINEAR OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPIES", "id": "14557zxh120", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14557", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Spectroscopy, the study of interactions between radiation and matter, often becomes more complicated for intense radiation due to the cause of nonlinearity. At the molecular level, the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties can be described using higher-order polarizability tensors, such as the first and second hyperpolarizabilities. Providing an insight into these properties is essential for designing NLO devices, and thus theoretical tools that can accurately and efficiently model them are greatly needed. The sum-over-states model within a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) framework is probably the most commonly used tool, and has shown success in calculating resonant NLO properties. However, this approach often assumes that a few states dominate the response, and consequently becomes less reliable when far from resonances or for systems that are characterized by a high density of states, such as metal clusters. To overcome this limitation, we have adopted response theory that takes all states into account by construction. With a phenomenological damping factor embedded into it, termed damped response theory, a balanced description of all off-, near-, and on-resonance optical properties can be enabled for both molecules and metal clusters. With the damped nonlinear response theory, we have performed simulations for the resonance hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRayS) of both molecules and small Ag clusters, the frequency-scanned hyper-Raman scattering (HRS) of the octupolar molecule crystal violet (CV), and the two-photon absorption (TPA) of the thiolate-protected Au25 cluster. These achievements allow for evaluating two-photon resonance enhanced HRayS of Ag clusters, indicate the HRS of CV is dominated by the Franck-Condon effects at the lowest two excitation energies, and reveal the one- and two-photon double resonance effect is not the main cause of the huge TPA cross sections of Au25(SH)18\u2212 found experimentally. However, widespread of the NLO techniques is still impeded by their inherent low cross sections. One routine solution is to intensify the spectroscopic signals via chemical mechanism (CM), e.g., the molecular resonance effects; alternatively, electromagnetic mechanism (EMM) that arises from surface localized plasmons can also significantly enhance the signal intensities. For surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), it has been found that the EMM plays a more important role in the signal enhancement as compared to the CM. To this end, we focus on the EMM and have developed two atomistic electrodynamics- quantum mechanical models to include the surface effects on HRS, termed surface-enhanced HRS (SEHRS). The first is the discrete interaction model/quantum mechanical model, which combines an atomistic electrodynamics model of the nanoparticle with a TDDFT description of the molecule. The second is a dressed-tensors method that accounts for the interactions between the molecule and the inhomogeneous local fields. With these methods, we have shown that the field gradient effects mainly determine the surface selection rules and the enhancements for SEHRS, and are more important than their counterparts in SERS. Combining the dressed-tensors approach with a wavepacket dynamics model, we have qualitatively predicted the orientation of Rhodamine 6G adsorbed onto silver nanoparticles.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15483], "author_name_tesi": "Hu, Zhongwei ", "last_name_ssi": "Hu", "first_name_ssi": "Zhongwei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lasse Jensen", "Lasse Jensen", "Paul S Cremer", "William George Noid", "Zhiwen Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lasse Jensen, Dissertation Advisor", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Chair", "Paul S Cremer, Committee Member", "William George Noid, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory", "Damped Response Theory", "Nonlinear Optical Properties", "Hyper-Rayleigh Scattering", "Hyper-Raman Scattering", "Two-Photon Absorption", "Surface-Enhanced Hyper-Raman Scattering"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "GUIDED WAVE PROPAGATION IN SINGLE AND DOUBLE LAYER HOLLOW\nCYLINDERS EMBEDDED IN INFINITE MEDIA\n\n\n", "id": "11153", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3271", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ultrasonic guided wave Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) has been studied for over a decade and has proven to be a very promising technique for pipe inspection. The work presented before studies guided wave propagation in bare, coated, and buried pipelines. \n\nGuided wave propagation in bare pipe has been investigated by many researchers and verified as a foundation for axisymmetric and focusing inspection techniques. The phased array focusing technique for pipeline can beneficially enhance the penetration power, improve the signal to noise ratio and reduce potential false alarms. In this work, the real-time phased array focusing technique is applied to anomalies detected by the axisymmetric inspection technique, leading to an amplitude enhancement for real defects and an amplitude decrease for ghost echoes. Both longitudinal and torsional wave modes are investigated in this study. Robust evidence of the advantages of the real-time phased array focusing technique is demonstrated.\n\nViscoelastic coating materials have a somewhat attenuative influence on guided waves depending on the coating type and thickness. The real-time phased array focusing technique is experimentally applied to a coated pipe inspection for the first time. Two different types of defects were successfully detected by using the focusing technique with the coated pipe parameters calculated by the Semi-Analytical Finite Element computation method. The bare pipe focusing parameters calculated by the global matrix method is also used for the coated pipe, leading to lower penetration power compared to using the coated pipe focusing parameters. \n\nBased on the dispersion study of guided wave propagation in coated pipe, it is shown that material properties of the coating layer are very significant in pipe inspection. Therefore, an innovative experiment based fitting method is developed for obtaining more accurate coating material properties. This newly developed method has been verified as very effective after evaluating coatings with various types and thickness. The influence of coating properties on dispersion curves is discussed as well.\n\nGuided wave propagation in buried pipe is quite challenging since the soil layer is basically a semi-infinite space compared with a pipe wall. A hybrid Semi-Analytical Finite Element method is applied to the buried pipe in this study. An infinite element is combined with finite elements to simulate soil in order to avoid the reflection problem from the outer surface. Two convergence problems are discussed for optimal results. Dispersion curves, wave structures, and the focusing parameters of a buried bare pipe and a buried coated pipe are calculated by an innovative hybrid SAFE method. An experiment is carried out on a buried coated pipe using the axisymmetric inspection technique. Both a saw-cut defect and a cluster defect have been successfully detected, despite the energy loss of the guided wave due to both the coating and soil layers. \n\nA synthetic focusing technique is also introduced in this study. This technique can be used for a complete feature visualization of the pipeline.

In the literature, one can find tools which are developed to provide screening criteria for oil recovery methods and assessment of production scenarios.  Some of those tools are qualitative utilizing experimental field applications knowledge and some are based on models which are quantitative.\nArtificial neural network(ANN) based tool-box by Claudia Parada(2008) provides an alternative way for screening and designing enhanced oil recovery methods with four fluid types included to investigate EOR processes.

In this dissertation, the effect of kernel methods are studied for high dimensional measure of dependence, and the methods are applied to neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. The ADNI study is a comprehensive dataset with the goal of finding potential genetic variants that contribute to the difference in brain volumes among the subjects, it contains brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans of 741 enrolled subjects, and are the main neuroimaging data used for this work.\n\nThe first part of this dissertation utilizes distance covariance for the association analysis on the ADNI dataset, as distance covariance is a consistent test and is able to identify linear or non-linear associations, and also preserve the within variable interactions using the $L_2$ distance kernel. Furthermore, combining distance covariance with a novel FDR modeling algorithm is proposed for examining a larger number of genetic variants simultaneously and it results in an increase number of significant findings than what has been seen previously in the literature.\n\nThe association analysis is then extended to the cases when covariates are present, where distance covariance is discussed in Hilbert spaces that results in a new representation called the kernel distance covariance (KDC). As part of our explorations under Hilbert spaces, we find and establish the equivalence of KDC and kernel machine regression (KMR) under certain conditions, and this leads to two major contributions: 1) the equivalence allows to measure the associations between two variables while taking into accounts of the covariate effects; and 2) KMR is found to be a member of KDC, where the family members are the different input kernels. This framework that unifies KDC and KMR leads to the problem of finding the optimal kernel pair among the KDC family, and is the concluding part of this work.\n\nFor finding the optimal kernel pair, we emphasize the discussion under the situations that there be no covariate effects, under which the KDC is related to the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). A local-alternative Power Maximization algorithm (LaPM) is proposed for the search of kernel pair optimality at a given test level, where LaPM selects the best kernel pair which maximizes the test power against local alternative (the Pitman approach). The numerical analysis shows that LaPM is able to achieve higher power than other existing approaches, and our real data experiment using the ADNI study shows that the optimal kernel pair selected by the proposed method can be used for the interpretation of high dimensional data.

In simplest cases, this self/non-self recognition is controlled by a highly polymorphic locus, named the S-locus.  If the S-haplotype of pollen is also carried by the pistil, the pollen is recognized by the pistil as self-pollen and rejected.  If the S-haplotype of pollen is different from both S-haplotypes carried by the pistil, the pollen is recognized as non-self pollen and its tube is allowed to grow through the pistil to effect fertilization.  Thus, SI allows flowering plants to avoid inbreeding and generate genetic diversity in the offspring.  My thesis research focuses on the type of SI that has so far been found in the Solanaceae and two other families, and I have used Petunia inflata, a wild species of petunia, as a model.  The Kao Lab has identified the S-RNase gene and the PiSLF (P. inflata S-locus F-box) gene as the genes that control pistil and pollen SI function, respectively.  The overall goal of my thesis research is to study how S-RNase and PiSLF interact inside a pollen tube to result in specific growth inhibition of self-pollen tubes. \n\nThere are several clues to the biological functions of S-RNase and PiSLF.  First, the RNase activity of S-RNase is essential for its function in growth inhibition of self-pollen tubes.  Second, PiSLF is a member of a large family of proteins, named F-box proteins, and a typical F-box protein is a component of an E3 ligase complex, named SCF, which consists of Skp1, Cullin 1, F-box protein and Rbx 1.  Third, a typical SCF complex, along with two other proteins, E1 and E2, catalyzes the attachment of poly-ubiquitin chains to a subset of proteins through specific recognition by the F-box protein.  The poly-ubiquitin chains allow the target proteins to be recognized by the 26S proteasome and degraded.  Based on these biochemical clues, I have designed experimental approaches utilizing a variety of techniques to study the biochemical mechanism of S-RNase-based SI.  \n\nIn Chapter 2, I describe the use of various protein-protein interaction assays to show that PiSLF is not a typical F-box protein, as the PiSLF-containing complex consists of only two other proteins, Cullin 1 and PiSBP1, with PiSBP1 possibly playing the dual role of Skp1 and Rbx1.  This finding suggests that PiSLF is likely involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.  Further in vitro binding experiments showed that a PiSLF interacted with its non-self S-RNases (produced by different S-haplotypes) much more strongly than with its self S-RNase, and an S-RNase interacted with its non-self PiSLFs much more strongly than with its self PiSLF.  This preferential binding with non-self S-RNases would allow the PiSLF-containing complex to specifically target non-self S-RNases for ubiquitination and degradation, but allow the self S-RNase to exert its RNase activity to degrade pollen RNAs.  This finding thus provides a biochemical explanation for why a pistil only rejects its self-pollen tubes during SI interactions.  I then developed a cell-free ubiquitination and degradation system using extracts of in vitro germinated pollen tubes, and showed that S-RNases were ubiquitinated and degraded via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome protein degradation pathway in vitro, albeit not in an S-haplotype-specific manner. \n\nExtensive sequencing of the S-locus region in Antirrhinum and several species in the Rosaceae family, all of which possess S-RNase-based SI, has revealed the existence of additional F-box genes at the S-locus.  In Chapter 3, I describe the identification of genes encoding four PiSLF-like proteins that share many properties with PiSLF, and present both in vitro and in vivo comparative studies of PiSLF-like proteins and PiSLF.  The results showed that none of the PiSLF-like proteins interacted with S-RNases to any significant degree, or functioned in SI, suggesting that PiSLF has a unique function in SI.  Sequence comparison between PiSLF and these PiSLF-like proteins has revealed three domains that are specific to PiSLF.  I used various chimeric proteins between PiSLF1 and PiSLF2, and between PiSLF2 and one of the PiSLF-like proteins, to show that one of the domains is responsible for the strong interaction with non-self S-RNases, and the other two domains together specifically suppress the interactions between PiSLF and its self S-RNase.  This finding provides the biochemical basis for why a PiSLF preferentially interacts with its non-self S-RNases as described in Chapter 2. \n\nTo further test the involvement of ubiquitin-26S proteasome-mediated protein degradation in SI, I studied whether any of the 20 lysine residues in S3-RNase of P. inflata might be targets for ubiquitination.  In Chapter 4, I report the finding that six lysine residues near the C-terminus, when changed to arginines, significantly reduced ubiquitination and degradation of the mutant S3-RNase, GST:S3-RNase (K141-164R), in pollen tube extracts.  I further showed that GST:S3-RNase (K141-164R) had similar RNase activity as GST:S3-RNase, suggesting that their degradation was not likely caused by an ER-associated protein degradation pathway that removes mis-folded proteins.  Finally, I showed that PiSBP1 (P. inflata S-RNase Binding Protein 1), the RING-HC subunit of the PiSLF (P. inflata SLF)-containing E3-like complex identified in Chapter 2, could target S-RNase for ubiquitination in vitro.  All these results suggest that ubiquitin-26S proteasome-dependent degradation of S-RNase is likely an integral part of the S-RNase-based SI mechanism. \n\nTwo biochemical models, a degradation model and a sequestration (compartmentalization) model, have recently been proposed to explain the S-RNase-based SI mechanism.  In the first part of Chapter 5, I provide a critical evaluation of these two models in view of the results I have obtained in my thesis research, and discuss why the model invoking specific degradation of non-self S-RNases via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway can better explain some key aspects of SI.  I have developed several projects and collaborated with three other graduate students in the Kao Lab to further test the validity of this model.  In the second part of Chapter 5, I discuss the preliminary results from these projects, as well as future directions.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6986], "author_name_tesi": "Hua, Zhihua ", "last_name_ssi": "Hua", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhihua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Teh Hui Kao", "Hong Ma", "Richard Cyr", "David Braun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Teh Hui Kao, Committee Chair", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Richard Cyr, Committee Member", "David Braun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PiSLF", "S-RNase", "Self-Incompatibility", "Petunia inflata"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Effects of nonenzymatic glycosylation of type I collagen on osteoblastic differentiation", "id": "13867azh190", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13867", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disorder that is affected by insulin resistance or the inability of the body to secrete sufficient amounts of insulin. As a result, glucose levels rise, affecting a number of systems including the skeletal system. Hyperglycemia has been observed to limit bone healing, however, the mechanisms behind this process are not clearly understood. In the present study, we set out to determine if defective matrix due to excessive glycosylation of type I collagen has an effect on osteoblastic differentiation. First, it was determined whether collagen undergoes glycosylation under glycemic conditions. Because glycosylation of matrix by glucose takes a long time, ribose which has been shown to reproduce matrix glycosylation in a short time was used. Effect of collagen glycosylation was assessed by SDS PAGE to examine collagen chain migration and fluorescence to determine the level of pentosidine cross-links. The data showed that glycosylated collagen migrated slower on SDS gels and collagen bands were not sharp. Evidence for Type I collagen glycosylation was observed at day 7 and was more pronounced at day 14. Fluorescence analysis showed increased collagen fluorescence in samples treated with ribose up to 14 days. After glycation of type I collagen was assessed with SDS PAGE and fluorescence, the collagen was used to determine the effects of type I glycosylation on osteoblastic differentiation by coating the collagen on 24 well plates. However, the experiment had to be modified due to the contamination of the collagen and ribose. Instead, MC3T3 cells were directly seeded on 24 well plates in order to observe the effects of differentiation when cultured in osteogenic medium supplemented with ribose. Differentiation was based on ALP activity at different days of culture. The results showed that at day 3 of differentiation, there was no difference in ALP activity between MC3T3 cells cultured in presence or absence of ribose. Analysis of ALP activity at day 7 showed significant differences\nin ALP activity between ribose treated and non-treated. These results provide evidence that hyperglycemia may limit bone formation via non enzymatic glycosylation of type I collagen leading to the accumulation of AGEs that limit the ability of osteoblasts to differentiate.

Driven by the specific binding of ligands on the NP with the complementary receptors overexpressed on cancer cells, NPs enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. As drugs are loaded either on or inside NPs, the efficacy of such systems is largely controlled by the amount of NPs that enter cells, i.e. cellular uptake. Despite considerable progress in the optimization of the NP design for enhanced cellular uptake, a comprehensive design map that presents the optimal combination of various variables is still missing. In addition, due to the active responses of cells to physical stimuli via mechanotransduction, the cellular uptake may also be regulated by the physical environments of cells. Especially, whether and how substrate stiffness and surface topography modulate cellular uptake of NPs requires further investigation.\nTo understand the endocytosis process, we developed a thermodynamics model for receptor-mediated endocytosis of spherical NPs. This model allowed us to interpret the endocytosis process from a general energy-balance framework of NP-membrane adhesion and membrane deformation. The model foresaw the interrelated effects of particle size and ligand density on endocytosis. The phase diagrams of the endocytic time of a single NP, cellular uptake of multiple NPs and the phenomenal cellular uptake rate in the space of particle size and ligand density provide a clear design map for spherical NP-based bioagents. To study the endocytosis of nonspherical NPs, which is inaccessible by theoretical approaches, we extended our coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) membrane model to simulate receptor-mediated endocytosis of NPs of various sizes and shapes. Our simulations demonstrated that NP shape modulates the kinetics of endocytosis via rotation mediated by the membrane deformation. For a spherocylindrical NP with the initial upright docking position on the membrane plane, endocytosis proceeds through a laying-down-then-standing-up sequence. A free energy analysis revealed that NP size encodes the maximal membrane curvature energy that primarily determines the completion of endocytosis, while NP shape breaks the symmetry of curvature energy landscape and hence dictates the endocytic pathway and the angle of entry. By performing cellular uptake assay on polyacrylamide (PA) gel of various stiffnesses and substrates of various topographies, we confirmed the direct regulations on cellular uptake of NPs by the physical environments of cells. Our experiments indicated that physical stimuli modulate cellular uptake via mechanotransduction by dictating cellular spreading and membrane mechanics. Our results not only provide fundamental guidelines, but also open up new avenues for engineering NP-based drug delivery system for more sensitive disease diagnosis and more effective anticancer drug delivery.

Popular software, such as Microsoft Windows, Office, Linux, Mozilla Firefox, and Adobe Reader, etc, has been installed on hundreds of millions of computers worldwide. Such dominance in today's information technology environments has created a monoculture that may lead to significant security problems, due to the existence of the large proportion of common vulnerabilities.\n\nAmong many proposed methods in the recent years, software diversity is a well-accepted and commonly used technique against monoculture threats. In this dissertation we present three topology-aware software assignment methods, which algorithmically distribute software to networked systems to increase the diversity at avoiding large scale propagation of worms or duplicated attacks. Following the survivability through heterogeneity philosophy, we present our first study to improve the survivability of networked systems based on graph multi-coloring. Specifically, we design an efficient algorithm to select and deploy a set of off-the-shelf software to hosts in a networked system, such that the number and types of vulnerabilities presented on one host would be different from that on its neighboring nodes. In this way, we are able to contain a worm in an isolated \"island\". Naturally, we extend our first study one step further by taking the vulnerability severity into consideration.  So in our second study we further redefine the goal of the software assignment problem as reducing the overall potential damage caused by various attack, rather than the number of infected computers. Based on this research goal, we introduced an improved software assignment method by measuring the potential damage resulting by exploiting potential vulnerabilities. We also propose possible improvement on the algorithm by considering the topology of the networks, such as the in-degree, and betweenness, etc. Our evaluation on those improvements can be used as guidance for defender's adjustment according to their architecture in real-world. Extended from our second study, we transform the software assignment problem from single objective to multiple objectives, which incorporates several real-world criteria simultaneously, including network survivability, system feasibility and usability. To solve this multi-objective problem efficiently, we propose an ant colony optimization (ACO) based algorithm, where colonies of artificial ants work collaboratively through both heuristic information and pheromone-mediated communication to iteratively search for better solutions. To validate the generalizability of the proposed method, we experiment our algorithm on various types of network topologies with different parameter settings. The results show that our model can be applied as an effective method for assigning software for multiple objectives. Finally, we propose an evaluation framework for assessing and comparing various software assignment algorithms based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which may help one to select a software assignment algorithm that best suit the security goal one is trying to achieve.\n\nWe believe this thesis is of interest as it offers a way to add diversity to the current homogeneous information technology environments. Our proposed algorithms would be of practical value, as they can be applied as effective methods to avoid large-scale malicious attacks.

Particulate emissions from combustors on jet aircraft are relevant to each area, occurring at ground level and at altitude. One of the advantages of alternative fuels is their potential for reducing emission levels. Comparative field-testing of alternative fuels for their emissions was conducted in the Alternative Aviation Fuel Experiment II (AAFEX II), a NASA-led ground-based field campaign. In this study, particulate emissions from a CFM-56-2C1 engine aboard a DC-9 aircraft were characterized by HRTEM and XPS for nanostructure, carbon speciation and surface chemistry. Fuels studied included JP-8, a 50:50 (JP-8 & HRJ) blend, Hydrotreated Renewable Jet (HRJ), and a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthetic fuel. Soot nanostructure and surface chemistry are examined across engine power levels from 4% to 100%. Nanostructure ranged from amorphous (reflecting organic carbon) to graphitic (reflecting elemental carbon) as characterized by lamellae length analysis. With JP-8 fuel, soot particle bonding chemistry, as inferred from the XPS ratio for sp2/sp3 carbon is compared to soot nanostructure evolution. Increasing lamellae length is found to strongly correlate with increasing sp2/sp3 ratio with increasing engine power \u2013 suggesting a change in species identity contributing to the soot growth process. \nComparisons between fuels for the same power levels yielded insights into differences in soot processes as dependent upon initial fuel. Soots from the renewable HRJ and FT fuels exhibit significant nanostructure at each power level, rather than the progression as observed for JP-8. This difference is associated with differences in the soot formation environments as dependent upon fuel. To further examine the correlation between chemical environment and soot structure as manifested on different physical length scales, primary particle size versus lamellae length was compared. For JP-8 and its blend with HRJ, there is correlation with engine power, i.e. each spatial metric increases with increasing power, suggesting common underlying cause(s) for both observations. For the HRJ and FT fuels, there is no discernable trend. These results are interpreted in terms of the aromatic content of the JP-8 and blended fuels and their different pyrolysis kinetics compared to paraffinic components of the fuels. Observations of fullerenic nanostructure, particularly evident in soots from the pure paraffinic fuels were interpreted as reflecting partial premixing in order to produce the C5 membered rings for lamellae curvature. This led to the hypothesis defining this study: Partially premixed combustion produces soot with fullerenic nanostructure. Curvature is that one special feature of nanostructure that can be related back to particular gas phase specie(s), namely cyclopentadiene and PAHs containing 5-membered rings.\n\nThis hypothesis was tested in the following two laboratory flame studies. Partial premixing within simple gas jet diffusion flames has a very long history \u2013 stemming back to the Bunsen flame. Yet HRTEM data of soot from such flames appears absent. In the first study cyclopentane was used as fuel to test lamellae curvature dependence upon C5 species. Modest curvature was observed \u2013 given competing fuel pyrolysis and ring dehydrogenation to yield cyclopentadiene, referred to as C5. Using benzene as the primary fuel with partial premixing tested the chemical path for C5 production \u2013 proceeding through partial benzene oxidation yielding the phenoxy radical followed by CO loss to produce C5. A strong variation of lamellae curvature with oxygen content in the primary fuel stream was observed \u2013 reflecting the increasing C5 production rate. Generality of the nanostructure dependence upon partial premixing and associated change in gas phase chemistry (compared to pure thermal pyrolysis) was demonstrated using an ordinary laboratory Bunsen burner with ethylene as fuel. In absence of partial premixing, soot production is well described by the HACA mechanism, C6 PAHs with observed flat lamellae, without curvature, dissimilar to observations here accompanying partial premixing.\t\n\nIn the third study, the main goal was to test two main parameters \u2013 adiabatic flame temperature (2000K) and fuel/air equivalence ratio (\u03a6 = 2.0) \u2013 for their relative impact on soot nanostructure formation. The soots were collected from a burner-stabilized flat flame burning the petroleum-based JP-8, synthetic FT, and surrogate \u2013 iso-Octane/n-Dodecane, m-Xylene/n-Dodecane, and n-Dodecane \u2013 fuels on a McKenna burner. Images from high-resolution transmission microscopy (HRTEM) show that for the same equivalence ratio of \u03a6 = 2.0 with temperature maintained constant, soot from the FT fuel has significant curvature compared to soot from the JP-8 fuel, as also found in FT-derived soot from the jet engine. This comparative observation indicates two major findings. First is that the soot nanostructure depends upon initial fuel composition \u2013 and by extension molecular structure. Similar findings from diesel engine studies have also been documented by Yehliu (2010) 1. Second is that fuel pyrolysis pathways and products also depend upon the fuel components. Adjustment of flame adiabatic temperature suggests a temperature threshold for realization of such differences. Soot nanostructure comparisons with a surrogate fuel mixture of n-dodecane/m-xylene (75:25 wt.%) further illustrate pyrolysis processes and intermediates as dependent upon fuel molecular structure and components present. \n\nTo further compare the experimental results, CHEMKIN with the SERDP mechanism using the burner-stabilized flame model was carried out and processed for the three surrogate fuels, iso-Octane, n-Dodecane, and m-Xylene at various reaction temperatures and fuel/air equivalence ratios. Both the C5H5/C6H6 ratio and C3H3 profiles were distinctly different between the pure n-dodecane and m-xylene/n-dodecane mixture. That the C3H3 profile is also the main difference between the iso-octane and surrogate fuel mix suggests that C3H3 participation in 5-membered ring formation is also key to introduction of 2-D curvature in lamella \u2013 especially given that the highest curvature is observed for FT fuel soot. Moreover, by these results the higher C5H5 observed for the surrogate mixture is an inferred consequence of the different C3H3 profile. Presently these calculated values are only used to interpret the observed curvature differences, as threshold values or the concentration dependency of curvature upon particular species are currently unknown.\n\nThe goal of this study was to build a bridge between molecular gas phase species and the soot nanostructure. Initial observations of nanostructure curvature in jet engine soot prompted interest. Current chemical kinetic models can address fuel breakdown, thermal and oxidatively assisted, PAH formation and growth all via detailed kinetics, followed by soot inception via their physical and chemical coalescence. Thereafter soot models are particle based and use measured growth rates and aerosol dynamics to account for increasing soot mass and aggregate formation. No modeling studies have yet addressed the link between gas phase species with any aspect of soot nanostructure. \n\nAs shown here soot nanostructure can reflect its origin, specifically the species forming the soot lamellae. The novelty of two-dimensional curvature is that it can be related uniquely to C5 species, via known chemical pathways \u2013 involving oxygen directly or indirectly. The oxygen concentration in the primary fuel stream defines the level of partial premixing. Therein lies the origin of the hypothesis that partial premixing leads to (recognizable) curvature in soot lamellae. Definition of the operative range of \u03a6 and temperature will constitute future work for C5 production and its manifestation as curvature in nanostructure. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10234], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Chung-hsuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chung-hsuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Randy Vander Wal", "Randy Vander Wal", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Thomas Litzinger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Randy Vander Wal, Dissertation Advisor", "Randy Vander Wal, Committee Chair", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Special Member", "Thomas Litzinger, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Soot nanostructrue", "AAFEX II", "Premixed flame", "diffusion", "bunsen", "SERDP", "ChemKin", "fullerenic soot", "curvature", "cyclopentadiene."]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Physics Based, Integrated Modeling Of\nHydrology And Hydraulics At Watershed Scales\n\n\n", "id": "6217", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2133", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents the major findings in the development of the hydrology and hydraulics modules of a first principle, physics-based watershed model (WASH123D Version 1.5).  The numerical model simulates water movement in watersheds with individual water flow components of one-dimensional stream/channel network flow, two-dimensional overland flow and three-dimensional variably saturated subsurface flow and their interactions.  First, the complete Saint Venant equations/2-D shallow water equations (dynamic wave equations) and the kinematic wave or diffusion wave approximations were implemented as three solution options for 1-D channel network and 2-D overland flow. Different solution techniques are considered for the governing equations based on physical reasoning and their mathematical property. The nature and propagation of these approximation errors under more complex 2-D flow conditions are evaluated within WASH123D with comparison of simulation results of several example problems. The accuracy and applicability of dynamic-wave, diffusion-wave and kinematic-wave models to real watershed modeling is discussed with simulation results from numerical experiments. Second, the physics-based coupling between surface water and subsurface flow was investigated. Generally, there are two cases based on physical nature of the interface: continuous or discontinuous assumption, when a sediment layer exists at the interface, the discontinuous assumption may be justified. As for numerical schemes, there are three cases: time-lagged, iterative and simultaneous solutions. Numerical experiments are used to compare the performance of each coupling approach for different types of surface water and groundwater interactions. Third, The Method of Characteristics (MOC) in the context of finite element method was applied to the complete 2-D shallow water equations for 2-D overland flow.  The search for genuinely multidimensional numerical schemes for 2-D surface water flow is an active research topic.  We consider the Method of Characteristics (MOC) in the context of finite element method as a good alternative. The intrinsic difficulty in implementing MOC for 2-D overland flow is that there are infinite numbers of wave characteristics in the 2-D context, although only three independent wave directions are needed for a well-posed solution to the characteristic equations. We have implemented a numerical scheme that attempts to diagonalize the characteristic equations based on pressure and velocity gradient relationship. This new scheme was evaluated by comparison with other choice of wave characteristic directions in the literature.  Example problems of mixed sub-critical flow/super-critical flow in a channel with approximate analytical solution was used to verify the numerical algorithm. The circular dam break problem was solved with different selections of wave characteristic directions and the performance of each selection was evaluated based on accuracy and numerical stability. Finally, the physics-based, integrated watershed model was tested and validated with the hydrologic simulation of a pilot constructed wetland in South Florida. For this field problem, strong surface water and groundwater interactions are a key component of the hydrologic processes. This study demonstrates the need and the utility of a physics-based modeling approach for strong surface water and groundwater interactions. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2113], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Guobiao ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Guobiao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gour Tsyh Yeh", "Christopher J Duffy", "Derek Elsworth", "Arthur Carl Miller", "Andrew Scanlon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gour Tsyh Yeh, Committee Chair", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Arthur Carl Miller, Committee Chair", "Andrew Scanlon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["overland flow", "channel flow", "Watersheds", "integrated models", "numerical models", "subsurface flow", "finite element methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Globally Distributed Information Technology Work: A Study of Cross-Cultural Influences, Communication, and Management\n", "id": "9942", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2270", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Distributing information technology work globally has become increasingly prevalent and is facing a variety of challenges, including the challenge of cultural diversity management. Cultural diversity is inherent in globally distributed information technology work and has both positive and negative effects on it. Even though there is a body of literature acknowledging the relevance of cultural influences on globally distributed information technology work, there seems to be a paucity of research that addresses how cultural factors affect the globally distributed information technology work in real settings. In addition, the majority of prior cross-cultural information systems research assumes national culture as the sole or main cultural boundary that determines the individual cultural identity, and depicts cultural differences through preset static dimensions. \nThis research draws on the theory of situating culture and social identity theory and aims to examine how cultural factors influence globally distributed information technology work as well as how global virtual team members negotiate cultural differences. This research employs an interpretative case study approach to investigate the global information technology collaborations between or among three nations, the United States of America, China, and India. Two multinational information technology companies were studied in this case. Data has been collected through interviews with 44 information technology practitioners and observations from the field studies in the United States of America, China, and India. \nIt was found that globally distributed information technology work is affected by the combination of different cultural factors including national culture, organizational culture, regional culture, and professional culture. These cultural factors also intertwined with other factors, such as time zone difference and infrastructure, to have impacts on communication, coordination and relationship dynamics of globally distributed information technology work. In the process of constructing their identities and negotiating the cultural differences, global virtual team members not only drew from their national and organizational backgrounds, but also drew from their individual experiences. Moreover, Chinese and Indian team members employed power relationships in their identity construction, such as core team/support team, outsourcer/outsourcee, and customer/service provider. Organizational practices including cross-cultural training, leadership development, and the uses of a global delivery model and cultural liaisons facilitate cultural diversity management.\nFrom the knowledge perspective, this research generates an in-depth understanding of cultural influences on globally distributed information technology work. Furthermore, this research adds some insights with regards to global information technology collaborations between China and the United States, which is quite limited in the existing literature. From the theoretical perspective, this research demonstrates the analytical capability of integrating the theory of situating culture and social identity theory. From the practical perspective, recommendations formulated from this research provide actionable knowledge for practitioners with respect to virtual work management, human resource management, cultural diversity management, cross-cultural training and cross-cultural knowledge management.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2250], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Haiyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Haiyan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eileen M Trauth", "Eileen M Trauth", "Carleen Frances Maitland", "Sandeep Purao", "Ronald L Jackson Ii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eileen M Trauth, Dissertation Advisor", "Eileen M Trauth, Committee Chair", "Carleen Frances Maitland, Committee Member", "Sandeep Purao, Committee Member", "Ronald L Jackson Ii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["IT Offshore Outsourcing", "Cross-Cultural Management", "Virtual Teams", "Information Technology Work", "Management Information Systems", "Workforce Diversity"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Moving towards Sustainability: Improving Material Flows in the Iron Casting Industry\n", "id": "10626", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2396", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ustainable engineering solutions were developed to improve the sustainability of the iron casting process.  These engineering solutions aimed to modify the material and energy flow in the iron casting industry in a manner that previously wasted energy and resources can be utilized to control the pollution and reduce energy and material cost for the iron foundries. \nThe first approach was to reclaim the thermal energy from cupola furnace exhaust gas to produce and regenerate porous carbons that could be employed to adsorb the volatile organic compounds from the iron casting process. Saturated porous carbons could further be reused in the green sand mold as the carbon additive. Therefore no extra cost will be posed to the iron casting to remove its VOC emissions. The pore structure developments of different coals under simulated thermal conditions were investigated. The adsorption of typical volatile organic compounds from the iron casting process on the in-situ porous carbons was also studied and compared with a commercial activated carbon from similar precursors. \nThe second approach was to replace expensive foundry coke by waste anthracite fines. The iron melting process was carefully investigated for the design of the alternative fuel. The thermal energy in the preheat zone of the cupola furnace was employed as free energy to create silicon carbide binding in-situ. The traditional material flow into the cupola furnace was also rearranged to assist the in-situ ceramic binding, minimize the change of chemistry in the cupola furnace, and eliminate the additional cost with silicon additives. Different Si-containing materials tested in this study showed different binding mechanisms at high temperature. Bindered anthracite with silicon powders had the highest post-pyrolysis strength provided by the nanowires generated in-situ at high temperature. The binding strength from the nanowires was further enhanced by decreasing the anthracite grain size which allowed more direct connections of the anthracite particles by individual nanowires. The post-pyrolysis unconfined compressive strength of anthracite pellets (2.86 cm in diameter and 1.875\u201d in length) made from pulverized anthracite fines with 9% silicon powders reached as high as 3.6 Mpa (535 psi). Anthracite pellets made from 50% pulverized anthracite fines and 50% original anthracite fines were only slightly weaker than the anthracite pellets made from 100% pulverized anthracite fines. The nanowires generated between silicon powders and anthracite fines at high temperature are silicon carbide (3C-SiC or &#946;-SiC) nanowires with highly crystallized face-center cubic zinc-blender structures. These nanowires, which were grown though the vapor-solid mechanism by stacking the (111) lattice plane along the [111] direction, were typically 30-60 nm in the diameter and could grow tens of micrometers in length. In the lab-scale pyrolysis system used in this study, the silicon carbide nanowires started to form at temperature as low as 1100 \u00b0C. At 1400 \u00b0C the formation of silicon carbide was very fast and finished within 10 minutes. The replacement of foundry coke by waste anthracite fines could save significant amount of energy, greatly reduce carbon dioxide emission, and avoid other pollutions from the coking process.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2380], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, He ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "He", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon", "Fred Scott Cannon", "Brian Dempsey", "Sridhar Komarneni", "Robert Carl Voigt", "Angela Lueking"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon, Dissertation Advisor", "Fred Scott Cannon, Committee Chair", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member", "Robert Carl Voigt, Committee Member", "Angela Lueking, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Volatile Organic Compounds", "Porous Materials", "Carbon Materials", "Industrial Ecology", "Sustainable Engineering", "Silicon Carbide Nanowires", "Alternative Fuel"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A STUDY OF SYSTEM VULNERABILITY AND MALWARE\nON ANDROID", "id": "28717", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12428", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The increasing popularity of mobile devices (e.g., Android, iOS and etc.) attracts both normal users and malware writers. In this dissertation, we conduct research on three important aspects of security problems in Android, which has a lion share (about 80%) of the current mobile market.\n\nIn the application-level, we perform a comprehensive analysis on the design of top 30 antivirus detectors (AVDs) tailored for Android. One latest comparison of Android AVDs from the independent lab AV-TEST reports that the AVDs have around 95% malware detection rate. This only indicates that current AVDs on Android have good malware signature databases. When the AVDs are deployed on the fast-evolving mobile system, their effectiveness should also be measured on their runtime behavior. Our new understanding of the AVDs\u2019 design leads us to discover the hazards in adopting AVD solutions for Android. First, we measure the seriousness of the discovered hazard in the malware scan operations by developing evasion techniques, which work even under the assumption that the AVDs are equipped with \u201ccomplete\u201d virus definition files. Second,\nwe discover that, during the engine update operations, the Android system surprisingly nullifies all types of protection of the AVDs and exposes the system to high risks. We design and develop a model checker to confirm the presence of this vulnerable program logic in all versions of Google Android source code and other vendor customized system images. We then report the findings to AVD vendors across 16 countries.\n\nIn the system-level, we identify and mitigate the system vulnerabilities in Android, which cause serious denial of service (DoS). The System Server (SS) process is considered as the heart of Android, as it contains most of the Android system services in the Android framework, which provides the essential functionalities for applications (apps). However, due to the complicated design of the SS and the easily-accessible nature of its system services (e.g., through Android APIs), we conjecture that the SS may face serious DoS attacks. Through source code analysis, we have discovered a general design pattern in the concurrency control mechanism of the SS that could lead to deadly DoS attacks. As the SS plays the anchor role in Android, these DoS attacks could cause single-point-of-failure in Android. We name it Android Stroke Vulnerability (ASV), as the SS, encounters downtime when the ASV is exploited. We then design an ASV-Hunter to rank the risk level of methods in the SS to cost-efficiently discover four unknown ASVs in critical services of SS. Our further threat analysis result is daunting: by easily writing a loop to invoke Android APIs in an app, an attacker can prevent the user from patching vulnerable banking apps, reboot the device at mission critical moments (e.g., making phone calls). The ASVs can be easily leveraged to design ransomware by putting the device into repeated freezing/rebooting loops or help equip malware with anti-removal capability. Google confirmed our findings immediately after sending them a report. We also proposed defenses to secure the SS. \n\nAfter identifying vulnerabilities in both critical apps and system components of Android, we consider that the vulnerable and fast evolving Android system may be the next target of malware writers. Hence, we are trying to uncover the current status of Android malware development in the real world. We suspect that, during the malware development and testing phase, some Android malware writers are continuously using public scanning services (e.g., VirusTotal \u201cVT\u201d) for testing the evasion capability of their malware samples, which we name Android malware development (AMD) cases. In this work, we designed an AMD hunting system in the context of VT to identify AMD cases and reveal new threats from Android malware development. Our system was\nimplemented and used in a leading security company for four months. It has processed 58 million of Android sample submissions on VT, and identified 1,623 AMD cases with 13,855 samples from 83 countries. We then perform malware analysis and case studies on 890 samples selected from the identified AMD cases. Our case study reveals lots of new malware threats, including fake system app development, new phishing development, new rooting cases, new evasive techniques and etc. Besides raising the awareness of the existence of AMD cases, more importantly, our research provides a generic and scalable framework for the systematic study of AMD cases on malware submission platforms. The relevant samples that we identified will become a fresh Android malware source for the research community.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11790], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Heqing ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Heqing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu", "Peng Liu", "Thomas La Porta", "David Jonathan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Peng Liu, Committee Chair", "Thomas La Porta, Committee Member", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Android Security", "Vulnerability", "Malware"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Examining youth attitudes toward civic engagement: A study of collaborative social entrepreneurship using a multi-user virtual environment", "id": "23558", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10698", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the last decade, the narrative in education had often been that schools should develop \u201c21st century skills\u201d in our youth, including the competence to effectively use information and communication technology.

Existing guidelines by the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21) and the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS) agree that collaborative learning, critical thinking, problem-solving, and civic engagement are important for today\u2019s students. This study examines how an intervention using an issues-centered classroom model, deliberation, and collaboration on a social entrepreneurship project in a multi-user virtual environment can potentially develop greater civic engagement in high school seniors participating in a county-wide dual enrollment program for youth interested in future careers in healthcare. \n\nThis study revealed that before the intervention, participating students as a whole espoused high levels of social responsibility. However, the students lacked civic efficacy, ability to critically analyze the root causes of social issues, civic engagement through action for social change, and a clear understanding of social justice. The deliberation of social issues, particularly those related to the social determinants of health outlined in the US Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2020, demonstrated how the issues-centered model of teaching social studies can be lead to positive self-reported shifts in the students\u2019 ability to think critically and communicate regarding social issues. Several other important conclusions emerged from the intervention. First, civic learning opportunities positively affected students\u2019 espoused commitments to civic engagement and their attitudes toward the learning experience. Second, MUVEs can be a useful tool for development of skills as articulated by the Framework for 21st Century Learning, although serious thought and reflection must be made to ensure when and how technology is incorporated into schools and curriculum. Third, social justice can be perceived through a lens of community responsibility, although the ambiguity that students have regarding social justice suggests that social deliberation is a more effective lens of encouraging students to critically examine issues and problems in society.

The classical AdaBoost algorithm only requires the underlying weak learner to perform better than random guessing and has shown empirical success in its resistance to overfitting. Many challenges, however, remain to be tackled. There are a number of theoretical research questions such as how to efficiently handle the multiclass classification setting, as well as how to reduce the impacts of outliers to the ensemble model. From an empirical perspective, scaling up a multiclass boosting algorithm, which requires the training of many underlying weak learners, to a large scale dataset is of practical interest.\n\nA novel multiclass classification algorithm Gentle Adaptive Multiclass Boosting Learning (GAMBLE) is proposed to address these issues. The algorithm naturally extends the two class Gentle AdaBoost algorithm to multiclass classification by using the multiclass exponential loss and the multiclass response encoding scheme. Unlike other multiclass algorithms which reduce the K-class classification task to K binary classifications, GAMBLE handles the task directly and symmetrically, with only one committee classifier. We formally derive the GAMBLE algorithm with the quasi-Newton method, and prove the structural equivalence of the two regression trees in each boosting step.\n\nTo scale up to large datasets, we utilize the generalized Query By Committee (QBC) active learning framework to focus learning on the most informative samples. Empirical results show that with QBC-style active sample selection, faster training time and potentially higher classification accuracy can be achieved by using only the informative fraction of the training instances. GAMBLE's numerical superiority, structural elegance and low computation complexity make it highly competitive with state-of-the-art multiclass classification algorithms.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3052], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Jian ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Lee Giles", "C Lee Giles"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Lee Giles, Thesis Advisor", "C Lee Giles, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Active Learning", "Multiclass Classification", "Boosting", "Data Mining"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Tale of Two Paradigms: Disambiguating Extracted Entities with Applications to a Digital Library and the Web", "id": "10561", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13254", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the increasing wealth of information on the Web, information integration is ubiquitous as the same real-world entity may appear in a variety of forms extracted from different sources. This dissertation proposes supervised and unsupervised algorithms that are naturally integrated in a scalable framework to solve the entity resolution problem, which lies at the heart of the information integration process.\n\nThis dissertation focuses on two incarnations of the entity resolution problem that arise in the data mining and natural language processing areas. First, name disambiguation occurs when one is seeking a list of publications of an author in a digital library, who has used different name variations and when there are multiple other authors with the same name. We present an efficient integrative framework that disambiguates the extracted author metadata from paper headers in a divide-and-conquer fashion: based on the metadata records extracted from paper headers, a blocking method retrieves candidate classes of authors with similar names and a density-based clustering method, DBSCAN, clusters the records by author. The distance metric between papers used for clustering is calculated by an online active selection Support Vector Machines algorithm LASVM. We prove that by recasting transitivity as density connectivity in DBSCAN, transitivity is guaranteed for core \npoints. The method achieves high accuracy on a manually labeled dataset and readily disambiguates about a million author metadata records in CiteSeer, which paves the way for the fielded search by author name feature in CiteSeerX. Second, as a key step towards document understanding in natural language processing, we investigate the problem of cross document coreference (CDC), which aims to decipher the true reference of a named entity across the boundary of documents. This dissertation presents a novel cross document coreference approach that leverages the profiles of entities which are constructed by information extraction tools and reconciled using a within-document coreference module. We propose to match the profiles by using a learned ensemble distance function comprised of a suite of similarity specialists. We develop a kernelized soft relational clustering algorithm that makes use of the learned distance function to partition the entities into fuzzy sets of identities. Evaluation on a large benchmark collection shows that the proposed methods achieve competitive coreference results. We further discuss the details of the implementation of the CDC and web person search system.\n\nThis dissertation surveys the literature on author name disambiguation in citations and paper headers, citation matching and cross document coreference. Additionally, we explore the social networks of the disambiguated authors, performing a comprehensive study of the network and community level characteristics and proposing a stochastic model to predict collaborations of individuals.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12801], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Jian ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C.

I identified that residues H55, N60, R62 and D64 within a loop region of the Esa1 Tudor domain are critical for Piccolo NuA4\u2019s nucleosomal HAT activity. The results of pull-down and site-directed UV-crosslinking experiments indicate that this loop region contributes to the binding between Piccolo NuA4 and the nucleosome via interaction with nucleosomal DNA. In vivo studies in yeast show that the point mutations in this loop region affect cell viability and global histone H4 acetylation. Moreover, the Esa1 D64A mutation reduces histone H4 acetylation, recruitment of the HAT complexes to chromatin, and transcription.\n\nThe N-terminal region of the EPcA domain in Epl1 was shown to be important for Piccolo NuA4 binding to the nucleosome. I further identified that residues R58 and K59 in the N-terminal region of EPcA domain are critical for Piccolo NuA4\u2019s nucleosomal HAT activity.  I employed a label transfer assay to determine that the N-terminal region of the EPcA domain is in close proximity to nucleosomal DNA and the histone H2A N-terminal tail.\n\nI also investigated how the RCC1/Ran protein complex interacts with the nucleosome. The Ran GTPase regulates important cellular functions by creating a Ran-GTP gradient around the chromosome. This gradient is established through stimulation of Ran nucleotide exchange by the guanine exchange factor RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation 1). I developed a competition pull-down binding assay to reveal that the nucleosomal binding site of RCC1 included the histone H2A/H2B acidic patch and overlapped with the binding site of the LANA (latency-associated nuclear antigen) peptide from Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus. I initiated work to solve the structure of Ran/RCC1/nucleosome triple complex by X-ray crystallography. I was able to reconstitute and purify several orthologous Ran/RCC1 complexes for reconstitution with the nucleosome. I have grown crystals of several of these triple complexes, and crystals of at least one complex produce medium resolution diffraction.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7582], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Jiehuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiehuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Song Tan", "David Scott Gilmour", "B Tracy Nixon", "Joseph C.

However, it also triggered environmental and human health concerns due to its impact on water resources, especially on disinfection by-product (DBP) formation upon chlorination. Increased bromide levels have been reported in several surface waters in Pennsylvania that accounted for the increased formation of DBPs in downstream water utilities. However, the effects of non-bromide ions in production wastewater at extremely high levels are vaguely defined. In this study, we investigated the effects of production wastewater, with bromide and non-bromide species, on the formation of DBPs when spiked into surface waters at different percentages. Results showed that the spiking of production wastewater dramatically increased DBP formation and shifted its speciation towards brominated species. Brominated DBPs increased at the expenses of chlorinated species as more production wastewater was added, while mixed bromochloro-DBPs rose and then declined. However, the introduction of debrominated production wastewater led to increased formation of some chlorinated DBP species in selected surface water and wastewater. As the spiking percentage of debrominated production wastewater increased, the chlorinated DBP species increased. The study of individual cations suggested that their contributions to DBP formation followed a sequence of magnesium > calcium > barium at high spiking percentage due to the different catalytic effects of their chelates with organic precursors. The study of anions suggested that the discharge of treated production wastewater containing elevated sulfate may further enhance DBP formation. The significance of this study lies in the fact that while bromide concerns from production wastewater are important, non-bromide species also contributed to DBP formation.

NAFLD has been shown to be positively associated with obesity, and thus not surprisingly the majority of NAFLD studies have utilized obese models to explore NAFLD causality. However, previous studies indicated that 25% of patients with NAFLD are not obese and that 7.4% of lean adults have steatosis, and they are more likely to be younger and female, suggesting that these people with lean NAFLD were metabolically obese. Additionally, insulin resistance is an independent risk factor to the development of lean NAFLD, which has been shown to be related to cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Therefore, understanding the etiology of lean NAFLD in the early stage of the development of steatosis becomes an urgent need. On the other hand, lifestyle modification intervention including diet and physical activity is believed to improve NAFLD or even reverse it, but very few studies have focused on the reversal of hepatic steatosis in the lean NAFLD model. Thus, the overall research hypothesis in this dissertation is that the exogenous lipids as a form of lipid emulsion (LE) and physical activity are capable to reverse hepatic triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation in the lean mouse model with preexisting steatosis.\nPrevious work in our laboratory indicated that 13.5% (percent of total energy, en-%) Intralipid\u00ae given orally ameliorated TG accumulation in the liver of nonobese mice fed a high carbohydrate diet (HCD) for 5 weeks. Here, in my first study (chapter 3) I examined whether HCD can induce hepatic steatosis in a short period of time (8d) and whether Intralipid\u00ae and voluntary exercise can prevent liver triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation by regulating the de novo lipogenesis-associated transcripts and the concentrations of total fatty acids, in 8 d, on the development of steatosis in a lean mouse model. The results revealed that hepatic TG contents in the HCD-fed mice were significantly increased, confirmed by Oil Red O staining, suggesting the 8d period of induction of steatosis was sufficient to induce mild steatosis. Supplementation with 13.5% Intralipid\u00ae, with or without exercise, also suppressed HCD-induced steatosis. qRT-PCR analysis showed that including 13.5% Intralipid\u00ae to the HCD significantly decreased the transcript levels for lipogenesis-associated genes, whereas mice-fed HCD with exercise had less beneficial effect in the early stage of steatosis, as compared to HCD supplemented with 13.5% Intralipid\u00ae. Fatty acid profiling also showed a consistency with transcriptional data that the concentration of monounsaturated FA was decreased significantly. \nAs noted in the previous study that HCD is capable to induce mild hepatic steatosis within 8d, I conducted a second study (chapter 4) to test whether the beneficial effect contributed by 13.5% Intralipid\u00ae supplementation will be extended to the mouse with preexisting steatosis. To investigate this, the mice were fed a HCD for 2.5 weeks to establish hepatic steatosis, then switched to HCD+13.5%LE for the final 2.5 wk. A combined targeted biochemical and untargeted metabolomics approach was employed, and biochemical analyses revealed that hepatic TG level and the lipogenic genes were significantly decreased in mice fed HCD with 13.5% Intralipid\u00ae. Total fatty acids and metabolomic profiles in liver and plasma indicated that the mice fed a HCD supplemented with 13.5% Intralipid\u00ae exhibited reduced hepatic lipogenesis, but increases in hepatic Krebs cycle intermediates, and in plasma very-low density lipoprotein. \nMany studies have shown that n-3 and n-9 FA have beneficial effects on lipid metabolism. In a third study (chapter 5), I compared 3 LEs-- Intralipid\u00ae, Omegaven\u00ae and ClinOleic\u00ae-- for their ability to reverse hepatic TG accumulation after the onset of steatosis. At this time, we used biochemical, transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches to capture an overall metabolic change in the lean NAFLD mouse model. The results showed that HCD-induced hepatic steatosis did not develop insulin resistance and that 13.5% Omegaven\u00ae had the strongest reversal effect on hepatic TG accumulation, as well as on the genes involved in the hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, which can further maintain energy homeostasis in the mice with preexisting steatosis. Additionally, lipolysis in the adipose tissue was greatly improved by introduction of Omegaven\u00ae; the metabolites, assayed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, were consistent with the transcriptomic data, suggesting a plausible mechanism of how n-3 FA-based LE reversed hepatic steatosis. \nIn summary, adding 13.5% Intralipid\u00ae to a HCD not only prevents the development of steatosis in the early dynamic stage by reducing de novo lipogenesis, but also mitigates the preexisting hepatic steatosis and energy homeostasis in the liver in a 5-wk study. However, Omegaven\u00ae provides beneficial effect on the reversal of preexisting steatosis as well as an improvement on energy homeostasis in both liver and adipose tissue.

The first problem considers a special case of a two-machine flow shop scheduling problem with asynchronous transportation times and the second one consider an application of flow shop scheduling to automated manufacturing cells with a synchronous material handling device. The objective of both problems is to find a job schedule which minimizes the makespan \u2013 the completion time of the last job. \n\nRegarding the asynchronous transportation times, there is one transporter with a specific capacity to transport jobs from the first machine to the second machine. The processing times on the first machine are job-independent. When the capacity of the transporter is greater than or equal to a threshold value, a dynamic programming algorithm is developed to obtain an optimal schedule. Given that n is the number of jobs, the computational effort of the proposed dynamic programming algorithm is shown to be O(n3).\n\nA new flow shop scheduling problem with synchronous material movement is considered. Specifically, we consider an automated machining center that consists of a loading/unloading (L/U) station, m machine stations, and a material handling device. The L/U station and the machines surround the material handling device, which is a rotary table that moves jobs between stations simultaneously. In this machining center, jobs have to be loaded on the rotary table at the L/U station, be transported to the processing machines subsequently, and finally be unloaded from the rotary table at the L/U station. Given a set of jobs that need to be processed in the machining center, the objective of the problem is to find the sequence that minimizes the makespan. We show that this scheduling problem is strongly NP-hard. A dynamic programming formulation is proposed for solving the problem in a small or medium scale. For large-size problems, two-phase heuristic algorithms are developed to obtain optimal or near optimal solutions in a short time for the cases with one machine and two machines. In addition, lower bounds are also provided for the problems with one, two and m machines. A polynomial-time algorithm is developed for the one-machine case with common unloading (or loading) times.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3565], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Kwei-Long ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kwei-Long", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Antonio Ventura", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "Tao Yao", "Terry Paul Harrison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Chair", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "Terry Paul Harrison, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Material handling", "Transportation", "Makespan", "Flow shop scheduling", "Dynamic prgramming", "Heuristic algorithm"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MOLECULAR CLONING OF A C. elegans LONGEVITY GENE pnc-1 AND INVESTIGATION OF ITS NOVEL FUNCTION IN DEVELOPMENT", "id": "8220", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3926", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The egg-laying apparatus in C. elegans is a great model system to study morphogenesis and organogenesis in developmental biology.  Egg-laying defective (Egl) mutants provide powerful genetic tools to address these issues.  ku212 was isolated as an allele with egg laying and associated connection of gonad defective (Cog) phenotypes.  The corresponding gene was named cog-3.  In this study, phenotypic analyses of ku212 revealed no obvious connection between the vulval and the uterine lumens at the appropriate stage, due to a temporal delay in uterine development.  Mild delay in global gonadogenesis relative to development of extra-gonadal tissues results in the lack of temporal synchronization between the vulva and the uterus.  ku212 mutants also have a specific uterine fate defect.  In wild-type animals, four outer ventral uterine \u00a6\u00d0 cells express LET-23 EGF receptor and adopt the uterine vulval 1 (uv1) fate in response to a vulval-derived LIN-3 EGF signal.  In ku212 mutants, these four uv1 cells undergo necrosis prior to full differentiation.  \nTransformation rescue by pnc-1 and further identification of a nonsense mutation in pnc-1 in ku212 animals confirm that ku212 is an allele of pnc-1, a homolog of a yeast longevity gene Pnc1.  pnc-1 encodes a nicotinamidase which converts nicotinamide (NAM) to nicotinic acid (NA) as part of the NAD+ salvage pathway for recycling NAD+.  PNC-1(ku212) is predicted to be a truncated protein missing the last 8 amino acids.  Although the function of Pnc1 has been extensively studied in longevity in yeast, little is known about its roles in development.  C. elegans pnc-1 clearly participates in a variety of developmental processes as demonstrated by multiple developmental defects in the loss-of-function pnc-1(ku212) mutants.  The impaired nicotinamidase activity could result in high levels of NAM or low levels of NAD+, leading to the developmental defects in the mutants.  \nTwo isoforms of pnc-1 including pnc-1a (with a signal sequence) and pnc-1b (without a signal sequence) are present in C. elegans.  Another nicotinamidase Y57G11C.47, or pnc-2, is identified in this study by its ability to rescue pnc-1(ku212) phenotypes.  How pnc-1 functions in development and how these three nicotinamidases cooperate in C. elegans are still under investigation.  A distinct function of each nicotinamidase confined by their unique localization is postulated.  PNC-1a could be acting as a secreted cue functioning non cell-autonomously.  PNC-1b and PNC-2 could be restricted in some cell types and mediate biological events cell autonomously.  I have detected the distinct expression pattern of pnc-1a in the head and pharyngeal muscle, ASK neuron, distal tip cells, uv2 cells and rectal gland cells.\nIn the process of investigating why uv1 cells undergo necrosis, I found that a gain-of-function mutation in LET-23 EGF receptor and ectopic expression of LIN-3 EGF within the proper temporal constraints can rescue the uv1 death, suggesting a compromised EGF signaling in ku212 mutants.  Activation of Ras-MAP kinase pathway by EGFR in the presumptive uv1 cells is required for uv1 cell fate specification.  However, a let-60(gain-of-function) Ras cannot prevent uv1 cell death, suggesting the requirement of additional signaling pathways in uv1 cell fate specification.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3899], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Li ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Li", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster", "Emine Koc", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Pamela J Mitchell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Chair", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster, Committee Member", "Emine Koc, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Pamela J Mitchell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nicotiamidase", "gonad development", "egg-laying defect", "EGF signaling", "uv1 cells", "NAD"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "THE USE OF PROCESS WRITING AND INTERNET TECHNOLOGY IN A TAIWANESE COLLEGE ENGLISH WRITING CLASS: A FOCUS ON PEER REVIEWS\n", "id": "6463", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4488", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\t The purpose of this action research was to evaluate the effectiveness of using process writing and Internet technology for helping Taiwanese college students overcome the difficulties they encounter in learning to write in English.  This study also examined the attitudes of the students and their teacher towards the implementation of the On-line Writing Project, which were on-line English writing lessons I created, integrating process writing and the Internet, as well as the influence of Chinese/Taiwanese culture on the implementation of the On-line Writing Project.  In this semester-long study, I implemented the On-line Writing Project as the co-teacher of an English writing class at a university in Taipei, Taiwan.  The teacher and his 16 students participated in this study.\n\n\nI collected nine kinds of data, using both qualitative and quantitative research methods.  The results of the quantitative analysis showed that both the On-line Writing Project and the peer reviews were effective, that the students responded positively to process writing, peer reviews, and the use of Internet technology in their English writing course, that the students liked teacher feedback on their writing better than peer feedback and thought that teacher feedback was more helpful than peer feedback, and that the On-line Writing Project decreased the value the participating students placed on searching the World Wide Web but increased their excitement about e-mailing and the trust in their partners\u00a1\u00a6 efforts in peer reviews.\n\n\nThe pre-interviews revealed the difficulties the participating students encountered in learning to write in English and their hopes for an effective, interesting, and interactive English writing class.  Accordingly, the On-line Writing Project was designed, implemented, and evaluated.\n\n  \nI generated several assertions after cross-referencing both the quantitative data and the qualitative data.  Generally speaking, the On-line Writing Project was helpful, and process writing and the Internet technology helped the students in several ways.  The On-line Writing Project did not change the students\u00a1\u00a6 attitudes towards English writing to a great extent; nor did their knowledge of basic English writing principles improve to a great extent; however, their attitudes and behaviors in relation to the course transformed radically.  Specifically, their excitement for the WWW cooled because of the slow connecting speed, the malfunction of the server, and the difficulty of finding what they needed; nonetheless, they maintained their enthusiasm for e-mailing native English speakers.  They were motivated to come to class more often, work harder, write better, and participate in the On-line Writing Project actively.  They also cooperated and helped each other. \n\n\nAlthough the students were equipped with basic English writing knowledge and were capable of indicating their partners\u00a1\u00a6 weaknesses related to content/organization, they were not skilled at giving specific suggestions on how to revise content/organization.  However, they were critical of their peers\u00a1\u00a6 comments: they adopted few incorrect comments even though they revised a great deal and incorporated considerable peer feedback. \n\n \nChinese/Taiwanese culture influenced the implementation of the On-line Writing Project in several ways.  Specifically, the participating students were eager for negative feedback, especially from the teacher.  Their belief in the teacher as the authoritative and single carrier of knowledge, as derived from Chinese/Taiwanese culture, resulted in their lower evaluation of peer feedback, despite the fact that teacher feedback was seldom given and more difficult to understand.  Feeling a lack of authority in students, the students did not completely trust their own and their partners\u00a1\u00a6 abilities as peer reviewers, either.  On the other hand, although the students were not one hundred percent honest to their peers because they considered themselves to be lacking in authority and avoided hurting their peers, they gave their peers considerable negative feedback, contrary to the speculation that Chinese/Taiwanese students may sacrifice honest feedback to maintain group harmony because of the influence of collectivist culture.  \n\n  \nThe participating teacher had not thought highly of using the Internet technology in English writing classes before he participated in the On-line Writing Project; however, his evaluation of the Internet technology was greatly enhanced.  He developed a positive attitude towards process writing, especially when it was combined with Internet technology.  On the whole, the participating teacher gave a high commendation to the On-line Writing Project and was impressed with its motivating effects on his students. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4458], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Mei-ching ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mei-ching", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lourdes Diaz Soto", "Jamie Myers", "Grant H Henning", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lourdes Diaz Soto, Committee Chair", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Grant H Henning, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["process writing", "Internet technology", "peer review", "English writing"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "NONPARAMETRIC TECHNIQUES IN FINITE MIXTURE OF REGRESSION MODELS", "id": "9798", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4582", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mixture models have been popular in the literature of both statistics and social science.

We first consider the mixing proportion in the nonparametric finite mixture of regression models is also a nonparametric function of covariates. We develop an estimation procedure for the nonparametric finite mixture of regression models by employing kernel regression, and proposed an algorithm to carry out the estimation procedure by modifying an EM algorithm. We further systematically studied the sampling properties of the newly proposed estimation procedures and the proposed algorithm. We found that the proposed algorithm preserves the ascent property of the EM algorithm in an asymptotic sense. We derive the asymptotic bias and variance of the resulting estimate. We further established the asymptotic normality of the resulting estimate. Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to assess the finite sample performance of the resulting estimate. The proposed methodology is illustrated by analysis of a real data example.\n\n\nWe further study the nonparametric finite mixture of regression models with constant mixing proportion. Since the mixing proportion is parametric, while the regression function and variance function for each components are nonparametric, the model indeed is a semiparametric model. To achieve better convergent rate for mixing proportional parameters, we develop an estimation procedures by using back-fitting algorithm. To reduce computational cost, we further suggest one-step back-fitting algorithm, which behaves similar to the gradient ECM algorithm. Thus, the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm can be analyzed along the lines for the gradient EM algorithm. We studied the asymptotic properties\nof the resulting estimate. We showed that the resulting estimate for the mixing proportion parameter is root $n$ consistent, and follows an asymptotic normal distribution. We also derived the asymptotic bias and variance for the resulting estimate of the regression function and variance function, and further established their asymptotic normality. Finite sample performance of the proposed procedure is examined by a Monte Carlo simulation study. The proposed procedure is demonstrated by analysis of a real data example.\n\n\nAs the advent of data collection technology and data storage device, researchers are able to collect functional data without much cost. In this dissertation, we studied mixture models for functional data. More specifically, we proposed mixtures of Gaussian processes for functional data. The proposed model is a natural extension of mixture of high-dimensional normals. We develop an estimation procedure to the mean and covariance function of mixture of Gaussian processes by using kernel regression. The proposed methodology is empirically justified by simulation and illustrated by an analysis of the supermarket data.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4549], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Mian ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Runze Li", "Runze Li", "Thomas P Hettmansperger", "David Russell Hunter", "Bruce G Lindsay", "Hoben Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Runze Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Runze Li, Committee Chair", "Thomas P Hettmansperger, Committee Member", "David Russell Hunter, Committee Member", "Bruce G Lindsay, Committee Member", "Hoben Thomas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mixture of regression models", "nonparametric regression", "EM algorithm", "mixture of Gaussian processes"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Molecular Aesthetics: Race, Form, and Matter in Contemporary Asian American Literature", "id": "14235mnh130", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14235", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Molecular Aesthetics: Race, Form, and Matter in Contemporary Asian American Literature examines posthumanist aesthetics in post-1965 Asian American literature to trace racial formation at the molecular scale. In the wake of current ecological disaster and biotechnological fragmentation, a growing number of Asian American novelists, poets, and artists view the scientification of the world as a creative catalyst for imagining smaller and smaller dimensions of human existence. Yet a diametrically opposite inclination can be said to characterize Asian American literary critics, who have largely eschewed engaging with science due to the dark legacy of Enlightenment racial science that cast Asian Americans as fundamentally alien or inhuman. This project argues that fully grasping how these creative works denaturalize sedimented structures of racial knowledge and thinking requires\u2014counterintuitively, perhaps\u2014redoubling critical engagement with scientific discourse. I term these literary experiments, which attenuate the boundaries of the human conceptually and formally, a \u201cmolecular aesthetics.\u201d \n\nIn conversation with Asian American literary studies, posthumanism, and science studies, Molecular Aesthetics considers works of speculative and science fiction, which explicitly engage with science and technology, as well as more traditional texts of Asian American literature where the import of a molecular reading practice is less self-evident. Focusing on texts that make visible microstructures of race shifts theoretical emphasis away from the individual subject to the persistence of racial forms and logics in the absence of recognizably raced bodies. Molecular Aesthetics foregrounds how the formal and aesthetic qualities of texts by authors such as Ruth Ozeki, Larissa Lai, Bhanu Kapil, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Perry Miyake, Julie Otsuka, John Yau, and Jeffrey Yang revise fundamental critical terms in Ethnic American literary analysis such as identity, agency, and race itself. Further, by deploying Asian American literary criticism as a powerful investigative tool for tracking evolving forms of racialization, this project is also an argument for the continuing value of Ethnic American literary studies in a so-called postracial era.

Safety of other airspace users is the primary concern; thus, with the introduction of UAV into the National Airspace System (NAS), a key issue to overcome is the risk of a collision with manned aircraft. The challenge of UAV integration is global. As automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) system has gained wide acceptance, additional exploitations of the radioed satellite-based information are topics of current interest. One such opportunity includes the augmentation of the communication ADS-B signal with a random bi-phase modulation for concurrent use as a radar signal for detecting other aircraft in the vicinity. This dissertation provides detailed discussion about the ADS-B radar system, as well as the formulation and analysis of a suitable non-cooperative multi-target tracking method for the ADS-B radar system using radar ranging techniques and particle filter algorithms.\n\n  In order to deal with specific challenges faced by the ADS-B radar system, several estimation algorithms are studied. Trilateration-based localization algorithms are proposed due to their easy implementation and their ability to work with coherent signal sources. The centroid of three most closely spaced intersections of constant-range loci is conventionally used as trilateration estimate without rigorous justification. In this dissertation, we address the quality of trilateration intersections through range scaling factors. A number of well-known triangle centers, including centroid, incenter, Lemoine point (LP), and Fermat point (FP), are discussed in detail. To the author\u2019s best knowledge, LP was never associated with trilateration techniques. According our study, LP is proposed as the best trilateration estimator thanks to the desirable property that the total distance to three triangle edges is minimized. It is demonstrated through simulation that LP outperforms centroid localization without additional computational load. In addition, severe trilateration scenarios such as two-intersection cases are considered in this dissertation, and enhanced trilateration algorithms are proposed.\n\n  Particle filter (PF) is also discussed in this dissertation, and a simplified resampling mechanism is proposed. In addition, the low-update-rate measurement due to the ADS-B system specification is addressed in order to provide acceptable estimation results. Supplementary particle filter (SPF) is proposed to takes advantage of the waiting time before the next measurement is available and improves the estimation convergence rate and estimation accuracy. While PF suffers from sample impoverishment, especially when the number of particles is not sufficiently large, SPF allows the particles to redistribute to high likelihood areas over iterations using the same measurement information, thereby improving the estimation performance.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8381], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Ming-shih ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ming-shih", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Julio Urbina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ram Mohan Narayanan, Dissertation Advisor", "Ram Mohan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Committee Member", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ADS-B", "Radar system", "Trilateration", "Lemoine point"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Characterization and Cloning of camouflage1, a Maize Gene Functioning in the Tetrapyrrole Synthesis Pathway\n", "id": "9895", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4411", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "During maize leaf development, polarized cell divisions result in clonal cell lineages arrayed along the long axis of the leaf. Utilizing this stereotypical division pattern, a collection of mutants that form chloroplast pigmentation sectors that violate the clonal cell lineages have been identified. Here, we describe the characterization of camouflage1 (cf1), a mutant which develops nonclonal, yellow-green sectors in its leaves. The cf1 gene was cloned by transposon tagging and found to encode porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), an enzyme that functions early in chlorophyll and heme biosynthesis. Although PBGD has been characterized biochemically, no viable mutations in this gene had been reported in plants. To investigate the in vivo function of PBGD, we characterized the cf1 mutant. Histological analyses revealed that cf1 yellow sectors display the novel phenotype of bundle sheath (BS) cell-specific death. Constant light suppressed cf1 sector formation, indicating that a dark/light transition is required to induce yellow sectors. Furthermore, sectors form only during a limited time in leaf development. Biochemical experiments determined that cf1 mutant leaves have decreased PBGD activity and increased levels of the enzyme substrate in both green and yellow regions. Moreover, the cf1 yellow regions displayed a reduction in catalase activity. A threshold model is proposed to explain cf1 variegation that incorporates photosynthetic cell differentiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and PBGD function.\nThe restricted BS cell death in cf1 mutants resembles that observed in programmed cell death (PCD). PCD is commonly seen during plant development and in response to biotic and abiotic stress. Lesion mimic22 (Les22), another maize mutant in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway, displays a cell death pattern similar to PCD observed in the hypersensitive response (HR) during pathogen attack. Genetic analysis investigating whether cell death in the cf1 and Les22 mutants is mediated by the same mechanism showed that the two mutants initiate cell death independently. Moreover, accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a type of ROS involved in many PCD processes, is found in Les22 lesions but not in cf1 yellow or green sectors. Lack of a ROS burst, combined with a much reduced heme level in cf1 yellow sectors, supports our model that BS cell death in cf1 mutants is caused by a deficiency in ROS scavenging capability. Additionally, we found that functional chloroplasts are required for BS cell death in cf1 mutants, in contrast with the case of Les22. Therefore, the data suggest that PCD in cf1 is mediated by a different mechanism than in HR-related cell death. \nGene duplication can increase functional diversity and specificity of genes. necrotic3 (nec3), a null mutation of cf1, is lethal if grown in a regular day/night cycle. When grown in a constant light environment, the cf1-nec3 phenotype is largely alleviated as evidenced by the seedling\u2019s ability to make chlorophyll. These data indicate the presence of a functional duplicate gene of cf1. We probed a maize bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library and found a duplicate gene, camouflage2 (cf2). CF1 and CF2 share 97.5% identity in their protein sequence. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that cf1 and cf2 likely resulted from a gene duplication event. RT-PCR experiments determined that cf2 is expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest expression level detected in photosynthetic tissues. Similar to CF1, the CF2 protein also has a predicted plastid-target signal peptide in its N terminus, and a CF2 red fluorescent protein (CF2-RFP) fusion protein localizes to chloroplasts. The similarities in sequence, expression pattern and localization between CF1 and CF2 suggest that they have related functions in producing heme and chlorophyll.\ncf1 is the first viable mutant in PBGD in plants. Studies on cf1 mutants provide insight into the complicated regulatory network of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, a pathway conserved from bacteria to higher eukaryotes including humans. Additionally, cf1 is the first mutant reported that display BS-specific cell death. This reveals a sensitivity difference of BS compared with mesophyll cells, to disturbance of an important metabolic pathway, probably due to an imbalance between ROS generation and scavenging capability. Studies of a null mutation in cf1 uncovered the presence of a PBGD duplicate gene. Gene duplication of PBGD appears to be uncommon in plants, and this is the first case reported in the grass family, which may reflect the high degree of redundancy in the maize genome.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4381], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Mingshu ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mingshu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David M Braun", "Sarah Mary Assmann", "David Braun", "Paula Mc Steen", "Surinder Chopra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David M Braun, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Chair", "David Braun, Committee Member", "Paula Mc Steen, Committee Member", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tetrapyrrole biosynthesis", "porphobilinogen deaminase", "maize", "camouflage1", "programmed cell death", "ROS"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Essays in Monetary and Banking Theory", "id": "13707", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7270", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\n    Chapter 1, Lotteries are introduced into Cavalcanti-Erosa (2008), a version of Trejos-Wright (1995) with aggregate shocks.

We have also witnessed the rapid advancement of related technologies. Despite the advancement, the adoption of microfluidic devices in daily human life for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes is still very limited, the reason being that to date, only a few powerful fluid manipulation devices have been proposed. This thesis has centered on understanding, designing, and prototyping a new class of acoustofluidic (i.e., the fusion of acoustics and microfluidics) devices to pave the foundation for applications, ranging from biomedical/chemical research to clinical applications. Implementing the acoustic streaming effect induced by oscillating sharp-edge structures in microfluidics, we have developed a series of sharp-edge-based acoustofluidic technologies that are able to control and manipulate fluids and micro-objects.\n\nFirst of all, an acoustofluidic micromixer is developed where rapid and homogeneous mixing of fluid was achieved via the acoustic streaming induced by oscillating sharp-edge structures. The acoustic streaming induced by the oscillation of sharp-edge structures allows two fluids to interchange and thus enhances the mass transport across the channel, greatly improving the mixing efficiency. Our sharp-edge-based acoustofluidic micromixer possesses desirable characteristics, including excellent mixing performance, simplicity, convenient and stable operation, fast mixing speed, and ability to be toggled on-and-off, which makes it a promising candidate for a wide variety of lab-on-a-chip applications.\n\nBuilt directly on the sharp-edge-based acoustofluidic micromixer, a modified sharp-edge-based acoustofluidic micromixer is developed for the mixing of highly-viscous fluid samples. The capability of our sharp-edge-based acoustofluidic micromixer for the mixing of highly-viscous samples is demonstrated by liquefying human sputum samples on-chip, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first microfluidic sputum liquefaction device, also known as acoustofluidic sputum liquefier. Our sharp-edge-based acoustofluidic sputum liquefier is a promising candidate for incorporation with other on-chip components that will enable the development of a fully integrated, self-contained sputum processing and analysis platform. In addition, our device can possibly be employed for applications that require the processing of highly viscous fluids.\n\nBy engineering the acoustic streaming patterns generated inside the microfluidic channel, a sharp-edge-based acoustofluidic chemical gradient generator is presented.\nThe generation of concentration gradients of chemical is due to the serial mixing of different solutions. Through the modulation of the driving signals of piezoelectric transducer, our sharp-edge-based acoustofluidic gradient generator can generate spatiotemporally controllable concentration gradients. The biocompatibility of our sharp-edge-based acoustofluidic gradient generator is validated by carrying out experiments of cell migration, as well as by preserving the cell viability after long-term exposure to an acoustic field. Our device features advantages such as simple fabrication and operation, compact and biocompatible device, and generation of spatiotemporally tunable gradients.\n\nFinally, to expand the potential of the acoustic streaming induced by oscillating sharp-edge structure, a highly reliable, programmable acoustofluidic micropump is developed. By engineering the geometry of sharp-edge structure, specifically, tilting the sharp-edge structure, the acoustic streaming pattern generated inside the channel is altered. This altered streaming pattern then produces a net force pointing toward the direction where the sharp-edge structure is tilted; as a result of the net force, fluid pumping motion occurs along the parallel direction where the sharp-edge structure was tilted. Our sharp-edge-based acoustofluidic micropump offers advantages over other microfluidic pumps in terms of not only simplicity, stability, reliability and cost-effectiveness, but also controllability and flexibility, which, when combined, make it valuable for many lab-on-a-chip applications. \n\nTo sum up, a series of acoustofluidic devices are developed and presented to control and manipulate fluids via the acoustic streaming effect induced by oscillating sharp-edge structures. Due to the advantages of high biocompatibility, ease of manipulation, high flexibility and controllability, and low power consumption, the acoustofluidic technologies that we have developed are invaluable for many microfluidic applications. The work presented in this dissertation serves as an important example and the foundation for the future development of sharp-edge-based acoustofluidic devices.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12726], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Po-Hsun ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Po-Hsun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["TONY JUN HUANG", "Jun Huang", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Francesco Costanzo", "Siyang Zheng", "Corina Stefania Drapaca"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["TONY JUN HUANG, Dissertation Advisor", "Jun Huang, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Member", "Siyang Zheng, Outside Member", "Corina Stefania Drapaca, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microfluidics", "Acoustofluidics", "Acoustic streaming", "Micropump", "Micromixer", "Chemical gradient", "Sputum liquefaction"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATION OF ENHANCEMENT OF DOWNWARD FACING BOILING  HEAT TRANSFER USING MICRO-POROUS COATINGS", "id": "15297sxh515", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15297", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nucleate boiling is a well-recognized means for passively removing high heat loads (up to ~106 W/m2) generated by a molten reactor core under severe accident conditions while maintaining relatively low reactor vessel temperature (<800oC). With the upgrade and development of advanced power reactors, however, enhancing the nucleate boiling rate and its upper limit, Critical Heat Flux (CHF), becomes the key to the success of external passive cooling of reactor vessel undergoing core disrupture accidents. In the present study, I mainly focus on the use of a suitable surface coating to enhance downward-facing boiling rate and CHF limit so as to substantially increase the possibility of reactor vessel surviving high thermal load attack. \nAmong the various available surface coating techniques, metallic micro-porous layer surface coating has been identified as an appropriate coating material for use in External Reactor Vessel Cooling (ERVC) based on the overall consideration of enhanced performance, durability, the ease of manufacturing and application. Since no previous research work had explored the feasibility of applying such a metallic micro-porous layer surface coating on a large, downward facing and curved surface such as the bottom head of a reactor vessel, a series of characterization tests and experiments were performed in the present study to determine a suitable coating material composition and application method. Using the optimized metallic micro-porous surface coatings, quenching and steady-state boiling experiments were conducted in the Sub-scale Boundary Layer Boiling (SBLB) test facility at Penn State to investigate the nucleate boiling and CHF enhancement effects of the surface coatings by comparing the measurements with those for a plain vessel without coatings. An overall enhancement in nucleate boiling rates and CHF limits up to 100% were observed. Based on the results of visualizations in the quenching experiments, the coated vessel was found to quench much faster than the bare vessel under identical experimental conditions, indicating a higher downward-facing boiling heat transfer (i.e., cooling rate) for the coated vessel. It was also observed that the local rate of boiling and the local CHF limit tended to vary appreciably along the outer surface of the test vessel. Quantitative measurements showed that for all angular locations on the vessel outer surface, the local CHF values for the coated vessel were consistently higher than the corresponding CHF values for the bare vessel. Moreover, combination of data from quenching experiments and steady-state experiments produced new sets of boiling curves, which covered both the nucleate and transient boiling regimes with much greater accuracy. Beside the experimental work, a theoretical CHF model has also been developed by considering the vapor dynamics and the boiling-induced two-phase motions in three separate regions adjacent to the heating surface. The CHF model is capable of predicting the performance of micro-porous coatings with given particle diameter, porosity, media permeability and thickness. It is found that the present CHF model agrees favorably with the experimental data.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16851], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Shan ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "first_name_ssi": "Shan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fan-Bill B Cheung"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fan-Bill B Cheung, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CHF  coating  vessel"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Study of structure and dynamics of plant cell wall polysaccharides via neutron scattering", "id": "25066", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11020", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Plant cell wall plays important biological functions of plant bodies and constitutes many renewable sources that can be used to make paper, textile, polymer derivatives and alternative energy resources. At the nanoscale, plant cell wall is an extraordinarily complex composite composed of three polysaccharides, namely, cellulose, hemicellulose and pectins. Despite numerous works have been done to understand the wall polysaccharides over the past three centuries, many aspects of cell wall are still not clear. \nTo enhance the understanding of plant cell wall, it is necessary to investigate cell wall at molecular level. Cell walls of both wild-type and xyloglucan-deficient mutant Arabidopsis thaliana are investigated. HPAEC experiment is performed to determine the fraction of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectins. Cell wall structure at nanometer scale is characterized by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). In this work, two methodologies are used to obtain information that was not available before. One is applying selective deuterium labeling on the non-cellulose polysaccharides in cell wall. Since the scattering of neutron from hydrogen is very different than that of deuterium, doing selective deuterium labeling create contrast between cellulose and the non-cellulose polysaccharides. Another method applied here is using contrast matching to detect structure of cellulose and the non-cellulose polysaccharides in turn. Models are utilized to fit the SANS profiles and to obtain the structural information of the cell wall samples. As expected, cellulose is high-aspect cylinders with diameters of about 3 nm and lengths of more than 100 nm. Partial surface of cellulose is covered by non-cellulose polysaccharides in wild-type Arabidopsis, which feature is negligible in xyloglucan-deficient mutant. This difference illustrates a unique role of xyloglucan in cell wall. However, not all xyloglucan is in close contact with cellulose, about half of xyloglucan has structure similar to the other non-cellulose polysaccharides, being solvated in water and only form extended coils, potentially function as spacers to separate cellulose microfibrils. \n\tThe experiment method, used to determined cell wall structure of Arabidopsis, is extended to several plant species to obtain a more general picture of cell wall. One prominent difference among plants is cell wall composition. For example, non-graminaceous land plants contain a large fraction of xyloglucan whereas graminaceous monocot cell walls contain little xyloglucan but much mixed-linkage glucans and arabinoxylans. HPAEC and SANS are used to determine the composition and the cell wall structure of cucumber, onion, wheat and maize. The composition and the cell wall structure of cucumber and onion are similar to that is found in wild-type Arabidopsis: cellulose microfibrils are about 3 nm thick and partially coated by xyloglucan. Most of the non-cellulose polysaccharides form extended coils. Maize and wheat have little xyloglucan and decent amount of mixed-linkage glucan. A decent coating around cellulose microfibril is observed in in maize cell wall, presumably the mixed-linkage glucan play a similar role as xyloglucan in maize. This might be because the similar backbone to xyloglucan and cellulose microfibrils.\nTo fully understand plant cell wall, we study not only cellulose-xyloglucan interaction between cellulose and the other polysaccharides, but also the interaction between cellulose and water. It should be noted that water makes up about 80% mass of cell wall. To remain active, cell wall requires an aqueous environment to permeate proteins and ions. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering is used to study the water dynamics. We investigate the state of water when it is in close contact with cellulose. On the surface of cellulose, two hydration layers are identified. Water in the inner hydration layer is directly constrained by the surface of cellulose. Thus the water molecules are confined and show relaxation times 100 times slower than bulk water. Water in the outer hydration layer is less confined but still has dynamics 5 times slower than bulk water. Despite the difference in the translational motion, both inner and outer hydration water shares similar rotational and vibrational diffusivity.  \nTo sum up, we bring an integrated result that includes the molecular interaction not only between cellulose and the non-cellulose polysaccharides but also between cellulose and water. Our results indicate cellulose in primary cell wall is about 3 nm thick, and sometimes the surface is covered by matrix polysaccharides if xyloglucan or mixed-linked glucan is decent. Most matrix polysaccharides are not capable to directly deposit on the cellulose surface. Instead, they form extended coils, presumably function as interfibril spacers.

Due to the tremendous number of users, these sites are playing a more and more important role in business marketing and customer care. The ex-ante knowledge of the future social activity and network status can assist a lot in decision making and improve the profit of businesses.\n\nExisting approaches analyze social networks and predict their future behaviors by modeling the evolving network with all cumulative nodes (members) and connections. Although the arrival of new nodes is taken into consideration to address the dynamic nature of social networks, in general, the degree of fine-grained node activity (e.g. a user adds a friend or posts on a friend's wall) has played very little role in such an analysis. As the infrastructure of a social network heavily depends on the member activities, we propose to explore the collective social dynamics and community infrastructure to predict the future social activity. As the evolution of social networks is a random process, we make use of a continuous-time stochastic process model with an uncountable future state space to simulate the social dynamics and investigate the impact of user activities.\n\nIn this thesis, we derive a novel parameterized model that incorporates the information embedded in collective activities to predict various features of the social community, including the size of active population, the number of social interactions, the social sentiment trend, etc. With member activities evolving over time, the predicting model itself also evolves and therefore dynamically simulates the network status to fit the real-time characteristics of the current active population.

Finding and applying such hidden semantics of UGC and social correlations illustrates a new way in solving various problems. In this thesis, we study several challenging data management problems to investigate how to apply the framework of UGC mining and social network analysis to substantially improve existing solutions.  In particular, we focus on the following four problems:\n\nFirst, we propose a novel query expansion technique in Information Retrieval that exploits the ``location-based'' correlation between users and search engine user logs. We explore the vocabulary of users from different geographic locations and investigate the semantic relations among the documents they search for. Based on that, a hierarchical location and topic based query expansion model is proposed to improve the accuracy of web search. Our proposed model predicts the query location sensitivity with more than 80% precision. Using the model, the final search result is significantly better than several existing query expansion methods.\n\nSecond, we explore the aggregate social activity and evaluate the significance of various activity features in determining the social activity evolution. In particular, we look in to various formats of social activities and measure how member activity impacts the evolution of the active population. Several activity features are extracted and their impact on the community evolution is evaluated with a feature selection model. Based on the model, the most significant features are identified.\n\nThird, we study UGC on Twitter, a large online platform of social media, to identify tweet topics and sentiments towards some preset brands/products. To help understand brand perception and customer opinions, we utilize the correlation of tweet sentiments and topics, and propose a multi-task multi-label (MTML) classification model that performs classification of both sentiments and topics simultaneously. It incorporates results of each task from prior steps to promote and reinforce the other iteratively. Meanwhile, by using multiple labels, the class ambiguity can be addressed. Compared with baselines, MTML produces a much higher accuracy of both sentiment and topic classification.\n\nFurthermore, based on tweet sentiment analysis, social network among Twitter users is also taken into consideration to investigate the impact of events on tweet sentiment change. By mining tweets about 2012 USA presidential campaign, we analyze the sentiments towards the presidential candidates. Meanwhile, we incorporate social correlation between Twitter users and present a method to predict the impact of events based on social activities. Analysis on tweets collected over 8 months shows that our method can predict the sentiment change with high accuracy. Mining UGC and social network is not only efficient but also effective in predicting the impact of events.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9013], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Shu ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee", "Peng Liu", "Heng Xu", "Jack C Hayya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee, Dissertation Advisor", "Peng Liu, Committee Member", "Heng Xu, Committee Member", "Jack C Hayya, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["data mining", "social network", "information retrieval"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Heterogeneity in Hybrid Involved Crash Severities: \nan exploratory Analysis Using The Hierarchical Mixed Logit Model With Hierarchical Hybrid Vehicle Attributes\n", "id": "26497", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11774", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, hybrid vehicles have been increasingly accepted by consumers because of environmental, economic and nonrenewable (e.g. fossil fuels) resource concerns.  In addition to the differences in fuel source, hybrid vehicles are different from the traditional fuel-engine vehicles in terms of ride characteristics, ride noise, vehicles weight, etc. For example, the power of hybrid vehicles comes from the combination of a fuel engine and an electric engine; when hybrid vehicles are using an electric engine, overall traffic noise is much lower than it would be with a traditional fuel engine vehicle. In addition, because of the extra battery, hybrid vehicles are always heavier than fuel engine vehicles in the same class. Factors such as weight distribution, vehicle noise interactions with driver and other vehicles can be sources of potential shifts in severity distributions involving hybrid vehicle crashes.  In particular, how the attributes of a hybrid vehicle affect our inferences on crash severity propensities is a largely unaddressed issue in the literature.  With the emergence of the hybrid vehicle market, this issue is bound to become prominent in our address of severe crashes in the nation, especially the FHWA\u2019s target of lowering fatalities.  \nThis thesis attempts contribute some insight into the impact of hybrid vehicle attributes on crash severity propensities by using a random parameter (mixed) logit model to predict the crash severity in crashes involving hybrid vehicles. Three levels of severity are considered: (a) property damage only; (b) possible injury; and (c) injury. The injury category combines the fatality, severe (incapacitating) injury and evident injury categories.  Using 5 years (from 2006 to 2010) of statewide data from reported crashes in Washington State involving hybrid vehicles, this thesis develops a mixed logit model for the severity of crashes involving hybrid vehicles, by considering factors such as roadway conditions, environment factors, driver and passenger attributes and vehicle characteristics. The mixed logit model is the state of the art in modeling crash severity.  However, the extant literature does not include a form of the mixed logit model where the random crash severity parameters are evaluated hierarchically.  The hierarchical model allows for the identification of factors that can influence of the mean of the random parameters in the mixed logit.  In this thesis, the hierarchical influences consist of hybrid vehicle attributes, due to the fact that at least one of the vehicles involved in the crash dataset is a hybrid.  The research results shows that the hierarchical mixed logit is a plausible approach for gaining insight into the particular impact of hybrid vehicle attributes on crash severity parameters.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11237], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Shuaiqi ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "first_name_ssi": "Shuaiqi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar", "Vikash Varun Gayah", "Sukran Ilgin Guler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar, Thesis Advisor", "Vikash Varun Gayah, Thesis Advisor", "Sukran Ilgin Guler, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hybrid Vehicle Crash", "Hierarchical Mixed Logit Model", "Hybrid Vehicle Attributes"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Detecting Policy Violators in Online Social Community\nan Extended Bayesian Belief Network Approach\n", "id": "15346", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7186", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, I have implemented solution for detecting policy violators in online social communities. Given the increasing number of users and traffic in online social services, e.g., forums, it is difficult for administrators to manually oversee the activities. My solution is designed to resolve such problems.\nTo achieve the goal, this thesis implemented a risk warning system, using Bayesian networks (BN).  BN is, firstly, a directed acyclic graph. Each node in the BN represents a hypothesis for user to have certain attributes. The arcs describe causal relationships between nodes. In this thesis, BN is designed using na\u00efve-based classifier. In other words, it is assumed that all hypotheses are independent to each other. Secondly, the BN is also a statistical model. The data collected represents behavioral features about a user. These features, after processed by input nodes, become hypothesize of user. Input nodes are parent nodes of intermediate nodes. Each intermediate node represents an intermediate attribute of the user. Intermediate nodes are parents of core model nodes. Core model nodes model intent, opportunity and capability of the monitored user. These core model nodes are parents of the result node. For the result of BN, the result node produces a conditional probability. This value indicates a binary outcome of whether the user is malicious. \nOur solution includes a number of key techniques for handling data mining and processing. For example, Page Rank and Degree Centrality are implemented to monitor the popularity of the user. Sentimental Analysis, Topic Mining and Mutual Information are used for detecting the Authenticity and Relevance of user generated content. \nFor test and evaluation, this thesis commandeers real world data of a top forum. The tests are designed to include fifty users with more than ten thousand posts per user as sample. To evaluate the performance of the BN, true positive and true negative ratios are carefully counted against human moderator. A true positive happens when BN successfully catches an abusive post. A true negative occurs when the post is malicious but the test result indicating otherwise. The test results show very high ratio of true positives and true negatives comparing to human moderator. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7171], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Shuo ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shuo", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu", "John Yen", "Anna Cinzia Squicciarini"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu, Thesis Advisor", "John Yen, Thesis Advisor", "Anna Cinzia Squicciarini, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Social Network", "Spam", "Page Rank", "Bayesian Network", "Mutual Information"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF \nINTERACTIONS BETWEEN ITK AND G&#945;13\n\n", "id": "11229", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6617", "abstract_tesi": "The Tec family kinase, Itk has been shown to be critical in T cell activation and development downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR). Other than TCR ligands, migratory responses to chemokines such as CCL11/Eotaxin and CXCL12/SDF-1&#945; that act through G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), require Itk. However, the mechanism by which chemokine receptor signals connect to Itk is not clear. \nWe hypothesize that the G-protein  G&#945;13 may serve to couple GPCRs, Itk and downstream signals. Using a Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation system, we show that Itk and G&#945;13 are in close physical proximity, less than 80\u00c5. \nWe extended the investigation to test the properties of Itk and G&#945;13 that are important for this interaction.  The interaction requires the membrane localization of both parties, as a membrane targeting deficient mutant of Itk (R29C), lost its association with WT G&#945;13, and a membrane targeting deficient mutant of G&#945;13 (C14S, C18S) lost its interaction with WT Itk. However, this interaction is Itk kinase activity independent (shown by Itk K391M mutant). We also show that both GTP bound and GDP bound forms of G&#945;13 can interact with Itk. Interestingly, we found that mutations in the Zn2+ binding Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (Btk) homology (BH) motif (C132GC133G, CCGG for further reference), disrupted the interaction between Itk and G&#945;13, even though this Itk mutant was still able to get recruited by WT Itk and form membrane associated clusters. The striking finding is that co-expression of Itk and G&#945;13 resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of G&#945;13. Moreover, we found that the interaction between Itk and G&#945;13 is transient upon stimulation against TCR signaling axis.\n  Taken together, we propose that interactions between G&#945;13 and Itk may connect chemokine/chemokine receptor stimulation and downstream responses regulated by Itk. Itk may also modulate the function of G&#945;13 by tyrosine phosphorylation. These data provide evidence for better understanding of the mechanism by which chemokines regulate immune cell responses.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6615], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Weishan ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Weishan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Avery August", "Avery August"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Avery August, Thesis Advisor", "Avery August, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["protein-protein interaction", "G&#945;13", "signal transduction", "T cell receptor", "Itk", "G protein coupled receptor"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Context Modeling for Semantic Text Matching and Scene Text Detection", "id": "zw12z528p", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12776", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Context is the information that surrounds and defines the target information it encapsulates. Without context, the most related target information could be misinterpreted. Most existing models utilize context by encoding it as a set of human-crafted heuristic features for machine learning, which may not fully capture\nmany connections between the context and the target. We contend that, in the setting of big data, context information should be modeled in a more principled way that is tightly coupled with learning algorithms. We present several machine learning models that learn the relations between context and related target information for two fundamental tasks in natural language processing and computer vision: semantic\ntext matching and scene text detection. In particular, this dissertation addresses two different applications with context modeling: citation recommendation for scientific papers and localizing text in the wild.\n\nCitations are crucial in academic attribution. A good citation recommendation engine can help both researchers and reviewers check the completeness of citations. Existing models for citation recommendation were mostly built on general recommendation models. Such methods usually project context into high dimensional feature vectors without directly modeling the relation between the citation context and the citation. Here, we propose two context-based models which learn the semantic relations between the citation contexts and the cited documents. Both models achieve state-of-the-art recommendation results on the CiteSeerX dataset. \n\nDetecting text in an unconstrained natural scene environment is a challenging task because of the many fonts, sizes, backgrounds, and alignments of the characters.

Fluvial erosion processes are driven by water discharge on the land surface, which depends on precipitation rates, soil moisture conditions, and groundwater discharge.  Much evidence indicates that these hydrologic processes have influences on long-term landscape evolution.  This dissertation focuses on obtaining a deeper understanding about how watershed hydrology affects the long-term evolution of a fluvial geomorphic system.  In particular, the dissertation addresses the question from three different stages.  First, the Geomorphic Effective Event (GEE) is often assumed to represent basin hydrology in most analysis and modeling of landscape evolution, the implications of the GEE in landscape evolution are explored through analytical and numerical approaches when the stream power erosion model with a threshold is used.  It is found that the GEE is highly affected by the threshold and the exponent on discharge.  Next, in order to account for the temporal and spatial variations of discharge rates at any location in a basin, a distributed hydrologic model was developed to consider the variability of precipitation, infiltration, evapotranspiration, and groundwater movement. The hydrologic model was calibrated using the hydrologic data of the WE-38 basin in Pennsylvania, and then coupled with a widely used geomorphic model.  The combined hydrologic/geomorphic model was used to examine the geomorphic role of Horton runoff and groundwater discharge.  Results show that groundwater processes produce three distinct zones, which have different relationships between annual streamflow and contributing area.  Groundwater processes also produce the abrupt hillslope-valley transition in the future topography of the WE-38 basin.  Finally, the conditions under which groundwater plays an important role in shaping the river basin topography are determined through exploring the sensitivity of watershed slope-area relationships and hypsometric curves to hydrologic and geomorphic parameters.  It is found that groundwater produces an abrupt hillslope-valley transition only if the erosion threshold is close to zero and the exponent on discharge is below one.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6702], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Xiangjiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiangjiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey D Niemann", "Arthur Carl Miller", "Peggy Ann Johnson", "Christopher J Duffy", "Rudy L Slingerland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey D Niemann, Committee Chair", "Arthur Carl Miller, Committee Chair", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member", "Rudy L Slingerland, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["watershed hydrology", "landscape evolution"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MEMBRANE ELECTRODE ASSMEBLY OF DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELLS USING HYDROCARBON MEMBRANES AND SUPPORTED CATALYSTS", "id": "9516", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6670", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is an attractive power source for portable applications in the near future, due to the high energy density of liquid methanol. Towards commercialization of the DMFC, several technical and economic challenges need to be addressed though. The present study aims at developing and characterizing high performance membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for the DMFCs by using a hydrocarbon type membrane (PolyFuel 62) and supported catalysts (PtRu/C).\nFirst, methanol and water transport properties in the PolyFuel 62 membrane were examined by various material characterization methods. Compared with the currently used perflurosulfonated Nafion 212 membrane, the PolyFuel membrane has lower methanol crossover, especially at high testing temperature. In addition, based on results of water diffusivity test, water diffusion through the PolyFuel membrane was also lower compared with the Nafion membrane.\nIn order to check the possible impacts of the low methanol and water diffusivities in the PolyFuel membrane, a MEA with this new type of membrane was developed and its performance was compared with a Nafion MEA with otherwise identical electrodes and GDLs. The results showed anode performance was identical, while cathode performance of the PolyFuel MEA was lower. More experiments combined with a transmission line model revealed that low water transport through the PolyFuel membrane resulted in a higher proton resistance in the cathode electrode and thus, leading to a low cathode performance. Thus increasing the water content in the cathode electrode is critical for using the PolyFuel membrane in the DMFC MEA.\nThen, a low loading carbon supported catalyst, PtRu/C, was prepared and tested as the anode electrode in a MEA of the DMFC. Compared with performance of an unsupported MEA, we could find that lower performance in the supported MEA was due to methanol transport limitation because of the denser and thicker supported catalyst layer. Accordingly, an addition of a pore former, Li2CO3, was proposed during the catalyst ink preparation. This was proved to be very effective, largely improving anode performance with only 1/3 of catalyst loading.\nFinally, the PolyFuel membrane and supported catalysts were ready to be applied in the new MEA for the DMFCs. The new made MEA, with the catalyst loading of 2.6-time lower than a reference MEA, showed a very promising result, about only 10mV performance loss under the current density of 150mA/cm2 compared with the reference MEA. Moreover, a short-term decay test indicated that the new MEA may have better durability and life because of its low methanol crossover on the cathode electrode due the PolyFuel membrane.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6667], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Xiaoming ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaoming", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Chao Yang Wang", "Long Qing Chen", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DMFC", "electrolyte membrane", "supported catalyst"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Multiscale mechanics of carbon nanotubes and graphene", "id": "14779", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7133", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Graphene, a single sheet of graphite, has recently emerged as one of the most exciting material systems to study, propelled by the discovery of unusual fundamental physical phenomena such as unconventional quantum Hall effects and surprisingly high room-temperature electron mobility.

Such a monumental push for new technologies, however, requires a deep physical understanding of the deformation, failure, and the coupled thermo-mechanical-electrical properties of this emergent material system.\t\n\nThis thesis contributes to the multiscale mechanics of graphene and its curved version, carbon nanotubes (CNT). As a one-atom-thick film with large ratio of the in-plane rigidity to out-of-plane bending rigidity, a monolayer graphene ripples even only under the thermal fluctuation. For layered graphene or multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs), the interplay between the interlayer interactions and in-plane deformation energies often leads to ordered deformation patterns under external loadings. The deformation morphologies of graphene and CNTs not only change their mechanical properties, but only affect their electronic properties. Understanding the deformation morphologies and the kinetics of the defects in graphene and CNTs is critical to the engineering and fabrication of the graphene/CNT-based devices. \n\nEnormous efforts have been undertaken in computationally modeling the deformation morphologies and defect motion in graphene. Classical single-scale methods such as quantum mechanical, molecular dynamics, and continuum mechanics simulations suffer from either length scale and time scale limitations or simulation accuracy. To achieve both physical accuracy and computational efficiency, this thesis strives to develop novel multiscale modeling approaches to bridge phenomena across different length and time scales. In particular, for pristine graphene and CNTs, the interatomic potentials are seamlessly cast into the constitutive relations of the finite crystal elasticity theories for atomic membranes. For interlayer bridged MWCNTs, the interlayer force-separation relations obtained from atomistic simulations are embedded into the continuum level constitutive relations through hierarchical message passing. To overcome the time scale barriers of molecular dynamics simulations, minimum energy paths and the transition states of various atomic processes are determined using the pathway sampling schemes such as the nudged elastic band (NEB) method.\n\nThe multiscale modeling approaches enabled large-scale simulations of CNTs and graphene, and revealed a range of interesting deformation phenomena, typically inaccessible to previous single-scale models. For pristine MWCNTs, a variety of ordered deformation patterns such as periodic rippling were identified under different loading conditions, which are in distinct comparison to the local sharp buckling phenomena observed in SWCNTs. For interlayer bridged MWCNTs, the presence of inter-wall covalent bridges not only enhances the post-buckling rigidities of the MWCNTs, but also modifies the deformation morphologies and morphology pathways of MWCNTs. For defected graphene and CNTs, we found that chemical addictives such as hydrogen and oxygen atom regulate the fracture paths.  Further, the migration barrier and direction of defects and adatoms (such as Li) strongly depend on the applied stress and strain.  The findings from the thesis research are not only scientifically significant, but also offer guidance to the engineering of MWCNTs and graphene as next-generation electronic nanodevices.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7123], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Xu ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sulin Zhang", "Sulin Zhang", "Charles E Bakis", "Jian Xu", "Md Amanul Haque", "Vincent Henry Crespi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sulin Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Chair", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Carbon nanotube; Graphene; Multiscale Modeling; Buckling; Rippli"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ATTITUDE STABILITY AND RESISTANCE: THE IMPACT OF NARRATIVES IN HEALTH COMMUNICATION", "id": "13765yxh185", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13765", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Individuals do not process health campaign messages in a vacuum. Rather, health messages often face various challenges presented by audiences\u2019 resistance, persuasive attempts from different interest groups as well as the passage of time. While the persuasive appeal of narrative health messages has been well-documented in prior literature, it remains unclear if the impact of narrative persuasion will hold in a competitive environment. In particular, will the advantage of narrative persuasion change over time? Are the persuasion outcomes generated by narrative messages able to resist the influence of an opposing message encountered at a later time? Can narrative messages effectively persuade individuals who hold a strong opposite pre-existing opinion?  This dissertation examined these questions through two experiments in the context of a health campaign advocating the use of radiotherapy in cancer care. \nThe first experiment (N = 171) focuses on the overtime impact of narratives. Findings suggest that the narrative pro-radiotherapy message outperformed the rhetorical message in shaping an immediate behavioral intention as well as a delayed favorable attitude toward radiotherapy. Moreover, the narrative message fostered a stronger memory than did the rhetorical message. The second experiment (N = 457) employed a 2 (Format of the initial pro-radiotherapy message: narratives vs. rhetorical) \u00d7 2 (Format of the subsequent anti-radiotherapy message: narrative vs. rhetorical) \u00d7 2 (Time: post-message 1 (t1) vs. post-message 2 (t2)) mixed design. Findings revealed that the narrative pro-radiotherapy message not only fostered a favorable attitude and behavioral intention toward radiotherapy, but also produced a carryover impact on attitude and behavioral intention assessed after exposure to the subsequent anti-radiotherapy message. The carryover impact was generated via two distinct psychological pathways. Enhanced memory accessibility was critical to the cognitive route, whereas the heightened narrative engagement, self-referencing, and counterargument with the subsequent message explained the carryover impact through an experiential route. Moreover, the subsequent narrative anti-radiotherapy message elicited a greater change in attitude and behavioral intention than did the rhetorical message. This effect could be explained via the increased engagement with the subsequent message. Unexpectedly, the subsequent narrative message triggered a greater perception of persuasive intent than did the rhetorical message. Implications of the study findings for narrative persuasion research and strategic communication practice are discussed.

The first is that pore fluid induced damping during shear wave excitations is negligible.  The second is that saturated density can be used to calculate shear modulus based on measured shear wave velocity.  The validity of these assumptions depends on the magnitude of fluid motion relative to solids during shear wave excitations.  For soils with low permeability (e.g., silts and clays) and under low-frequency excitations (e.g., seismic waves), these assumptions are generally valid.  However, relative fluid motion may be important for soils with high permeability (e.g., sands and gravels) and under high-frequency excitations, rendering the above mentioned assumptions questionable.\n\tThis study presents an experimental investigation of the concept of effective density for propagation of small strain shear waves through saturated granular materials.  Bender element tests and resonant column tests were conducted on various granular materials in dry and saturated conditions.  Values of small-strain shear modulus measured for the dry condition are compared to corresponding values measured for the saturated condition using saturated density and effective density.  Analysis of test results indicates that effective density instead of saturated density should be used to calculate small-strain shear modulus.  For bender element tests, the use of saturated density produced errors in shear modulus as high as 28%; whereas the use of effective density resulted in errors generally less than 5%.  For resonant column tests, errors in shear modulus obtained using saturated density were smaller than those for bender element tests due to the lower range of excitation frequency.     \n\tThis study presents two analytical solutions for Biot flow induced damping in saturated soil specimens in resonant column tests based on the half-power bandwidth and free vibration decay methods.  These solutions are compared with a closed-form analytical solution readily available in literature.  The solutions indicate that Biot flow induced damping may provide an important contribution to total soil damping in coarse sand and gravel, but can be practically neglected for less permeable soils (e.g., fine sand, silt, and clay).  The solutions also indicate that Biot flow induced damping increases as porosity increases and decreases considerably as the ratio of the mass polar moment of inertia of the loading system to the specimen increases.  It is concluded that Biot flow induced damping is suppressed by the boundary condition of typical resonant column apparatuses and is hence difficult to be measured.  The solution from the free vibration decay method is compared to RC test results of various granular materials at dry and saturated conditions.  The comparison suggests that the validity of this analytical solution is inconclusive, which is largely due to the very small magnitude of Biot flow induced damping in RC tests.       \n\tIn addition, a theoretical investigation of energy dissipation in a nearly saturated poroviscoelastic soil column under quasi-static compressional excitations, which is applicable to slow phenomena (e.g., consolidation), is also presented in this study.  Different components of the energy dissipation are evaluated and compared.  This investigation indicates that the magnitude of pore fluid induced energy dissipation is primarily a function of a normalized excitation frequency  .  For small values of  , a drained soil column is fully relaxed and behaves essentially as a dry column with negligible pore pressure.  In this case, fluid induced energy dissipation is negligible and the total damping ratio of the column is essentially the same as that of the solid skeleton.  For very high values of  , a drained soil column is fully loaded and the excitation-generated pore pressure decreases as the fluid becomes more compressible.  In this case, the fluid pressure gradient only exists in a thin boundary layer near the drainage boundary, where drainage occurs and fluid induces energy dissipation; whereas the rest of the column is essentially undrained.  Significant fluid induced energy dissipation occurs for moderate values of   due to a combination of moderate fluid pressure, pressure gradient and fluid relative motion throughout the soil column. The effects of boundary drainage condition, saturation, porosity, and skeleton damping ratio on fluid induced energy dissipation are discussed.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9728], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Yanbo ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yanbo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tong Qiu", "Tong Qiu", "Chun Liu", "Farshad Rajabipour", "Mansour Solaimanian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tong Qiu, Dissertation Advisor", "Tong Qiu, Committee Chair", "Chun Liu, Committee Member", "Farshad Rajabipour, Committee Member", "Mansour Solaimanian, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Effective Density", "Pore Fluid Induced Damping", "Resonant Column Test", "Bender Elements Test", "Energy Dissipation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Nonlinear Pricing in Yellow Pages\n\n", "id": "11124", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6839", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "CHAPTER 1: Nonlinear Pricing in Yellow Pages (with Isabelle Perrigne and Quang Vuong)\n\nThis paper analyzes nonlinear pricing in yellow page advertising.

Controlled drug release systems of different sizes, shapes, structures, and functionalities have been widely investigated for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications. The most promising drug release systems are on-demand release systems in which drugs are released in response to environmental stimuli, traditionally through dramatic physical or chemical changes of the carrier material. In particular, self-regulated drug release systems, which respond to changes in the concentration of specific analytes, are especially intriguing as the systems can be applied to maintain homeostasis by counteracting pathological events as they occur. Though current techniques to engineer self-regulated systems show promise, they are not generalizable for complex pathological situations where numerous signals are present. \nHence, a dual aptamer-based hydrogel system that is potentially able to respond to any specific signal molecule was engineered. The dual aptamer system includes a drug-loading oligonucleotide strand and a signal molecule-binding strand.

Chapter 1 gives a brief review of recent studies on C60 films. Chapter 2 is divided into three subsections: the first part shows the method to prepare a clean surface, the second part introduces the basic principles of LEED and the symmetrized automated tensor LEED (SATLEED) which used for LEED I-V analysis and the third one briefly reviews the principles of STM and STS. Chapter 3 discusses the adsorption of potassium on Pb(100). Studies of the structures of the alkali metal adsorbed on metal surfaces are the foundation for further analysis of the chemical bond and electronic structure. The top and hollow adsorption sites were found to be very common for alkali metals\u2019 adsorption systems. LEED indicates that all submonolayer coverage was found to be the commensurate c(2\u00d72) structure, with potassium atoms located in substitutional sites in the top of the Pb substrate layer. Due to the low vacancy formation energy of Pb, the substitutional adsorption site is more favorable than all on-surface adsorption sites, when potassium is adsorbed on the Pb(100) surface.\nIn chapter 4, after a short review on some properties of C60 molecules, the surface structure of C60 on Pb(100) is discussed. C60 adsorption on several metal surfaces exhibits nearly close-packed hexagonal or quasi-hexagonal features, with a nearest-neighbor distance close to the natural spacing of C60 solid regardless of substrate symmetry. However, a unique commensurate structure is observed for C60 on Pb(100), in which C60 forms a c(4\u00d74) square lattice with a nearest-neighbor distance of 9.9 \u00c5. Based on our LEED calculations, the substitutional adsorption site, which involves a reconstruction to make C60 molecules sink deeper into the surface is more favorable than all on-surface adsorption sites.\nChapter 5 describes the structural and electronic properties of potassium-doped C60 monolayer obtained by LEED, STM and STS. With different potassium doping levels, we observed that structural features changed. On the low potassium-doped C60/Pb(100) surface, C60 molecules still adopt a square lattice structure. For intermediate potassium-doped C60/Pb(100), a hexagonal-like structure with an angle of 56\u25e6 was deduced from the LEED pattern. The reorientation and the shifting of the molecules are clearly seen in the STM images. These results suggest that potassium atoms diffuse into C60-induced vacancies, thus C60 molecules are effectively sitting on the K and not the vacancy, therefore they are not as strongly bound to the substrate, which is similar to the system of C60/Ag(111). Further, potassium-doped C60/Pb(100) seems to be a disruptive process. C60 molecules are no longer strongly bound to the substrate. Some of the C60 molecules are mobile to form a bilayer structure. By switching the order of doping, inhomogeneous structures across the surface were observed, including a square structure, a hexagonal-like structure, and a hexagonal structure with two orthogonal domains, when C60 was deposited on a lightly precovered potassium surface. This confirms that the underlying potassium atoms reduce the role played by the substrate. With different potassium doping levels, not only did the structural features change, but the electronic states of C60 molecules also varied. Based on our STS measurement, a C60 monolayer on Pb(100) does not create the optimal doping level corresponding to a C60\u22123 charge state which is required for superconductivity in bulk alkali-doped C60. By deliberately introducing potassium atoms into the surface, C60 molecules undergo metal-insulator-metal transition which corresponds to C60\u22123, C60\u22124 and C60\u22125 charge states, respectively. Although a C60\u22123 charge state was achieved by potassium doping, no additional feature appeared around the superconducting energy gap on the optimally doped C60 monolayer, which suggests that the formation of a Cooper pair was suppressed in a C60 monolayer.\nIn the end, conclusions and open problems are given in Chapter 6. Finally, the Appendix A is focused on the structural determination of the high temperature phase of the Al5Co2(001) surface while the Appendix B is aimed at the (2\u221a3\u00d72\u221a3) phase of Sn/Si(111) with the combination of LEED I-V analysis and STM study.

In order to achieve kinesin-driven microtubule transport in enclosed channels while allowing for observation with a standard fluorescent microscope, channels were fabricated in a transparent and motor compatible material with an architecture that enabled sample introduction and visualization.  Channels were designed to redirect microtubules without clogging or running out of the ATP fuel that powers these motors. Developing these devices involved several areas of microelectronics and MEMS technologies, including optimizing a reliable deep glass wet etching strategy and the development of a novel adhesive bonding process.  Microtubules were manipulated using AC electric fields generated by patterned electrodes and kinesin motors were micropatterned by DUV irradiation.   \n In this work we constructed a three-tier hierarchical system of microfluidic channels that links microscale bio-motor transport channels to macroscopic fluid connections. We demonstrated that a 60 \u00a3gm diameter circular ring functionalized with motors can concentrate and align bundles of thousands of uniformly oriented microtubules which continue to move for more than 90 minutes. This confinement is the first demonstration of channel confinement of moving microtubules for times needed for realistic biomotor applications. Furthermore, the AC electric field generated by microelectrodes in low ionic strength buffers was able to collect and align bundles of microtubules for sorting and in vitro assembly of mitotic-spindle-like structures. We found that AC fields result in electroosmotic flow, electrothermal flow, and dielectrophoresis of microtubules, which can be controlled by varying the solution conductivity, AC frequency, and electrode geometry and we were able to model key aspects of the field-drive movements.  \nA novel approach was also developed for directly patterning neutravidin protein by exposure to DUV irradiation. Neutravidin is physically absorbed onto a glass or quartz substrate, dehydrated in acetone and air-dried. Dry neutravidin-coated samples can be patterned either by top-side or back-side exposure, and the exposure time and UV wavelength were optimized to maximize pattern contrast and resolution. \nBiomotor-based transport alleviates the need for bulk fluid flow, which enables device miniaturization and the development of cheap and even disposable bioanalytical systems.

Main factors in the study included three dew removal strategies (untreated, rolled and mowed) prior to the application of fungicides (untreated, chlorothalonil, propiconazole and iprodione).  All treatments were applied to turfgrass previously treated with TE treatments (untreated and TE). Dollar spot infection centers (DSIC) and area under the disease progress curve data were analyzed using the PROC MIXED procedure in SAS.  The presence or absence of dew at the time of fungicide application had no influence fungicide efficacy.  The effect of regulation by TE on fungicide-treated turf had little influence on dollar spot severity.  However, the effect of regulation on non-fungicide treated turf resulted in a significant reduction in DSIC. Based on the results of this study, dew removal prior to the application of fungicides in the morning is an unnecessary step and does not influence fungicide efficacy. Although TE had little influence on disease severity where fungicides were applied, its use in areas where fungicide applications are restricted or too cost prohibitive may provide a small, but beneficial reduction in dollar spot.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8119], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yu", "degree_name_ssi": "M AGR", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Agriculture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Edward Kaminski Iii", "Peter Landschoot", "Wakar Uddin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Edward Kaminski Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Peter Landschoot, Thesis Advisor", "Wakar Uddin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["turfgrass", "dollar spot", "dew removal", "trinexapac-ethyl"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Private Kindergarten Scorecard \n", "id": "7643", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6838", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this study is to develop an effective self-evaluation system for use in Taiwan\u2019s kindergartens that will enable administrators and teachers to enhance school performance and ensure continuous improvement. It also examines kindergarten insiders\u2019 and outsiders\u2019 perceptions toward self-evaluation and performance management.\nIn order to achieve the research purpose and develop a self-evaluation system, this study applies the Balanced Scorecard concept as theoretical foundation, reviews relevant literature and consults with early childhood experts in Taiwan and the United States. A questionnaire, the Private Kindergarten Scorecard, is developed especially for this study. This study is quantitative in nature and applies survey as measurement. Subjects included 189 kindergarten outsiders and 122 kindergarten insiders. Descriptive statistics, panel review, exploratory factor analysis, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), MANOVA, and pair-t test are the methods used to analyze the data. \nExploratory factor analyses suggest that the Balanced Scorecard theory provides a solid basis and four dimensions exist for designing a self-evaluation instrument. The AHP analysis indicates that kindergarten insiders believe these four dimensions are vital for managing a kindergarten. However, kindergarten outsiders focus on the stakeholders\u2019 and innovation perspectives. The MANOVA analysis shows that the operation perspective is the only perceptual difference between kindergarten insiders and outsiders in the self-evaluation result. The additional finding of the MANOVA analysis is that kindergarten insiders and outsiders have great perceptual differences for the importance of measure of operation, daily support to children, and evaluation perspectives. The paired t-tests imply that kindergarten insiders and outsiders are dissatisfied with the actual performance of kindergartens. Recommendations and future research are also presented.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6835], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Yu-Chuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yu-Chuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Daniel Yawkey", "Jamie Myers", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "William Hartman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Daniel Yawkey, Committee Chair", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "William Hartman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["performance management", "self-evaluation"]}]
