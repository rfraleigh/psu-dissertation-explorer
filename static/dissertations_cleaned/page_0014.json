Combining broadband Kerr-gated emission spectroscopy and time-correlated single photon counting techniques enables determination of fluorescence lifetimes over femtosecond to nanosecond times. Using conventional solvents with well-known physical properties (viscosity, dielectric constant, solvation time, etc.) allows one to discern what types of solvent effects influence the solute's dynamics. When these experiments are complemented by quantum chemical calculations, a better understanding of reaction mechanisms and solvent dependencies can be gained. Three studies have are described in this dissertation to provide new information and insights. The first study involves three naphthalene malononitrile derivatives which belong to the family of molecular rotors. Previous studies of other malononitriles remained inconclusive with respect to the fluorescence deactivating mechanism. By tuning the rotational barrier and inhibiting rotating degrees of freedom through structural design and by measuring in a series of eleven representative solvents new experimental and computational information supporting a deactivation mechanism consisting of an excited-state double bond isomerization contrary to the more accepted concept of a single bond rotation were provided.\nThe second study looks at Thioflavin T, a popular fluorescence sensor for fibrillization kinetics. In solution Thioflavin T has a viscosity dependent quantum yield. A recent publication indicates a fast auto-degradation which produces a fluorescent impurity which could have led to wrong conclusions about the photophysics. After intensive purification Thioflavin T has been measured here in 18 representative solvents and quantum mechanical calculations have been performed on the rotation dynamics. We find viscosity alone as insufficient to describe the fluorescence quenching but determined a solvation time dependence as well as a difference between protic (alcohols) and aprotic solvents.\nThe third study is the ultrafast excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) reaction of the 3-hydroxyavone derivative DEAHF was studied. Recent literature suggested a proton-tunneling in the Frank-Condon state leading to prompt tautomer formation. However, solvent relaxation induces a reaction barrier which also results in a slow component to the tautomerization process. A binary mixture of acetonitrile and propylene carbonate provides a solvent system having constant polarity but solvation times which vary by a factor of ten between acetonitrile to propylene carbonate. Spectroscopic analysis confirms that the excited-state equilibrium does not change within this mixture series. Time-resolved measurements showed no evidence of a non-zero concentration of the tautomer form at time zero. However, our data clearly shows a slowing in the tautomer formation at early times with decreasing solvation time, suggesting a reaction barrier build-up upon solvation dynamics.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10121], "author_name_tesi": "Breffke, Jens ", "last_name_ssi": "Breffke", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jens", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Maroncelli", "Mark Maroncelli", "John B Asbury", "James Bernhard Anderson", "John H Golbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Maroncelli, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Chair", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluorescence", "solvent effect", "ultrafast spectroscopy", "malononitriles", "Thioflavin T", "4-diethylamino-3-hydroxyflavone"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Recess: Follow the Bounding Ball\n", "id": "12595", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2767", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The opportunity for children to experience free-play (i.e. recess) with parallel opportunities to interact and relate with their peers has been diminished or eliminated in many school systems across the United States. The movement to minimize recess in schools is popular among politicians and school superintendents; they see it as a way to get tough on education, provide more academic time for students, and improve academic performance to meet Annual Yearly Progress (AYP) criteria. Although many educators and parents recognize the importance of maximizing the efficient use of relatively scarce classroom time, they also see the necessity for breaks between periods of intense work where children can both relax and interact with their peers. The hope is students will return to their classrooms with renewed interest. \n\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" is a well known proverb. In school, students work hard, their heads bent over their books, and most look forward to recess. As popularly conceived, recess is a time for students to release pent up energy built up after hours of sitting quietly, learning the lessons of the day, Anthony Pelligrini calls this the \u201csurplus energy\u201d theory. For students, recess provides a welcome reprieve from studies. One can easily observe children sitting anxiously awaiting the time when they can run out the door and get on the best kickball team, play tag, climb on playground equipment, or simply exchange the latest news. The playground swells with students having conversations, racing around, or just laughing and playing independently. Despite such happy images, however, the perception exists and, for some, the reality exists that recess is becoming an endangered practice in many American schools. \nAn oft-cited cause of the decline of recess is the pressures upon schools to meet the demands of the federal law\u2026\u2026 \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d legislation and their need to \u201csqueeze in every minute for lessons that could help raise scores on standardized tests\u201d (Gammill, 2007, p.4). Other cited reasons involve the deterioration of some school playgrounds or issues of safety and liability. But some suggest that cutting back recess or eliminating it altogether is comparable to the elimination of work breaks or the shortening of lunchtime in an adult working environment in order to increase productivity standards (Starr, 2007). The cutting back of such individual free time in schools or corporations would seem to prompt concerns for the general well-being of individuals denied adequate breaks as well as for its impact on overall morale and productivity. Corporations such as \u201cGoogle\u201d was named in U.S. World and News Report as being one of if not the best environment in the world to work \u2013 because the employees play all day while at work.\nNevertheless, a dual discourse now surrounds the concept of school recess. On one hand, recess is understood as a traditional part of the elementary school day; a time when students can go outside, get away from classroom regimentation, and engage in self-directed physical or social activity with their peers. Under this line of argument, recess serves multiple purposes; many of which are subtle and difficult to objectively measure. On the other hand, recess is viewed by some as anachronistic, an unnecessary throwback to an earlier time when school academic achievement was less critical to students\u2019 future lives. For others in this same camp, recess may be viewed as impractical in an era when schools must aim more resources toward academic matters and fewer toward providing a safe outdoor environment. \nAlthough the value of recess in terms of objective student outcomes has been examined in various studies, a prevailing consensus is yet to be reached. At the same time, it seems reasonable to suggest that the value of recess lies not simply in measurable student outcomes, but also in the beliefs of administrators and teachers that the practice represents an important part of what makes a \u201cgood,\u201d \u201chealthy,\u201d or \u201cethical\u201d.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2764], "author_name_tesi": "Brelsford, Jeannette L.", "last_name_ssi": "Brelsford", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Jeannette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger C Shouse", "Roger C Shouse", "Dr Preston Green", "Dana Lynn Mitra", "James F Nolan Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger C Shouse, Dissertation Advisor", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Chair", "Dr Preston Green, Committee Member", "Dana Lynn Mitra, Committee Member", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vitamin D Deficiency", "Wellness Policy 246", "Positive Behavior Support", "Cognitive", "Ethic", "Socialization", "Case Study", "Phenomenology", "Physical Activity", "Play", "Recess", "Childhood Obesity", "History", "PSSA"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Effects of Rust Deposition at the Axial Seal Pin Between Two Blades\n\n\n", "id": "12142", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1463", "abstract_tesi": "Rust deposits in the gap associated with the axial seal pin between two turbine blades can inhibit the vibration dampening of the pin, which can ultimately result in premature failure of components.

Rotation compacts rust particles significantly, doubling their bulk density when spun at engine representative forces.  Static and rotating test facilities were developed to flow compressed air and particles through full-scale engine hardware and test coupons representative of the axial seal pin geometry.  Rust was injected at ambient temperatures and engine-realistic pressure ratios.  Reductions in flow were measured to be as high as 74%.  In static tests, increasing the pressure ratio increased flow blockage for a given rust amount, whereas in rotating tests, flow blockage was independent of pressure ratio.  The amount of blockage was highly sensitive to the geometry of associated area near the axial seal pin particularly under rotating conditions.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1449], "author_name_tesi": "Breneman, Duane L", "last_name_ssi": "Breneman", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Duane", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole, Thesis Advisor", "Karen Ann Thole, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["seal pin", "leakage flow", "secondary flow", "rust particle deposition", "gas turbine", "rotating orifice"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Delayed Neutrons and Detector Dead-time in Feynman Distribution Analysis", "id": "bz60cw24r", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12736", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I have explored the effect of delayed neutrons on neutron chains in a sub-critical nuclear system. Every fission has an approximately 0.7% chance of creating a delayed neutron that will go on to cause another fission. My hypothesis was that in systems with a very high sub-critical multiplication, there will be enough delayed neutrons created that they will in effect become a stronger starting neutron source than the original source.  I used a point Monte-Carlo style simulation of sub-critical neutron chains to explore the physics of neutron chains. The simulation was designed to keep the same assumptions behind the Hage-Cifarelli derivation and Prasad-Snyderman formulation, to preserve the statistical variations in the list-mode data found in a physical experiment, and to be as simple as possible while maintaining accuracy. I present this method and benchmark it against both measured data and a theoretical model. I also use the model to simulate a Feynman Beta curve and 1/M approach-to-criticality experiments. I modified the simulation to take into account delayed neutrons and found that delayed neutrons have no measurable effect on a sub-critical systems for subcritical multiplication (M) less then 200. I wrote an algorithm to take into account detector dead-time with multiple detectors and found that increasing the number of detectors is the only effective method of compensating for dead-time effects. I investigated the minimum number of events needed for the analysis methods to produce accurate results and found that, for low values of M, there are statistical variations of the calculated multiplicity that will produce inaccurate results. For high values of M, the statistical variation is low, but an insufficient number of events will produce M-values that are inaccurately low.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12402], "author_name_tesi": "Brener, Mathieu W", "last_name_ssi": "Brener", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Mathieu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Lee Catchen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Lee Catchen, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["delayed neutrons", "Feynman analysis", "detector dead time", "neutron analysis", "neutron coincidence counting", "neutron chains", "neutron multiplicity", "monte carlo simulation", "hansen-dowdy", "feynman distribution"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Fundamental studies of the interaction between energetic C60 ion beams with inorganic and organic solid surfaces\n", "id": "13896", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7027", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " The nature of the interaction between energetic C60 cluster ion beams with inorganic and organic solid surfaces is presented in this thesis.  Details of the interaction were deciphered experimentally and with complementary molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations.  Agreement between the experimental results and those calculated on similar systems offers a new avenue to greatly improve the understanding of the C60 cluster ion/solid surface interaction.\n \n The C60 cluster ion/solid surface interaction is investigated experimentally by bombarding solid surfaces in ultra-high vacuum conditions with energetic C60 primary ions and coupling photoionization spectroscopy with surface sensitive methods based on time-of-flight mass spectrometry.  Atomistic and coarse-grained MD computer simulations with similar experimental conditions are employed to provide a detailed view of the interaction that is not obtainable with the experiments.\n \n The results presented in this thesis demonstrate that the C60 cluster ion/solid surface interaction stimulates a sputtering process for atoms, molecules, and fragments that is unique and distinguishable from other energetic ion beams.  Atoms sputtered from polycrystalline and single crystal surfaces, are dependent on experimental conditions like the C60 impact energy and angle, and the surface topography.  Each are demonstrated to influence either the sputtered atom\u2019s kinetic energy, take-off angle from the surface, or the sputtering yield.  Intact molecules sputtered from organic solid surfaces will desorb via a fluid-flow and effusive-type emission process which is accompanied by molecular fragmentation.  The molecular fragmentation can induce exothermic reactions or excitation to gently heat and desorb loosely bound fragments, but can be quenched at liquid nitrogen temperatures.  All of these findings illustrate the unique properties associated with the interaction of C60 ion beams with solid surfaces.  By knowing how to efficiently use these properties, the combination of C60 ion beams with secondary neutral and secondary ion mass spectrometry can be optimized as a surface analytical tool for the analysis of complex systems like biological cells.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7023], "author_name_tesi": "Brenes, Daniel A", "last_name_ssi": "Brenes", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nicholas Winograd", "Carlo G Pantano", "Miriam Arak Freedman", "Barbara Jane Garrison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nicholas Winograd, Dissertation Advisor", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member", "Miriam Arak Freedman, Committee Member", "Barbara Jane Garrison, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Time-of-flight secondary neutral mass spectrometry", "sputtering", "c60 ion beams", "angular distribution", "kinetic energy distribution"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "BLOGGING BETTY(S): HOW BLOGGERS USED THE ANNIVERSARY\nOF THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE TO DISCUSS FEMINISM", "id": "24971", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11100", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This paper examines how and why bloggers use blogs as a forum to discuss, debate, circulate, and promote feminism through examination of blog coverage on The Feminine Mystique\u2019s 50th anniversary in 2013.

As the Common Core Standards were adopted by many states, they pressed for shifts from previous practices and resulted in an increased need for leadership during significant instructional changes. This case study sought to understand the role of an elementary principal as an instructional leader during the adoption of a new literacy program intended to meet the new standards. The perception of the role as observed by the teachers and the principal of the school were considered in relationship to how the principal promoted high literacy expectations, teacher-to-teacher interactions, and supported the teachers in their classroom instruction. The findings underscore the need for leadership during instructional change to be differentiated, communicate a clear mission, relay the big picture, and to find a balance between managerial and instructional leadership tasks; all of which satisfies the specific context of the school.

This technique can be used for remote inspection or monitoring of buried pipelines, or pipelines with insulation.  Guided waves are sensitive to flaws such as corrosion pits and cracks.  They can be used to locate flaws existing on either the outer or the inner surface of a pipe.  Guided wave energy focusing can be performed to concentrate guided wave energy at particular combinations of circumferential and axial locations in straight pipes.  When it can be used, this practice enhances the circumferential resolution of defects.\nElbows in a piping system are sufficiently disruptive to guided wave energy that the focusing methods used in practical inspections of straight pipe have not been extended to the region beyond an elbow.  Counter-intuitively, elbows with a 45 degree bend are more harmful to guided waves than those with a 90 degree bend.  A simple and elegant explanation for this phenomenon is provided in this dissertation.  \nTheoretical advancements to guided wave physics propagating around an elbow have tended to be few and slow.  This is at least partly due to the complexity of the mathematics involved in the conventional description of guided wave mechanics.  Parametric focusing for pipes with bends has not been previously possible as it is for straight sections of pipes.  While some techniques such as time-reversal mirrors and blind finite-element-method modeling have existed for focusing beyond elbows, these techniques have been limited and largely of academic value.  Also, the understanding of wave behavior in a pipe elbow has in the past been generally unclear.  Consequently, signal interpretation has also been very limited for guided waves initiating in, or returning from, the far side of an elbow.  \nA new approach to understanding guided wave propagation is developed in this work.  This understanding consists of the idea that the pathway a guided wave will take across a waveguide can be predicted from the geometric features of the waveguide and a set of initial conditions pertaining to the wave.  One such feature is the geometric cross-section in which the wave is propagating.  This cross-section refers to a plane that contains both the propagation direction of the wave and the coinciding surface normal of one of the boundaries guiding the wave.\nThinking of guided waves from this perspective enables a clear answer to some important questions about wave propagation beyond an elbow that have not been effectively answered before.  For example, before this work, it was not understood if and when full guided wave coverage exists in a pipe beyond an elbow.  This new thinking also enables the calculation of the elbow transfer function--the mapping of guided wave energy impinging on an elbow to the configuration it will have on the other side of the elbow.  Each of these examples separately represents significant practical advancements in the guided wave community.\nThe new approach also introduces a forward focusing model for controlling and focusing guided wave energy in pipe sections in and beyond an elbow.  It is believed that this is the first such forward-oriented apparatus for controlling guided wave energy beyond an elbow.  It is expected that this will be of great practical consequence.  In addition to these specific benefits, it is anticipated that this dissertation will serve as a foundation for a good deal of future work and contributions to guided wave understanding and non-destructive testing equipment.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11726], "author_name_tesi": "Breon, Luke Justin", "last_name_ssi": "Breon", "middle_name_ssi": "Justin", "first_name_ssi": "Luke", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith Todd Copley", "Judith Todd Copley", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Joseph Paul Cusumano", "Kyusun Choi", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith Todd Copley, Dissertation Advisor", "Judith Todd Copley, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member", "Kyusun Choi, Committee Member", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Guided Wave", "Pipe", "Elbow", "Focusing", "Complex Waveguides", "Mode Tracing"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "3D Reconstruction of 2D Endobronchial Ultrasound", "id": "10736", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4325", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Multidimensional Image Processing Lab (MIPL) at The Pennsylvania State University has been developing methods to help stage and diagnose lung cancer for over 15 years now.

This interest is accelerating as large area single crystal substrates become commercially available.\nThe diamond M-i-P (Metal \u2013 intrinsic diamond \u2013 P++ diamond) Schottky barrier diode takes advantage of intrinsic diamond\u2019s extremely high hole mobility (3800cm2/Vs) that permits very high forward current densities (up to 100A/cm2 at 5V). However, the performance of this structure depends on the crystalline quality and purity of the intrinsic region. Defect and impurity centers act as traps, capturing charge carriers passing through the intrinsic region. This leads to power loss and degraded device efficiency. Therefore, a growth process is required that produces a thick, high quality, high purity intrinsic diamond layer.\nThis thesis studies the effect of microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) reactor design, process conditions, and pre-growth surface treatments on the quality, surface morphology, and growth rate of single crystal intrinsic diamond. A vertical bell-jar MPCVD reactor was purchased for homoepitaxial diamond growth. Several geometry modifications were explored to take full advantage of the growth kinetics of MPCVD diamond. By altering the reactor geometry, the plasma could be manipulated to provide a high plasma density, sufficient contact to the substrate, decreased plasma etching of the quartz chamber walls, and increased dissociation of gas species (as observed with optical emission spectroscopy). As part of the reactor study, the susceptor was adapted to enhance cooling of the substrate, allowing for high microwave input powers at low substrate temperatures. In this regime, growth rates approaching 20&#956;m/hr were achieved in a high purity hydrogen-methane plasma. These films were verified with Raman spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to be of high crystalline quality and purity.\nThe effects of pre-growth surface etching and substrate misorientation on the surface morphology were also studied. Dislocations and surface defects can lead to macroscopic growth features (such as growth hillocks) that degrade device performance, encourage non-uniform p-type doping, and induce strain, defects, and impurities. Here, pre-growth reactive ion etching (RIE) is shown to remove surface damage and improve substrate surface roughness (Ra) from 0.795nm to 0.478nm. Substrate misorientation is shown to supply a high density of favorable nucleation sites in the form of crystallographic step edges. Both techniques are shown to suppress hillock formation and improve overall film quality.\nAn initial study of nanocrystalline diamond growth is also reported. Grain size of polycrystalline diamond films was controlled in an attempt to deposit nanocrystalline diamond. This thesis studies the effects of argon concentration on the growth rate, grain size, and crystalline phase (as observed with Raman spectroscopy) of diamond films approaching nanocrystalline material. It was shown that argon concentrations from 90- 95% can yield diamond films with grain sizes below 1 &#956;m and growth rates around 1&#956;m/hr in the current reactor configuration.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4319], "author_name_tesi": "Bresnehan, Michael Stephen", "last_name_ssi": "Bresnehan", "middle_name_ssi": "Stephen", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Joan Marie Redwing", "David W Snyder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Thesis Advisor", "Joan Marie Redwing, Thesis Advisor", "David W Snyder, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["MPCVD", "Diamond", "Surface Morphology", "Growth Kinetics", "M-i-P Diode", "CVD Diamond"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Synthesis and Characterization of Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Integration with Graphene Electronics", "id": "19826", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9236", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has attracted increased interest as a dielectric material to graphene electronics. Traditional dielectrics, such as SiO2 or various high-k materials, can introduce scattering from charged surface states, impurities, surface optical phonons, and substrate roughness; significantly degrading the transport properties of graphene. Hexagonal boron nitride boasts several key advantages over SiO2 and high-k dielectrics. Most notably, it exhibits an atomically smooth surface that is expected to be free of dangling bonds, leading to an interface that is relatively free of surface charge traps and adsorbed impurities. Additionally, h-BN\u2019s high energy surface optical phonon modes lead to reduced phonon scattering from the dielectric. Using h-BN (grown via CVD on copper foil) as a gate dielectric to quasi-freestanding epitaxial graphene (QFEG) devices, a >2.5x increase in intrinsic current gain cut-off frequency and a >3x increase in mobility over HfO2 gated devices is obtained.\nIn addition, this thesis presents the transfer-free deposition of boron nitride on sapphire and silicon for use as a supporting substrate to CVD-grown graphene. This is accomplished via a polymer-to-ceramic conversion process involving the deposition of polyborazylene at low temperature (\u2264400\u00b0C) and subsequent annealing at 1000\u00b0C to BN. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirms the deposition of an ultra smooth (RMS roughness <130pm) h-BN film without the need for a solution-based transfer process. However, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the stoichiometry is dependent on the initial polyborazylene deposition temperature. Despite a turbostratic structure and a boron-rich stoichiometry, CVD graphene transferred to boron nitride films deposited on Al2O3 at a polyborazylene deposition temperature of 400\u00b0C is nearly strain-free and results in an improvement in mobility of >1.5x and >2.5x compared to CVD graphene transferred to bare Al2O3 and SiO2, respectively, due to a low impurity density and reduced surface optical phonon scattering.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9049], "author_name_tesi": "Bresnehan, Michael Stephen", "last_name_ssi": "Bresnehan", "middle_name_ssi": "Stephen", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Robinson", "Joshua Alexander Robinson", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Robinson, Dissertation Advisor", "Joshua Alexander Robinson, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Graphene", "Epitaxial Graphene", "Boron Nitride", "h-BN", "Dielectric", "Field Effect Transistor", "CVD", "High Mobility"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "ASSESSING GENE, ENVIRONMENT, AND GENE \u00d7\nENVIRONMENT EFFECTS ON ANXIETY-RELATED AND\nLEARNING BEHAVIORS IN MOUSE MODELS\n", "id": "12243", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "146", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The pathological mechanisms underlying human psychiatric disorders, including\nanxiety and mood disorders, are far from understood.

A detrital cooling-age sample collected from a riverbed represents an integration of information from the upstream area. Within orogenic belts that contain glacial cover and high relief, detrital minerals provide an easy method to sample the range of cooling ages found within a basin. In addition, detrital-mineral thermochronology can be used to extract information from the foreland stratigraphic record, which extends the temporal applicability of the technique beyond traditional bedrock thermochronology. For example, individual mineral grains can be extracted from a stratigraphic horizon and dated. Following correction for the stratigraphic age of the horizon, the detrital mineral ages provide a proxy for the erosion rates contained within the catchment area at the time the rock was deposited. However, before reliable interpretations of the stratigraphic record are made, a modern calibration of the technique was needed.\nWe investigated the spatial development of a modern cooling-age signal in the Marsyandi valley of central Nepal with muscovite grains dated using 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology.  Over 500 individual grains were dated from both the trunk stream and tributaries over a ~100-km transect along the Marsyandi. These provide a database that displays striking contrasts along the length of the Marsyandi River. The first stage of the investigation focused on the interaction of geological parameters that control the distribution of detrital cooling ages from an individual basin. The range of bedrock cooling ages contained within a catchment is determined by the erosion rate and the depth of the closure isotherm (~350\u00b0C for muscovite). With a 2-D thermal model, we investigated the effects of the vertical erosion rate and topography on the depth of the closure isotherm. Increasing the erosion rate and/or topographic relief decreased the depth of the closure isotherms below valley floors, and re-equilibration following sustained changes in the erosion rate took ~10 My. Once the range in cooling ages had been determined for a basin, the distribution of detrital cooling ages in sediment at the basin mouth was calculated as a function of catchment hypsometry. This approach was applied to two sub-catchments of the Marsyandi River. The predicted probability distribution of cooling-ages matched the observed data better in the more slowly eroding basin, than in the more rapidly eroding basin. \nTo understand the more complex distribution of cooling ages from the mouth of the Marsyandi River, the basin was divided into smaller sub-basins that were modeled individually. To predict the trunk-stream signal, individual tributaries were mixed as a function of their area, erosion rate, and the percentage of muscovite in their sediment, which was determined from point counting. Comparison of the model results with observed data illustrated that the detrital-cooling age signal evolved downstream in an understandable manner, and suggested that the mechanical comminution of muscovite was not significant over the length-scale of the basin. The pattern of spatial erosion seen in the thermochronology \u2013 low erosion rates in the Tibetan zone, high erosion rates in the Greater Himalaya zone, and intermediate erosion rates in the Lesser Himalayan zone \u2013 was broadly similar to calculations of erosion rate based upon the point-counting results. Sample pairs were dated to assess the temporal and spatial variability of the cooling-age signal within the fluvial system. Results indicated that the samples were undistinguishable at the 95% confidence level, once the effects of random selection and the number of grains dated had been accounted for. \nA more integrated approach was used to predict the spatial distribution of bedrock cooling ages within the 3-D landscape, and the distribution of detrital cooling ages resulting from the erosion of that landscape. A 2-D kinematic-and-thermal model, using the assumption of a single orogen-scale decollement, was developed to predict the depth of the closure isotherm as a function of the ramp geometry and the relative partitioning of convergence between the Indian Plate underthrusting and southern Tibet overthrusting.  The thermal result was extrapolated laterally and combined with a digital elevation model to predict the distribution of bedrock cooling ages. At any site in the landscape, the cooling age is a function of the distance each rock particle travels after passing through the closure isotherm and its speed along the trajectory predefined by the underlying decollement geometry. Once the contribution of each site had been corrected for lithological factors and the volume of sediment eroded, a theoretical cooling-age probability distribution was calculated for the Marsyandi by the summation of age-probability for all sites within in the basin. The volume of sediment was calculated as a function of the regional slope and the angle of the underlying ramp. Comparison of various model runs with the observed data indicates that the best solution is obtained by partitioning the total of ~20 mm/yr of convergence between India and southern Tibet into 15 km/my of India underthrusting, and 5 km/yr of Asian overthrusting and subsequent erosion. However, the exact partitioning is dependent upon the geometry of the decollement. A variant of the model that assumed the modern Main Central Thrust represented the approximate surface trace of the orogen-scale decollement produced better results than those runs that assumed the Main Boundary Thrust represented the surface trace of the orogen-scale decollement. This provides additional evidence that the MCT has been active recently. The new methodology of integrating complex kinematic-and-thermal models with digital elevation models can be applied to any orogenic belt, and it may be used to compare theoretical predictions against easily collected and analyzed detrital-mineral data.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2414], "author_name_tesi": "Brewer, Ian D", "last_name_ssi": "Brewer", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Ian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas W.

To design such interfaces and improve experts' access to GIS, it is important to understand how geospatial information is used in emergency management and crisis decision making.  The immediate motivation for this research is to support a larger research effort to make GIS easier to use in emergency management and command and control situations. During emergencies, the standard operational delivery of geospatial information is channeled through GIS specialists, working individually, who provide emergency response managers maps and analyses for damage assessment assistance requests.  Efforts have been made to improve the timely delivery of information during emergencies through widespread efforts to deploy geospatial information technologies in emergency management divisions across the country in support of emergency planning, decision-making, management, and response.  Still, our understanding of the breadth and depth of geospatial information technologies in emergency and crisis response centers is limited.  Recent advances in vision tracking, speech recognition, and interface design have opened the door on the design of multimodal interfaces to GIS.  To develop a deep understanding of work with geospatial information, I implemented a three stage, problem-centered study based on theoretical foundations in Cognitive Systems Engineering, Naturalistic Decision Making, and Knowledge Elicitation.   The knowledge obtained about current practices was used to create models and envisioned designs of advanced, next-generation geospatial information technologies.  In order to provide design assistance, this work focuses on gaining an in-depth understanding of the use of geospatial information during emergency response activities, with specific focus on hurricanes.  Improved understanding was achieved by the production of models of crisis decision-making and scenarios of the use of geospatial information during emergencies.  A key component of communicating the information was through the creation of real world emergency response scenarios that serve as envisioned designs for more natural interfaces to GIS, new geospatial information technologies, and as representations of work in Emergency Operations Centers.

For the period of 1970 to 2000, the annual per capita income growth rates for the counties of the United State range from -1% to over 8%, representing enormous changes in regional wealth.   To help understand why these regional rates are so different, the first essay of this dissertation considers the impact of urban characteristics on convergence in incomes.  Convergence is a theoretical assertion of the neoclassical growth model.  Based on diminishing returns from capital, the neoclassical model suggests that the rate of growth should be more rapid over time when a given economy starts with less capital, and less income.  Using a spatially dependent model of growth as a function of starting income, education and rural dummy variables, Essay 1 of this dissertation finds evidence of convergence in rural and small urban counties, but they are converging at different rates.  There is no evidence that the large cities of America are converging.  This could be due to urban agglomeration economies, where clusters of industries face lower costs due to economies of scale in service provision and from knowledge spillovers.  \n\nEssay 2 considers the role of local amenities, migration and human capital, or education, in the differing growth rates for urban and rural counties suggested by Essay 1.  This essay uses a four equation structural model with assumed spatial dependence and simultaneity.  With adjustments for changing human capital, populations, and amenities, conditional convergence is supported in all of the counties of the U.S., although significant differences between urban and rural cohorts remain.  Migration tends to speed up income and human capital growth.  Convergence is also supported for human capital.  The least educated regions are more likely to see rapid improvement in their human capital.\n\nEssay 3 looks at the growth of one industry, primary pork production, at the U.S. county level.  The forces of agglomeration, amenities and local population characteristics developed in the first two essays are incorporated into predictive models of local hog densities and the recent growth in these hog densities.  Theoretically important input price and availability variables, especially related to feed and land, are supported in the predictive model of the local density of hogs.  Contrary to predictions, agglomerations in this industry are not supportive to future growth.  Possibly due to congestion over the limited resource of cultivated land for manure disposal, counties with high beginning densities saw less growth than those with low starting densities. Recent increases in regulatory stringency have also had a negative impact on hog density increases.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1383], "author_name_tesi": "Brewin, Derek Gerald", "last_name_ssi": "Brewin", "middle_name_ssi": "Gerald", "first_name_ssi": "Derek", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Gerard Abler", "Martin L Shields", "Stephan J Goetz", "Kenneth Kephart", "Stephen Michael Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Gerard Abler, Committee Chair", "Martin L Shields, Committee Chair", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Member", "Kenneth Kephart, Committee Member", "Stephen Michael Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Regional Economics", "Rurality", "Convergence", "Migration"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "My Country, 'tis of Thee: Examining the Relationship Between Immigrant Students' Political Socialization and Their Feelings of Belonging in the United States and Canada", "id": "27224", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11955", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While political scientists have long described the choice to engage politically as a rational decision, we consistently see evidence of individuals participating because they value the community they live in, and the identity they gain by belonging to a community. The political socialization literature, which studies the knowledge, attitudes, habits and dispositions that motivate young people to become politically active, continues these individualistic assumptions by focusing on individual students\u2019 thinking rather than the school and community context where students live, learn and interact. By excluding students\u2019 feelings of belonging to the school and symbolically the broader community, political socialization scholars miss a crucial element of students\u2019 political socialization. This failure is particularly problematic for immigrant students whose first experiences of in/exclusion in their new countries\u2019 governments come from the schools that they attend. \nI use an exploratory, comparative, embedded case study of two school districts: one in Pennsylvania and the other in Manitoba, Canada to examine the unexplored relationship between immigrant youths' political socialization process and their feelings of belonging to their school community. Using document analysis, observations, interviews, surveys and reflective writing, the study contextualizes a previously largely undifferentiated model of political socialization. Students described feelings of belonging which largely aligned with the literature on belonging. These feelings included feeling comfortable, accepted, known, trusted and cared for. Many students relied on a thin sense of belonging to maintain a feeling of connection even when the students\u2019 experiences with school and community did not warrant feelings of belonging. This thin sense of belonging allowed them to justify and claim their right to be somewhere even when the people and policies of that place did not warrant a feeling of belonging. In school, the study shows that teachers\u2019 responses to the students shaped the students\u2019 experiences of schooling. Such that when students forged caring, responsive relationships with teachers, students\u2019 feelings of belonging to the school existed even as those same students recognized the myriad of problems in their school such as bullying or the academic failures of many of their peers. School-level policies also influenced students\u2019 feelings about their relationship with adults and others in the schools. These policies communicated school officials\u2019 assumptions to the students and this helped or hindered students\u2019 feelings of belonging to the school. Lastly, the findings highlight the varying understanding of citizenship that students\u2019 hold. One group of students tended to define citizenship in legal terms of the rights and responsibilities entailed in citizenship. The other group of students focused on the relational aspects of citizenship. However, while the students differed in their various emphases on the priority of citizenship, they shared a similar understanding of what the characteristics of good citizenship entailed. The relationship between belonging and citizenship became the most clear when students discussed the characteristics of a good citizen and those that they considered citizen role models. These good citizens shared the characteristics with people who helped creates places of belonging for the students. We see that the students\u2019 role models exemplify individuals who both help students feel a sense of belonging to their schools and communities as well as model good citizenship for the students. The findings show that immigrant students\u2019 feelings of belonging relate to how they conceptualize the concept of citizenship and whom they find to be good citizens.  This dissertation will add an important but absent element to the political socialization model, the role of belonging to the school community. Lastly, it challenges the rationalistic assumptions undergirding much of political socialization research. Given the burgeoning population of immigrant children, the study explores fundamentally important relationships between schools, immigrant children\u2019s feelings of belonging and their political socialization. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11397], "author_name_tesi": "Brezicha, Kristina Franciska", "last_name_ssi": "Brezicha", "middle_name_ssi": "Franciska", "first_name_ssi": "Kristina", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dana Lynn Mitra", "Gerald K Letendre", "Erica Frankenberg", "Stephanie Cayot Serriere"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dana Lynn Mitra, Dissertation Advisor", "Gerald K Letendre, Committee Member", "Erica Frankenberg, Committee Member", "Stephanie Cayot Serriere, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Political socialization", "Belonging", "Immigrant Students", "Citizenship", "Education Policy"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Hermeneutics of the Lake: Lancelot's Masculinities and Hybridities in 12th- and 13th-Century Arthurian Romance", "id": "11656cub162", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11656", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation reclaims Lancelot\u2019s atypical gender constructions and performances as a crucial site of analysis.

I argue that the \u201clake\u201d, and/or the fairy figures that preside over Lancelot\u2019s childhood and early progress, generate both an abnormal and supernormal adult left to navigate a feudal world governed by patriarchal and hypermasculine norms and values. My dissertation\u2019s three chapters analyze the effects of Lancelot\u2019s unusual background on his interactions among men and women and the standardized laws that rule them (notably feudal sovereignty and marriage). Troubled by identity loss and misrecognition, Lancelot\u2019s gender escapes the firm categorizations of \u201cmasculine,\u201d \u201cchivalric,\u201d or \u201ccourtly\u201d but discloses on the contrary a tendency for mobility and transformation, supporting both the character\u2019s early successes, which demand that he cross or blur boundaries, and his later failures, which require that he not do so. \n\nIn order to highlight Lancelot\u2019s difficulties with the highly codified world of men, and the changes that he can bring to it, I engage with questions of gender construction, queer performativity, and the semiotics of marginality. I also rely on medieval symbolism, in particular natural elements, humors, and colors. By doing so, my dissertation claims that the stories in which Lancelot is the central protagonist, and which focus on either his life or an important episode of his existence, are not necessarily centered on his adulterous relationship with Guinevere.

With increasing scientific evidence to support these health benefits, interest has grown in the addition of probiotic organisms to dairy products and to pharmaceutical preparations.  Strain differentiation and identification are important tools both for industry (e.g., for quality assurance and safety, and for protecting rights of strain ownership) and for research (e.g., for identifying the strain of interest from among others).  The long-term goal of this research is to enhance the use of probiotics in dairy and non-dairy foods by developing methods to identify probiotic Bifidobacterium isolates at the genus, species, and strain levels so manufacturers have reliable, accurate tools to confirm culture identity and to assure product quality.  \nSpecifically, the first objective of this work was to acquire a collection of bifidobacterial strains representing species used in cultured dairy products, to identify them at the genus-, species- and subspecies-levels, and to characterize them using both phenotypic and nucleic acid-based methods.  Thirty-one strains of Bifidobacterium were obtained from six commercial starter culture companies.  Based on traditional detection of fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (F6PPK) activity and by PCR with genus-specific primers, twenty-two commercial strains were identified as Bifidobacterium.  While only one starter culture manufacturer misidentified strains at the genus level, species misidentification was common.  Based on PCR with species-specific primers, only six of twenty-two strains of Bifidobacterium were correctly identified at the species level.  \nTwenty of the twenty-two commercial strains of Bifidobacterium were identified as B. animalis ssp. lactis, the most common bifidobacterial (sub)species isolated from probiotic dairy products.  These twenty commercial strains were characterized using a variety of phenotypic and nucleic acid-based techniques.  PFGE, RAPD-PCR, and comparison of gene sequences, which are some of the more discriminatory typing methods, were unable to differentiate among this collection of highly related strains.  The commercial strains exhibited a high degree of relatedness to the B. animalis ssp. lactis type strain, DSMZ 10140, and only one phenotypic difference, related to glucose utilization, was observed.  \nTwenty commercial strains of B. animalis ssp. lactis, ATCC 27536, and the type strain, DSMZ 10140, were separated into two phenotypes, glucose \u201cfast\u201d and glucose \u201cslow\u201d.  Ten commercial glucose \u201cfast\u201d strains grew equally well in either lactose- or glucose-based media, while ten commercial glucose \u201cslow\u201d strains only grew on glucose after an extended lag time.  Eventually, all glucose \u201cslow\u201d strains grew equally well in lactose- or glucose-based media \u2013 these were referred to as glucose \u201cadapted\u201d strains.  \nThe second phase of this project was to develop an understanding of glucose utilization in B. animalis ssp. lactis.  This knowledge is important when selecting a medium for detection, isolation, or enumeration of bifidobacteria from a product.  Glucose non-fermenting strains of bifidobacteria may be undetected or underreported when glucose is used as the sole carbohydrate source in media, as is often the case in reports of enumeration of probiotic products.  Although mentioned in passing, little detailed information is available in the literature about glucose non-fermenting strains of bifidobacteria and no study has been conducted on glucose transport by B. animalis ssp. lactis.  The dominance of B. animalis ssp. lactis strains used in the manufacture of probiotic dairy products, the prevalence (50%) of glucose non-fermenting strains of B. animalis ssp. lactis identified in this work, and the common use of glucose as the sole carbon source in media for isolating or enumerating bifidobacteria emphasizes the need to characterize glucose utilization in these strains.    \nA low-affinity facilitated diffusion glucose transporter was identified in DSMZ 10140.  Glucose uptake assays revealed: 1) saturable kinetics with a Kt of 14.8 mM, 2) stereospecificity, with greater competition by methyl-b-glucoside than methyl-a-glucoside, and 3) decreased glucose uptake of more than 30% by phloretin, an inhibitor of facilitated diffusion of glucose.  \nWhile there was a correlation between growth in glucose and glucose uptake for glucose \u201cslow\u201d and glucose \u201cfast\u201d strains, not all \u201cadapted\u201d strains exhibited increased glucose uptake (i.e., RB 4825 and RB 5251).  This suggests multiple mechanisms are responsible for a strain\u2019s inability to grow on glucose in Liver Glucose (LG) and are involved in a strain acquiring the ability to grow on glucose.  \nDuring the characterization of glucose transport in DSMZ 10140 and five commercial strains of B. animalis ssp. lactis, each strain exhibited a unique \u201cbiochemical fingerprint\u201d of its glucose transporter.  Among these six strains, glucose uptake varied with respect to levels of activity and effects of competitors, cations, and sodium chloride concentration.  However, all strains were inhibited by phloretin, indicating facilitated diffusion was the primary mechanism of glucose transport.  \nIn bifidobacteria, few glucose transporters have been described.  The glucose transporters characterized in this work are the first identified in B. animalis ssp. lactis and the first identified facilitated diffusion transporters of glucose in actinobacteria, contributing to our understanding of glucose utilization and bifidobacteria physiology.  \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1809], "author_name_tesi": "Briczinski, Elizabeth Panko", "last_name_ssi": "Briczinski", "middle_name_ssi": "Panko", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert F Roberts", "Jean Elnora Brenchley", "Stephanie Doores", "Stephen John Knabel", "Allen T Phillips"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert F Roberts, Committee Chair", "Jean Elnora Brenchley, Committee Member", "Stephanie Doores, Committee Member", "Stephen John Knabel, Committee Member", "Allen T Phillips, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis", "strain characterization", "glucose transport", "glucose non-fermenting strains", "probiotic", "glucose uptake", "facilitated diffusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "RURALITY AND CRIME:\nIDENTIFYING AND EXPLAINING RURAL/URBAN DIFFERENCES\n", "id": "10315", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3835", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rural crime is relatively understudied in criminology. Though most research finds that urban places have the highest crime rates and rural areas the lowest, little attention has been given to specifying this relationship. This neglect is particularly conspicuous in research on communities and crime. Although this approach, with its attention to community characteristics, would be particularly useful for understanding differences in crime rates of rural and urban places, research in this field has been limited almost exclusively to urban areas. This dissertation offers an initial step towards remedying this lack of attention to rural crime by using national data to examine differences in rural and urban crime rates. I identify variation in crime rates across a full range of rural and urban counties in order to clarify which aspects of rurality are most strongly associated with lower crime rates. \nI also explore theoretical explanations for the differences in crime rates, focusing on social disorganization theory. If levels of social disorganization differ in rural and urban places, this may account for the differences in their crime rates. In addition, social disorganization theory is often put forth as a general theory, yet has been tested primarily in urban areas. The myriad differences between rural and urban places may contribute to differences in the effects of disorganization on crime rates. \nTo test this, I combine county-level data from several sources, including the Uniform Crime Reports, U.S. Census, County Business Patterns survey, and Religious Congregations and Membership Study. I find that controlling for structural antecedents of disorganization and measures of community social organization reduces differences between rural and urban crime rates; more urban counties generally suffer from higher levels of disorganization which partially explains their higher crime rates. I also find that the effects of measures of social disorganization differ in rural and urban places; in general, they are better predictors of urban crime. This is particularly evident for poverty, which is positively associated with crime rates in urban counties, but in rural areas, is negatively associated with property crime and is not associated with violent crime. Overall, these results support the extension of social disorganization theory to rural counties, but suggest the need to adapt the theory to better predict crime across all locations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3811], "author_name_tesi": "Briddell, Laine O'Neill", "last_name_ssi": "Briddell", "middle_name_ssi": "O'Neill", "first_name_ssi": "Laine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["D Wayne Osgood", "D Wayne Osgood", "Eric Silver", "Jeremy Staff", "Diane Krantz Mclaughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["D Wayne Osgood, Dissertation Advisor", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Chair", "Eric Silver, Committee Member", "Jeremy Staff, Committee Member", "Diane Krantz Mclaughlin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rural crime", "social disorganization", "crime rates"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Using Emission Lines to Characterize Galaxy Properties: From the Nearby to the Distant Universe", "id": "14604jub256", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14604", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ever since the hydrogen emission line of Lyman-alpha (Ly\u03b1) has been postulated to hold one of the keys to studying high-redshift galaxies, the question of what emission lines can tell us about the properties and evolution of galaxies has driven much of our research. This work is a survey of emission lines across cosmic history. Just as galaxies evolve with redshift, so does how we can use emission line information from these galaxies. I begin with a study of resolved Ly\u03b1 emission in nearby galaxies, and how we can use pixel-by-pixel photometry to study emission on very small galactic scales and to characterize Ly\u03b1 scattering. Using the Lyman-Alpha Reference Sample, a set of 14 starbursting galaxies with redshifts of 0.02 < z < 0.2 observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) Solar Blind Channel on the Advanced Camera for Surveys, I have characterized how the Ly\u03b1 photons scatter. Since Ly\u03b1 is a resonant line, the photons are absorbed and re-emitted by the neutral hydrogen in galaxies until they finally escape or are absorbed by dust. Understanding how this random walk process affects where and how much Ly\u03b1 we observe is important for us to be able to use Ly\u03b1 as a signpost of galaxy evolution at high redshifts. By comparison, the H\u03b1 transition, which is optically thin and therefore where we observe H\u03b1 photons are likely where they were emitted originally, is much easier to trace. I have developed a method to compare the H\u03b1 and Ly\u03b1 distributions in galaxies to determine a characteristic scattering length for Ly\u03b1 photons. This is an important step in understanding exactly how much a Ly\u03b1 photon scatters before escaping, and is important for understand the overall escape fraction of Ly\u03b1. Shifting to higher redshifts of z \u223c 0.5, emission lines can no longer be used to study the emission from galaxies at such high resolution. Instead, I examine how we can study global galaxy properties using the emission lines, and how we can relate that to galaxy size and morphology. For this study, I used a sample of 284 [O II] emitting galaxies from the Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Survey (HETDEX) Pilot Survey. Using the forbidden transition of [O II] as a star-formation rate indicator, we found that these galaxies corroborate the main sequence of star forming galaxies. I confirm, however, that the [O II] line is very sensitive to metallicity and abundance. I find that the star formation in these galaxies is generally not due to galaxy mergers, but more likely the result in situ cold gas accretion. Galaxy emission activity becomes more complicated as we approach cosmic noon (z \u223c 2), when star formation was at its peak. To address this issue, I look at how we can use both Balmer and oxygen emission lines to help disentangle star formation activity from emission caused by active galactic nuclei. I do this by simulating z \u223c 2 galaxies with H\u03b2 at 4861 Angstroms and [O III]\u03bb5007 emission and performing mock HST grism observations with the infrared G141 grism on the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). The benefit of observing these galaxies using a grism is that we are able to gather spatial information about where the emission is coming from, whether it is nuclear or from more extended regions. By developing a method for separating these emission regions in our observations, we provide a way to find obscure or low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGN) that are undetectable by other methods. Finally, I explore our prospects for using emission lines to probe the first galaxies at z > 6 and how we can leverage new technology to catch them in the act of formation. I examine the completeness of the WFC3/G102 grism program CANDELS Lyman-alpha Emission at Reionization (CLEAR) survey, simulating Ly\u03b1 emission at these high redshifts. This is a necessary step in being able to leverage the \u223c 90 Ly\u03b1 emitters that will be found to tell us not only about galaxy formation at high redshift but also about the luminosity function of Ly\u03b1 emitters during this cosmic era.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15537], "author_name_tesi": "Bridge, Joanna S", "last_name_ssi": "Bridge", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Joanna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Caryl Ann Gronwall", "Caryl Ann Gronwall", "Robin Bruce Ciardullo", "Michael Eracleous", "Christopher Howard House", "Donald P Schneider"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Caryl Ann Gronwall, Dissertation Advisor", "Caryl Ann Gronwall, Committee Chair", "Robin Bruce Ciardullo, Committee Member", "Michael Eracleous, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Outside Member", "Donald P Schneider, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["astronomy", "astrophysics", "galaxies", "emission lines", "star formation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "INTERPRETING FEEDBACK IN THE WORKPLACE: AN EXAMINATION OF STEREOTYPE THREAT AND STIGMATIZATION WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN PROFESSIONALS\n", "id": "9018", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5718", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study sought to examine the effects of the presence of stereotype threat on perceptions of feedback in the workplace with African American professionals.

A specific application considered here consists of having a robotic manipulator refuel a vehicle gas tank. Currently there are no standard mobile robotic refueling systems.  Moreover, although increasingly more common, ground robots have not been used specifically for refueling tasks. This thesis examines the ability of a three-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator coupled with a mobile base to perform a vehicle refueling task. A model of a three-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator was fully implemented with a GAZEBO simulation package to test the refueling process in a virtual world.  This allowed virtual testing of multiple vehicles and fuel tank configurations. Tests were then conducted using a real three-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator, a RE2 Automatic Arm, fully integrated with ROS (Robot Operating System). For angled fuel tank inlets, an additional degree of freedom was required, where a wrist joint was needed to properly align the nozzle along the central axis of the angled fuel tank inlet tube. The advantage of using a mobile base as an additional degree of freedom during refueling is assessed for a sample refueling trajectory.  Specific geometries of the robotic manipulator in relation to the mobile base were incorporated into an analysis of the optimal base location for each trajectory point along the desired refueling path. Through the investigation of mobile base and manipulator movement, specific constraints are quantified for the prototype design of a wheeled mobile base. The analysis results also provide insight into general design principles for robotic refueling systems.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9703], "author_name_tesi": "Briggs, Kathryn Launa", "last_name_ssi": "Briggs", "middle_name_ssi": "Launa", "first_name_ssi": "Kathryn", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean N Brennan", "Karl Martin Reichard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sean N Brennan, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Martin Reichard, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["inverse kinematics", "robotic refueling", "mobile base", "robotic manipulator"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Wind Turbines Under Atmospheric Icing Conditions - Ice Accretion Modeling, Aerodynamics, and Control Strategies for Mitigating Performance Degradation", "id": "18859", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9095", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents a combined engineering methodology of ice accretion, airfoil data, and rotor performance analysis of wind turbines subject to moderate atmospheric icing conditions.

Preliminary results obtained for the NREL Phase VI rotor, the NREL 5MW rotor, and the in-house designed PSU-2.5 MW wind turbines subject to a representative icing condition indicate that performance degradation with respect to power loss can be mitigated with appropriate control strategies during and post an icing event.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8921], "author_name_tesi": "Brillembourg, Dwight David", "last_name_ssi": "Brillembourg", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Dwight", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sven Schmitz", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sven Schmitz, Thesis Advisor", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor", "George A Lesieutre, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["wind turbine", "icing"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Affective Reactivity to Food Consumption: Within- and Between-person Associations in Daily Life", "id": "13799mjb6504", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13799", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Objectives: The impact of food consumption on our emotions (and vice versa) has the potential to act as a risk factor or causal mechanism for overweight and obesity. Previous research on the relationship between affect and emotions on food consumption has been mixed. In this paper, I examine this relationship (positive and negative affect in relation to meal and snack consumption) using a multilevel modeling approach with data collected from a measurement burst study to address these conflicting results.   \nMethod: Using data from 140 adults (MAge= 46.20 years) who provided three weeks of daily reports as part of an intensive experience sampling study, I examine differences in how meal and snack consumption influence daily positive and negative affect. \nResults: Between-person differences in meal consumption are related to higher levels of PA and lower levels of NA, and between-person differences in snack consumption are related to lower levels of PA and higher levels of NA. Individuals who consumed more meals or snacks tended to have higher levels of PA and lower levels of NA. Within-person differences in daily affect were, on average not related to meal and snack consumption. Between-person associations were independent of daily physical activity, sleep quality, caffeine consumption, and alcohol consumption, but were not independent of between-person differences in income.  \nDiscussion: The examination of repeated measures data to understand the relationship between affect and food consumption may address prior conflicting findings within these relationships by parsing trait and state levels of food intake.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13960], "author_name_tesi": "Brinberg, Mimi Ida", "last_name_ssi": "Brinberg", "middle_name_ssi": "Ida", "first_name_ssi": "Mimi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nilam Ram", "Lori A.

In turn, this has led to a number of techniques, such as the Method of Moments (MoM), the Finite Element Method (FEM), and the Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD), each of which exhibits their own advantages and disadvantages. In particular, the FDTD has become a widely used tool for modeling electromagnetic systems, and since it solves Maxwell\u2019s equations directly\u2014without having to derive Green\u2019s Functions or to solve a matrix equation or\u2014it experiences little or no difficulties when handling complex inhomogeneous media. Furthermore, the FDTD has the additional advantage that it can be easily parallelized; and, hence, it can model large systems using supercomputing clusters. However, the FDTD method is not without its disadvantages when used on platforms with limited computational resources. For many problems, the domain size can be extremely large in terms of the operating wavelengths, whereas many of the objects have fine features (e.g., Body Area Networks). Since FDTD requires a meshing of the entire computational domain, presence of these fine features can significantly increase the computational burden; in fact, in many cases, it can render the problem either too time-consuming or altogether impractical to solve. This has served as the primary motivation in this thesis for developing multi-scale techniques that can circumvent many of the problems associated with CEM, and in particular with time domain methods, such as the FDTD. \nNumerous multi-scale problems that frequently arise in CEM have been investigated in this work.  These include: 1) The coupling problem between two conformal antennas systems on complex platforms; 2) Rigorous modeling of Body Area Networks (BANs), and some approximate human phantom models for path loss characterization; 3) Efficient modeling of fine features in the FDTD method and the introduction of the dipole moment method for finite methods; and, 4) Time domain scattering by thin wire structures using a novel Time-Domain-Electric-Field-Integral-Equation (TD-EFIE) formulation. Furthermore, it is illustrated, via several examples, that each problem requires a unique approach.

Some scholars are concerned that modern societies lack the institutional and civic capacity necessary to become sufficiently deliberative democracies (Nabatchi, 2010). University-based scholars and public-interest organizations have responded by organizing procedural mini-publics, a type of public forum designed to enhance the quality and efficacy of political discourse (Fung, 2003). These deliberative processes differ from informal political conversation by systematically selecting participants and by constraining discourse to achieve normatively desirable outcomes (Bohman & Rehg, 1997, p. xvi).\nIn this dissertation, I use communication theory to explain how participants in deliberative processes manage to cooperate even in manifestly adversarial political contexts. I argue that interactions within mini-publics involve an understudied but crucial relational component. Using Relational Framing Theory (Dillard, Solomon, & Samp, 1996) to inform my investigation, I measure participants\u2019 relational perceptions during a small-group deliberative interaction. I use those data to examine the effect of differential relational judgments on participants\u2019 interactive experiences, reasoning, and legitimacy assessments.\nIn Chapter 1, I outline deliberation as a political practice and as a subject of scholarly inquiry. I discuss deliberative democracy as a theory of legitimate government. I then examine why some empirical social scientists embrace its tenets to guide academic studies of mini-publics as democratic interventions. I describe their features and give examples of the specific problems mini-public organizers intend to solve. I conclude by arguing that the development of procedural democratic deliberation is an attempt to increase political legitimacy.\nIn Chapter 2, I discuss political legitimacy as the focal concern of deliberative democratic theory. I define the concept of democratic legitimacy and differentiate four types of deliberative\niv\nlegitimacy. A central feature of deliberative legitimacy is that it links citizens\u2019 expectations about democratic norms with their experiences of communicative interaction. My central argument is that deliberative theory implies that legitimacy has a communicative basis. Thus, in Chapter 3, I consider how communication theory may inform deliberation theory.\nIn Chapter 3, I argue that the communicative aspect of small-group deliberation is under-theorized. Communication scholars have described this problem as the \u201c\u2018black box\u2019 of deliberation,\u201d in which scholars assume without evidence that dialogue under conditions of deliberative interaction produces democratically desirable outcomes (Mutz, 2008, p. 530; Stromer-Galley & Muhlberger, 2009, p. 174). Solving this problem requires theorizing based on foundational understandings of human communication. Thus, I draw on the concept of relational information processing, as articulated through Relational Framing Theory (Dillard, Solomon, & Samp, 1996), as a grounds for explaining how deliberative mini-publics legitimize collective self-governance through communicative interaction. This concept links Chapters 1 and 2 by explaining how the unique environment of a mini-public invites participants to maintain interpersonal relationships. These relationships are integral to the process of reasoning on policy arguments because they give participants a basis for differentiating between enactment of strategic (i.e. persuasion-oriented) and cooperative (i.e. understanding-oriented) goals.\nIn Chapter 4, I present four theoretical models that relate causal forces (e.g., process design and norm enactment) to democratic legitimacy outcomes. The first two models are attitudinal (influences on participants\u2019 legitimacy-salient judgements), and the second two are behavioral (influences on participants\u2019 legitimacy-salient actions).\nI augment these models by theorizing about how variance in relational frame salience acts as a conditional effect within each of them. I hypothesize that relational frame salience is an outcome of the process design choices from Chapter 1. I argue that participants\u2019 differential perceptions of frame salience explains variation in participants\u2019 attitudinal perceptions of\nv\nteleological and procedural legitimacy. Based on my theorizing in Chapter 3, I argue that interactions characterized by cooperative relationships allow participants to engage with reasons rather than compete over contested positions. Finally, I argue that participants are more likely to give symbolic consent when deliberation is teleologically and procedurally legitimate.\nIn Chapter 5, I describe my empirical methodology for collecting data to assess the plausibility of my hypotheses. I discuss my recruiting method, the design of my participatory mini-public, and the instruments I used for measuring variables of interest. I also report the measurement properties of my data. This section includes manipulation-checks of the experimental component and factor analyses to establish reliable measures.\nIn Chapter 6, I discuss my data analysis. I use structural equation modeling to test my hypotheses. The data support several of the hypothesized conditional effects that flow from relational framing. One key finding is that enactment of deliberative norms primes an affiliation/disaffiliation-salient interpretation of the interaction episode. The data also confirm my hypothesis that interaction framing is important for policy reasoning by reducing the role of prior commitment and increasing the role of argument-specific judgements.\nIn Chapter 7, I draw conclusions from my study for the theory and practice of deliberation. I also note limitations on my claims and future research avenues to address them. From my analysis, I draw the conclusion that relational frame salience is a conditional effect that partially explains why mini-public participants adopt deliberative norms, and when prior attitudes act as independent influences on participants\u2019 evaluations of issue-relevant argument quality.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15591], "author_name_tesi": "Brinker, David Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Brinker", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Gastil", "John Gastil", "James P.

Border State emancipation, no less traumatic than its Confederate counterpart(s), nonetheless took a different path. Recent scholars have observed that in much of the Confederacy, wartime emancipation was neither secure nor absolute. In the loyal Border States, it was more fraught yet. Slaves and ex-slaves struggled to navigate the overlapping terrains of federal policy, civil law, and the market in their labor as they began to lay the material and ideological foundations of free households. Long experience with hiring markets and geographical mobility gave Border State freedpeople valuable tools in the post-war economy. Nonetheless, many remained enmeshed in ongoing relations of coercion and dependence with the former master class, and still others found that waged labor required hard, often agonizing choices, once again compelling the separation of husbands from wives and children from parents in order to ensure the survival of all family members.

Conflicting terminology is problematic, as terms such a motivation and job satisfaction have been used interchangeably with the term morale in many cases.  Additionally, numerous measurement tools have been created to measure teacher morale.  Getzels and Guba (1957) suggest that morale is affected by three tensions: belongingness (role expectations vs. personal needs), identification (organizational goals vs. personal needs), and rationality (role expectations vs. organizational goals). Some available instruments measure the term holistically with questions aimed at determining at what level respondents view their morale, while others evaluate individual factors.  However, established tools fail to provide data regarding those tensions directly, thereby providing an incomplete picture to school administrators hoping to examine and improve teacher morale \nThe quantitative, non-experimental, cross-sectional study examined the conflicting terminology associated with term teacher morale as well as the contradictory results of prior morale research.

Relational turbulence theory highlights relationship qualities that emerge during transitions and complicate marital functioning.  In particular, the theory explains how doubts about the future of the relationship and perceptions of goal interference amplify negative experiences in romantic relationships.  The experiencing life transitions model from the field of nursing identifies how attempts to increase interaction, feel connected, feel situated, and increase confidence contribute to a successful transition.  In a preliminary study, these behaviors were associated with improved relational quality, as well as more positive transition experiences and outcomes among married partners in the general population.  Building on that foundation, the dissertation presents two studies that examine the communication strategies that help parents of children with ASD reduce relational turbulence during stressful transitions throughout their child\u2019s life.\nStudy 1 surveys the landscape of transitions specific to parents of children with ASD, examines how characteristics of married relationships vary based on the type of transition experienced, and explores the communication and cognitions couples use to navigate marital transitions in this context.  The study examined the transition experiences of 298 parents of children with ASD who were currently married.  Participants detailed an important transition throughout the life span of their child with ASD using open-ended questions.  They completed scales assessing qualities of the relationship during the transition and communication behaviors used to navigate the experience.  Results demonstrate significant differences in relational qualities based on the type of transition described.  In particular, the initial diagnosis received the highest ratings for transition magnitude and relational turbulence, and it was considered the most negative transition experience compared to other common transitions.  Starting school for the first time was associated with the most positive transition experience ratings.  Transition processing communication predicted participants\u2019 experiences of relational uncertainty and facilitation from a partner, which predicted relational turbulence.  \nStudy 2 expands on the results from Study 1 by incorporating a longitudinal, pre- and post-test design with diary surveys.  Specifically, the goal of Study 2 was to examine how married partners\u2019 transition processing communication affects their own and their spouse\u2019s experiences of relational uncertainty, changes in interdependence, and relational turbulence.  Fifty-three couples, parents whose child with ASD started school for the first time this year, completed a pre-test, 14 dairies, and a post-test.  Participants completed diary entries every three days over a 42-day period of time, beginning on the child\u2019s first day of school.  \nFindings for Study 2 suggest that married partners\u2019 engagement in transition processing communication (and perception of their spouse\u2019s communication) significantly affect their own and their spouse\u2019s daily experiences of relational uncertainty, interference and facilitation from a partner, and relational turbulence.  Parents\u2019 reported turmoil in the relationship increased over the course of the transition, while the use of transition processing communication decreased or stayed the same.  For daily experiences, spouses\u2019 perception of their partner\u2019s attempts to increase interaction, feel connected, feel situated, and increase confidence in the relationship were associated with decreased relational uncertainty and relational turbulence, and increased facilitation from a partner.  In assessments of participants\u2019 linear trends on the variables of interest, increases in husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 transition processing communication throughout the course of the study coincided with improvement in their own reports of relational turbulence variables from pre-test to post-test.  Perceptions of a spouse\u2019s engagement in transition processing communication demonstrated similar effects, particularly for women; however, increases in one\u2019s perceptions of a partner\u2019s engagement in transition processing coincided with increases in partner uncertainty.  Husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 reports of their own engagement in transition processing communication demonstrated few significant effects on their partner\u2019s reports of relational turbulence variables.

Riparian wetlands may alleviate the impacts of elevated nitrate and atmospheric carbon through denitrification and long-term carbon storage. However, anthropogenic impacts in the surrounding landscape likely affect the ability of riparian wetlands to provide these ecosystem services. Changes in land-use regimes surrounding riparian wetlands has been known to alter plant communities, hydrology, and soils. However, few studies examine whether the different plant communities associated with land-use regime affect decomposition or total carbon inputs and outputs within these wetlands and whether these differences lead to differential carbon storage. For denitrification, surrounding-land use likely influences the concentration of important abiotic parameters such as nitrate and dissolved organic carbon. However, it is not understood how surrounding land-use influences the distribution of these parameters and thus the distribution of denitrification in space and time.  To better understand the influences of land-use on denitrification and carbon storage, three high disturbance and three low disturbance headwater wetlands were selected. Factors known to affect denitrification in shallow groundwater were analyzed at a meter scale and used to construct functional habitats to examine the combined effects of multiple parameters on denitrification. To examine effects of plant community on carbon storage I classified the sites by plant community, performed a yearlong decomposition experiment, and measured organic carbon inputs and outputs at each site. \nFive distinct denitrification functional habitats were identified across the six sites. Distribution of three out of five functional habitats differed between high and low disturbance sites, indicating that surrounding land-use regime likely influences the spatial characteristics of biogeochemical parameters important to denitrification. Carbon storage differed between the plant communities, with low disturbance sites dominated by Tsuga canadensis having the highest soil carbon levels. The differences in carbon storage were likely due to differential decomposition and carbon inputs and outputs between the different plant communities. Litter quality was found to be a large driver of decomposition dynamics, as litter with greater percent C, percent lignin, C:N ratios, and lignin:N ratios decomposed more slowly. Furthermore, significant differences in dissolved organic carbon concentration and quality, as well as soil carbon content and quality between high and low disturbance sites indicate shifts in carbon dynamics which can likely be attributed to differences in plant community. Overall, large changes were seen in carbon dynamics and biogeochemical parameters associated with denitrification between high and low disturbance sites, indicating that surrounding land use has a large effect on C and N cycling in headwater wetlands. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10219], "author_name_tesi": "Britson, Aliana Jocelyn", "last_name_ssi": "Britson", "middle_name_ssi": "Jocelyn", "first_name_ssi": "Aliana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Denice Heller Wardrop", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer", "Patrick Joseph Drohan", "Christopher J Duffy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Denice Heller Wardrop, Dissertation Advisor", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer, Committee Chair", "Patrick Joseph Drohan, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Denitrification", "Carbon Storage", "Wetlands", "Anthropogenic Disturbance", "Ecosystem Services", "Ecosystem Functional Assessments"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Phase Field Simulation of Domain Switching Dynamics in Multi-axial Lead Zirconate Titanate Thin Films", "id": "24807", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11084", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The defining characteristic of ferroelectric materials is their ability to be switched between energetically equivalent polarization states.  This behavior has led to an interest in ferroelectrics for a wide range of bulk and thin film applications such as mechanical actuators and ferroelectric random access memory devices.  Ferroelectric switching depends on domain wall motion, however, and is critically influenced by the existence of defects such as dislocations and preexisting domains.  Domain wall motion in thin film applications can be controlled by individual local defects due to the reduced length scale of the system.  This dissertation describes the impact of preexisting ferroelastic domains and misfits dislocations in coherent (001)-oriented Pb(Zr0.2,Ti0.8)O3 (PZT) thin films on the switching response and domain structure.  \nA phase field model based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory that accounts for the electrostatic and mechanical interactions is used to describe domain structures in ferroelectric PZT thin films. To solve the governing equations a semi-implicit Fourier-Spectral scheme is developed that accommodates boundary conditions appropriate to the thin film geometry.  Errors are reduced in the solutions at the film edges through extensions to the model developed to correct the Fourier transform around stationary discontinuities at the thin film edges.  This correction is shown to result in increased accuracy of the phase field model needed to appropriately describe dynamic switching responses in the thin film.  \nInvestigation of switching around preexisting ferroelastic domains showed these defects are strong obstacles to switching in PZT thin films.  Directly above the ferroelastic domain the magnitude of the required nucleation bias underneath a tip-like electrode was found to be elevated compared to the required bias far from the domain.  Locally both the piezoelectric and dielectric responses of the thin film were found to be suppressed, which is in agreement with previously reported experimental results.  Modeling results also showed that built in electric fields and long range strains around the ferroelastic domains were responsible for the observed property changes.  During switching embedded ferroelastic domains were shown to arrest 180\u00b0 ferroelectric switching by forming partially stabilized charged 90\u00b0 domain walls in which the local bound charge was accommodated by substantial broadening of the domain wall.  This led to the charged interface remaining stable over a modest range of applied biases and necessitated a larger switching bias than required far from the ferroelastic domain.  This result may explain previously observed experimental difficulty poling PZT thin films around ferroelastic domain structures.\nFerroelastic domains were then modeled around misfit dislocations in coherent thin films to better quantify interactions between two common types of elastic defects.  Isolated misfit dislocations relieving compressive strain in the thin film were found to locally stabilize ferroelastic domains due to the creation of in-plane tensile stresses around the dislocations.  Ferroelastic domains in thinner films extended completely to the free surface of the thin film, while in films with larger thicknesses only small, wedge-shaped domains were observed.  The transition between the two domain structures with film thickness is shown to be well reproduced with transmission electron microscopy results.  Calculations of the total free energy and its derivatives in the system show the transition has the characteristics of a first order transition at the critical thickness.  These results show how dislocations may stabilize the wide range of observed domain structures based on the local stress environment around the dislocation. \nDynamic responses of ferroelastic domains around dislocations were found to be reduced through elastic interactions.  Inclusions of dislocations near the substrate interface reduced both the real part of the dielectric response and the loss tangent, indicating misfit dislocations are strong pinning centers in thin films.  A method to separate the domain wall and lattice contributions to the total response is proposed and used to show that the reduction in response is due to decreases in the domain wall mobility around the dislocations caused by the local non-uniform stress state.  This provides insight into the causes of reduced responses in ferroelectric thin films that is then used to demonstrate a film geometry that maximizes the local dielectric response in the system.  \nThis work provides insight into switching in ferroelectric thin films around specific common elastic defects and provides a basis for investigating the impact of other classes of defects that are difficult to isolate and study experimentally.  For instance, point defects such as oxygen vacancies around moving domain walls could be more easily studied with phase field models.  Further, phase field modeling creates a method to quantitatively rank the impact of various defect types on ferroelectric switching.  By studying common defects, efforts to produce high quality devices by minimizing defect concentration can be focused on eliminating the most critical defects.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10656], "author_name_tesi": "Britson, Jason Curtis", "last_name_ssi": "Britson", "middle_name_ssi": "Curtis", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen", "Clive A Randall", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ferroelectrics", "Phase Field", "Domain Switching", "Thin Films", "PZT"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DRAWING DOS AND DON\u2019TS:  THE DRAW-A-PERSON TEST AS A MEASURE OF INTELLECTUAL MATURITY?\n\n", "id": "10081", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5091", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Goodenough-Harris Draw-A-Person Test is used today in schools as a measure of school readiness and a predictor of academic success.

This thesis continues the academic discussion of whether this type of drawing-based assessment should be used in schools.  If art lessons could improve children\u2019s test scores, then the test would not truly measure intellectual maturity, which is assumed to be innate and cannot be taught.  In this study, kindergarten classes were divided into two groups, an intervention group, and a control group.  Thirty-one parents or guardians of kindergarteners consented to having their children participate.  At baseline, the Draw-A-Person Test was administered to both groups.  The intervention group received four art lessons over two weeks about drawing people, which I created and delivered.  Then both groups repeated the test.  There was no statistical difference between the pre-intervention and post-intervention test scores in either group.  This finding supports the validity of the Draw-A-Person Test since the test scores for children in both groups remained constant.  However, my experiences and observations while teaching the intervention group told a different story.  There is a difference between statistical significance and real world significance that is observed by the art teacher.

While scholars have discussed the text\u2019s protofeminist leanings, no one has analyzed how its treatment of women\u2019s intellectual, corporeal, and spiritual life encourages the reform of patriarchal institutions. I contend that the text challenges masculine preeminence in the Church and aristocracy through recurring tales of attempted rape, in which self-interested men assert subjectivity and dominance by objectifying women. To contest the reduction of women to sexualized bodies, female storytellers foreground the faith and intelligence of the rapists\u2019 intended victims. In so doing, they redefine female experience in spiritual and intellectual terms and thus affirm female subjectivity. \n\nMoreover, in the post-tale debates, the female narrators assert their right to be seen as subjects by echoing their heroines\u2019 resistance to masculine aggression. When male storytellers propose interpretations of rape that laud masculine self-interest, the women use Scripture and critical thinking to unravel their arguments. In place of a selfish, power-driven mentality that incites hostility between the sexes, the female narrators endorse a Christlike relational standard called agape. As they attempt to convert their male interlocutors to this new paradigm, they also aim to recruit readers to their cause. The text aids them in that effort by manipulating readers\u2019 generic expectations, acquired from the Heptam\u00e9ron\u2019s male-authored inspirations and the lighthearted genres with which they engage. By redirecting readers toward moral discussions with political import, the text begins a process of disorientation. It continues to disorient the reader through the myriad opinions the storytellers express before employing textual signposts to invite the reader to join the devisantes\u2019 community. By altering individual perspectives, the text works to reform the Church and aristocracy and gain recognition for female subjectivity. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14070], "author_name_tesi": "Brock, Theresa Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Brock", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Theresa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jean-Claude Vuillemin", "Jean-Claude Vuillemin", "B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Monicat", "Christine Clark-Evans", "Thomas Beebee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jean-Claude Vuillemin, Dissertation Advisor", "Jean-Claude Vuillemin, Committee Chair", "B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Monicat, Committee Member", "Christine Clark-Evans, Committee Member", "Thomas Beebee, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["French", "Heptam\u00e9ron", "literature", "Early Modern", "Genre", "Reception Theories", "Women's and Gender Studies"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "EFFICIENT OPTIMIZATION OF ANTENNA AND ELECTROMAGNETIC DEVICES AT MEDIUM, RADIO, AND OPTICAL FREQUENCIES", "id": "2f75r800t", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12790", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The fast growth of computer technology has led to aggressive advancement in engineering design, where in the past, analytical methods and/or intuitive trial and error through experiments were the most lucrative tools. Specifically in electromagnetics, powerful computers can be used to run simulation models subject to numerical solutions of Maxwell\u2019s equations, providing extremely accurate predictions of the device performance. Growing computer resources also offer the ability to optimize devices via simulation, facilitating fine-tuning before fabrication. Hence, engineering design has drifted more and more towards computer modeling and optimization and has, in some cases, drifted away from intuition-based design and experimental fine-tuning. Although the former approach has the tendency to lower research and development costs and, at times, predict novel devices, the latter is still essential to the overall advancement of engineering design. With this in mind, this dissertation summarizes multiple efforts, ranging across many sub-fields of electromagnetics, where computer modeling and optimization was strongly coupled to intuitive design. This approach leads to efficient optimization of high performance designs that would likely not be possible with analytical or brute-force computer optimization alone. First, a hybrid approach combining transmission line equations and full-wave models is developed to optimize large communication networks in coal mines for emergency response applications. Secondly, a miniaturized dual-band antenna with an interdigitated slot load is proposed based on transmission line models and fine-tuned using computer simulation models. The antenna was fabricated and characterized, showing excellent agreement with simulation predictions. Next, an ultra-thin electromagnetic absorber design is proposed based on an equivalent circuit model. In particular, the circuit model is used to optimize the absorber design for wide bandwidth. Subsequently, the circuit model is used to simplify the optimization routine by cascading the scattering properties of the different absorber regions.

This falls far short of the grander vision of such systems as a new operational paradigm for science, in which ontologies might aid knowledge discovery by serving as digital proxies for scientific knowledge. To enable scientific discovery, ontologies must additionally embrace the contextual knowledge evident in science, such as methodological histories, implicit assumptions, evolving concepts and diverse scientific perspectives. \nIn this research, ontologies are considered digital instruments of scientific inquiry. A contextual theory of geoscientific ontology representation is developed, formalized, and tested against scientific practice and real data. The theory takes a geo-pragmatic viewpoint, in which discovery is facilitated through development of a computable formalism for elements of the geoscientific discovery process.  The knowledge represented with the formalism can be tested and replicated by geoscientists, and have sufficient context to help stimulate new hypotheses. The formalism affects the structure and content of geoscientific ontologies: (1) concept structure is augmented by including origins, effects, uses, and their production functions; and (2) ontology content is affected by the introduction of situated concepts that are defined by unique geographical histories. \nThe formalism is empirically tested by studying how geoscientists collaborate to develop a shared geologic map. The results are computationally implemented by using the formalism as a basis for a geospatial database schema in which the empirical data is hosted. This enables periods of geoscientific knowledge discovery and evolution to be explored visually. Geo-pragmatic influences are then used to help organize knowledge within the schema, through the introduction of several levels of abstraction for geoscience concepts including a level for situated concepts. \nThese studies cumulatively show that geo-pragmatic representation is realistic, viable, and valuable, as it is shown respectively to fit geoscientific data and practice, be computationally implemented, and improve current geoscience knowledge representation practices. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [722], "author_name_tesi": "Brodaric, Boyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Brodaric", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Boyan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Gahegan", "Alan Maceachren", "William Ewart Easterling Iii", "Frederico T Fonseca"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Gahegan, Committee Chair", "Alan Maceachren, Committee Member", "William Ewart Easterling Iii, Committee Member", "Frederico T Fonseca, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["GIScience", "ontology", "pragmatics", "geoscience", "knowledge discovery"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Individual Differences in Mothers' and Fathers' Marital and Coparenting Relationships.", "id": "2r36tx526", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12503", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The coparenting relationship has been conceptualized as a mechanism by which the marital relationship affects child outcomes, but little is known about how aspects of fathers\u2019 and mothers\u2019 marital quality (i.e., adjustment and conflict), are linked to coparenting quality within families, or whether individual differences in the experience of economic strain or racial and ethnic background have implications for the strength of associations.

With its relatively high band gap (0.3eV) and nearly ideal band structure, Bi2Se3 has been a primary material of interest in the study of topological insulating behavior.  However, several factors have made this study difficult.  Bi2Se3 typically has a high native selenium vacancy concentration, and selenium vacancies act as donors in the material, leading to a high bulk electron concentration.  The surface of Bi2Se3 has also been shown to be susceptible to environmental doping when exposed to ambient air.  Combining these two factors means that Bi2Se3 is usually highly n-type doped, making it difficult to study the surface conducting states by transport measurements.  \nThis study investigated the use of two different chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques for the growth of Bi2Se3 thin films on sapphire (001): hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD) and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).  HPCVD is a process which combines the evaporation of elemental selenium with the thermal decomposition of trimethylbismuth (TMBi).  The use of elemental selenium immediately around the substrate provides a high overpressure of selenium, allowing for reduction of the selenium vacancy concentration.  Bi2Se3 films grown on sapphire were epitaxial and highly oriented parallel to the substrate giving rise to narrow X-ray rocking curves (full-width-at-half-maximum=160 arcsecs for (006) reflection) and 6-fold rotational symmetry as determined by phi scans.  The structural properties were consistent with deposition via a van der Waals epitaxy process.  The selenium to bismuth ratio (VI/V) ratio proved important for achieving a reduced electron concentration of <8x1018 cm-3 and room temperature mobilites of up to 800 cm2V-1s-1.\nMOCVD growth of Bi2Se3 was also investigated using trimethylbismuth (TMBi) dimethylselenide (DMSe) as precursors.   Epitaxial Bi2Se3 films were also produced by MOCVD on sapphire, however, the electron concentrations were generally higher (1-3x1019 cm 3) and the mobilities were lower (~250 cm2V-1s-1) than films grown by HPCVD.  This difference is likely due to the higher VI/V ratios more easily achievable with HPCVD growth compared to MOCVD growth.  The primary advantage of MOCVD compared to HPCVD, however, was the flexibility that it afforded to grow multilayer structures.   This was demonstrated through the deposition of Bi2Se3/MgB2 heterostructures on sapphire for potential use in the study of proximity effect induced topological superconductivity.\nThe effects of different ambient environments on the surface chemistry and electrical properties of Bi2Se3 were also studied.  Hall measurements performed over time in air, N2, H2O vapor, and O2 ambient environments showed that the type of ambient gas has a significant impact on the electrical properties of Bi2Se3.  Samples held in air and water vapor showed a 25-30% increase in carrier concentration over 10 hours, while a sample held in N2 showed no increase.  A sample held in O2, however, showed an initial 20% decrease in carrier concentration followed by a steady increase with time eventually reaching a value 15% above the initial value after 10 hours.  Water vapor was determined to be the major contributing factor to the oxidation of Bi2Se3 in air over time, reacting with the Bi2Se3 surface and leading to an increase in free electrons, increasing the carrier concentration.  This was supported by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showing oxygen bonding on the surface for samples held in air and oxygen, but not in nitrogen.  Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) shows that nitrogen was able to suppress oxidation over a period of several weeks compared to a sample stored in air.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9779], "author_name_tesi": "Brom, Joseph Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Brom", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Nitin Samarth", "Joshua Alexander Robinson", "Suzanne E Mohney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Dissertation Advisor", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Joshua Alexander Robinson, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CVD", "Bi2Se3", "bismuth selenide", "topological insulator"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN TODDLER\u2019S REGULATORY ABILITIES:\nEVIDENCE FOR LINKS AMONG SYSTEMS\n\n\n\n", "id": "9222", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5189", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this study, we explored whether measures of emotion regulation, physiological regulation, and inhibitory control form a global indicator of individual regulation.

Though the periods surrounding Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Russia in 1812 and the Crimean War have been studied in detail, the period between the end of the Crimean War (1856) and the beginning of the Franco-Russian alliance (1894) is rarely or summarily treated.  This time span, however, marked a critical transition in Franco-Russian relations, as well as changes in French national identity as France passed from the Second Empire to the Third Republic.  \n\tThis dissertation is a study of France\u2019s print culture representations of Russia\u2014with Russia functioning as a prism of sorts through which to see France\u2014that bring to light aspects of France\u2019s construction of itself.  This study aims therefore to define how France constructed various notions of itself by examining evidence of cultural relationships between France and Russia during a crucial period for the development of French national identity, the second half of the nineteenth century.  Overarching concepts in the study are the notions of cultural translation, both literal and figurative, as the French encountered Russian culture and attempted to \u201ctranslate\u201d it into a more comprehensible French idiom in words or images, as well as the idea of Russia as a borderland.  \nAmong the types of representations the study considers are Russian literature in translation, French travel literature, French children\u2019s literature set in Russia, advertisements, and caricature.  To explore the varied and changing French perspectives on Russia during the second half of the nineteenth century, I rely on approaches and methods in cultural history and cultural studies (border studies in particular), but also turn to sociology of culture and semiotics. \nThe study\u2019s importance lies primarily in its examination of French constructions of national identity, manifested in a pseudo-colonial discourse that emerged from some French representations of Russia.  The French made assessments about Russia similar to those France formulated about its own colonies.  During a period of rapid expansion of the French colonial empire, this treatment of Russia by the French points to a globalizing colonialist attitude that was not restricted to its colonies, but which pervaded French opinions about other countries with which it came into contact, Russia among them.  However, as France moved towards its alliance with Russia in 1894, this discourse was modified.  After the Second Empire, France looked at Russia increasingly as its partner against a unified Germany and softened its past positions, concentrating on the exotic and enchanting aspects of the country.  The French attitudes towards Russia revealed in print culture elucidate the tensions within France over its own unstable identity at home and in an increasingly divided Europe.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4597], "author_name_tesi": "Brookes, Nanci Christine", "last_name_ssi": "Brookes", "middle_name_ssi": "Christine", "first_name_ssi": "Nanci", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Willa Zahava Silverman", "Vera Mark", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "Adrian Johannes Wanner", "Allan Inlow Stoekl"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Willa Zahava Silverman, Committee Chair", "Vera Mark, Committee Member", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Committee Member", "Adrian Johannes Wanner, Committee Member", "Allan Inlow Stoekl, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["France", "Nineteenth Century", "Franco-Russian relations"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Reagents for Improved Sensitivity in Point-of-Need Diagnostic Assays", "id": "14343adb278", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14343", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Point-of-need diagnostic assays are needed for providing sensitive and rapid measurements in environments where clean water, electricity, refrigeration, instrumentation, and technicians are not available.

We report the structural properties of homoepitaxial (100) SrTiO3 films grown by reactive molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). The lattice spacing and x-ray diffraction (XRD) rocking curves of stoichiometric MBE- grown SrTiO3 films are indistinguishable from the underlying SrTiO3 substrates. The effect of off-stoichiometry for both strontium-rich and strontium-poor compositions results in lattice expansion with significant changes to the shuttered reflection high-energy electron diffraction oscillations, XRD, film microstructure, and thermal conductivity. Up to an 80% reduction in Sr(1+x)TiO3 film thermal conductivity is measured for x = -0.1 to 0.5. Significant reduction, from 11.5 to ~2 W\u22c5m-1K-1, occurs through the formation of Ruddlesden-Popper planar faults. The ability to deposit films with a reduction in thermal conductivity is applicable to thermal barrier coatings and thermoelectrics. Scanning transmission electron microscopy is used to examine the formation of Ruddlesden-Popper planar faults in films with strontium excess. We also show that the band gap of SrTiO3 can be altered by >10% (0.3 eV) by using experimentally realizable biaxial strains providing a new means to accomplish band gap engineering of SrTiO3 and related perovskites. Such band gap manipulation is relevant to applications in solar cells water splitting, transparent conducting oxides, superconductivity, two-dimensional electron liquids, and other emerging oxide electronics.\nThis work also presents the adsorption-controlled growth of single-phase (0001)-oriented epitaxial films of charge ordered multiferroic, LuFe2O4, on (111) MgAl2O4, (111) MgO, and (0001) 6H-SiC substrates in an iron-rich environment at pressures and temperatures where excess iron desorbs from the film surface during growth.

One, how does African-American music function as rhetoric? Two, what happens if black music is posited as central to the discourse of African Americans and Americans in general? Through rhetorical and musical analyses of Scott Joplin, Duke Ellington, John Coltrane, and Mary Lou Williams, I conclude that these artists used their music to provide a profound counterargument to the dehumanization and racial oppression of African Americans. I establish that Joplin used ragtime as a principal tool for articulating the humanity of African Americans and distancing black music from the legacy of minstrelsy. Ellington\u2019s compositions are notable for their clear expression of Afrocentric themes that engage the sonic archive lost to African Americans through the institution of slavery. Coltrane remains one of the most referenced jazz musicians in African-American poetry and prose as a symbol of the aesthetic qualities of Black Nationalism. Moreover, the rhetorical impact of his music suggests ways of understanding the genre of free jazz as constitutive, much like Ellington\u2019s work, of rhetorics of Afrocentrism. Mary Lou Williams, an important, though marginalized, figure in the development of jazz, and her modern gospel-inflected jazz compositions celebrated the role of black music in shaping a sense of collective history while defying the norms surrounding female musicians and the secular confinement of jazz. The rhetorical dimensions of the music from these artists suggest broader ways of recognizing the centrality of black music to African-American rhetorical practices.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15533], "author_name_tesi": "Brooks, Earl Holmes", "last_name_ssi": "Brooks", "middle_name_ssi": "Holmes", "first_name_ssi": "Earl", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Keith Gilyard", "Keith Gilyard", "John \"Jack\" Selzer", "Cheryl Glenn", "Paul C Taylor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Keith Gilyard, Dissertation Advisor", "Keith Gilyard, Committee Chair", "John \"Jack\" Selzer, Committee Member", "Cheryl Glenn, Committee Member", "Paul C Taylor, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rhetoric", "black music", "jazz", "ragtime", "public sphere", "discourse", "Scott Joplin", "Duke Ellington", "John Coltrane", "Mary Lou Williams"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A comprehensive study of the health of farm-raised white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) with emphasis on respiratory tract infection by Fusobacterium spp.\n", "id": "10972", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3127", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "White-tailed deer farming is an established and growing industry in Pennsylvania.  Managers of deer farming operations often struggle with animal health problems, the most common of which is pneumonia associated with Fusobacterium sp. infection.  Fusobacterium is a genus of anaerobic, gram negative, rod-shaped bacteria that have been associated with many infectious disease processes in humans and animals.  It is important to the deer industry, as well as the cattle and sheep industries, to more clearly understand fusobacterial disease pathogenesis and determine effective treatment and prevention strategies.  The objectives of the following series of studies were: 1) to determine the current management practices and animal health problems on white-tailed deer farms in Pennsylvania, 2) to phenotypically and genotypically characterize a set of Fusobacterium isolates from white-tailed deer and evaluate their association with disease in the host, and 3) to determine the pathogenicity of Fusobacterium varium to the respiratory tract of mice and to evaluate this system as a model for pulmonary fusobacterial infection of deer.\n\nIn order to determine the current management practices used by white-tailed deer farms and identify animal health problems in these herds, a self-administered questionnaire was mailed to managers of 235 farms in Pennsylvania that raise white-tailed deer.  Herds ranged in size from 1 to 350 deer.  Land holdings ranged from 0.07 to 607 hectares (0.17 to 1,500 acres).  Stocking density ranged from 0.1 to 118.6 deer/hectare (0.04 to 48 deer/acre).  Most (84%) respondents raised deer for breeding or hunting stock; 13% raised deer exclusively as pets or for hobby purposes, and purpose varied by herd size.  Multiple associations were identified between management or disease factors and herd size.  The use of vaccines, veterinary and diagnostic services, pasture, and artificial insemination increased as herd size increased.  The most common disease conditions in herds of all sizes were respiratory tract disease, diarrhea, parasitism, and sudden death.  The prevalence of respiratory tract disease increased as herd size increased.  Results suggested that many aspects of herd management for white-tailed deer farms in Pennsylvania were associated with herd size, but that regardless of herd size, many preventive medicine practices were improperly used or underused in many herds.\n\nA total of 28 clinical strains of Fusobacterium spp. were isolated at necropsy over a two-year period from the respiratory tract of cervids, including white-tailed deer, elk, and reindeer.  Isolates were identified as F. varium (21/28, 75%), F. necrophorum subsp. funduliforme (5/28, 17.9%), and F. necrophorum subsp. necrophorum (2/28, 7.1%).  Using PCR-based detection of virulence genes, all F. varium isolates were negative for the promoter region of the leukotoxin operon of F. necrophorum and the hemagglutinin-related protein gene of F. necrophorum.  In the necropsy population no significant differences in gross or microscopic lesions were detected across Fusobacterium species, suggesting similar potential for virulence, however, toxicity to bovine polymorphonuclear leukocytes was not observed in any F. varium strains, perhaps indicating that a virulence factor other than leukotoxin is involved in the pathogenesis of F. varium infection.  F. varium was less susceptible to many antimicrobials than were the F. necrophorum subspecies.  These data suggest that F. varium may be a significant pathogen in deer and may require different treatment and prevention methods than F. necrophorum.\n\nC57BL/6 mice and BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with various strains and varying dosages of F. varium to evaluate the pathogenicity of F. varium to the respiratory tract of mice and to determine the utility of this system as model of fusobacterial pneumonia.  Prior to inoculation, mice were pre-treated with either 0.2 mg dexamethasone intraperitoneally once daily for four days, 10 \u00b5g of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of E. coli 055:B5 intranasally one time, or no pre-treatment.   Following inoculation mice were observed for morbidity and mortality for fourteen days.  No mice infected with F. varium showed clinical illness or died.  No mice infected with F. varium developed gross or microscopic lesions.  The bacterium was recovered from the blood of one mouse, but was not recovered from blood or lung of any other mice.  Anti-fusobacterial IgM or IgG were not produced in serum by 14 days in response to infection.  Pre-existing antibodies detected in pooled serum bound similarly with proteins of two F. necrophorum subspecies and three F. varium strains, but did not bind to proteins of similar size from other common bacterial pathogens including Escherichia coli, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, and Clostridium perfringens.  No serum antibodies were detected in BALB/c mice.  These results suggest that F. varium is not highly pathogenic to the respiratory tract of mice, and does not result in a humoral immune response following intranasal inoculation.\n\nIn conclusion, the results of this series of studies suggest that fusobacterial species, specifically F. varium, are not highly pathogenic to the respiratory tract and are unable to establish lung infection alone without some severe predisposing condition.  Management changes on deer farms should be instituted in an effort to minimize stress, overcrowding, nutritional imbalance, and environmental contamination, while maximizing immunity through colostrum and vaccination, and developing effective preventive health and biosecurity programs with routine veterinary consultation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3116], "author_name_tesi": "Brooks, Jason W.", "last_name_ssi": "Brooks", "middle_name_ssi": "W.", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao", "Bhushan M Jayarao", "Arthur Hattel", "Avery August", "Gary San Julian", "Sanjeev Narayanan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao, Dissertation Advisor", "Bhushan M Jayarao, Committee Chair", "Arthur Hattel, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Gary San Julian, Committee Member", "Sanjeev Narayanan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["necrobacillosis", "Odocoileus virginianus", "white-tailed deer", "Fusobacterium varium", "Fusobacterium necrophorum", "pneumonia"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Medea Unmasked: Innokentii Annenskii\u2019s Proto-feminist Translation of Euripides\u2019 Medea ", "id": "23559", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10811", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Scholars have long studied Innokentii Annenskii, the famous but enigmatic Russian Silver Age poet, philologist, and pedagogue.

Beyond Russian literature, however, this thesis has broader applications to literary and classical studies.  Grounding his efforts in perceptive philological analysis, Annenskii produces a deeply interpretive translation, one that prefigures many late-twentieth century readings of Euripides\u2019 play; thus a fresh consideration of various poets\u2019 translations may provide new insight into many literary lights that we think we understand so well, but whose corpora scholars have not given a full consideration.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10421], "author_name_tesi": "Brooks, Jason Kent", "last_name_ssi": "Brooks", "middle_name_ssi": "Kent", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adrian Johannes Wanner", "Adrian Johannes Wanner", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Michael Marion Naydan", "Zoi Stamatopoulou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adrian Johannes Wanner, Dissertation Advisor", "Adrian Johannes Wanner, Committee Chair", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member", "Michael Marion Naydan, Committee Member", "Zoi Stamatopoulou, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["literature", "Russian symbolism", "Annenskii", "classical studies", "Classics", "Euripides", "Medea", "feminism", "feminist", "translation"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "KAFKA GOES TO NEW YORK: READING KAFKA IN SEINFELD'S AMERICA", "id": "15247ljb232", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15247", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation is about authority, respect, and their absurd and meaningless nature as demonstrated through Kafka\u2019s works and the U.S. situation comedy, Seinfeld.

The effects of varying surface conditions on baseball field playing quality have never been documented. The lack of information makes it difficult for field managers to gauge the effects of varying maintenance procedures on the quality of their playing surfaces. The objective of this project was to determine the effects of varying surface conditions on the hardness, traction, and pace of baseball field playing surfaces.\n\nIn order to evaluate baseball field playing surface quality both player-to-surface and ball-to-surface interactions need to be measured. Player-to-surface interactions were evaluated by measuring surface hardness and traction with the Clegg Impact Soil Tester and PENNFOOT, respectively. An instrument, termed Pennbounce, was developed to measure ball-to-surface interactions, such as playing surface pace. \n\nA survey was conducted to document the playing quality of existing baseball fields, and to try to identify the key factors affecting playing quality. Surface hardness was measured using both a Clegg Impact Soil Tester and F-355 apparatus A. Surface pace was measured using Pennbounce. The speed at which the ball traveled after impact with the playing surface represented the pace of the surface. \n\nDifferences in surface hardness and pace were observed on both natural and synthetic turf surfaces. On natural turfgrass surfaces, these differences were attributed to variations in soil moisture content and thatch thickness. On synthetic turf surfaces, variations in playing quality were attributed to differences among synthetic turf products, as well as infill depth. There was less variation in surface pace across a synthetic turf surface compared to the variation across a natural turfgrass surface.\n\nThe infield portion of most baseball fields contains a skinned playing surface. This skinned infield area is a bare soil surface that receives the majority of player traffic. At any given time during a game, three players are standing on turfgrass and five players are standing on this skinned infield area.\n\nIn this survey, the skinned infield mixes of various fields were found to be similar in soil texture, having a consistent ratio of coarse to fine sized soil particles. It was concluded that observed differences in playing quality on skinned infield surfaces were a function of maintenance practices, rather than material properties. \n\nSkinned infield surfaces in this survey were found to be excessively hard, often above the threshold set by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Skinned infields of different moisture contents did not differ in surface pace. Differences in surface pace were thought to be a function of sub-surface soil compaction more than the surface soil moisture content. \n\nSkinned infield and natural turfgrass plots were constructed at the Joseph Valentine Turfgrass Research Center, University Park, PA. These plots represented the range of playing surface conditions measured during the survey phase of this project. Synthetic turf plots that had previously been established at the Joseph Valentine Turfgrass Research Center were also used in this study. \n\nSkinned infield plots were constructed to a depth of 102 mm. Treatments included three levels of compaction, four rates of calcined clay, and three grooming depths. Calcined clay is a porous ceramic amendment commonly applied to skinned areas to improve the aesthetic quality of the surface and to manage soil moisture content. \n\nNatural turfgrass plots were established from sand-based Kentucky bluegrass sod laid over a silt loam soil. Vertical mowing treatments were used to develop three thatch thicknesses. Plots were split with three cutting height treatments.\n\nSix synthetic turf products were evaluated. Previously constructed plots were split to receive two levels of traffic: high traffic and no traffic. Plots receiving the high traffic treatment received 12 simulated football games per week using a Brinkman Traffic Simulator.  After 96 simulated games were applied, plots were groomed to loosen rubber infill granules and to return synthetic fibers to an upright position.\n\nMaterial and human subject tests were used to evaluate the playing quality of the various playing surface treatments across all surface types.  Player-to-surface and ball-to-surface interactions were evaluated using material test measurements of surface hardness, traction, and pace with the Clegg Impact Soil Tester, PENNFOOT, and Pennbounce, respectively. Player-to-surface interactions were also evaluated using human subject tests that measured vertical ground reaction force generated by human subjects equipped with pressure sensitive insoles. Measurements were made while subjects ran and jumped on various playing surfaces. Vertical ground reaction force measurements were correlated to hardness measurements made with a Clegg Impact Soil Tester. \n\nOn natural turfgrass surfaces, neither thatch thickness nor cutting height treatments affected any of the three playing quality parameters evaluated. Plots receiving the reduced cutting height treatment may not have been maintained at low heights of cut long enough to increase tiller density, and subsequently affect playing quality parameters such as traction. A greater range of turfgrass conditions, including various types of rootzones, should be evaluated in future experiments. \n\nOn skinned infield surfaces, increased soil compaction resulted in increases in surface hardness, traction, and pace. The high soil compaction treatment caused surface hardness to increase above the maximum limits determined by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. The deeper grooming treatment reduced the surface hardness and traction of the skinned area, but had no effect on playing surface pace.\n\nApplications of calcined clay to the skinned soil surface minimally affected playing quality in this study. Calcined clay particles on the soil surface changed color following irrigation. Field managers often irrigate three to four times a day in response to this color change. This may not be the most efficient management practice. Minimal differences in soil moisture content were observed among calcined clay treatments in this study. \n\nTraffic significantly affected all components of playing quality on synthetic turf plots. The high traffic treatment increased surface hardness, rotational traction, and pace. Grooming plots tended to reduce rotational traction and surface pace. These reductions may have occurred because the grooming process loosened the rubber infill material in the pile. \n\nThe ball-to-surface interaction was more consistent on synthetic turf plots than natural turfgrass plots. Consistency was determined by measuring the variability in surface pace values within each treatment.  This consistency was observed in data collected during the survey and on research plots. Differences in the consistency in surface pace between brands of synthetic turf may be related to the type of carpet comprising each surface or installation procedures. \n\nVertical ground reaction force measurements with pressure sensitive insoles yielded two conclusions. First, surface hardness (Gmax) standards, designed to minimize injuries from head-to-surface impacts should not be applied in situations where a reduction in injuries from foot-to-surface impacts is desired. Second, material tests do not completely describe the player-to-surface interaction. A relationship between surface hardness and traction was detected in data collected with pressure sensitive insoles. This relationship was not detected in data collected using material test methods such as the Clegg Impact Soil Tester and PENNFOOT. Until a new method is developed, researchers will not be able to determine the lower body injury potential of a surface using current material test methods. Future research is needed to explore this issue in detail and develop material test methods that accurately simulate the player-to-surface interactions occurring in athletics.\n\nLittle research is available on traction values of baseball shoes (cleats) with flat steel studs. In this study, traction values measured on both natural and synthetic turf plots using the Nike Air Zoom Clipper baseball shoe were much higher than what has been reported in other studies using standard football shoes. This difference may be a function of the shape of the studs and their arrangement on the sole of the shoe. Future studies need to investigate this issue in greater detail as these shoes may generate excessive traction on baseball fields.\n\nFew research studies have investigated baseball field playing surface quality. This project was a baseline effort that may lead to additional studies investigating the quality of baseball field playing surfaces. Field managers can use the results of this study to change the surface hardness, traction, and pace of the skinned infield, natural turfgrass, and synthetic turf portions of their baseball fields. Researchers can also use this information to develop new material test methods for evaluating playing quality, as current techniques failed to fully capture the player-to-surface interaction.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3019], "author_name_tesi": "Brosnan, James ", "last_name_ssi": "Brosnan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Scott Mc Nitt", "Daniel Dale Fritton", "Peter Landschoot", "Maxim J Schlossberg", "George F Salvaterra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Scott Mc Nitt, Committee Chair", "Daniel Dale Fritton, Committee Member", "Peter Landschoot, Committee Member", "Maxim J Schlossberg, Committee Member", "George F Salvaterra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["skinned infield", "baseball", "COR", "turfgrass", "synthetic turf", "Fieldturf", "calcined clay", "Pennbounce", "PENNFOOT", "CIST", "F-355"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "PROCESSING, PROPERTIES, AND APPLICATION OF TEXTURED 0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 CERAMICS ", "id": "7451", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3422", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-01-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Textured (1-x)(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3 (PMN-xPT) ceramics obtained by the\ntemplated grain growth (TGG) process possess a significant percentage of the\npiezoelectric properties of the Bridgman grown single crystals with the potential of lower\ncost. In this work, TGG materials with high texture volume (81 %) were developed.\nHighly anisotropic (aspect ratio > 10) SrTiO3 template crystals were aligned by tape\ncasting in a fine, calcined, perovskite PMN-28PT matrix. The processing conditions used\nin this study produced higher quality textured PMN-28PT with a corrected x-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) rocking curve full width half maximum (FWHM) of 7.6\u00a1\u00c6. The textured\nPMN-28PT ceramic had high texture volume (f = 0.81), narrow orientation distribution\n(r = 0.21), and high density (7.8 g/cc, 98% TD).\nUntil recently, characterization of texture in this material had been limited to\nLotgering analysis (a comparison of the relative intensity of XRD peak heights). In\nthis study, XRD and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques were used to\ncharacterize the fiber texture in oriented PMN-28PT and the intensity data were fit with a\ntexture model (the March-Dollase equation) that describes the texture in terms of texture\nfraction (f), and the width of the orientation distribution (r). EBSD analysis confirmed\nthe <001> orientation of the microstructure, with no distinguishable randomly oriented,\nfine grain matrix. Although XRD rocking curve and EBSD data analysis gave similar f\nand r values, XRD rocking curve analysis was the most efficient and gave a complete\ndescription of texture fraction and texture orientation (f = 0.81 and r = 0.21, respectively).\nXRD rocking curve analysis was the preferred approach for characterization of the\ntexture volume and the orientation distribution of texture in fiber-oriented PMN-PT.\nThe dielectric, piezoelectric and electromechanical properties for random ceramic,\n69 vol% textured, 81 vol% textured, and single crystal PMN-28PT were fully\ncharacterized and compared. The room temperature dielectric constant at 1 kHz for\nhighly textured PMN-28PT was \u00a5\u00e5\nr \u00a1\u00c3 3600 with low dielectric loss (tan \u00a5\u00e4 = 0.004).

The\n81 vol% textured PMN-28PT displayed similarly low piezoelectric hysteresis as single\ncrystal PMN-28PT measured by strain-field curves at 5 kV/cm. 81 vol% textured\nPMN-28PT and single crystal PMN-28PT displayed similar mechanical quality factors of\nQM = 74 and 76, respectively. The electromechanical coupling (k33) of 81 vol% textured\nPMN-28PT (k33 = 0.79) was a significant fraction of single crystal (k33 = 0.91) and was\nhigher than a commercial PMN-PT ceramic (k33 ~ 0.74).\nThe nonlinearity of the dielectric and piezoelectric response were investigated in\ntextured ceramics and single crystal PMN-28PT using the Rayleigh approach. The\nreversible piezoelectric coefficient was found to increase significantly and the hysteretic\ncontribution to the piezoelectric coefficient decreased significantly with an increase in\ntexture volume. This indicates that increasing the texture volume decreases the non-180\u00a8\u00ac\ndomain wall contribution to the piezoelectric response in PMN-28PT.\nFinally, 81 vol% textured ceramics were also integrated into a Navy SONAR\ntransducer design.

In addition, an 81 vol% textured PMN-28PT tonpilz\nelement showed large scale linearity in sound pressure levels as a function of drive level\nunder high drive conditions (up to 2.33 kV/cm). The maximum electromechanical\ncoupling obtained by the 81 vol% textured PMN-28PT transducer under high drive\nconditions was keff = 0.69. However, the resonance frequency shifted significantly during\nhigh drive tests (\u00a5\u00c4fs = -19% at 3.7 kV/cm), evidence of a \u00a1\u00b0soft\u00a1\u00b1 characteristic of the\n81 vol% textured PMN-28PT, possibly caused by Sr2+ from the template particles.\nThe results suggest there are limitations on the preload compressive stress (and\nthus drive level) for these textured ceramics, but this could be addressed with\ncompositional modifications.

Some environmental changes occur rapidly, which result in organisms having traits that are mismatched with current conditions, incurring costs. To cope with changing conditions, many organisms exhibit phenotypic flexibility, or the ability to alter phenotypes given the same genotype. In doing so, organisms benefit by altering their phenotype to keep up with their environment. Such flexibility of traits helps to ameliorate costs associated with maintaining or producing traits that are not optimal to current conditions. \n   Environmental variation can be predictable, such as changes that occur seasonally. Animals that utilize different habitats during the breeding and non-breeding season, for example, need to adjust to predictable changes in their environment. Trait flexibility can help these organisms improve their performance in these different environments. If traits carry-over between environments, however, traits providing benefits in one setting might impose costs in the other setting. \n   Other environmental factors can vary unpredictably over short time scales, such as predation threat; an important selective pressure that can shape individuals, populations, and communities. Inducing predator defenses (e.g. chemical or morphological defenses) only when a predator is present can minimize costs of production and maintenance for these traits. Behavioral defenses, such as refuge seeking and alarm signaling, are often driven by an organism\u2019s physiological response to stress. The role of \u201cstress\u201d (including the production of glucocorticoid stress hormones) in driving morphological and chemical responses to predators is poorly understood, and will provide important insight into predator-prey interactions.\n   Here, I explored the flexibility of traits in Eastern Red-spotted Newts (Notophthalmus viridescens viridescens). In Chapter 1, I examine whether tail size in adult newts carries-over from the aquatic (breeding) to the terrestrial (non-breeding) phase, and whether this imposes costs to locomotor performance across environments. I found that tail size did carry-over \u2013 newts with larger tails in the aquatic phase also had larger tails in the terrestrial phase. Larger tails were beneficial in the aquatic phase as they increased swim speed, but did not impede locomotion in the terrestrial phase. \n   In Chapter 2 and 3, I investigate predator-induced morphological (tail size) and chemical defenses (tetrodotoxin, TTX) in larvae and adult Eastern Red-spotted Newts. Larval newts increased tail size in the presence of a predator cue, but did not alter chemical defenses. By contrast, adults showed evidence of chemical but not morphological defense flexibility during the course of the trials. To evaluate the relationships between the stress hormone, corticosterone (CORT), and the production of defensive traits, I validated a water-borne hormone collection technique for adults. A positive relationship between CORT levels and TTX was found, but no relationship was identified between CORT and tail size. \n   Overall, the results of this research reveal the flexibility of traits in shifting environments.  My work has revealed that flexible traits may carry-over between habitats, and further research examining potential costs of this would be informative for understanding the evolution and maintenance of these traits. I found that an organism\u2019s morphological and chemical defenses can be modified, and the degree of flexibility can vary seasonally and across developmental stage. Flexibility of traits can be triggered by predator presence (morphological traits) and may be linked to stress hormone concentrations (chemical defenses). Further exploration into the factors regulating flexible traits will shed light on the evolution of complex life histories and anti-predator defenses. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8788], "author_name_tesi": "Brossman, Kelly Helene", "last_name_ssi": "Brossman", "middle_name_ssi": "Helene", "first_name_ssi": "Kelly", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read", "Robert Brooks", "James Harold Marden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tracy Lee Langkilde, Thesis Advisor", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Brooks, Thesis Advisor", "James Harold Marden, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Eastern Red-spotted Newt", "life history trait", "locomotion", "predator-induced defenses", "stress", "tetrodotoxin"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Toward Multi-proxy Reconstructions of Hydroclimate over the Contiguous United States from A.D. 500 to Present", "id": "26469", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10753", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For the reconstruction of two targets, summer drought (by way of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)) and winter precipitation, gridded instrumental data were calibrated with differing combinations of proxy data that comprised a network.

Three experiments, performed for both targets, modified the Regularized Expectation Maximization (RegEM) algorithm to yield high-skill reconstructions that depict low-frequency variability going back farther in time. Experiment 1 involved the RegEM algorithm regularized by ridge regression and using in the calibration only tree-ring records, which represented a much expanded data-set compared to previous studies. Experiment 2 introduced a new hybrid RegEM method in which the same tree-ring-only proxy data-set as in Experiment 1 was used in the calibration for two sub-reconstructions -- one regularized using ridge regression and the other regularized using truncated total least-squares (TTLS) regression \u2013 that were added together to make a total reconstruction.

However, for reconstructions of that same target that extended farther back in time, the regionalized hybrid RegEM method in which low-frequency records are additionally used in the calibration (Exp. 4) was preferred because it produced reconstructions that depicted low-frequency variability going back in time with moderate to high cross-validation skill though not as high as that realized in some previous work.

A subset of HPVs infect the anogenital tract and are thus agents of sexually transmitted disease (STD). Within this subset are \u201clow risk\u201d types including HPV-6, -11 and -40 that primarily cause warts and \u201chigh risk\u201d types including HPV-16, -18, and -31 which have been shown to induce cell transformations that develop into cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that more than 98% of all cervical cancers contain HPV DNA, and cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide.\n   Upon HPV infection, the virus gains access to the basal layer epithelium through a breach in the mucosal membrane. Following infection of the basal cells, the virus exploits the natural differentiation process of keratinocytes in order to replicate and produce progeny. The mechanism by which HPV infects basal cells at the site of wounding is currently unknown. Various in vitro models indicate that successful infection is the result of HPV binding to heparan sulfate moieties on surface proteins found on basal keratinocytes. Additional research indicates that \u00e16-integrin may act as a secondary receptor for virus entry. In conjunction with these studies, previous research has established a direct binding interaction between HPV-11 virions and the extracellular matrix (ECM) component laminin 5. This ECM component was shown to serve as a transient receptor for HPV-11 entry into cells in culture. As a result of these studies, an alternate model of natural infection is proposed in which virions first bind to laminin 5 and then utilize this binding interaction to target basal keratinocytes migrating to the site of wounding.\n   These various binding studies indicate that multiple virus attachment and entry mechanisms may be utilized by papillomaviruses. The general objective of this thesis is to gain insight into specific binding interactions that occur between different HPV types and the host cell or ECM during the attachment phase of the virus life-cycle. This main objective was pursued using virus-like particle (VLP) technology in conjunction with monolayer cells and various blocking reagents.\n   Immunofluorescence studies looking at the binding pattern of various HPV types on fixed HaCaT cells and ECM revealed that different HPV types bind to the cell and ECM associated receptors with different affinities. HPV-6, -11 and -40 VLPs bind preferentially to the ECM component laminin 5, whereas HPV-16, -31, and -58 bind strongly to both the apical cell surface receptor and ECM component(s). Antibody and heparin blocking studies revealed that HPV utilizes different types of receptors for attachment to cells and ECM. Some virus types preferentially bind to a single receptor molecule whereas other virus types have evolved dual binding capabilities in order to ensure attachment. By determining the critical steps involved in HPV entry, we will gain a better understanding of the various virus-host cell interactions utilized for successful infection and this research can further translate into designing better drug targets for treatment.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6264], "author_name_tesi": "Broutian, Tatevik Rafik", "last_name_ssi": "Broutian", "middle_name_ssi": "Rafik", "first_name_ssi": "Tatevik", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil David Christensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neil David Christensen, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["binding", "human papillomavirus", "receptors", "entry"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Experimental Investigation of a Rotor Icing Model with Shedding", "id": "10579", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1892", "abstract_tesi": "A critical operational problem for rotorcraft is flight in adverse weather conditions.  Flight in icing conditions is fraught with operational hazards, including reduced vehicle performance and degraded handling qualities.  Additionally, shedding of ice from blades due to centrifugal force poses a ballistics danger to the aircraft and creates large vibrations due to imbalanced rotors.  Modeling the effects of accreted ice on rotorcraft flight performance has been a challenge due to the complexities of periodically changing conditions as well as spanwise variations of angle of attack, velocities and surface temperatures.  Model validation has been complicated by the lack of available data due to the existence of only a few facilities designed to study the rotorcraft aspect of the icing problem.  \n\nAs part of the development of the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand (AERTS), a new icing model was developed to predict ice shapes on a hovering rotor.  The AERTS Rotor Icing, Shedding and Performance (ARISP) model has the goal of exploring rotor icing trends.  The core feature of the model is the coupling with NASA\u2019s LEWis ICE accretion code (LEWICE).  Rotor performance is predicted with a blade element momentum theory module, while increases in rotor torque due to ice accretions are empirically calculated.  A shedding module predicts the shedding time and blade station based upon the accreted ice properties.  The ARISP model was correlated with published ice shapes for both small-scale and full-scale rotor ice accretion results.\n\nFurther correlations were made with experiments in the newly developed Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand (AERTS).  These experiments constitute the first ice shape comparisons in the test stand.  A total of 44 test cases were completed, of which the first 23 were designed to explore the limitations of the AERTS facility.  The remaining 21 cases formed the test matrix for the ARISP model validation and were designed to investigate the influence of various icing parameters.  Favorable comparisons have been made between ice shape, especially at inboard stations.  Primary ice shape features were predicted well for over 81% of the experimental ice tracings.  The largest discrepancies occurred at test cases that did not lie within the FAR Part 25/29 Appendix C icing envelope.  Impingement limits were modeled well, with the discrepancies between the limit calculations and experimental values generally lower than 20%.  Torque rise predications were generally within 20% of experimental values.  Shedding behavior was also evaluated, but correction factors were required to improve test data correlation due to the general overprediction of tip ice accretions.  These correction factors were derived from the difference in ice shape between predictions and experiments and reduced prediction error in shedding time to 25% and shedding station to 8%.  Further investigations are required, but the icing model has laid the foundation for future research in the AERTS Facility.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1875], "author_name_tesi": "Brouwers, Edward William", "last_name_ssi": "Brouwers", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Edward", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Smith", "Edward Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Edward Smith, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rotorcraft", "icing", "Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand", "AERTS", "LEWICE", "shedding", "ice accretion", "impingment limits", "torque degradation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE ROLE AND REGULATION OF APICAL SPECTRINS IN CELL POLARITY, TRAFFICKING, GROWTH, AND CORTICAL TENSION IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER", "id": "13804kcb179", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13804", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Spectrins are long, rope-like proteins that form heterotetramers of two  and two  chains. These heterotetramers crosslink F-actin in the cell to form a structural network call the Spectrin-Based Membrane Skeleton (SBMS). In Drosophila melanogaster, there are three genes that encode spectrins: alpha-spec (encoding alpha-spectrin), \u03b2-spec (encoding conventional \u03b2-spectrin), and karst (encoding \u03b2H\u2011spectrin; \u03b2H) (Moorthy et al., 2000; Thomas and Williams, 1999; Bennett and Baines, 2001; Bennett and Healy; 2008). The SBMS is not only important for maintaining cell structure, but also plays roles in cell polarity, membrane trafficking, cell growth, and cortical tension. This dissertation reports two major studies involving the role of spectrin in polarity, trafficking, and growth (Chapter 2) and cortical tension (Chapter 3).\n\u03b2H is apically localized in epithelial cells and interacts with many protein partners that contribute to its diverse functions (outlined in Chapter 1). One of these interactions is with the apical determinant Crumbs (Crb) to regulate apical membrane size. \u03b2H is also required for correct endosomal trafficking to and at the multivesicular body (MVB) and in recycling of proteins to the plasma membrane. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, a subunit of Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was shown to directly interact with \u03b2H. PP2A is a family of serine/threonine phosphatases involved in many important cellular events. This heterotrimeric protein is comprised of a catalytic (C) subunit and structural (A) subunit. The third, variable regulatory B subunit, determines the substrate specificity, localization, and catalytic activity of the PP2A enzyme.\nChapter 2 presents data demonstrating that PP2A-PR72 (a regulatory B subunit) is involved in modulating both the \u03b2H/Crb complex during apical pole establishment/maintenance, and endomembrane trafficking. PP2A-PR72 knockdown flies exhibit an elevated number of late endosomal compartments when stained for the late endosome marker Rab7 and an accumulation of acidic compartments when stained with LysoSensor. In addition, \u03b2H becomes internalized and localizes to Hrs positive MVB. This suggests that PP2A-PR72 normally down regulates lysosomal trafficking, encouraging protein recycling as previously hypothesized for the action of \u03b2H and its molecular partner Annexin B9 (Tjota et al., 2009). \nAn extensive series of genetic interaction experiments using various Crb, aPKC, and Hippo pathway constructs in conjunction with PP2A-PR72 knockdown and overexpression, and immunostaining in larval salivary glands, suggests that PP2A-PR72 negatively regulates Crb activity, specifically in its regulation of the Hippo/Warts pathway via Expanded. When overexpressing PP2A-PR72 in adult wings there is a significant size increase compared to wild-type or PP2A-PR72 knockdown consistent with Hippo downregulation. Also, genetic interaction experiments with Yorkie/PP2A-PR72 co-overexpression suggest that PP2A-PR72 negatively regulates the Hippo/Warts pathway. The interaction seen is strikingly similar to the PP2A-PR72 interaction with Crb, suggesting that PP2A-PR72 modulates Crb well documented cross-regulation of the Hippo/Warts pathway.\nBeyond spectrin\u2019s roles in polarity, trafficking, and growth, the SBMS is constantly adapting to changes in cell shape during epithelial morphogenesis. It does so, in part, by reversible folding and unfolding of spectrin repeats. The unfolding force required for repeat unfolding is low at a range of 25-35 pN. A FRET based strain sensor inserted within an alpha-spectrin repeat was used to observe and measure tension in the spectrin network in the terminal web of the gut epithelia and in apically contracting cells during embryogenesis (Chapter 3). This strain sensor confirmed that spectrin is experiencing tension in actively contracting cells. Upon ablation this tension is relieved in step with recoil of the tissue, and spectrin network tension returns during wound repair, specifically as it accumulates around the leading edge of the wound. The actomoyosin network also accumulates at this site suggesting a collaboration with the SBMS. Myosin-II and alpha-spectrin do co-localize within cells known to be actively contracting during embryogenesis supporting this collaboration. Live imaging experiments are on-going to confirm the connection between the SBMS and actomyosin network. \nChapter 4 contains a comprehensive model extending known information in the literature in Chapter 1 with data presented in Chapters 2 and 3 of \u03b2H roles in polarity, trafficking, growth, and cortical tension as it relates to Crb trafficking. A step-by-step approach is used to explain the order of events as well as several hypotheses for PP2A-PR72 regulation in early stages of endocytosis and growth.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13992], "author_name_tesi": "Browder, Kristen Cherie", "last_name_ssi": "Browder", "middle_name_ssi": "Cherie", "first_name_ssi": "Kristen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Graham H.

Specifically, we introduce pixel efficiency analysis, with the associated measures of pixel efficiency value and conversion efficiency value, as a web analytic approach for evaluating potential website changes. Pixel efficiency analysis is the practice of relating screen real estate measured in pixels to the achievement of organizational goals and key performance indicators as indicated by quantifiable user behavioral interactions on a webpage. We employ both the concept and measures through a case study focusing on high traffic webpages of an academic library website for a major research university. An overarching web analytics investigation in combination with pixel efficiency analysis of four of the library\u2019s major webpages identifies the key areas of improvement in regards to real estate usage and provides quantifying numbers to support the improvement. Based on these results, we investigate changes to each of the four pages utilizing A/B testing of tens of thousands of library patrons and the measurements of pixel efficiency value and conversion efficiency value to examine the effect on user behaviour, demonstrating the value of pixel efficiency analysis. Our research findings show the capability of pixel efficiency analysis to provide insight not delivered by existing web analytics approaches for academic libraries.

The proposed technique is an extension of the multistatic polarization ratio technique that has been developed by prior students at the Penn State Lidar Lab to include multiple wavelengths.  This approach uses the ratio of polarized components of the scattering phase functions at multiple wavelengths across the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum to extract the microphysical and optical properties of aerosols.  The scattering intensities at each wavelength are vertically separated across the face of the imager using a transmission diffraction grating, so that scattering intensities for multiple wavelengths at many angles are available for analysis in a single image.  The ratio of the scattering phase function intensities collected using parallel and perpendicular polarized light are formed for each wavelength and analysis of the ratio is used to determine the microphysical properties of the aerosols. \nOne contribution of the present work is the development of an inversion technique based on a genetic algorithm that retrieves lognormal size distributions from scattering measurements by minimizing the squared error between measured polarization ratios and polarization ratios calculated using the Mie solution to Maxwell\u2019s equations.  The opportunities and limitations of using the polarization ratio are explored, and a genetic algorithm is developed to retrieve single mode and trimodal lognormal size distributions from multiwavelength, angular scattering data.  The algorithm is designed to evaluate particles in the diameter size range of 2 nm to 60 \u00b5m, and uses 1,000 linear spaced diameters within this range to compute the modeled polarization ratio.  The algorithm returns geometric mean radii and geometric standard deviations within 2% of the correct value when inverting a single lognormal probability size distribution from simulated polarization ratios that include random Gaussian noise added to limit the signal-to-noise ratio to 25.  The genetic algorithm performed reasonably well when retrieving results using a single complex refractive index for all three wavelengths while finding the lognormal particle size parameters.  Three inversion runs of the algorithm on simulated noisy data showed that the algorithm could retrieved a trimodal size distribution and a single complex refractive index that produced a very good fit between the simulated noisy polarization ratios and the forward-calculated polarization ratios.\nA significant contribution of the present work is a set of tests conducted at the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Aerosol Test Facility (ATF), which is a controlled environment, where direct measurements of the size distribution and concentration of the scattering volume are available.  The aerosol size distribution results obtained from inversion of the measured scattering phase functions, a lognormal size distribution with a geometric mean diameter of ~450 nm and a geometric standard deviation of ~1.3, compare favorably with measurements from an aerodynamic particle sizer and a condensation particle counter.  This is one of the first large scale experiments where a comparison between multistatic inversion results and known properties of the interrogated volume of aerosols are made under controlled conditions.\nThe eventual goal is to develop a prototype sensor and an analysis approach to provide an important and useful tool to better define the atmospheric aerosol properties.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [303], "author_name_tesi": "Brown, Andrea Michelle", "last_name_ssi": "Brown", "middle_name_ssi": "Michelle", "first_name_ssi": "Andrea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Russell Philbrick", "C Russell Philbrick", "Julio Urbina", "Zhiwen Liu", "Anne Mee Thompson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Russell Philbrick, Dissertation Advisor", "C Russell Philbrick, Committee Chair", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Anne Mee Thompson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["optical scattering", "multistatic lidar", "aerosol characterization", "multiwavelength lidar"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "AN ENGINEERING APPROACH TO PERL AND RUBY\nOBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES\n\n\n\n", "id": "12610", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "258", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study compares two object oriented programming languages, Perl and Ruby.

In this project, I analyze depictions of King Arthur and his court in the few Old French chansons de geste, or epic poems, in which this romance figure appears. I contend the Arthurian episodes in these chansons de geste complicate generic categorization of medieval texts by introducing an ostensibly long deceased King Arthur, who rules the otherworldly Avalon, into an alternative narrative form. I argue that Arthurian intrusions into the epic genre disrupt the Crusade era\u2019s Christian-Muslim dichotomy by presenting Arthur\u2019s court as a space existing outside conventional geographical or chronological boundaries. As a result, I demonstrate how the Arthurian episodes link these texts into a single cycle. Distinct episodes that I term \u201cArthurian interludes\u201d introduce Arthur and his court into this alternative narrative form through a three-fold process. First, the epic poets reduce the Arthurian world to a selection of customs, and romance motifs well known to medieval audiences. They then blend these Arthurian elements with epic personages and places, reusing them to create a hybrid space in which Arthur tests the epic hero and his knightly merits. The characters of Arthur and Morgan the Fay in particular are borrowed from the romance genre and inserted into the chansons de geste, through the phenomenon of interfigurality. Often interrupting the Christian knight\u2019s efforts to defeat his Muslim enemies, this episode at Arthur\u2019s castle in Avalon, which later comes to be known as F\u00e9erie, empowers him to achieve his mission. The seven chansons de geste that include these Arthurian episodes, all written during a period of roughly 150 years, build on one another by recycling these motifs, and develop a parallel Arthurian legend steeped in the epic ethos. Through my analysis of these texts, I have determined that the chansons de geste containing episodes at King Arthur\u2019s court constitute a cycle of Arthurian-inspired epics.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10532], "author_name_tesi": "Brown, Brandy Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Brown", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Brandy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Norris Joiner Lacy", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "Jennifer Boittin", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Norris Joiner Lacy, Dissertation Advisor", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Committee Member", "Jennifer Boittin, Committee Member", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["French", "medieval", "literature", "Arthurian"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "More Than Just Hair Talk: The Kinks, Curls AND Dueling Feminisms in YouTube\u2019s Natural Hair Community", "id": "21239", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9817", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Naptural85, BeautfulBrwnBabyDol, MyNaturalSistas, MahoganyCurls, HairCrush; these are five of just a few of the thousands of Black natural hair channels on YouTube.

The ice shapes were accreted in the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand (AERTS) at Pennsylvania State University, and digitized to provide 2D slices of the iced blade. Hybrid, viscous sub-layer resolved grids were created in order to capture these ice features. Several sub-layer turbulence models were applied. For 2D cases, drag predictions obtained with the NPHASE-PSU Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code compare favorably with drag data from several data sources including the AERTS experimental facility. Iced airfoil drag is primarily due to form drag associated with the bluff effective leading edge ice shapes, effects which are well captured. However, predicted lift values deviate signi\fcantly from the experimental data at high angles-of-attack, consistently underpredicting stall onset and high-alpha-lift. Parametric exploration of the causes of these discrepancies was pursued. Specifcally, experiments performed in NASA Glenn's Icing Research Tunnel on two additional airfoil geometries with accreted glaze ice shapes were modeled. These studies show that 2D RANS turbulence modeling consistently leads to this same inaccurate lift prediction behavior, and that this observation is consistent with other studies that have appeared in the literature. These shortcomings are hypothesized to arise due to the well known challenges that 2D RANS turbulence models have in adverse pressure gradient flows, stagnating flows, and flows with strong curvature and also due to the inherent three-dimensionality of the ice shape and the unsteady recirculation regions aft of the sharp ice shape separation points. In order to explore the role of 3D and unsteady flow effects, a CT scan of one of the full 3D AERTS ice molds was used to create a large 3D grid.

As commodities, oil and gas play important roles in both US and worldwide markets and are often viewed as critical economic drivers and assessment tools of the marketplace. Even though almost all local communities are in some way dependent upon oil and gas resources, there are many variables that contribute to the uncertainty of these commodities such as exploitation dynamics (e.g. technological, production, and cost factors), international law and trade factors, and local legislation factors (national and below). Factors such as these can make venture investment risky. The market, being dynamic, can quickly create constraints for new ventures and are often difficult to predict. The decline of oil and gas prices over the past year has jeopardized newer oil and gas technologies that rely on higher commodity prices to maintain a profit. The newly developed plays of the Marcellus and Utica Shales are examples of this phenomena. Oil and gas are limited resources; therefore, the price will continue to climb at some point. However, in the short run as prices fluctuate, companies will enter and exit based on technology and commodity price. This same phenomenon occurs in traditional mining with both the resources and technology. Traditional mining is much older than oil/gas mining and the technological growth has not been quite as rapid. Resources, however, are becoming more difficult to exploit as they are also limited. Many of the concentrated resources currently mined will at some time transition to a cut-off value too low for traditional mining methods to be used. Alternatives to traditional mining are already being developed and studied in an effort to mitigate the mentioned future issues of limited high grade ore. Both traditionally mined and oil and gas commodities attempt to maximize the resources available within the respective reserves. This thesis explores the potential of utilizing oil and gas resources to their fullest extent. Additional revenue that can be made from an oil or gas well will help mitigate risks associated with development and investment. Developing technologies to build on already available infrastructures will also potentially mitigate substantial investment costs for subsidiary technologies as well as ancillary environmental issues.

Characterization of minor atmospheric constituents, biological hazards, and chemical plumes containing multiple species is difficult when using current approaches because of weak signatures and the use of a limited number of wavelengths used for identification.  Current broadband systems such as Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) have either limitations for long-range propagation, or require transmitter power levels that are unsafe for operation in urban environments.  Passive hyperspectral imaging systems that utilize absorption of solar scatter at visible and infrared wavelengths, or use absorption of  background thermal emission, have been employed routinely for detection of airborne chemical species.  Passive approaches have operational limitations at various ranges, or under adverse atmospheric conditions because the source intensity and spectrum is often an unknown variable. \n\nThe work presented here describes a measurement approach that uses a known source of a low transmitted power level for an active system, while retaining the benefits of broadband and extremely long-path absorption operations.  An optimized passive imaging system also is described that operates in the 3 to 4 &#956;m window of the mid-infrared. Such active and passive instruments can be configured to optimize the detection of several hydrocarbon gases, as well as many other species of interest.\n\nMeasurements have provided the incentive to develop algorithms for the calculations of atmospheric species concentrations using multiple wavelengths.

Six herds with Normande crossbreds were visited once each during January, May, August, and October during 2011 to represent different seasons.  Milk production and pedigree information was collected for all herds.  One herd in Minnesota also provided pedigree and milk production information, but no BCS information.  Cattle from one herd with Normande crossbreds provided blood for DNA extraction and telomere length analysis. Purebred Holsteins from the Penn State dairy research center, crossbred and purebred beef animals from the Penn State beef research center and a commercial Pennsylvania beef farm also provided blood for telomere length analysis.  \n   Multiple trait mixed-models were used to analyze BCS, milk yield, fat yield and percentage, protein yield and percentage, somatic cell score, and calving interval among Normande crossbreds and their herd mates sired by Ayrshire, Holstein, Jersey and other breeds.  Normande sired cattle had greater body condition than animals sired by Ayrshires, Holsteins, Jerseys and other breeds.  Daily milk yield, fat yield, and protein yield were all influenced by season in herds that utilized greater amounts of pasture and were lowest during the summer months of July through August.\n   Normande cattle were able to mobilize more body reserves during the summer season, when pasture growth was expected to be low, than cows sired by other breeds; however, differences with Ayrshire, Holstein, and Jersey sired cattle were not significant.  Decreases in fat yield were lower for Normande (-0.08 kg/d) during the summer months when compared to Holstein sired animals (-0.11 kg/d). Cows sired by bulls of unknown origin, crossbred sires, or breeds other than Ayrshire, Holstein, Jersey or Normande had larger declines in milk, fat and protein yield during summer months in grazing herds. This reinforces the need to use proven sires, even in grazing systems that incorporate crossbreeding.\nMixed models were used to estimate telomere length for individual animals, herd, and breeds.  Dairy and beef cows were evaluated separately because there was no breed overlap between herds to facilitate evaluation of breed versus herd effects. Herd was highly significant within both beef and dairy analyses (P< 0.001). There was a significant decline in telomere length as age increased in dairy cattle (P<0.05), but the decline was not significant for beef cattle (P>0.05). Adding breed to the model was not significant for dairy (P = 0.71) or beef (P = 0.92) animals, indicating that there was no difference in telomere length between crossbred and purebred animals. Results suggested wide variation among animals in telomere length at any given age. There was no evidence that longer telomere length explained the improved survivability reported for crossbred dairy cattle. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7776], "author_name_tesi": "Brown, Dustin Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Brown", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Dustin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chad Daniel Dechow", "Wansheng Liu", "Kevin John Harvatine", "Kathy Jo Soder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chad Daniel Dechow, Thesis Advisor", "Wansheng Liu, Thesis Advisor", "Kevin John Harvatine, Thesis Advisor", "Kathy Jo Soder, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Crossbreeding", "Telomere", "Normande", "Grazing", "Body Condition Score"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Study in the Design of an Accelerated Wear Tester that is Compatible with a Particle Image Velocimetry and High Speed Camera Setup", "id": "26618", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11704", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States.  A subset of CVD affects the valves of the heart (HVD).  Due to the aging population's susceptibility to HVD, it is a growing concern.  Heart valve replacement is often necessary if the valve is beyond repair.  There are two main categories of artificial heart valves that can be used for a replacement, mechanical and bioprosthetic.  Although there have been many advances in artificial heart valve technology, there are still many problems that need to be addressed.  One major problem for bioprosthetic heart valves is deterioration .  This study aims to design an accelerated wear tester (AWT) that is compatible with a particle image velocimetry and high speed camera set up so that bioprosthetic heart valve deterioration can be studied at an accelerated rate.  By using SolidWorks, a single chamber AWT was designed and its materials were modeled to determine if it could withstand the stresses of testing a heart valve at an accelerated rate.  The design of the AWT needed to be able to meet FDA requirements for in vitro bioprosthetic heart valve testing.  Simulations were run to determine if the AWT could test a bioprosthetic heart valve over 200 million open and close cycles, having the valve fully open and close during each cycle, while maintaining a minimum average transvalvular pressure of 100 mmHg during valve closure.  Based on the initial tests, the AWT\u2019s acrylic walls underwent loading stresses of 0.99  MPa, which is much smaller than  acrylic\u2019s fatigue life of 38 MPa.  This means that the flow chamber walls will not break or crack while testing the heart valve over the valve's entire life span.  The pressures induced by the AWT\u2019s piston motor during its down-stroke (~135 mmHg) and its up-stroke (~ -120 mmHg) were large enough to fully open and close the valve during each heart beat.  The piston\u2019s up-stroke created a transvalvular pressure drop of 120 mmHg during valve closure, proving that the AWT will be able to meet all the FDA requirements for testing bioprosthetic heart valves.

In turn, public opinion can affect public policy and other decisions made in a community (Dearing & Rogers, 1996; Jordan & Page, 1992). This study examined how newspapers in Pennsylvania portrayed issues related to Marcellus Shale gas drilling and development. The theories of agenda-setting and framing were used. \n\nObjective newspaper articles from newspapers in Pennsylvania written between the years 2008-2012 that discuss Marcellus Shale gas drilling and development were evaluated for any differences in frames and topics from year-to-year, between regions in Pennsylvania, and between mainstream media and agriculture media. The top ten topics discussed, the most common benefits and risks, the way the Marcellus Shale industry is portrayed in newspaper articles also were analyzed.

Further research should examine the public opinion on Marcellus Shale drilling and development to see if there is a connection between opinion and issues related to drilling and development presented in the media, similar to the McCombs & Shaw (1972) study in Chapel Hill, which found a correlation between information presented in the media about political issues and public opinion.

The well exposed and well-defined sequence stratigraphic framework of the fossiliferous Middle Permian San Andres Formation within Last Chance Canyon provides an opportunity to test these controls. This study examines the fossiliferous shell beds of the San Andres Formation in Last Chance Canyon through two depositional sequences about 180 m in thickness across approximately 700 meters along depositional dip to characterize the distribution and accumulation of fossil material. Major changes in biofacies from molluscan dominated assemblages in a channelized pelloidal sandstone to brachiopod-sponge-echinoid dominated assemblages in a heavily bioturbated sandstone occur at the maximum flooding surface. In addition, high density shell beds accumulated near the maximum flooding surface. While this implies the sedimentation rates are influencing the abundance of these fossiliferous beds, sedimentary structures indicate transport is the dominant factor within these facies. An additional biofacies and shell density change from brachiopod-sponge dominated sandstones to very dense Parafusulina dominated carbonates occurs within the depositional sequence. However, no major stratigraphic surfaces were observed at this transition, most likely indicating a shift in environments favorable to Parafusulina.

The Dominican population is a mix of Spanish, African, and Indigenous cultures; however, the African heritage is often overlooked. This thesis combines historical aspects of Dominican culture and identity with Dominican media analysis to investigate the notion of the rejection of African heritage within the culture. A significant premise in this body of research incorporates the theories of colorism, postcolonial theory, contingent self-esteem theory, and African self-consciousness. \nPrior research has explored Dominican identity, but few studies have explored the influence of advertisements on their identity. Additionally, few studies have explored media influences on Dominicans\u2019 association with their African heritage. This study evaluates the influences of model images in print ads on Dominican women and their identity. The study combines the theories to test and examine the correlation between print ads and Dominicans\u2019 level of African self-consciousness. \nThe study was administered in the Dominican Republic as opposed to the United States because the social contexts of the two are very different. The United States has different racial tensions from the Dominican Republic. Twenty-eight female, Dominican university students participated in focus groups during which they completed questionnaires, viewed and discussed beauty advertisements of a Dominican magazine, Pandora. Four main themes emerged from the discussions: real versus commercial beauty, authenticity, self-critique and unattainable beauty, \u2018mestizaje,\u2019and Haitian relations. The participants acknowledged they are a mix of European (Spanish), African, and Indian but seem to prefer to associate primarily with their Indian roots. Most of the beauty advertisements were of very fair models and did not reflect the discussants. The images in the magazines, which are supposed to represent beauty, are disconnected from the real images of a Dominican woman, which can impress not only identity conflicts but also impose esteem issues. \nIt is hoped that results from this study will not only offer further insight into issues pertinent to the Dominican identity, but also be applied to advertising practices, especially those that are ethnic-specific. Advertisers have responsibility to properly represent the cultures to which they promote products. \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2449], "author_name_tesi": "Brown, India Latina", "last_name_ssi": "Brown", "middle_name_ssi": "Latina", "first_name_ssi": "India", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Media Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Olorunnisola", "Anthony Olorunnisola"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Olorunnisola, Thesis Advisor", "Anthony Olorunnisola, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["women", "dominican republic", "beauty", "enthnography", "blackness", "media representation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Religious Identity and Language Shift among Amish-Mennonites in Kishacoquillas Valley, Pennsylvania\n\n", "id": "12212", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "2958", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation provides an analysis of religious identity and language behavior in an Anabaptist settlement in central Pennsylvania.  Kishacoquillas \u201cBig\u201d Valley, Pennsylvania is home to a variety of Anabaptist congregations ranging from conservative Old Order Amish to progressive Mennonites.  Uniquely, each of these congregations traces its lineage to a shared Amish beginning in the late eighteenth century.  Due to the geographic location within a narrow and level valley, congregations began to construct ethnoreligious identities, which not only defined themselves, but separated them from other congregations.  As a result, differing interpretations of the traditional Anabaptist tenet of \u201cseparation from the world\u201d emerged.  Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century, a group wishing to pursue more progressive changes chose to adopt meetinghouses for worship and less conservative hair and dress styles.  They soon adopted a hyphenated religious identity as Amish-Mennonites \u2013 binding them to their Amish roots, but pronouncing their more progressive Mennonite aspirations.  By the 1930s, these congregations ceased using Pennsylvania Dutch for the in-group and archaic German for worship.  Today they identify only as Mennonites and Pennsylvania Dutch ceases to be a marker for their new religious \u2013 and less exclusive or sectarian \u2013 identity.  \n\nA second group, similarly arising from Amish origins in 1911, currently identifies as Amish-Mennonite.  This group has adopted similar religious goals as the first group, especially Sunday school, mission work, and evangelism.  They are currently undergoing language shift with only a thirty-minute German-language hymn sing in the more conservative of the two congregations remaining.\n\nBy relying on an oral history interview project, participant observation, and sociohistorical sources, this dissertation examines the changing ethnoreligious identities of the two groups.  Employing Le Page and Tabouret-Keller\u2019s (1985) early assertions that language acts are acts of identity, the language behavior of each group is analyzed as part of their changing expressions of religious identity.  Further, the religious identities of residents of Big Valley are viewed from a poststructural perspective: their identities are both multiple and dynamic.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2951], "author_name_tesi": "Brown, Joshua R.", "last_name_ssi": "Brown", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Carrie Neal Jackson", "Michael Travis Putnam", "John Lipski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barry Richard Page Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Chair", "Carrie Neal Jackson, Committee Member", "Michael Travis Putnam, Committee Member", "John Lipski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Anabaptist", "Amish-Mennonite", "religious identity", "sectarian", "language shift"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "LABORATORY AND FIELD-SCALE OBSERVATIONS OF FERROUS IRON OXIDATION AND FERRIC IRON PRECIPITATION AT AN ACID MINE DRAINAGE SITE\n", "id": "10679", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2674", "abstract_tesi": "The first study (Chapter 2) analyzed the aqueous chemistry, mineral precipitates, microbial communities, and Fe(II) oxidation rates at an acid mine drainage (AMD) site in the context of a depositional facies model.  Both pool and terrace facies at upstream and downstream locations were studied.  Fe(III) precipitates were determined to be schwertmannite with pin-cushion morphology at all locations, regardless of facie.  Microbial community composition was studied with 16s rDNA cloning and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and found to transition from a Betaproteobacteria and Euglena dominated environment at the AMD spring to an Acidithiobacillus dominated environment downstream, as pH decreased.  Microbial composition at adjacent pool and terraces was similar; thus, microbial community structure was more strongly a function of pH and other geochemical conditions rather than depositional facie.  Intact pieces of terrace and pool sediments from upstream and downstream locations were used in laboratory reactors to measure rates of low-pH Fe(II) oxidation at variable residence times (2-10 h).  Rates of Fe(II) oxidation were normalized to mass and surface-area.  Mass-normalized oxidation rates ranged from 0.74 to 10.4 x 10-9 mol Fe L-1 s-1 g-1 and rates were faster for pool sediments compared to terrace sediments.  Surface-area normalized rates ranged from 0.63 to 1.75 x 10-9 mol Fe L-1 s-1 cm-2 and the faster rates were also associated with pool sediments. Upstream sediments were also more efficient at Fe(II) oxidation than downstream sediments, regardless of facie, suggesting that Fe(II) oxidation rates were also dependent upon biogeochemical conditions, not solely the depositional facies environment.  Sediments were irradiated with 60Co and analyzed again to determine abiotic Fe(II) oxidation rates.  No change in Fe(II) concentration was observed for sterilized sediments, indicating that all Fe(II) oxidation was a result of biological activity.  A depositional facies model explained some differences in Fe(II) oxidation kinetics, but this model could not explain differences in water chemistry, mineral composition, crystal morphology, or microbial community composition. \nIn the second study (Chapter 3), three low-pH coal mine drainage (CMD) sites in central Pennsylvania (Lower Red Eyes, Fridays-2, and Hughes Borehole) were studied to determine similarities in sediment composition, mineralogy, and morphology.  Water from one site (Lower Red Eyes) was used in a discontinuous titration/neutralization experiment to produce Fe(III) minerals by abiotic neutralization/precipitation for comparison with the field precipitates that were produced by biological low-pH Fe(II) oxidation.  Sediments were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS).  Even though the hydrology and chemistry of the CMD varied considerably between the three field sites, the mineralogy of the three iron mounds was found to be very similar.  Schwertmannite was found to be the predominant mineral phase precipitated at low-pH with traces of goethite at some sampling locations.  Schwertmannite particles occurred as micron sized spheroids with characteristic \u201cpin-cushion\u201d morphology at all sites.  No trace metal incorporation was detected in sediments from the field, and no metals (other than Fe) were removed from the CMD at any of the field sites.  Minerals formed by abiotic neutralization/precipitation (pH 5.18 \u2013 8.34) were also found to consist primarily of schwertmannite.  In contrast to low-pH precipitation, substantial trace metal removal occurred in the neutralized CMD, the subsequent precipitates were found to contain Al, and schwertmannite morphology changed dramatically.  While secondary minerals such as schwertmannite essentially store some of the emergent acidity from CMD sources, this mineral may be of industrial value because, at least when precipitated at low-pH, it does not contain trace metal contaminants.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2669], "author_name_tesi": "Brown, Juliana F.", "last_name_ssi": "Brown", "middle_name_ssi": "F.", "first_name_ssi": "Juliana", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bill Burgos", "William D Burgos"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bill Burgos, Thesis Advisor", "William D Burgos, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["low-pH Fe(II) oxidation", "acid mine drainage", "schwertmannite"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Early Compositional Education of Sergey Prokofiev:  A Survey of Pedagogy, Aesthetics, and Influence", "id": "21257", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9888", "abstract_tesi": "As the creative mind behind Peter and the Wolf\u2014perhaps the most time-tested childhood staple from the world of orchestral music\u2014Sergey Prokofiev has touched the musical experiences of children across the world for generations.

I take up these questions across analyses of three episodes when public memories of civil rights in Greensboro have been contested. These case studies demonstrate that Greensboro\u2019s progressive regional identity is maintained through a rhetoric of exceptionalism that disconnects the city from its larger contexts and reduces the ability of public memories of Greensboro\u2019s past to speak to contemporary problems of racism and inequality. \nAttention to regional identity is one way that rhetoricians can examine what gives power to a particular construction of public memory. I argue that region is a tool we can use to explore the complexities of cases of public memory\u2014especially those cases in which multiple versions of memory are competing for traction or significance. Ultimately, this dissertation offers rhetoricians a model for using critical regionalism to analyze public memory conflicts.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13877], "author_name_tesi": "Brown, Laura Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Brown", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheryl Glenn", "Cheryl Glenn ", "Debra Hawhee", "Jack Selzer", "Kirt Wilson", "Stuart Selber"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheryl Glenn, Dissertation Advisor", "Cheryl Glenn , Committee Chair", "Debra Hawhee, Committee Member", "Jack Selzer, Committee Member", "Kirt Wilson, Outside Member", "Stuart Selber, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rhetoric", "public memory", "regionalism", "civil rights movement", "greensboro", "north carolina"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Limb Position Drift and Its Implications for Movement and Position Control", "id": "6031", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3740", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-12-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Perception of limb position is dependent on visual, proprioceptive, and haptic information. Limb position information is important for movement planning and production, therefore changes in limb position can illuminate how vision and proprioception are used to control movement. Psychophysical research suggests that, without vision, perception of limb position drifts over time. Is this position drift due to a decay of proprioceptive information? If so, this decay should have consequences for movement performance. The experiments reported here address this hypothesis. Limb position cumulative drift was observed in repetitive shape-drawing and reaching tasks. After visual feedback was removed, drift accumulated over time in a systematic pattern. Drift increased quickly early in the series of movements, but then plateaued. The direction of drift accumulation varied widely between participants, but did not vary with the initial position of the limb in the workspace. Instantaneous drift distance, a measure of the movement-to-movement changes in limb position did not change over a series of movements. Instantaneous drift direction, however, was fairly consistent early in the series but then became less consistent, allowing drift to plateau. Both shape form and reaching trajectory were preserved as position drifted. An analysis of movement kinetics at the shoulder and elbow showed that movement distance and direction were preserved because shoulder torque was modified. A forward rigid-body simulation showed that if these torque modifications had not been made, movement direction would not have been preserved. We hypothesized a posture controller that allowed small position errors to accumulate to a fixed threshold. Experimental manipulations of movement speed led to predictable changes in error that affected drift accumulation rates but not drift plateau level, confirming our hypothesis. Together, the results suggested that proprioception remains a reliable source of limb position information, but that it is used differently by separate movement and position controllers. This hypothesis was favored over explanations for drift in terms of a spatial attractor, a growing state estimation error, and differential salience of static and dynamic limb position information.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3721], "author_name_tesi": "Brown, Liana Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Brown", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Liana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rick Owen Gilmore", "Cathleen M Moore", "David A.

Yet we know little about the values transmission process.  I define values-based leadership as an influence process consisting of transmission of values by leaders and subordinates\u2019 acceptance of these values as guiding principles for their work.  Accepted values are the values that followers use to guide decisions and actions.  Employees, however, are not simply values receptacles.  In the climate of cynicism that is prevalent in many business organizations, employees may be hesitant to accept leader-espoused values.  The key question driving this research was, what influences employees\u2019 acceptance of their leader\u2019s values message?  \nI proposed that trust (confident positive expectations of a supervisor) would moderate the values transmission-acceptance process by facilitating employees willingness to believe and cooperate with their manager\u2019s values messages and influencing their willingness to make themselves vulnerable by accepting their leaders\u2019 values messages.  I hypothesized that specific dimensions of trust would moderate the strength of the relationship between transmitted and accepted values depending on the values in question.\nI also examined alternative theories that might explain values similarity between managers and their direct reports\u2014ASA (Schneider, 1987), charisma (Bass & Avolio, 1995), power, demographic similarity (Byrne, 1971) and demography (Pfeffer, 1983).  To test these my hypotheses against these competing explanations, I conducted a survey-based field study in a large national healthcare organization.  Overall, the results suggested that: a) leader and direct report values are significantly correlated for self-transcendence, change orientation and conservatism but unrelated for self-enhancement values; b) despite some significant bivariate and partial correlations (controlling for social desirability), there are no significant main effects of leader values on employee values in regression analysis, only moderated ones; c) demographic and occupational/cultural differences affect the values leaders convey and employees use; d) no one theory appears to fully explain the values transmission and acceptance process; and e) the ASA, power and charisma arguments were for the most part unsupported.

In addition, these procedures were used to evaluate precision feeding strategies on ammonia volatilization, while nitrogen utilization, and milk production and components were evaluated in Holstein dairy cows. Lastly, the impact of the level of zeolite inclusion mixed into a totally mixed ration on nitrogen utilization and nutrient digestibility was evaluated in continuous culture fermenters. \n\tExperiment I involved using a non-steady state flux chamber coupled to a photoacoustic gas monitor to measure ammonia emissions directly from a freestall dairy barn floor. The barn housed two groups of 60 animals fed either alfalfa or grass silage based rations and alternated between a fine ground or a coarse ground corn through four periods in a switchback design. Dry matter intake (DMI) milk production and components and nitrogen utilization efficiency of each group of animals were evaluated. Corn particle size had minimal effects on DMI, milk production, and milk components (fat%, protein %). Animals that were fed alfalfa silage based rations consumed approximately 5 kg more feed (29.1 vs. 24.1 kg/d, respectively) and produced approximately 5.6 kg more milk (43.9 vs. 38.3 kg/d, respectively) compared to animals consuming grass silage based rations. Forage source had no significant impact on milk components (fat% and protein %), animals averaged 3.9% fat and 3.0% milk protein. Nitrogen utilization efficiency was not significantly different between rations, regardless of forage source or corn particle size and averaged 37.4%. Ammonia emissions from manure were not significantly different between treatment groups and averaged 3 kg/d, equivalent to 0.05 kg/cow/d. \n\tExperiment II involved the development of a laboratory, steady-state flux chamber coupled to a photoacoustic gas monitor, to measure ammonia volatilization from manure. Five urine to feces ratios (10:90, 30:70, 50:50, 70:30 and 90:10) were used to evaluate the instrumentation, and determine ammonia volatilization. The gas monitor demonstrated that in scenarios where urease was limiting (90:10, 70:30) ammonia production was gradual compared to instances in which urea was limiting (10:90, 30:70) where rates of ammonia production were much faster. Samples with greater urine proportions reached peak ammonia concentrations in less time and began a gradual decline towards zero after 22 hours of analyses.  The highest rate and most consistent ammonia production was observed when equal proportions of urine and feces (50:50) were evaluated. \n\tExperiment III involved a using a  replicated 4 x 4 Latin square to evaluate the effects of forage source and corn particle size on animal performance and ammonia (NH3) volatilization from manure.  The same four rations, as fed in experiment I were evaluated. Cows fed alfalfa silage had a greater dry matter intake (DMI) compared to cows fed grass silage based rations (27.9 vs. 22.1 kg/d, respectively).  The increased DMI for cows fed alfalfa silage resulted in greater milk yield (35.3 vs. 30 kg/d; P < 0.01)) than for cows fed grass silage based rations.  Milk yield efficiency was greater (P<0.02) for cows provided grass silage based rations vs. cows fed alfalfa based rations (1.43 vs. 1.30, respectively).  Corn particle size had no effect on DMI, milk yield, FCM or milk yield efficiency.  Milk fat, protein and milk protein percentages were higher for cows fed alfalfa based rations vs. grass based rations diets.  Cows fed grass silage based diets had higher (P<0.08) milk urea N when compared to cows fed alfalfa silage based rations. Ammonium-N content of urine of cows fed alfalfa silage was significantly greater than cows fed grass silage based rations.  Corn particle size had no impact on urinary urea N (UUN) concentrations when cows consumed alfalfa silage based rations, but fine ground corn resulted in reduced UUN when cows consumed grass silage based rations. Regardless of forage source or corn particle size, all rations resulted in similar cumulative amounts of ammonia being volatilized from manure, although the fine ground corn resulted in a numerically lower release of ammonia from manure.\nExperiment IV involved using a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square to evaluate the effects of forage preservation method (silage vs. hay) and corn particle size on animal performance, N excretion and ammonia emissions.  The four treatments were:1) grass silage with fine ground corn, 2) grass silage  with coarse  ground corn, 3) grass hay with fine ground corn, and 4) grass hay with coarse ground corn  in diets for lactating cows. Cows averaged 73 \u00b1 11 d in milk. Neither corn particle size nor forage preservation method had an impact on DMI (24.7 &#61617; 1.60 kg/d), milk yield (38.6 &#61617; 3.42 kg/d), milk fat% (3.4% &#61617; 0.17) or milk protein % (3.1% &#61617; 0.05). Fine ground corn resulted in a significant increase in ammonium-N content of manure when fed with the silage based ration, but decreased the ammonium-N content of manure when fed with hay based rations compared to coarsely ground corn. Corn particle size had no significant impact on urinary urea concentrations (UUN). Urine from cows consuming silage based rations had significantly lower urea concentrations (667.9 mg/dL) compared to urine from animals consuming hay based rations (773.0 mg/dL). This difference in UUN of approximately 100 mg/dL between the silage and hay based rations, did not result in considerable differences in ammonia volatilization when urinary urea nitrogen was used as an input parameter in an ammonia volatilization simulation model. \n\tExperiment V involved using a dual-effluent continuous culture system to evaluate the effects of level of zeolite in a total mixed ration on ruminal fermentation.  A Latin square design was used to evaluate 0 (control), 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8% zeolite addition to a basal ration on ruminal fermentation. The addition of zeolite did not impact the digestibilty of dry matter (DM) (41.5 &#61617; 0.61%), Total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) (80.4 &#61617; 0.31%), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (78.2 &#61617; 0.93%) or acid detergent fiber (ADF) (75.1 &#61617; 0.70%). A trend (P=0.11) for lower ruminal pH was observed for the 1.2% zeolite level (5.91) compared to the other treatments (6.12). Total VFA concentrations were significantly reduced by the 0.6% and 1.8% zeolite treatments compared to the control and the 1.2% treatment. Molar percentages of acetate, and butyrate were not affected by zeolite addition and were 55.4 and 13.6%, respectively. A trend (P=0.08) was observed for greater propionate proportion for the 1.8% zeolite treatment compared to the control and the other zeolite treatments. Zeolite addition to the diet did not impact  protein digestibility, ammonia concentration, amount of ammonia produced, bacterial N or the bacterial N produced per kg of digested DM. Bacterial N was reduced by zeolite addition, compared to the control. Zeolite addition to the diet had no effect on buffering capacity of the rumen environment. The addition of zeolite to the ration resulted in changes in pH, propionate concentrations and bacterial N, primarily due to the 1.2% zeolite addition. Including zeolites in dairy rations alters ruminal fermentation, especially pH and ammonia concentrations. However, responses to zeolite addition is influenced by the level of inclusion in the ration, and under the conditions of this study, 1.2% zeolite inclusion resulted in reduced ammonia concentrations, without negatively impacting nutrient digestibility or microbial crude protein synthesis.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4610], "author_name_tesi": "Brown, Neil Edmond", "last_name_ssi": "Brown", "middle_name_ssi": "Edmond", "first_name_ssi": "Neil", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gabriella Anne Varga", "Robert John Vansaun", "Eileen Wheeler", "Kenneth Kephart", "Gregory Wayne Roth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gabriella Anne Varga, Committee Chair", "Robert John Vansaun, Committee Member", "Eileen Wheeler, Committee Member", "Kenneth Kephart, Committee Member", "Gregory Wayne Roth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["alfalfa silage", "grass hay", "grass silage", "rumen synchronization", "zeolite", "ammonia emission"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Investigating STAT3 isoform expression and gene targets in the retina\n", "id": "24972", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11179", "abstract_tesi": "Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) regulates cell fate decisions in the developing retina through transcriptional control of its target genes.

A microarray with probes for 12, 282 genes was used to determine expression changes in embryonic retina cultured with or without CNTF. Only 2% of the genes exhibited a change in expression.

Expression of the two STAT3 isoforms, \u03b1 and \u03b2, was examined during retinal development and adulthood to determine if the different roles are a result of differential isoform expression. RT-PCR revealed that the mRNA messages for both isoforms are present in the perinatal and mature retinal tissue, but STAT3\u03b1 is expressed in much greater abundance compared to STAT3\u03b2.

RNA is built from only four similar heterocyclic nucleotides with pKas of < 4.5 and > 9.  Moreover, nucleotide pKa values shift further from neutrality in typical base pairs.  Thus, nucleotides seem to lend themselves neither to electrostatic nor general acid-base catalysis of biologically relevant reactions.  However, seven naturally occurring ribozymes have been discovered and several artificial ribozymes synthesized that are capable of catalyzing phosphodiester-bond synthesis and cleavage, aminoacylation of RNA, glycosidic and amide bond formation, hydroxyl phosphorylation, alkylation, acyl transfer, and Diels\u00a1VAlder reactions.  To achieve these functions, nucleobase pKas are shifted by attaining complex structures with specific microenvironments.\n\nThe HDV and leadzyme ribozymes serve as models throughout this dissertation highlighting the importance and complexity of understanding nucleic acid catalysis.  These ribozymes have in vivo significance in that HDV is a human pathogen and the essential sequence of leadzyme has been found throughout eukaryotic genomes leading to implications of its function in lead toxicity.  A number of methodologies are used in this dissertation.  A novel application of chip electrophoresis with capillary sample introduction is developed to measure ribozyme kinetics.  Additionally, rational mutant design, enzymatic structure mapping, pH-dependent PAGE, and CD, UV-absorbance, and fluorescence spectroscopy are used to investigate ribozyme folding pathways and nucleobase pKa perturbation. \n\nTo obtain a suitable construct for biophysical studies, the G11C/U27\u0192\u00b4 HDV ribozyme double mutant was prepared in an effort to destabilize known alternative pairings\u00a1XAlt 1, Alt 2, Alt 3, and Alt P1\u00a1Xwhile leaving the catalytic core intact (Chapter 2.1).  However, biphasic kinetics and antisense oligonucleotide response trends opposing those of the well\u00a1Vstudied G11C mutant were observed, suggesting that new alternative pairings with multiple registers, termed \u00a1\u00a5Alt X\u00a1\u00a6 and \u00a1\u00a5Alt Y\u00a1\u00a6, had been created.  Inclusion of biologically relevant concentrations of Na+ realized the goal of monophasic, fast\u00a1Vfolding kinetics (kobs \u201el 60 min\u00a1V1).  A model is developed wherein Na+, which destabilizes secondary and tertiary structures in the presence of Mg2+, facilitates native folding by destabilizing multiple alternate secondary structures with a higher\u00a1Vorder dependence.  Thus, design of a highly reactive HDV ribozyme sequence uncovered facilitation of RNA folding by alternate pairings and near physiological ionic strength.\n\nIn Chapter 4.1, continuous analysis of a fluorescene-labeled leadzyme reaction is demonstrated using completely automated capillary sample introduction onto a microfabricated chip with an array of separation lanes, laser-induced fluorescence detection and differing lead concentrations.  The automated results are in agreement with rates determined by conventional, more labor intensive, manual sample collection and PAGE analysis.  This work demonstrates the potential of this method to provide valuable kinetic information for other, more complex, biologically relevant RNA and protein enzymes. \n\nSpecific measurements of critical ribozyme features, such as nucleobase pKa, are of even greater interest than the global molecular characteristics.  In Chapter 3.1, a simple method for determining nucleobase pKa values by indirect labeling is developed and used to demonstrate a pKa of neutrality in dsDNA using optimal nearest-neighbor partners and lower temperature.  Such pKa values expand the catalytic repertoire of nucleic acids at physiological pH.\n\nC75 of the HDV ribozyme has been proposed to be involved in both the general acid-base mechanism and coupled to conformational changes in the folded ribozyme.  Because of this, pH-dependent structural changes are followed by CD, UV-absorbance, and pyrene fluorescence spectroscopy (Chapter 5.1).  In addition, non-denaturing PAGE is employed over a broad pH range to further elucidate linked structure formation.  Unfortunately, the spectra of each method were complicated by the presence of the \u00a1\u00a5non-targeted\u00a1\u00a6 nucleotides.  In conclusion, these methods are not effective reporters of subtle changes associated with this single protonation.  These efforts demonstrate that changes in structure coupled to the protonation state of C75 in the pre-cleaved HDV ribozyme are subtle.  This thesis highlights the importance of rational mutant design, describes the use of Na+ as a denaturant, and demonstrates combining these two points to achieve a homogeneous, pre-cleaved, folded ribozyme population suitable for biophysical studies, which uncovered only a subtle structural change upon protonation of C75 and suggested that the large rearrangements previously reported may have been the result of stable misfolded structures.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6278], "author_name_tesi": "Brown, Trevor S.", "last_name_ssi": "Brown", "middle_name_ssi": "S.", "first_name_ssi": "Trevor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

The dimensions of Caribbean rhetoric therefore reflect constructions of social reality and allow practitioners and scholars to approach and analyze the issues and challenges faced by Caribbean people. Objects of study include the novels of Earl Lovelace, the prophetic musical performances of David Rudder, and the transformative possibilities afforded by Caribbean discursive activity in digital environments.

The trope is deployed for two primary purposes: as a key rhetorical device operating among Caribbean people; and as an effective theoretical device for considering how Caribbean people participate in different forms of democratic deliberation and interaction with other groups. Overall, the project strives for an understanding of the Caribbean rhetorical tradition as one of the possible means of approaching, managing, and improving the social circumstances Caribbean people face.

The major roadblock associated with implementation of biomass into these new systems is the high cost of handling and transport.  Herbaceous biomasses from crop residues and dedicated energy crops have a low bulk density, which leads to expensive handling and transportation costs.  Densification of the herbaceous biomass is necessary to increase the efficiency of transport.  The method of densification investigated is mechanical compression, without forming pellets.  This method involves compressing the herbaceous biomass with a mechanism to hold it in the compressed form.  This method differs from pelleting in the fact that the compressed dry herbaceous biomass can expand after released.\nA commercial hay compressor was used to compress switchgrass bales and evaluate the effectiveness of the compressor operating on herbaceous biomass.  The compressor operated at 0.1104 hours per ton and .5435 gallons per ton to compress the material.  Assuming labor costs are 15 dollars per hour and fuel is 3 dollars per gallon, the labor and fuel costs are 1.66 dollars per ton and 1.63 dollars per ton, respectively.  Including the machinery costs and 2 laborers, the total price would be 16.44 dollars per ton to compress the biomass.\nThe adoption of biomass into power generation and liquid fuel production requires optimized handling methods to move the biomass.

While research of these materials focused for many years upon investigations into the properties and processing of graphene, attention has now begun to shift towards examination of other two dimensional material systems, including hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) compounds.  These compounds possess a wide range of optical, electrical, thermal, and chemical properties that make them intriguing for use in many applications ranging tunneling field effect transistors (TFETs) to hydrogen evolution catalysts.  Tungsten diselenide (WSe2) has recently become of particular interest due to its many technologically advantageous properties including a direct band gap in the visible spectrum, modest carrier mobility, high degree of thermal anisotropy, and catalytic properties.  Unfortunately, a method capable of producing WSe2 in the form of large-scale, uniform films of controllable thickness remains undiscovered, making commercialization of WSe2 currently impossible.\nThe purpose of this thesis is to explore the possibility of producing wafer-scale films of WSe2 using methods involving oxygen-selenium exchange mechanisms.  WSe2 films were synthesized using several different techniques including a batch cold-wall reactor process involving reaction of elemental selenium with a tungsten oxide (WOx) film deposited by thermal evaporation onto sapphire (Al2O3) and silicon dioxide (Si/SiO2) substrates, a continuous hot-wall process capable of supplying a continuous selenium overpressure, a cold-wall reactor process using reaction between WOx and the metal organic precursor dimethyl selenide (DMSe), and a reaction process between elemental selenium and the metal organic tungsten hexacarbonyl (W(CO)6).  Studies of the role of selenium overpressure, reaction temperature, system pressure, heat treatment, substrate, and treatment of the oxide film were conducted to gain an understanding of the role of different experimental variables on film growth.  Films were characterized through the use of Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).  Using the batch synthesis process it was found that WSe2 could be obtained under a number of experimental conditions, however best results were obtained at elevated pressures and temperatures near 750 \u00b0C (the maximum system temperature), with low hydrogen to nitrogen carrier gas ratios.  Contrary to previous reports in literature, it was found possible to generate WSe2 films even without the presence of hydrogen.  Based on cross-sectional TEM imaging and discrepancies between sample results, the process was deemed too unreproducible for practical use and unable to fully selenize the tungsten oxide due to the departure of the selenium vapor over time.  Synthesis using the hot-wall reactor process revealed films synthesized at temperatures up to 900 \u00b0C were capable of producing WSe2, however open raising system temperature to 1050 \u00b0C no WSe2 Raman spectra was detected of the film, placing a limit on maximum processing temperature.  Pressures near 10 Torr were found to produce superior films than those generated at 100 Torr, suggesting the improvement at higher pressure found for the batch process was due to reduced depletion of selenium with time rather than film growth thermodynamics.  Low concentrations of hydrogen to argon or nitrogen gas were again found to produce optimal film growth results.  Cross-sectional TEM revealed full selenization of the deposited oxide films, however an amorphous interlayer was found between the WSe2 film and sapphire substrate, suggesting damage of the substrate by prolonged exposure of selenium and possible formation of aluminum selenide.  Synthesis using DMSe exposure over WOx films reveled the metal-organic could be successfully used to generate carbon-free films at pressures near 10 Torr and temperatures as high as 800 \u00b0C, with low hydrogen concentrations again being found optimal for growth of films.  Studies of prolonged exposure of films to selenium vapor revealed no increase in grain size, suggesting grain growth was limited by the concentration of WOx present in the system.  Activation of DMSe at temperatures near 500 \u00b0C was found to greatly improve film roughness and morphology, suggesting a selenium overpressure serves to prevent delamination of WOx films as tungsten oxide is known to participate in evaporation-condensation growth mechanisms.  Atomically-smooth, wafer-scale films of WSe2 were obtained by this method and the hot-wall selenization methods, however the grain size of the films was found to be on the order of several hundred nanometers in both cases.  Use of rapid thermal annealing treatments on the oxide films was found to produce films of increased grain size, as well as improve film uniformity, highlighting that final film morphology was controlled by the morphology of the oxide prior to selenization, and suggesting little to no solid-state diffusion of tungsten atoms within the films.  Furthermore, film thickness of WSe2 was found to be controlles by the thickness of the deposited oxide film, allowing for deposition of WSe2 films of thickness 2 nm and greater.  Using these treatments, heterostructures of directly-grown WSe2 on epitaxial graphene and hexagonal boron nitride were demonstrated for the first time, with results indicating a clean interface between the epitaxial graphene and WSe2 film and AFM showing van der Waal\u2019s epitaxy between the WSe2 film and epitaxial graphene or h-BN substrates.  Finally, reaction of W(CO)6 with selenium was determined to be a promising synthesis route for development of WSe2 films, although the batch nature of the process used in the study made the reaction incapable of producing the ultrathin films desired.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9693], "author_name_tesi": "Browning, Paul Nathan", "last_name_ssi": "Browning", "middle_name_ssi": "Nathan", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua Alexander Robinson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua Alexander Robinson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Two-dimensional materials", "chemical vapor deposition", "synthesis", "electronic materials", "Raman spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Refractory Metal Alloys Formed by Field Assisted Sintering Technique (FAST)", "id": "13209pnb115", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13209", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Refractory metals and their alloys are of critical importance for a large number of applications ranging from nuclear fission and fusion reactors to the defense and aerospace industries.  Of the refractory metal alloys, tungsten, tantalum, and molybdenum alloys are dominant in both commercial and defense applications.  Unfortunately, due to their high melting temperatures and relatively poor sinterability, formation of high-density components of these alloys is difficult, requiring either the use of time-consuming and expensive techniques such as hot isostatic pressing or post-processing such as hot extrusion and annealing to produce components acceptable for structural use.  Furthermore, as components of these compounds are generally by their very nature used at elevated operating temperatures, they frequently experience failure due to recrystallization, grain growth, and creep.\nField Assisted Sintering Technique (FAST), also commonly referred to as spark plasma sintering (SPS) or pulsed electric current sintering (PECS) is a promising method for formation of dense compacts of traditionally difficult to sinter materials.  FAST uses a combination of elevated temperatures, pressures, and the application of an electric field to rapidly sinter components over the course of several minutes to hours.  FAST is an excellent technique for rapid production of refractory alloys, as it produces near net-shaped components featuring equiaxed grain structures.  As FASTs uses rapid heating and cooling rates, it is also capable of producing dense components of much finer grain sizes in comparison to traditional sintering techniques.\nThis dissertation explores the use of FAST and alloying additions to produce refractory metal alloys featuring improved mechanical properties over current commercially available materials.  Work begins by exploring the room and ultra-high temperature mechanical properties of a series of tungsten alloys (Chapter 3) attempting to make use of Ta and TiC alloying additions.  W-TiC alloys are found to be promising for high-strength applications where ductility is less of an issue, and display substantial resistance to grain growth at temperatures up to1927 \u02daC (3500 \u02daF).  This strengthening effect was found to be lost upon testing at 2204 \u02daC (4000 \u02daF).  In contrast, a tested W-10vol%Ta alloy was found to display high strength and ductility at temperatures of 1649 \u02daC (3000 \u02daF) and higher, making this an excellent candidate material for ultrahigh temperature applications.  \nTo gain increased understanding of the microstructural effects that were resulting in observed mechanical behaviors, a detailed study of W-10vol%Ta and W-10vol%Ta-5vol%TiC alloys including optical and SEM imaging with EDS mapping, TEM imaging, X-ray diffraction, and hardness measurements was performed to examine elemental diffusion and microstructural changes in these two alloys.  W-Ta cross diffusion was discovered to occur over a relatively large area on order of 10s of microns, producing a Ta interface region featuring increased hardness than that expected for pure tantalum.  Interestingly, interstitial elements such as C and O were found to preferentially migrate to the center of Ta particles, producing regions displaying extremely high hardness in comparison to the surrounding ductile matrices, possibly accounting for the apparent strengthening seen in the W-10vol%Ta samples at both room and elevated temperatures.\nThe loss of strength in W-TiC alloys at 2204 \u02daC was disappointing given their excellent grain growth resistance up to 1927 \u02daC, therefore work was done investigating the centering and mechanical behavior of W with other nanoparticle additives.  This resulted in identification of oxidation of nanoparticle additions in W due to oxygen present in the matrix phase, which is in agreement with previous oxidation seen in W-TiC alloys.  A Zener-type model allowed for successful description of grain growth inhibition of W during sintering with carbide particle additions, and a simple model combining the Hall-Petch and second-phase precipitate strengthening mechanisms was capable of prediction alloy hardness values with relative accuracy, alloying for tailoring of W hardness with specific nanoparticle additions to desired values.\nTungsten alloys were found to be highly brittle at room temperature regardless of alloying changes, therefore work was also performed exploring room and ultra-high temperature Ta alloys (Chapter 4).  This resulted in identification of Ta-10vol%W as an excellent alloy for use over a wide range of temperatures including up to temperatures in excess of 2204 \u02daC.  It was further demonstrated that this alloy displayed superior mechanical properties to Ta-10vol%W produced by other commercial methods at elevated temperatures which was attributed to the improved microstructure obtained by FAST sintering in comparison to Ta-10vol%W alloys obtained by typical arc casting, forging, and heat treatment methods.  \nFinally, as TiC nanoparticle addition was found to produce extremely strong W alloys up to 1927 \u02daC, it was of interest whether use of this alloy was possible with molybdenum, a material used at lower temperatures than tungsten for which the loss of strength seen at 2204 \u02daC would not be a concern.  Sintering studies were therefore performed determining optimal sintering conditions for production of the molybdenum alloy TZM (titanium zirconium molybdenum) alloys with and without TiC addition (Chapter 5).  After determining these conditions, commercial-scale 4\u201dx4\u201d plates were sintered at optimized conditions, producing similar densities to that seen in smaller samples demonstrating potential scalability of FAST production of these alloys for commercial-scale sintering.  Mechanical testing of these alloys identified the presence of high degrees of ductility in pure TZM samples and TZM-5vol%TiC samples, although this ductility was lost at 10 vol% TiC addition.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13778], "author_name_tesi": "Browning, Paul Nathan", "last_name_ssi": "Browning", "middle_name_ssi": "Nathan", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jogender Singh", "Anil Kulkarni", "Todd Palmer", "Ivica Smid", "Ivica Smid"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jogender Singh, Dissertation Advisor", "Anil Kulkarni, Committee Chair", "Todd Palmer, Committee Member", "Ivica Smid, Committee Member", "Ivica Smid, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Refractory Metals", "Field Assisted Sintering", "Spark Plasma Sintering", "Mechanical Properties"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Soy Protein on Colon Carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo\n\n", "id": "12055", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "210", "abstract_tesi": "Previous studies have suggested a beneficial effect of dietary soy against inflammation and colon cancer.  Much of this has been attributed to soy isoflavones; however, soy proteins and peptides have also shown bioactivity and antioxidant activity in some models.  Enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins has also been shown to increase free radical scavenging by increasing solvent accessibility of active amino acids.\nWe investigated the antioxidant capacity of an isoflavone-free soy protein concentrate (SPC) and an enzymatically-hydrolyzed SPC (SPH) using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay.   Consistent with our expectations, SPH delayed the oxidation of fluorescein significantly longer than SPC (p<0.01), indicating its superior antioxidative capacity.\n  \nThe cytoprotective effects of SPC and SPH were also compared in the Caco-2 human intestinal cell model to evaluate their ability to prevent H2O2-induced oxidation.  Cells were cotreated with 50 \u00b5M H2O2 and SPC or SPH (0-2 mg/ml) in PBS for 60 min or were pretreated with SPC or SPH (0-2 mg/ml) for 30 min and subsequently treated with 50 \u00b5M H2O2 for 60 min.  Cell viability was assessed using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.  Treatment with 0.5 mg/ml SPC increased cell viability from 42.8-50.0% in H2O2-only treated cells to 76.1 \u00b1 9.0% and 60.8 \u00b1 6.5% of the PBS control in the cotreatment and pretreatment trials, respectively.  Higher concentrations of SPH were required to achieve similar cytoprotective effects.  At a concentration of 2 mg/ml SPH, cell viability was increased to 85.3 \u00b1 10.9% and 62.1 \u00b1 3.2% in the cotreatment and pretreatment trials, respectively.  Photomicrographs of treated cells showed that SPC prevented H2O2-induced changes in morphology and reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS).  These effects were also observed for SPH treatment, but to a lesser extent.\n\nThe effect of dietary supplementation with SPC on colon inflammation and carcinogenesis in male, CF-1 mice was investigated in one 10-week and one 20-week study.  In both studies, following one week pretreatment with SPC or casein as the sole source of protein (19% kcal), mice were injected with the colon carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM, 10 mg/kg body wt).  One week later, mice received dextran sodium sulfate (DSS, 1.5% w/v) as their sole drinking fluid for one week to induce colon-specific inflammation.  On days 3 and 7, and weeks 7 and 20 (second study only) after DSS treatment, mice were euthanized and the colons were examined for markers of inflammation and carcinogenesis.  All samples were scored using the inflammation index, which measures inflammation area, severity, ulceration and hyperplasia and dysplasia.  In both studies, trends in these measures appeared to be highly dependent on sacrifice time-point.  With the data from both studies combined, mean polyp multiplicity was significantly reduced in mice fed SPC at Week 7 and for the study overall (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively).  Hyperplasia and dysplasia, inflammation area and total inflammation index score were significantly decreased in the SPC group compared to the control at Week 7 (p<0.10, p<0.10 and p<0.05, respectively).  At 20 weeks, mice in both the control and SPC-treated groups showed colon tumors.  A trend toward reduced tumor burden and multiplicity in mice fed the SPC diet was observed, but the effect was not statistically significant.  \nFinally, the ORAC assay was used to compare the radical scavenging capacities of SPC and casein, to elucidate any effect this may have had in the mouse studies.  In comparisons of the proteins alone and of the SPC and casein-containing mouse diets, casein was found to have significantly greater radical scavenging capacity (p<0.0001).  In conclusion, while these studies suggest that soy may have antioxidant activity and colon cancer preventative effects independent of isoflavone content, further research is required to confirm this finding and the underlying mechanism.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [209], "author_name_tesi": "Brownschidle, Amy Laura", "last_name_ssi": "Brownschidle", "middle_name_ssi": "Laura", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert", "Ryan John Elias", "Joshua D Lambert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert, Thesis Advisor", "Ryan John Elias, Thesis Advisor", "Joshua D Lambert, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Soy protein", "colon cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Practical Sense and Social Action\n", "id": "9337", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4346", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation concerns limitations endemic to those accounts of social action that do not sufficiently distinguish intelligent individual action from actions caused by or defined in terms of second-order mental intentionality.  My claim is that accounts of social action can be greatly improved if they recognize that where there is intelligent action, there is not necessarily action driven by reflection, second-order states or higher-order mental content.  I develop this claim with respect to three specific kinds of social theorizing: explanations, normative prescriptions and applied accounts of social action.  In all cases, I argue, failures to achieve these ends \u2013 explanatory, normative and applied \u2013 may stem from failures to recognize the practical understanding or \u201cpractical sense\u201d of social actors.  \n\nPractical understanding refers to the skillful know-how that enables individuals to act intelligently in the world.  By intelligently, I mean with adept sensitivity and social skill to a background of largely opaque norms that determine how one is to \u201cgo on\u201d in practical situations.  The central claim I derive from Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Bourdieu and others is that there is a more basic level of intentionality at work in human action than higher-order mental intentionality.  My dissertation argues that the study of this basic level of non-mentalistic intentionality helps to solve some of the central problems plaguing explanatory, normative and applied social theories.\n\nThe dissertation has six chapters which can be grouped into three thematic sections.  In the first section of the dissertation, I address explanatory models of action in the philosophy of social science, principally the individualist account developed by Jon Elster and others.  I show that a model of social action based on the practical understanding of social actors, such as Bourdieu\u2019s, solves problems which are insurmountable for individualist psychological models of action.  \n\nIn the second section, I address normative social theories.  Through a critique of Charles Taylor\u2019s Verstehen thesis, I argue that working to make the meaning of social practices explicit sometimes may have deleterious effects upon the experiences of social actors.  Because of the \u201cpositive indeterminacy\u201d of practical understanding, normative social theories must attend to the gains and losses of theoretical activity itself.  I go on to address models of normative social theory which I consider to be more successful than Taylor\u2019s: I discuss the arguments of the \u201clegal realists\u201d with respect to practices of adjudication, John Dewey\u2019s claims about the reformulation of the operative concepts of social theories and, finally, Bourdieu\u2019s proposals for \u201cself-reflexivity\u201d in social science.\n\nIn the final section of the dissertation, I show that the study of newly emerging social practices benefits from an account of the practical understanding of social actors.  I use the internet as a case study and consider several instances where online social practices raise challenging questions for accounts of social action.  I discuss three related issues: the relationship of online information retrieval to intelligent social networks; the nature of disembodied communities; and the changing legal meaning of propriety due to online practices.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4318], "author_name_tesi": "Brownstein, Michael Saul", "last_name_ssi": "Brownstein", "middle_name_ssi": "Saul", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Philip Christman", "John Philip Christman", "Leonard Richard Lawlor", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Nancy S Love"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Philip Christman, Dissertation Advisor", "John Philip Christman, Committee Chair", "Leonard Richard Lawlor, Committee Member", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Committee Member", "Nancy S Love, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phenomenology", "social practice", "social action", "practical understanding", "intelligent coping", "Pierre Bourdieu", "internet"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Health-care access in a rural area: Perspectives from Russian-speaking immigrants, English-speaking doctors, and volunteer interpreters\n", "id": "9818", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1119", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Health-care access for immigrants in the United States is often problematic because of language barriers, lack of health insurance, or differing expectations based on divergent medical systems in the U.S. and the immigrants\u2019 home countries. Such difficulties are exacerbated when a linguistic-minority population lives in a rural community that has limited health-care-access resources for non-English-speakers. In the current project, I investigate an immigrant community in an area of Pennsylvania that has recently become a destination for Russian-speaking immigrants. Their numbers have been estimated at 2,000 people. Some have strong proficiency in English, but many do not, especially the elderly. In the study context, there are very few medical personnel with language skills in both English and Russian, few intermediaries trained in medical interpretation for those languages, and a scarcity of Russian-language print materials.\nUsing a directed approach to content analysis, I analyze data from semi-structured interviews with three groups who have a significant stake in the issue of health-care access: recent Russian-speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union (n=12); English-speaking staff members at a medical and social services facility where many of the immigrants seek help (n=5); and volunteer interpreters who act as go-betweens for Russian-speaking patients and English-speaking personnel (n=3). \nBased on the coding and analysis of the data, particularly salient issues included: 1) the role of language as an entry point or impediment to health-care access (language and language accommodation) and 2) the impact of immigrant and U.S. health-care beliefs on medical behavior (health-care socialization). Regarding language and language accommodation, I consider the following questions using data from the stakeholders\u2019 interviews: \n--What kind of language accommodation is portrayed as desirable?\n--Who is responsible for providing the interpreter?\n--What roles do non-professional/non-na\u00efve interpreters take on?\nIn regard to health-care socialization, I address the following issues using data from the stakeholders\u2019 interviews:\n--How are \u201cgood doctors\u201d portrayed?\n--How are \u201cgood patients\u201d portrayed?\n--How is use of medications portrayed?\n--What effects are associated with divergent logistics of the medical systems?\n--What attitudes surround prices, payments, and quality of care?\nIn the three participant groups\u2019 discussion of these issues, there are areas of convergence. For instance, all share the sense that medical costs in the U.S. present a barrier to access, and all recognize the need for medical bilingualism in interpreters. There are also a number of potentially significant divergences, especially around attitudes toward medical compliance and use of medications, and the logistics of approach to medical care.\nIn the conclusion, I synthesize the research literature and my own empirical findings to suggest ways of increasing the health-care access of the Russian-speaking community in the study context and, by extension, of other linguistic-minority groups in areas far from the resources available in large cities.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1108], "author_name_tesi": "Brua, Charles ", "last_name_ssi": "Brua", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Charles", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert William Schrauf", "Robert William Schrauf", "Karen E Johnson", "Sinfree Bullock Makoni", "Roxanne Louise Parrott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert William Schrauf, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert William Schrauf, Committee Chair", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Member", "Sinfree Bullock Makoni, Committee Member", "Roxanne Louise Parrott, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["language accommodation", "health-care beliefs", "rural health care", "Russian-speaking immigrants", "Medical interpreters", "health-care socialization"]}]
