The family is a proximal socialization context that teaches children about the emotional states of others and how to respond to such states (Valiente, Eisenberg, Fabes, Shepard, Cumberland, & Losoya, 2004).  Emotional expressiveness, emotions that parents express in the presence of their children, influences how their children respond in social events, such as ones that encourage prosocial behavior (Eisenberg, Cumberland, & Spinrad, 1998).  There is some research to suggest that parents\u2019 emotion socialization contributes to the physiological mechanisms that regulate children\u2019s social engagement (e.g., Hastings & De, 2008).  It is important to address that studying one parent and one child in the family does not fully capture children\u2019s emotion socialization environment, thus the current study examined whether the associations between mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 emotional expressiveness and children\u2019s prosocial behavior differed for two children in the same family.  Additionally, it examined if children\u2019s baseline RSA moderated the associations between parents\u2019 emotional expressiveness and children\u2019s prosocial behavior.  This study utilized data from a larger study of 70 families, including mothers, fathers, older siblings, and younger siblings.  The results indicated that higher levels of mothers\u2019 positive emotional expressiveness were associated with greater sharing.  Further, significant interactions between parental emotional expressiveness and sibling, as well as between parental emotional expressiveness and baseline RSA, emerged.

Inducing heifers into lactation at a younger age would reduce this non-productive time.  The objectives of this research were to characterize milk production, growth, reproduction, and herd life after induced lactation in healthy 15-month old heifers; to quantify the lactation response to bovine somatotropin (bST), and compare survival rate and profitability of induced heifers to conventionally raised heifers; to evaluate whether starting bST treatment during lactation induction would improve milk production; and to determine if dexamethasone administration at the onset of milking and age at lactation induction would affect milk production.\n     Holstein heifers were induced into lactation by daily administration of estradiol-17&#946; (0.075 mg/kg body weight [BW]) and progesterone (0.25 mg/kg BW) for 7 days.  Milking began on day 18.  Heifers treated with bST (500 mg dose every 14 days) between 25 and 95 days in milk (DIM) produced 14.7% more milk than controls.  Induced heifers gained 0.69 kg/d, averaged 1.8 services/pregnancy, and 27 heifers calved subsequently.  Induced animals had a 62.7% chance of remaining in the herd as long as conventionally raised heifers, however both groups had similar productive lifespans.  Net present value for an induced animal ($2459) was not different from that of a traditionally raised peer ($3137).\n     When bST administration began on experimental day 1 with the induction treatment, mean daily milk yield for bST-treated heifers was 36% higher than for controls.  Milk production remained higher in bST-treated heifers (15.5%) through 305 DIM even though control animals began bST treatment at 54 DIM.  The data suggest that heifers treated with bST during the induction phase had more mammary secretory tissue than controls.  \n     Dexamethasone administration (10 mg) on days 1 and 2 of lactation increased initial milk production through 15 DIM, but this did not persist through 305 DIM.   Milk yield was 8.6% higher in heifers induced into lactation at 18 months compared to those induced at 14 months of age.

By applying a fluid-dynamics perspective to examine current trace-explosive sampling techniques, sampling time can be minimized while providing an increased efficiency.  The goal is to sample the trailer's inner airspace without opening its doors.\n\nCommercial trailers are first characterized by length, body style, and shipping environment.  Further comparisons include door styles, ventilation characteristics inside the trailer, and contrasts between new and used trailers.  Full-scale tests are performed to provide insight to the quantity and nature of air leakage between a trailer and its surroundings.  Construction of a scale model allows for further testing in a laboratory setting.  Qualitative flow-visualization is then conducted to reveal the airflow patterns within the model during both empty and full-container scenarios.  Lastly, trace-explosive experiments are performed using minute quantities of RDX vapor released at various locations throughout the scale model.\n\nFull-scale testing confirmed that truck trailers have the ability to exchange air with their surroundings when subjected to a pressure differential - a key element to effective trace-explosive sampling and detection.  Flow visualization showed that an adequate flow field exists within the scale model, and that a top-front suction vent location yields no areas lacking fluid flow.  This was confirmed by detecting trace amounts of RDX vapor all areas inside the model.  Based on the results, recommendations are made for future work, and suggestions are made for the design and implementation of commercial sampling devices.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4158], "author_name_tesi": "Madalis, Matthew ", "last_name_ssi": "Madalis", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Stuart Settles"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Stuart Settles, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sampling", "Trace-explosive", "detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Design And Characterization Of Novel Rf Circuits Based On Emerging Material Systems\n", "id": "28043", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12072", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Novel material systems like Transition Metal Oxides (TMO) and 2-dimensional materials have garnered a lot of interest amongst researchers due to their unique properties. Currently, there exist several fundamental questions as to the role these materials might play in future electronic applications.  My research has focused on the application of these novel materials towards radio frequency (RF) circuits by exploiting their unique properties. More specifically, I have demonstrated an electrically triggered vanadium di-oxide (VO2) RF switch with a record 26.5 THz cut-off frequency, and a graphene RF ambipolar mixer with a record low conversion loss (14dB) for a single graphene field effect transistor (GFET) design.\nThis dissertation primarily focuses on VO2, a TMO that undergoes a solid state phase transitions, which is accompanied by an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT). First, the quantitative mapping of both thermally and electrically induced inhomogeneous IMT in VO2 at the nanoscale, using Scanning Microwave Microscopy (SMM) is demonstrated. Next, the switching dynamics using a numerical model is discussed. Finally, this dissertation presents how the unique switching physics of VO2 can be used to develop an electrically triggered VO2 RF switch. This demonstration provides evidence to support that VO2 switches can achieve good isolation and high frequency of operation that is typical of MEMS based switches, and also simultaneously achieve the high speed operation and form factor that is typical of solid state switches. \nThe later part of this dissertation covers a detailed study of the graphene RF mixer, comparing ambipolar and drain mixing for the first time. Transfer and output characteristics of the graphene transistor were also analyzed in order to achieve the highest performance for both mixing configurations.  The optimized graphene RF mixer achieved a high conversion gain of -14 and -16 dB at LO power 0 dBm at 4.2 and 10 GHz, respectively, 20dB higher than previously reported ambipolar mixer.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11495], "author_name_tesi": "Madan, Himanshu ", "last_name_ssi": "Madan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Himanshu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suman Datta", "Suman Datta", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Julio Urbina", "Joshua Alexander Robinson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suman Datta, Dissertation Advisor", "Suman Datta, Committee Chair", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "Joshua Alexander Robinson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Scanning Microwave Microscopy", "Vanadium di-oxide", "Insulator-to-Metal Transition (IMT)", "RF switch", "Graphene", "Ambipolar Mixer"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Maurice Ravel\u2019s Affinity for St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9: Symbolism and Pr\u00e9ciosit\u00e9 in Trois po\u00e8mes de St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9\n\n\n", "id": "11883", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "925", "abstract_tesi": "The combination of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s esoteric poetry and Maurice Ravel\u2019s elusive tonal designs presents a multitude of methodological problems for analysts attempting to study the Trois po\u00e8mes de St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 (1913).  While extant analyses of these songs draw on pitch content to make observations about Ravel\u2019s interpretation of the text, they fail to consider the fundamental structural importance of Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s poetry.  In his autobiographical sketch, Ravel noted that Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s \u201cpr\u00e9ciosit\u00e9 so full of meaning\u201d inspired him to compose the Trois po\u00e8mes.  By using the archaic French word pr\u00e9ciosit\u00e9, which carries literary connotations, Ravel suggests that Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s poetry provided the primary source of inspiration for the Trois po\u00e8mes.  After establishing Ravel\u2019s life-long affinity for Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s Symbolist structures and formal improprieties, I will demonstrate that Ravel\u2019s understanding of Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s pr\u00e9ciosit\u00e9 served as the compositional impetus for these songs. \n     In \u201cSoupir\u201d (\u201cSigh\u201d), Maurice Ravel employs contrasting pitch areas to construct a palindromic arch form that mirrors the bipartite structure of Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s poem.  Just as the structure of Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s two-part poem symbolizes the inhalation and exhalation of a sigh, so too does Ravel\u2019s rising and falling arch-form capture the symbolic content of Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s poetic form.  In the second song, \u201cPlacet futile\u201d (\u201cFutile Petition\u201d), Ravel uses motivic transformation to depict the personal development of a humble abb\u00e9 who wishes to become one with the elusive princess painted on his teacup.  Here, Ravel\u2019s interest lies in Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s irregular gendered rhyme scheme, which suggests gradual male empowerment throughout the poem.  Through the use of obscured cadences and evolving melodic motives, Ravel remains faithful to Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s male-empowered rhyme scheme and depicts the abb\u00e9\u2019s success at the conclusion of the song.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [917], "author_name_tesi": "Madden, Christopher A.", "last_name_ssi": "Madden", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Music Theory and History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Taylor Aitken Greer", "Taylor Aitken Greer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Taylor Aitken Greer, Thesis Advisor", "Taylor Aitken Greer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mallarm\u00e9", "Maurice Ravel", "Ravel", "Ravel songs", "Ravel symbolism", "Ravel and Mallarm\u00e9", "Mallarm\u00e9 songs", "St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9", "Trois po\u00e8ms", "Trois po\u00e8mes de St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE ROLE OF GONADOTROPIN-INHIBITORY HORMONE (GnIH) AND ITS\nRECEPTOR ON CHICKEN REPRODUCTION", "id": "8222", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5768", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nGonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), a hypothalamic peptide, has been\nshown to inhibit pituitary LH release in both avian and mammalian species.

Dietary methionine restriction (0.17% methionine, MR) has been found to enhance longevity in rats and mice independent of energy restriction and have differential effects on GSH levels in liver, kidney and blood.  We hypothesized that MR is specifically affecting GSH metabolism and transport as a result of reduced tissue availability of sulfur amino acids precursors and reduced levels of oxidative stress.  To test this hypothesis, male Fischer 344 rats were fed control (0.86% methionine) or MR (0.17% methionine) diets for 4 weeks or 6 months, and GSH and its key redox-enzymes were analyzed at various time points.

However, the biology of these cells is still poorly understood primarily because there are no specific markers available to identify them. Ease of harvest and abundance in tissues like bone marrow and adipose tissue makes the cells attractive for various applications in regenerative medicine. The application of these cells in regenerative medicine will require isolation and identification of the cells from a mixture of other cell types. Numerous surface antigens have been shown to be expressed on MSCs, however, these markers are not specific for MSCs alone. The present studies focused on cells harvested from murine and human adipose tissues and were directed toward assessing the effectiveness of a panel of surface antigens attributed to MSCs for stability in culture, identification of MSCs and application in isolating the cells from other cell types. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) isolated from murine inguinal fat pads were sorted into cell subsets expressing CD73, CD90.2, and CD 105. The sorted and unsorted cells were assessed for in vitro and in vivo differentiation in order to determine the effectiveness of each marker to identify cells with high potential to differentiate toward osteogenic lineage. In vitro data showed that the CD73+ and CD105+ cell subsets displayed greater ability to differentiate toward the osteogenic lineage compared to the CD90.2+ subset. However, when the cell subsets were injected locally into mouse femur, no difference in osteogenic differentiation potential was observed. Therefore, this panel of surface antigens is not useful in identifying and isolating putative ADSCs from a variety of cell types. Human studies focused on assessing the effectiveness of early embryonic stem cell marker: Stage Specific Embryonic Antigen (SSEA-4). This antigen was shown to be expressed by MSCs isolated from bone marrow but its effectiveness in characterizing cells harvested from adipose tissue has not been established. Results showed that ADSCs sorted for SSEA-4 possessed a greater ability to differentiate toward the osteogenic, adipogenic, and neurogenic lineages in vitro. The evaluation of the sorted and unsorted cells also included the ability of cell subsets to heal critical sized defects in the calvarial. Data demonstrated that SSEA-4 Sorted and Unsorted ADSCs were able to regenerate a similar amount of bone in vivo. SSEA-4 Sorted and Unsorted ADSCs expressing BMP-2 demonstrated a similar rate of bone deposition; ADSCs expressing BMP-2 had the potential to regenerate a greater amount of bone than ADSCs which did not express the BMP-2 growth factor. Taken together, data indicate that SSEA-4 enriches for mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, however there is no significant difference between in vivo bone regeneration potential between Unsorted and SSEA-4 Sorted ADSCs. Because the cells are removed from their natural niche, the behavior of the cells in vitro compared to in vivo may be different due to culture conditions.\nThe rationale behind the present studies is to understand how the surface antigens can be utilized to isolate the cells with high osteogenic potential from a variety of other cells. It is well established that there are no specific markers available for the identification of the adult derived stem cells; analysis of the established surface antigens expressed by ADSCs with culturing offers means of assessing markers that can be applied to prospectively isolate a population of cells that exhibit high osteogenic potential as well as the potential to differentiate into other cell lineages. The data presented in this thesis have established that most of the surface markers attributed to mouse MSCs are unstable in culture; some markers are expressed at very high levels and are therefore inefficient in isolating cells that from other cell types. For human MSCs, the embryonic stem cell marker SSEA-4 was determined to significantly enrich for MSCs in vitro; however there was no significant difference for bone formation between Unsorted and SSEA-4 Sorted ADSCs in vivo.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2988], "author_name_tesi": "Maddox, Jacquelyln Renee", "last_name_ssi": "Maddox", "middle_name_ssi": "Renee", "first_name_ssi": "Jacquelyln", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Niyibizi", "Christopher Niyibizi", "Laura Carrel", "Henry Joseph Donahue", "Cara Lynne Schengrund", "Kent Eugene Vrana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Niyibizi, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Niyibizi, Committee Chair", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member", "Henry Joseph Donahue, Committee Member", "Cara Lynne Schengrund, Committee Member", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bone formation", "stem cell marker", "mesenchymal stem cell", "adipose derived stem cell", "SSEA-4", "osteogenic"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Inventory policies for perishable products with fixed shelf lives.\n\n\n", "id": "9086", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6421", "abstract_tesi": "The retail food industry has sales of over a trillion dollars. Most of these products are perishable in nature. This thesis deals with the development of multi period ordering policies for the perishable products with fixed shelf lives and finite replenishment lead times.\n\n In this thesis, simple ordering policies are developed by modifying the traditional EOQ model and base stock policies. The performance of both, the continuous review and periodic review policies, when applied to the perishable products with a fixed shelf life, is evaluated. Two categories of products\u2014one with short shelf lives and another with long shelf lives are considered. Within each category, the shelf life, lead time, order quantity and review periods are varied. For a given shelf life and lead time, the best review periods and order quantities are identified. Both the continuous review and periodic review policies are evaluated using simulation models under three different distributions of demand, using cost and service levels as performance metrics.\n\nFrom the results of the simulations, the impact of product perishability on the EOQ ordering policies is studied. In the periodic review policy, it was found that the traditional EOQ base stock policy is optimal for the perishable products in almost all cases. For the continuous review policy, while perishability was not a factor, an increment of the computed EOQ value was found to be optimal due to lead time consideration. \n\nIn general, with the proper choice of review periods and order quantities, the EOQ policies that are optimal for the non perishable products can also be used for the perishable products. Comparisons are also done between the relative performances of the periodic and continuous review policies. Overall, the continuous review policy gave a lower cost of operation for similar customer responsiveness measures.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6422], "author_name_tesi": "Madduri, Venkata Sree Raghuram", "last_name_ssi": "Madduri", "middle_name_ssi": "Raghuram", "first_name_ssi": "Venkata Sree", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran", "Arunachalam Ravindran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran, Thesis Advisor", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Simulation", "Fixed shelf lives", "Perishable products", "AutoMod"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Students\u2019 Perceptions of Social Relatedness in the Classroom: The Roles of Student-Teacher Interaction Quality, Children\u2019s Aggressive Behaviors, and Peer Rejection\n", "id": "12362", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5103", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study examines the roles of classroom characteristics (teacher-child interaction quality) as well as child characteristics (aggression and rejection) in children\u2019s perceptions of social relatedness in 1st, 3rd, and 5th grade classrooms.

Because of their unique role in the classroom, teachers may be able to shape children\u2019s peer relationships and social behavior even in the absence of direct social skills training. The present dissertation aimed to identify teaching behaviors and strategies that may be important influences on children\u2019s social development. This dissertation consists of two related papers, each exploring a single mechanism by which teachers were expected to influence children\u2019s social interactions and relationships. The first paper uses classroom seating charts to explore how seating arrangements are associated with changes in children\u2019s aggressive and prosocial behaviors across several months. The second paper examines whether teachers who are highly responsive to their students promote the development of high-quality classroom relationships within a single school year. Both studies capitalize on the rich data collected as part of the Classroom Peer Ecologies Project, a study of teaching practices, peer ecologies, and child outcomes. \n\nResults from the first paper suggest that seating arrangements may be a meaningful factor in the development of children\u2019s social behavior. Children who were initially aggressive had more severe behavior problems when classrooms were arranged as groups rather than rows. Popularity played an important role: In classrooms arranged as groups, less-aggressive children tended to become more similar to their aggressive seatmates, but only if seatmates were popular. Children who were unpopular were especially likely to adopt the prosocial behavior of their seatmates. Results from the second paper indicate, first, that subjecting classroom observation data to a bifactor analysis reveals a common factor which we labeled Responsive Teaching. Second, having highly responsive teachers protected children in aggressive contexts from developing low-quality relationships with their teachers and peers. Overall, this dissertation shows the value in understanding how the teacher may use both direct and indirect teaching strategies to manage the classroom. Results also underscore the importance of children\u2019s daily interactions with teachers and classmates, rather than just children\u2019s friends and peer group members. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9976], "author_name_tesi": "Madill, Rebecca Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Madill", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott David Gest", "Karen Linn Bierman", "Donna Coffman", "D Wayne Osgood"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott David Gest, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Linn Bierman, Committee Member", "Donna Coffman, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["teacher-child interactions", "teacher-child relationship quality", "elementary school", "seating arrangements"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A platform for evaluating embedded multi-core systems", "id": "tm70mv16z", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12814", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multiprocessor system on chip (MPSoC) such as the POWER8 processor is a heterogeneous multi- core architecture.

In the process of doing this we will be developing a generic methodology of significant protein identification for any disease. There are a number of oral anti diabetic drugs available in the market but none of them have worked effectively towards prevention and cure of the epidemic diabetes; none the less have adverse side effects. The reason for this is the lack of complete understanding of diabetes due to its complexity and the multifactorial components involved in disease onset and progression. A disease or a biological function can only rarely be attributed to a molecule - it is usually an interaction of numerous molecules that perform a function or bring about any change. So one just cannot look at the genes or proteins or metabolites; but needs to look at all of them and their interactions to come up with a good drug target. This is a more holistic approach of understanding disease and is called the systems biology based approach. A natural way to represent such discrete interacting units is a graph or network. \n\n\nDifferentially expressed protein ratios of morbidly obese patients before and after bariatrics surgery is obtained by researchers at the Hershey Medical Center which was used in this work. Surprisingly, some of the patients, who were diabetic before the surgery, were freed from diabetes. This observation led us to the hypothesis that the proteins expressed in the patients may be related to the potential drug targets for diabetes. In order to identify drug targets, we adopt a systems biology approach i.e. analyze the proteins observed from patients in the context of the entire human protein interactions. We believe that this approach will help us identify key proteins that play a major role in diabetes.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4402], "author_name_tesi": "Madireddy, Manini ", "last_name_ssi": "Madireddy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Manini", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Scanlon", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Scanlon, Thesis Advisor", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mass Spectrometry", "Diabetes", "Gene Filtering", "Complex Networks", "Systems Biology", "Biological Networks", "Protein Interaction Network", "Bariatric Surgery"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Efficient Evacuation For Disaster Management", "id": "27474", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9787", "abstract_tesi": "During an evacuation, evacuees experience congestion which leads to evacuation inefficiencies. The efficiency of an evacuation process is primarily determined by the decision adopted by the evacuees. There are two critical decisions that every evacuee has to make: (a) when to evacuate and (b) which route to take. In this thesis, we build mathematical models to study the impact of evacuee behavior on evacuation process and propose strategies to improve evacuation efficiency. \n\nOne of the first decisions an evacuee makes is the departure timing decision. Evacuee departure timing decisions are important as simultaneous evacuations leads to congestion. One of the reasons for near simultaneous departures is higher perceived risk of threat spread through social contacts. We built an individual level departure time choice model incorporating both evacuee individual characteristics and the evacuee social influence. We also propose a traffic control strategy to alleviate congestion. We find that the performance of an evacuation process can be improved by forcing a small subset of evacuees (inhibitors) in the low risk area to delay their departure. The performance of an evacuation is measured by both average travel time of the population and total evacuation time of the high risk evacuees. We derive closed form expressions for average travel time for ER random network. Further we perform detailed experimentation to study the impact of evacuee network topology, risk distribution and control strategy on evacuation performance. \n\nOnce an evacuee decides to evacuate they need to identify the best route to destination. During evacuation evacuees tend to behave non-altruistically and try to optimize their own individual utility. This leads to over utilization/ congestion on certain road segments. There are several traffic control strategies but most of them assume altruistic evacuee behavior. We propose traffic control strategies - blocking and throttling to improve evacuation efficiency. These strategies manipulate the evacuee behavior (i.e. routing choice) by altering the topology of the underlying transportation network.

The most abundant of these greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide (CO2), and as such CO2 always attracts special attention due to its prevalence over other GHGs. GHGs levels have increased tremendously over the years, contributing immensely to the global warming effects that the world is experiencing today. Natural gas exploration and production is one major source of CO2 emissions, taking into consideration all the pre-production and post-production stages. As such the Marcellus shale becomes an area of great interest because of its large gas reserve which is estimated to have a capacity of 30-300 TCF of recoverable gas. The breakthrough in present day exploration technologies, such as hydraulic fracturing, has made gas production in this area more feasible. Increase in CO2 emissions is a direct implication of all these activities and as such requires a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) system that will greatly assist in mitigating CO2 emissions in this region and the world as a whole. This research focuses on the CO2 emissions generated from the Marcellus shale activities, showing how an efficient CO2 transport system will assist greatly in achieving suitable GHG levels for this region. Current CO2 emission levels from the Marcellus shale are taking into consideration, and a CO2 transport system is designed from a number of analytical and statistical methods. This research shows that the best method to transport CO2 in the Marcellus shale region of Pennsylvania will be the pipeline method.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [947], "author_name_tesi": "Madu, Christian Chidi", "last_name_ssi": "Madu", "middle_name_ssi": "Chidi", "first_name_ssi": "Christian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Oyewole Samuel", "Samuel Oyewole", "Li Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Oyewole Samuel, Thesis Advisor", "Samuel Oyewole, Thesis Advisor", "Li Li, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CO2 transport", "Emissions", "Greenhouse Gases", "Marcellus shale", "Pipeline", "Wells"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Essays on Repeated Games", "id": "5972", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1709", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-08-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The problem of equilibrium selection in repeated games is approached by incorporating\nexplicit models of players\u2019 decision processes into the repeated game.

The neutron-kinetics code calculates the neutron flux and the resulting power distribution in the core, which it passes to the thermal-hydraulics code, which in turn solves the heat transfer in the fuel rods, and the energy, momentum, and mass equations for each phase of the coolant, passing back to the neutron-kinetics code the feedback from the fuel and coolant conditions. The spatial exchange of feedback parameters currently is performed in a coarse-mesh framework based on assembly-wise neutronics model and channel-wise model in thermal-hydraulics.\nWhile current methods are adequate for many applications, there has been a tendency in recent years toward greater heterogeneity in reactor cores, due to the use of mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, burnable absorbers, and longer cycles with consequently higher fuel burnup. The resulting asymmetry of the neutron flux and energy spectrum between regions with different compositions causes a need to account for the directional dependence of the neutron flux, instead of the traditional diffusion approximation. Furthermore, the presence of both MOX and high-burnup fuel in the core increases the complexity of the\niv\nheat conduction. The heat transfer properties of the fuel pellet change with irradiation, and the thermal and mechanical expansion of the pellet and cladding strongly affect the size of the gap between them, and its consequent thermal resistance. These operational tendencies require higher fidelity multi-physics modeling capabilities, and this need is addressed by the developments performed within this PhD research.\nThe dissertation describes the development of a High-Fidelity Multi-Physics System for Light Water Reactor Analysis. It consists of three coupled codes \u2013 CTF for Thermal Hydraulics, TORT-TD for Neutron Kinetics, and FRAPTRAN for Fuel Performance. It is meant to address these modeling challenges in three ways: (1) by resolving the state of the system at the level of each fuel pin, rather than homogenizing entire fuel assemblies, (2) by using the multi-group Discrete Ordinates method to account for the directional dependence of the neutron flux, and (3) by using a fuel-performance code, rather than a Thermal Hydraulics code's simplified fuel model, to account for the material behavior of the fuel and its feedback to the hydraulic and neutronic behavior of the system. While the first two are improvements, the third, the use of a fuel-performance code for feedback, constitutes an innovation in this PhD project.\nAlso important to this work is the manner in which such coupling is written. While coupling involves combining codes into a single executable, they are usually still developed and maintained separately. It should thus be a design objective to minimize the changes to those codes, and keep the changes to each code free of dependence on the details of the other codes. This will ease the incorporation of new versions of the code into the coupling, as well as re-use of parts of the coupling to couple with different codes. In order to fulfill this objective, an interface for each code was created in the form of an object-oriented abstract data type. Object-oriented programming is an effective method for enforcing a separation between different parts of a program, and clarifying the communication between them. The interfaces enable the main program to control the codes in terms of high-level functionality. This differs from the established practice of a master/slave relationship, in which the slave code is incorporated into the master code as a set of subroutines.\nv\nWhile this PhD research continues previous work with a coupling between CTF and TORT-TD, it makes two major original contributions: (1) using a fuel-performance code, instead of a thermal-hydraulics code's simplified built-in models, to model the feedback from the fuel rods, and (2) the design of an object-oriented interface as an innovative method to interact with a coupled code in a high-level, easily-understandable manner. The resulting code system will serve as a tool to study the question of under what conditions, and to what extent, these higher-fidelity methods will provide benefits to reactor core analysis.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9223], "author_name_tesi": "Magedanz, Jeffrey William", "last_name_ssi": "Magedanz", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Armin Seubert", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Suzanne Michelle Shontz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova, Dissertation Advisor", "Maria Nikolova Avramova, Committee Chair", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Chair", "Armin Seubert, Special Member", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Suzanne Michelle Shontz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["coupled codes", "light water reactor simulation", "high fidelity", "fuel performance", "discrete ordinates"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "A Laboratory Investigation of Vapor-Grown Ice Crystals at Low Atmospheric Temperatures", "id": "6953", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4627", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-11-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An experimental system for controlled growth of small ice crystals has been developed and used to produce new measurements of ice crystal growth at low atmospheric temperature.

Furthermore, it was hypothesized that affective prosody would modulate effective connectivity. To investigate these questions data from a study utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging were examined using effective connectivity analyses and graph theory measures.  Results partially supported the hypotheses. At the group level, effective connectivity was observed only among regions identified by one of the neuroscience models. However, analyses revealed heterogeneity in effective connectivity at the individual level indicating that all regions were implicated in and functionally connected when children processed different prosodies. Moreover, analyses of graph theory metrics indicated that there were no differences in effective connectivity at the global network level, however there were differences in properties of specific nodes when children processed angry prosody relative to neutral prosody.

Dimension ICON Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) were utilized as measurement instruments. Onion and celery epidermal peels were used as test samples. High resolution images were taken of microfibril structure of cell walls. This research uncovered, for the first time, an unexpected architecture of intact plant cell wall utilizing extremely low force of the AFM tip in a liquid environment.  The newly discovered features include [1] the presence of single fibers, strands of several fibers and large bundles of fibers; [2] the layering of the fiber bundles; [3] the changes in angle of orientation of the fibers between layers, for example, in celery the top layer has an angle of 42 to 50 degrees and the second layer has an angle of 111 to 117 degrees; [4] possible evidence of slight twisting of the bundles. These features are significant because they give insight into the architecture of cell wall structure. The statistical analyses were able to provide a detailed description and understanding of both mechanical properties and experimental data. The results showed that: 1) AFM was determined as an effective method for nondestructive evaluation of materials in nano scale level; 2) an innovative Peak Force Tapping technique in AFM was used to scan the cell walls using extreme low forces (&#8776;200 picoN); 3) the AFM images showed the orientation of the microfibrils in the same cell were consistent, regardless of position of the cell; 4) it was determined that enzyme and buffer solutions had a negative influence on the stiffness and the strength of the cells\u2019 epidermis; 5) celery epidermis had comparable behavior to both viscoelastic and elastoplastic modeling in the linear region; 6) a simulation Model showed the force change as a function of calculated displacement in the same direction for plant cell wall microfibrils, primarily in the first layer; 7) the changes in microfibrillar orientation had an significant role in the change of elastic properties; 8) in modulus of elasticity analysis, onion had the least coefficient of variation (23% or 77% equality), representing the highest consistency during the data collection ; 9) the Young\u2019s modulus of onion and celery ranged from 0.2-4.9 MPa and 5-13 MPa, respectively; and 10) the stiffness of onion and celery ranged from 91 to 197 N/m  and from 98 to 525 N/m, respectively.

Emerging hypotheses linking hominin evolution and the environment present specific, testable predictions for hominin evolutionary responses to different modes of environmental change.  Yet, discontinuous terrestrial sediment sequences coupled with indirect proxy indicators for plants and water obscure environmental perspectives on the hominin fossil record.  Opportunity to overcome these challenges is presented by lake and soil sediments from a preeminent hominin archaeological locality \u2013 Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania.  These extensive, well-constrained sediments have abundant organic matter, allowing for unparalleled resolution of biomarker data through time and space for an individual locality.    \n\nTo link the hominin archaeological record to local environmental conditions at Olduvai Gorge, I characterized distributions and stable isotope compositions (\u03b413C and \u03b4D) for a diverse suite of modern and sedimentary biomarkers.  Towards this end, I established a quantitative framework for reconstructing plant functional type (PFT) relative abundances in tropical ecosystems based on biomarker \u03b413C values from living plants by compiling previously published data relating (a) PFT to tropical ecosystem structure, (b) PFT to soil organic matter \u03b413C values, and (c) soil organic matter \u03b413C values to biomarker \u03b413C values.  Separation of previously published \u03b4D values for biomarkers from living plants according to PFT can elucidate differences in the biochemical and physiological influences on apparent fractionation between source-waters and biomarkers (\u03b5lipid/water). By extension, \u2018landscape\u2019 apparent fractionation factors are calculated from isotopic mass-balance of \u03b5lipid/water values via biomarker \u03b413C estimates for relative PFT abundances.  Using this novel approach to establish fractionation factors in dynamic environments, I then reconstructed \u03b4D values for precipitation and lake waters at Olduvai Gorge during the past.\n\nThe early Pleistocene is associated with a key adaptive juncture in hominin evolution \u2013 the emergence of our direct ancestor Homo erectus/ergaster.  To constrain local environmental conditions during this juncture, I measured \u03b413C and \u03b4D values for sedimentary biomarkers from a continuous sequence of lake sediments deposited between about 2.0 and 1.8 million years ago (i.e., the early Pleistocene) at Olduvai Gorge.  Biomarker \u03b413C values correlate strongly with changes in orbital geometry and tropical sea-surface temperatures during this interval, and reveal cyclic catchments-scale ecosystem shifts between closed woodlands and open grasslands.  After correcting measured biomarker \u03b4D values for \u2018landscape\u2019 apparent fractionation factors, reconstructed source-water \u03b4D values indicate lower amounts of precipitation fell on open grasslands (about 250 mm yr-1) as compared to closed woodlands (about 700 mm yr-1).  The scale and pace of environmental changes at Olduvai Gorge contrast with long-held views of directional or step-wise aridification in eastern Africa during the early Pleistocene.\n\nFaunal evolutionary responses to environmental change are strongly influenced by microhabitat (<100 m2) features.  To reconstruct fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in plants and water associated with hominin habitation, we measured the distributions and \u03b413C values for plant biomarkers (leaf-waxes, lignin and 5-n-alkyresorinols) preserved in time-equivalent soil sediments across the iconic FLK Zinjanthropus archaeological Level 22 (FLK Zinj) locality at Olduvai Gorge.  Central trenches of FLK Zinj are associated with low \u03b413C values for leaf-waxes and lignin monomers indicative of closed woodland habitat.  About 200 m to the north of the central trenches, abundant aquatic-plant and sedge biomarkers occur in conjunction with mound-like tufa deposits, suggesting wetland habitat near freshwater springs.  In contrast, southern trenches contain high \u03b413C values for leaf-waxes and lignin monomers indicative of open grassland habitat.  Taken together, these data delimit a heterogeneous microhabitat mosaic that is obscured in catchment-scale records of environmental change.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8282], "author_name_tesi": "Magill, Clayton R", "last_name_ssi": "Magill", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Clayton", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman", "Katherine Haines Freeman", "Lee Kump", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY", "Nina G Jablonski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman, Dissertation Advisor", "Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Chair", "Lee Kump, Committee Chair", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY, Committee Member", "Nina G Jablonski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biomarker", "isotope", "evolution", "Africa", "biogeochemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "SILENT VOICES: HOMELESS VETERANS\u2019 EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES AND \nPERCEPTIONS ON IDEALIZED DESIGN OF SCHOOLS\n", "id": "11010", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1382", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is a qualitative research investigation that explores the educational experiences and perceptions of homeless veterans.

In general, the method is applicable to any experiments in which a sequence of stimuli are presented to an organism while the binary responses of a large number of cells are recorded in parallel. The central concept underlying the approach is the total probability that a neuron responds to a random stimulus, called the neuronal sparsity. The model then estimates the distribution of response probabilities across the population of cells. Applying the method to single-unit recordings from the human medial temporal lobe, estimates of the sparsity distributions are acquired in  four regions: the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, the amygdala, and the parahippocampal cortex. The resulting distributions are found to be sparse (large fraction of cells with a low response probability) and highly non-uniform, with a large proportion of ultra-sparse neurons that possess a very low response probability, and a smaller population of cells which respond much more frequently.

In particular, this research is motivated by the need for resource sharing in systems such as mobile adhoc networks (MANETs), web servers, software agents, etc. In that light, consideration is of queueing models with two classes of traffic that have widely varying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements but\nshare the available resources. The objective here is to consider performance measures of both the classes so that the resources are utilized efficiently.\nTwo independent approaches viz. macroscopic and microscopic are considered in this research. In the macroscopic approach, the granularity of information is at the request or file level where an entire document, file or request is considered as a single piece of information. However, in the microscopic approach, information is considered at the packet level whereby a document is broken into several quanta of information packets. As a result, the macroscopic approach uses discrete models for traffic and the microscopic approach uses fluid models since the packet level traffic flows like a fluid. In the discrete model, measures such as availability and average delay of a request are considered to evaluate the QoS, whereas, in the fluid model, availability and delay for each packet do not mean much to the end user. Therefore, both the systems differ in modeling and analysis in order to compute various performance measures.\nThe macroscopic approach considers a server that supports two classes of requests, streaming and elastic. A policy is formulated wherein resources are shared between these two classes in such a manner that QoS of both the classes are considered and honored simultaneously. This policy is modeled and compared against two other policies that are\nbased on the modeling approaches prevalent in the literature. In practical applications,\nsince the information flow into the system is often time-varying, illustration, here, is of how resources can be dynamically adjusted between the two classes to provide favorable QoS.\nThe microscopic approach considers a server that attends to two classes of fluid. This study formulates a system in which resources of the server are shared between the two classes dynamically based on the content of fluid waiting to be served. The system is modeled and performance measures of both the classes are obtained. Finally, the performance measures are combined to develop an optimization problem and design the parameters that influence the dynamics of resource sharing between the two classes.\nThe main contribution in both the macroscopic as well as the microscopic approach is to model the two classes and obtain various performance measures by taking into account the complexity involved due to resource sharing. Thus, this thesis provides methodologies for solving resource sharing queueing problems at different abstraction levels and illustrates how these models can be applied in computer systems. The conjecture is that this research would not only lead to some more innovative queueing applications but also\nhelp researchers understand more complex problems and solve them.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6039], "author_name_tesi": "Mahabhashyam, Sai Rajesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Mahabhashyam", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sai Rajesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Natarajan Gautam", "Tom Michael Cavalier", "Susan H Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Chair", "Natarajan Gautam, Committee Chair", "Tom Michael Cavalier, Committee Member", "Susan H Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stochastically varying service rates", "Buffer content analysis", "Resource sharing", "Large deviations", "Multiclass applications", "Apllied Probability", "Queueing models", "Semi-Markov process"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Exploring Changes in Food Meanings and Food Choices Among Asian Indian Hindu Brahmins in State College, PA: A Grounded Theory Approach", "id": "6196", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4520", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Immigration to a new cultural context leads to acculturation or the movement of traditional food-related values and behavior from one\u2019s own culture to that of the host country\u2019s (Mavreas et al. 1989).

Physical properties of a sample can determine the success of a microbicide in terms of both acceptability of the product and drug delivery; understanding the relationship between acceptability and physical properties is a critical step in the rational design of microbicide products.  However, acceptability data is affective and thus only reflects participant preferences for a product while instrumental data, though reliable and extensive, does not necessarily measure qualities that are relevant to human perception.  Linking instrumental data and acceptability data often requires the additional step of quantifying human perception of product attributes.  While the microbicide field is beginning to recognize the need for perceptual data, this step has already been filled and refined in the food and consumer product industry through descriptive analysis.  \n\nTo demonstrate a potential application of descriptive analysis to the microbicide field, a sample set of six over-the-counter vaginal products (Astroglide, PreSeed, KY, Replens, RepHresh, and Gynol) were subject to descriptive analysis, using a panel of 10 individuals, to quantify perceptual attributes and instrumental analysis, using a rheometer, to collect rheological data.  Multivariate statistics were used to study relationships between the data sets.  Analysis showed that Gynol was the most perceptually different sample while PreSeed was the most rheologically different sample in the set; but patterns corresponding to intended function of the products were found within both the rheological and sensory data.  The indirect measurements of viscosity, G\u201d at 10 rad/s and K, appeared to predict stickiness, rubberiness, peaking, and uniform thickness.  However, strong relationships were not found between most rheological and sensory variables, meaning the most of the instrumental data collected either do not predict human perception of the sensory variables measured in this study or that they are incomplete measures of the underlying sensory constructs.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1724], "author_name_tesi": "Mahan, Ellen Daly", "last_name_ssi": "Mahan", "middle_name_ssi": "Daly", "first_name_ssi": "Ellen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John E Hayes", "John E Hayes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John E Hayes, Thesis Advisor", "John E Hayes, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["descriptive analysis", "rheology", "sensory", "multiple factor analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Prior Knowledge and Procedure-Based and Principle-Based Instructional Strategies on Students' Transfer of Principles", "id": "7540", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6526", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of worked examples that use two different types of instructional strategies on students\u2019 near and far transfer of complex (principle-based) mathematical problems.

Based on the results of an online pretest, students were divided according to low prior knowledge and high prior knowledge, and then randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, which included instructional text interspersed with conventional practice problems (control group), procedure-based worked examples or principle-based worked examples.  After the treatment phase, the students completed a test measuring near transfer and far transfer.\n\nA two-way MANOVA was conducted to test the main effects and interactions between the level of prior knowledge and the three instructional strategies. Data were analyzed with the near transfer and far transfer test items.  Overall, students in the principle-based worked examples group did not perform significantly better on near transfer and far transfer than the control or procedure-based examples groups. Students in the control condition, however, obtained significantly higher scores on the near transfer test than either worked examples group.  Thus, hypotheses 1 and 2 were not supported.  For students with high prior knowledge, there were no significant differences between the treatments for near or far transfer, so hypotheses 3 and 4 were also not supported.   For students with low prior knowledge, there was a significant difference between the near transfer scores, but not as predicted.  Specifically, students with low prior knowledge in the control group obtained significantly higher near transfer scores than students in the procedure-based group; however, there were no significant differences between the control group and principle-based group, or the procedure-based group and the principle-based group.   With regard to far transfer, test scores of the students with low prior knowledge were not significantly different between the three treatment groups.  Thus, hypotheses 5 and 6 were not supported.\n\nBased on the data, it was concluded that principle-based worked examples and procedure-based worked examples as designed/developed according to the component display theory are less effective than conventional practice problems for near transfer and not significantly different from conventional practice problems for far transfer.  Speculation about the results yielded the following possible explanations: (1) students in the control group may have been more likely to read the instructional explanations in the feedback than the students in the principle-based group, because the instructional explanations contained minimal information in the control group and elaborated information in the principle-based group;  (2) students may have paraphrased the instructional explanations in the principle-based group instead of generating their own explanations, which may have resulted in shallow learning and better performance only on test items very similar to worked examples; or (3) students with high prior knowledge may have found the procedure-based worked examples to be redundant and thus experienced high cognitive load, which may have interfered with learning.

In general, a low-bit-rate image\ntransmission system requires an outstanding image encoder that\nprovides both an excellent quality for the reconstructed image and\na high compression ratio. However, the resulting compressed bit\nstream becomes highly sensitive to channel noise. There have been\nseveral approaches to add error resiliency to an image coder. In\nthis work we concentrate on the use of joint source-channel (JSC)\nmethods. In particular, source-controlled channel decoding, based\non the residual redundancy in MPEG-4 compressed imagery, is\nconsidered. Here an embedded zerotree wavelet (EZW) algorithm is\nused to generate a compressed bit stream, which is then passed\nthrough a ring convolutional encoder (CE) and a CPFSK modulation\nsystem.

Unlike traditional approaches for linking the atomic structure to its equivalent continuum, this method directly connects the atomic degrees of freedom to a reduced set of finite element degrees of freedom without passing through an intermediate homogenized continuum. As a result, there is no need to introduce stress and strain measures at the atomic level. The Tersoff-Brenner interatomic potential is used to calculate the consistent tangent stiffness matrix of the structure. In this finite element formulation, all local and non-local interactions between carbon atoms are taken into account using overlapping finite elements. In addition, a consistent hierarchical finite element modeling technique is developed for adaptively coarsening and refining the mesh over different parts of the model. This process is consistent with the underlying atomic structure and, by refining the mesh to the scale of atomic spacing, molecular dynamic results can be recovered. This method is valid across the scales and can be used to concurrently model atomistic and continuum phenomena so, in contrast with most other multi-scale methods, there is no need to introduce artificial boundaries for coupling atomistic and continuum regions. Effect of the length scale of the nanostructure is also included in the model by building the hierarchy of elements from bottom up using a finite size atom cluster as the building block. To be consistent with the bravais multi-lattice structure of sp2-bonded carbon, two independent displacement fields are used for reducing the order of the model. Sparse structure of the stiffness matrix of these nanostructures is exploited to reduce the memory requirement and to speed up the formation of the system matrices and solution of the equilibrium equations. Applicability of the method is shown with several examples of the nonlinear mechanics of carbon nanotubes and carbon nanocones subject to different loadings and boundary conditions.\n\nThis finite element technique is also used to study the natural frequencies of low-dimensional carbon nanostructures and comparing the results with those of a homogenized isotropic continuum shell. Conclusion is that, replacing the atomic lattice with an isotropic continuum shell for a graphene sheet does not significantly affect the vibration frequencies while in the case of carbon nanotubes and carbon nanocones there is a significant difference between the natural frequencies of the atomistic model and its continuum counterpart. In the case of the carbon nanotube, continuum model successfully captures the beam bending vibration modes while overestimating frequencies of the modes in which the cross-section undergoes significant deformation. Furthermore, in the case of carbon nanotubes, the continuum shell exhibits a torsional mode which appears to be an artifact resulting from the small nominal thickness typically used in the continuum shell approximation of these nanostructures. Results of this study indicate that isotropic continuum shell models, while simple and useful in static analysis, cannot accurately predict the vibration frequencies of these nanostructures.\n\nWe have studied the bistable nature of single-walled carbon nanotubes by investigating the change in the tube's energy as it is compressed between flat rigid indenters of various widths.  Assuming the nanotube deformed uniformly along its length and modeling the cross-section as an inextensible, non-linear beam we found that tubes with a radius greater than 12 are bistable and that tubes with a radius greater than 25 have a lower energy in the collapsed state than in the inflated state.  The difference in energy between the collapsed and inflated states decreases nearly linearly with increasing tube radius. While the inflated state remains stable for tubes of all diameters, the energy barrier keeping the tube from collapsing approaches zero as the tube radius increases.  We also demonstrate why collapse with a wide indenter may be difficult to observe in narrow tubes.\n\nA reduced-order model is developed for the dynamics of the carbon nanotube atomic force microscope probes. Bending behavior of the nanotube probe is modeled using Euler\u2019s elastica. A nonlinear moment-curvature relationship is implemeneted to account for the ovalization of the cross section of the nanotube during bending. Van der Waal forces acting between tube and the substrate is integrated over the surface of the tube and used as distributed follower forces acting on the equivalent elastica. Approximating the behavior of the nanotube with an elastica proved to be a very effiecient technique for modeling these nanostructures. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7407], "author_name_tesi": "Mahdavi, Arash ", "last_name_ssi": "Mahdavi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Arash", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric M Mockensturm", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Dr Kon Well Wang", "Panagiotis Michaleris", "Mary I Frecker", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric M Mockensturm, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Chair", "Dr Kon Well Wang, Committee Member", "Panagiotis Michaleris, Committee Member", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Finite Element", "Nanomechanics", "Carbon Nanotube", "Multisclae", "Nonlinear", "Continuum Mechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "VITAMIN K2 (MENAQUINONE-7) PRODUCTION BY BACILLUS SUBTILIS NATTO IN A BIOFILM REACTOR", "id": "15017exm329", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15017", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Menaquinone-7 (MK-7), a subtype of vitamin K, has received significant attention due to its effect on improving bone and cardiovascular health.

Previous studies indicate that static fermentation is associated with pellicle and biofilm formations, which are critical for MK-7 secretion while posing significant operational issues. Therefore, the present study is undertaken to evaluate the possibility of using biofilm reactors as a new strategy for MK-7 fermentation. \nIn the first phase of the study, 15 Bacillus species namely Bacillus subtilis natto, Bacillus licheniformis, and Bacillus amyloliquifaciens as well as 4 plastic composite supports (PCS) were investigated in terms of MK-7 production and biofilm formation. Results show the possibility of using a biofilm reactor for MK-7 biosynthesis.

Using response surface methodology (RSM), optimum growth parameters including temperature, pH, and agitation were determined in a glycerol-based medium. Results were presented in a statistical model (R2=0.90), leading to optimum growth conditions of temperature (35\u00b0C), agitation (200 rpm) and pH (6.58).

The obtained concentration was 58% higher as compared to the suspended-cell culture (7.7\u00b11.5 mg/L). \nThen, in order to optimize the same fermentation growth parameters for MK-7 production in the glucose-based medium, Central Composite Design (CCD) was carried out along with supplementary runs to determine the optimum conditions. The biofilm reactors were able to produce a maximum concentration of 18.4\u00b10.8 mg/L of MK-7, which was 237% higher than the suspended-cell fermentation. \nThe next phase was undertaken to utilize biofilm reactor by optimizing the components in the glucose-based medium. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to determine optimum concentrations of three major medium components (glucose, yeast extract, and casein). Maximum MK-7 concentration in biofilm reactors was achieved as 20.46\u00b10.51 mg/L, which was 344% higher compared to the suspended-cell reactors containing the same optimum media composition. \nLater, optimization phases were undertaken to utilize biofilm reactors in investigating and optimizing different media components in the glycerol-based medium. By using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), the effects of glycerol, yeast extract, and soytone were studied in the fermentation medium on MK-7 production in biofilm reactor. With a composition of 45 g/L of glycerol, 5 g/L of yeast extracts, 10 g/L of soytone and 0.06 g/L of K2HPO4, MK-7 concentrations could reach 14.7\u00b11.4 mg/L in biofilm reactors, which was 57% higher compared to the MK-7 concentration achieved in suspended-cell reactor under similar conditions. While glycerol was depleted by the end of the fifth day in the biofilm reactor, it was never depleted in the suspended-cell reactor. Evidently, biofilm reactors present a reliable strategy likely to mitigate the operational issues with MK-7 biosynthesis at the industrial scale.  \nThen, fed-batch strategies were investigated for glucose and glycerol-based media, as carbon source addition seemed crucial in batch fermentations. Results indicated that fed-batch additions can be significantly effective in glucose-based medium, increasing the end product concentrations to 28.7\u00b10.3 mg/L of MK-7 which renders the biofilm reactors a potential replacement for static fermentation strategies with a maximum 32.5\u00b10.4 mg/L of MK-7. Moreover, morphological changes of the applied B. subtilis strain was tracked during the 12 day long runs and finally, SEM investigations confirmed robust biofilm and extracellular matrices formed on the Plastic Composite Supports (PCS) in the biofilm reactors. In conclusion, biofilm reactors especially with fed-batch fermentation regimes seem to be an effective tool to enhance MK-7 productions on industrial scales.\nIn order to reach the desired MK-7 quality, several downstream processing including extraction, drying, ultrasonication, etc. must be carried out after its biosynthesis in the broth. These processes, however, need to be carried out in such way to ensure least amount of losses and maximum recovery into the end-product. Therefore, in this phase of the study, drying, storage, and ultrasonication steps were evaluated under different conditions. Results showed that drying under forced air flow is not only fastest, but also demonstrated a better preservation of the vitamin and should replace the vacuum drying. Ultrasonication for 15 minutes seem to be harmless and sufficient for phase transition in analysis. Also, storage at refrigerated temperatures seem to preserve MK-7 at least for one week. Static liquid fermentations were conducted in McCartney bottles to explore the maximum MK-7 secretion potentials in different glycerol and glucose-based media compositions that were optimized in our previous studies. Maximum 32.5\u00b10.4 mg/L and 14.6\u00b10.4 mg/L concentrations were achieved in glycerol and glucose-based media respectively. Furthermore, fermentations in deeper culture tubes indicated how the MK-7 concentrations are distributed in different zones of the static liquid broth. Results in general, showed a clearer road map to ensuring better quality and preservation of the valuable end-product and enlightened more the path to further scaling up the fermentation process when compared with results obtained in optimized biofilm reactors in the previous steps.\nLast phase in the study was to mathematically model the findings in batch fermentations in the biofilm reactors and thus further elucidate the conditions governing fermentation. The logistic equation was modified to correlate substrate consumption with fermentation time and was utilized to model the substrate consumption in the four batch fermentations. Results indicated very accurate fits and therefore there is no need for more complex equations (R^2>0.953). Then, this successfully modified-logistic equation was inserted into the basic Luedeking-Piret equation modifying it to model MK-7 production based on substrate consumption. Furthermore, modified-Gompertz model was also used for the same purpose. Results indicated more accurate fits by the modified Luedeking-Piret equation (R^2=0.9705,0.943,0.970,and 0.959) compared to the modified-Gompertz (R^2=0.914,0.943,0.949 and 0.860). Yet, the modified Luedeking-Piret equation was a more complex model compared to the modified-Gompertz. \nIn summary, bench-top biofilm reactors were successfully constructed using suitable PCS and B. subtilis natto combination. Growth parameters including temperature, pH and agitation along with medium components including carbon and nitrogen sources in glycerol and glucose-based media were optimized using RSM. Results indicated significant enhancement of MK-7 production in biofilm reactors compared to suspended-cell bioreactors by up to 344%. Furthermore, the fermentation profiles indicated robust carbon source consumptions leading to substrate depletions around halfway of the fermentations. Thus, fed-batch substrate additions were investigated and results indicated up to 28.7\u00b10.3 mg/L MK-7 concentrations in the glucose-based medium with fed-batch additions. These concentrations are comparable with maximum concentrations coming from static fermentation counterparts (32.5\u00b10.4 mg/L). Finally batch results were mathematically modeled and optimum processing procedures were investigated. The result from this study show a potential for larger pilot scale fermentations in biofilm reactors and investigating downstream and in-situ recovery techniques on pilot scales.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16300], "author_name_tesi": "Mahdinia, Ehsan ", "last_name_ssi": "Mahdinia", "first_name_ssi": "Ehsan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali Demirci", "Ali Demirci", "Virendra M.

The work in chapters 2 through 4 examines mixed-substituent polyphosphazenes with fluoroalkoxy side groups.  Chapters 2 and 3 involve a synthetic route to mixed-substituent polyphosphazenes via side group replacement of fluoroalkoxy substituents.  The thermal and mechanical properties of mixed-substituent poly(fluoroalkoxyphosphazenes) are examined through varying the ratios of two fluoroalkoxy substituents.  These structure-property relationships and the potential use of these materials as fluoroelastomers are the subjects of chapter 4.  The specifics of chapters 2-4 are summarized below.  The work in chapter 5 concerns the synthesis and evaluation of mixed-substituent polyphosphazenes as single-ion conductors.  The synthesis of a sulfonimide functionalized side group for proton conducting fuel cell applications is the subject of the appendix and is also utilized in the work in chapter 5.  The specific details of the ionic conducting polymer studies are also summarized below. \n\n\n\tIn chapter 2, several poly(alkoxyphosphazenes) and poly(fluoroalkoxyphosphazenes) were synthesized and allowed to react with various organic nucleophiles.  Reactions were carried out at room temperature (25 oC) and at 67 oC in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and were monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy.  The possible use of single-substituent polymers as hydrolytically stable macromolecular intermediates for mixed-substituent polyphosphazene synthesis is discussed and factors that influence side group replacement in poly(organophosphazenes) are examined.  In addition, evidence for a random, irreversible SN2-like mechanism of side group replacement is presented.  The work in chapter 3 is complementary to chapter 2 and examines the equilibrium exchange reactions of fluoroalkoxy substituents and fluoroalkoxy nucleophiles.\n\n\n\tIn chapter 4, a series of poly(fluoroalkoxyphosphazenes) containing a mixture of 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoropentoxy and 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy substituents was synthesized.  The series included polymers with 25-94% incorporation of the trifluoroethoxy substituent, as well as single-substituent polymers with 100% octafluoropentoxy or trifluoroethoxy side groups. The polymers were analyzed by multi-nuclear NMR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and were subjected to limiting oxygen index and microtensile testing.  The variation in thermal and mechanical properties as a function of the side group ratios is discussed and polymers that may be suitable for fabrication into low temperature elastomer materials are identified.\n\n\n\tThe use and evaluation of mixed-substituent polyphosphazenes as single ion conductors is described in chapter 5.  Polyphosphazenes with both 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy and lithiated sulfonimide functionalized side groups were synthesized and characterized using multi-nuclear NMR, GPC, flame atomic absorption (FAA) spectroscopy, elemental analysis (EA), and DSC.  The sulfonimide functional group was lithiated via dialysis with aqueous lithium chloride solutions.  Lithiation was confirmed by FAA spectroscopy and EA.  The polymers were examined for their behavior as single ion conductors using impedence analysis.  The dependence of the conductivity on the macromolecular motion of the polymers and on the amount of sulfonimide functionalized side group is discussed.  \n\n\n\tChapter 6 briefly describes potential future research directions based on the work presented in chapters 2 through 5.\n\n\n\tThe appendix describes the synthesis of the sulfonimide functionalized side group.

Given the established benefits of SWL, it is important to understand the factors that influence SWL so strategies can be developed to enhance SWL. Physical activity (PA) is an established between-person, top-down predictor of SWL. More recently, the influence of PA has also been investigated from a within-person, bottom-up perspective. Although this approach has revealed a direct within-person association between PA and SWL in emerging adults, it has relied on self-reported PA and has not differentiated between low levels of activity and inactivity. A 14-day daily diary study was designed (1) to determine if the association between PA and SWL present using self-reported activity was also present using directly-measured activity and (2) to untangle the effects of PA and sedentary behavior (SB) on SWL. Results revealed that PA and SB had additive, within-person effects on SWL. People reported greater SWL on days when they were more active than was typical for them, and people reported lower SWL on days when they were more sedentary than was typical for them. Results were consistent across self-reported and directly-measured (in)activity. Additional analyses revealed that daily moderate-intensity PA appeared to drive the within-person association between self-reported PA and SWL; that the association between directly-measured moderate-intensity PA and SWL also was positive and trended toward significance.

On average, older adults spend more than 60% of their waking hours each day sitting \u2013 the most out of any segment of the population. Understanding the factors that contribute to this high volume health behavior and its consequences will facilitate the development of effective interventions to reduce sedentary time that also promote healthy and successful aging. This dissertation aims to (1) identify the motivational processes that contribute to sedentary behavior, (2) test relations between sedentary behavior and life satisfaction \u2013 an important indicator of well-being and successful aging in older adults, and (3) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary efficacy of a brief psychoeducational intervention designed to reduce older adults\u2019 sedentary behavior. A 14-day ecological momentary assessment study with ambulatory monitoring was conducted to capture time-varying and time-invariant motivation, behavior, and evaluations among older adults (n = 100). These data were used to test hypotheses about the motivational antecedents of daily sedentary behavior and hypotheses about relations between daily sedentary behavior and life satisfaction. Next, a brief psychoeducational intervention to reduce older adults\u2019 sedentary behavior was developed and implemented at local senior centers (n = 5). This intervention was evaluated in terms of feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary efficacy. Results of these studies led to five major conclusions. First, older adults\u2019 sedentary behavior is regulated by both controlled and automatic motivational processes. Second, both between-person and within-person motivational processes were associated with sedentary behavior. Third, sedentary behavior and life satisfaction were negatively linked through within-person processes. Fourth, older adults found the psychoeducational intervention approach to be engaging. Finally, the intervention reduced older adults\u2019 self-reported weekday sedentary behavior by approximately two hours more per day compared to the control group. Ultimately, this dissertation informs the development of interventions designed to reduce older adults\u2019 sedentary behavior to promote healthy and successful aging.

They must work in dynamic, rapidly changing environments and are expected to adapt while remaining composed and positive. Therefore, principals must utilize strategies and develop skills that enable them to interact with others consciously, with full awareness of how their actions impact themselves, others and their environments. Practicing mindfulness\u2014the ability to be self-aware, to observe and accept the thoughts, sensations, and emotions one experiences without attempting to alter them (Baer, 2003; Grossman, Niemann, Schmidt, & Walach, 2004; Kabat-Zinn, 1994; Marlatt & Kristeller, 1999), could be a valuable tool for school leaders, enabling them to contemplate the thoughts and sensations they experience, remain aware and attentive, and break habitual think-feel-act patterns. Such a practice could potentially help them reconfigure preexisting categories and examine biases that may exist by paying close attention to each situation and context (Langer, 1989), especially when making decisions. However, the effects of mindfulness practices on educational leaders remains unexplored. \nI address this research gap by using qualitative grounded theory to explore the influence of Cultivating Awareness and Resilience in Education (CARE), a mindfulness-based professional development program, on the leadership and well-being of 13 school administrators from a school district comprised of six schools situated in a rural cluster area in central Pennsylvania. Specifically, I examine: (a) the stressors school administrators face, (b) their experiences with the CARE program, and (c) receptivity to the CARE program. I collected data during the Spring 2016 semester by conducting in-depth interviews with 13 school administrators before and after the implementation of CARE program, shadowing their activities, attending the CARE program sessions as a participant observer, taking detailed field notes, and reviewing other artifacts. Employing the prosocial classroom model (Jennings & Greenberg, 2009) and using Mezirow\u2019s (1991) framework of adult transformative learning as a theoretical foundation, I engaged in an ongoing, iterative data analysis process, following the coding and interpretive analysis techniques of grounded theory. The findings show that the school administrators experience stress related to work, relationships and time. The CARE professional development program helped them deal with these stresses by improving their self-awareness, self-management, and self-compassion. Participants reported an improved ability to recognize their emotional reactions, which enabled them to better understand their leadership roles in shaping their school climates. The findings also show that the school administrators\u2019 motivation, their understanding of the value of mindfulness, and their personal and leadership dispositions mediated their receptivity to the CARE professional development program. \nThis study highlights the potential role of a school administrator\u2019s well-being in shaping the overall school climate, which could affect school improvement processes as well as student achievement. The findings reveal significant insights about the implementation of social-emotional, mindfulness-based professional development with school administrators and potential outcomes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14814], "author_name_tesi": "Mahfouz, Julia ", "last_name_ssi": "Mahfouz", "first_name_ssi": "Julia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah L.

Mobile telephone service serves as a perfect example for this trend \u2013 the global mobile-cellular subscriptions rose from 962 millions in 2000 to 5,373 millions in 2010 (ITU, 2012). Identifying which market factors influence this remarkable increase in subscriptions and how a mobile telephone market changes over time is crucial for understanding how this growth opportunity can benefit mobile telephone consumers, producers, and the society as a whole. \nThe demand for and supply of mobile telephone services across five developing countries in Southeast Asia are analyzed. This study contributes to the existing literature on telecommunications by using a disequilibrium approach which acknowledges the inherent lumpy capacity building aspect of the infrastructure investment along with the rapidly growing demand for mobile phone services.  Two specifications of this approach, the directional method and the two-step method, are employed. The first method utilizes a change in price to separate the observations into the demand and supply equations, then estimates the mobile demand and supply via a simple linear ordinary least squares regression. Alternatively, the second method uses a probit maximum likelihood estimation in the first stage to obtain the selectivity correction factors. The demand and supply equations, along with the correction factors, are then estimated via OLS in the second stage. \nThe findings suggest that a one-year lagged mobile subscription charges, a share of population in urban areas, a literacy rate, and an age-dependency ratio have significant impacts on mobile telephone subscriptions. However, an income effect reflected by GDP per capita has no effect. As for a supply for mobile telephone subscriptions, in addition to the one-year lagged mobile subscription charges, total number of staff, investment in and revenue generated from mobile phone services also affect the supply significantly. \nThe demand and supply curves generated from the parameters estimated indicate the existence of market disequilibrium, which results in deadweight loss for the society. The magnitude of deadweight loss generated vary across countries and time periods, with the mobile telephone market is in excess demand or excess supply. From 2003 onward, the mobile phone markets in Southeast Asia are under excess supply with a growing magnitude, causing mobile users the gainers from this social welfare loss. The Malaysian market is the nearest to the equilibrium levels. The demands for mobile phones in Philippines and Vietnam commence later and lag behind than those of their neighboring countries. These findings imply that policy makers should concentrate on both encouraging mobile phone service consumption, especially for the smartphones, and facilitating market activities along with incentivizing network expansions among the producers. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7604], "author_name_tesi": "Mahinchai, Montira ", "last_name_ssi": "Mahinchai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Montira", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["telecommunications", "mobile telephones", "disequilibrium", "southeast asia"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Vibration energy harvesting from rotorcraft drive systems using thermoelectric conversion of heat generated by mechanical damping", "id": "23693", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10808", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Energy harvesting from ambient structural vibrations on rotorcraft continues to generate increasing interest due to its potential use in powering wireless sensors for applications such as structural health monitoring. Vibration energy harvesters developed in the past have used piezoelectric or electromagnetic devices to convert mechanical work into electrical energy for use by accelerometers, strain gauges, or other devices. Vibrations from rotorcraft drive systems typically occur within a frequency range of 500 to 3000~Hz as a result of transmission gear meshing.\n\nAn alternative method for vibration energy harvesting employs a thermoelectric generator which converts thermal energy dissipated by a damped mechanical oscillator installed on the vibrating structure to electrical energy. Damping of the oscillator is provided by either a viscoelastic spring or by forces due to eddy current induction in a metal plate moving relative to a magnetic field.\n\nTwo harvester designs implementing oscillators damped by either viscoelastic or electromagnetic forces are described, and one-dimensional analytical models are developed to model heat generation and conduction for each design. Test articles are designed for experimental evaluation of the two heating methods, and the analytical models are used to predict the behavior of the test articles. An analogous thermal circuit model is used to model transient heat flow, and a finite element model is used to model magnetic flux distribution to aid in prediction of temperature response of the test articles.\n\nExperimental characterization of a stiff, low damping elastomer indicated decreasing stiffness and loss factor with increasing base acceleration. The average measured stiffness was found to be slightly lower than the expected value based on the material specification, and the average loss factor was also lower than expected but aligned with the expected value at low acceleration levels. An increase in the temperature of the viscoelastic test article driven at resonance was recorded at a slightly lower rate than predicted.\n\nInduction heating measurements of aluminum plates of varying thicknesses showed an increase in surface heating with plate thickness.

Measurement of the power output of two thermoelectric generators with changing surface temperature revealed differences in the response for upward and downward temperature change, indicating nonlinearities in the behavior of these units.\n\nResults of the study showed limited applicability of the considered approaches for high frequency vibration energy harvesting applications due to the long time required for heating of the elastomer, or the high velocities required for magnetic induction heating.

We implement a cost function that includes costs for the goal-level error, balancing overshooting and undershooting, and the range of motion. The selection of weights for each cost term determines the mean operating point and the dynamic stability.\n\nWe construct a virtual shuffleboard game to collect data for two experiments. In the first experiment, we introduce a penalty for overshooting the target. We observe identical stability properties both when the overshooting penalty is present and when absent. However, the mean operating point is set back from the target when the penalty is applied. We estimate the weights in cost function that subjects apply in both conditions and see more emphasis on balancing overshooting and undershooting with the penalty present. We are able to recreate the empirically observed behaviors in simulation using the estimated weights in the model.\n\nIn the second experiment, we reduce the required precision in the shuffleboard task by making the target area larger. We expect that control effort will be reduced since small body-level fluctuations from the mean remain within the target area. A slight reduction in control is observed, but we do not see a random walk around the target, which we would expect if error-correction were the only cost. Slight differences in the weights of the cost emerge as the target thickness changes.\n\nThis new control model demonstrates the importance of competing costs in explaining the behavior of human subjects. The model can be adapted for other non-shuffleboard tasks to include task-specific terms. Additionally, comparing the weights between subjects may be useful in differentiating or diagnosing pathological patients.

An emphasis is made on the characterization of defect complexes formed by the nearest neighbor pairing of acceptor dopant or impurity ions with oxygen vacancies.  By using a range of experimental techniques backed by a thorough re-analysis of studies available in the literature, a new model for the local interaction of oxygen vacancies with acceptor ions is presented.\n\n\tAn important conclusion of the presented material is that the method used to measure transport processes related to conductivity has a critical influence on the kinetic parameters that are obtained.  General expressions for vacancy mobility are typically applied over wide ranges of experimental and material parameters.  As depicted in Figure 1, however, the measurement technique that is used will typically probe orders of magnitude in length scale.  \n \nFigure 1  Local interaction of oxygen vacancies with acceptor defect centers at various length scales.\n\nThe interaction of oxygen vacancies with their local surroundings is influenced by changes in temperature, defect concentration, and applied electric bias.  By defining an oxygen vacancy potential energy landscape, a unified model for oxygen vacancy mobility can be derived that explains the dynamics of oxygen vacancies at all measurable length scales.\n\nLarge Length Scales (Oxygen Vacancy Mass Transport)\n\n\tA new scaling law that can be used to predict mean time to failure of multilayer ceramic capacitors is introduced.  The effectiveness of the common practice of using an Eyring equation to predict the rate of voltage accelerated resistance degradation in ceramic capacitors has recently been shown to decline when it is applied to the testing of samples with thin dielectric layers.  Using an electrochemically driven mass transport description of oxygen vacancy migration, the diffusion equation for oxygen vacancies can be derived.  This equation, when combined with the full expression for voltage-driven vacancy hopping, produces a better highly accelerated lifetime scaling law that better explains failure mechanism in capacitors with thin layers.\n\n\tLow temperature conductivity data for acceptor doped SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 are presented.  Ionic mobility and diffusivity measurements are typically made at high temperatures in order to speed up the kinetics of sample equilibration with the atmosphere as well as the mass transport of oxygen vacancies.  The interpretation of high temperature data can be difficult because additional charge compensation mechanisms must be accounted for, such as intrinsic Schottky disorder and impurity redox reactions.  To fit high temperature conductivity data, many unknown mass action and mobility parameters must be used to explain a single conductivity curve.  Additionally, the measurement of ionic mobility is difficult because high temperature conductivity is typically controlled by electronic carriers, leaving a small transference number for ionic conductivity.  High concentrations of oxygen vacancies can be quenched into a sample at low temperatures, ensuring that low temperature conductivity is controlled by ionic conduction.  This technique was used to measure the mobility of oxygen vacancies in acceptor doped BaTiO3 and SrTiO3.  The results of these experiments provided values for the enthalpy of migration of oxygen vacancies in the range of 0.7-0.8eV.  These measured values are substantially less than the values typically measured using high temperature conductivity methods.  However, these lower activation energy values agree well with measurements made using tracer diffusion experiments. \n\nIntermediate Length Scales (Distributed Dipole Relaxation)\n\n\tIn the past, defect dipole-related relaxations have been measured using thermally stimulated depolarization measurements in the SrTiO3 system as well as other materials in the paraelectric phase.  Here, data are presented that show, under dc bias, nearest neighbor defect dipoles do not align in the cubic phase of a material.  This result carriers strong implications, not only for the way some dielectric relaxations are characterized, but also for the analysis of ferroelectric aging mechanisms.  EPR analysis reveals that defect dipoles do not align under an applied field and that their association energies are on the order of 0.3eV.  A proposed model is introduced for the potential energy landscape of the oxygen vacancy sublattice in order to describe the temperature and concentration dependence of oxygen vacancy defect association.  This model is used to explain the thermally stimulated depolarization current measured in the iron doped SrTiO3 system.  It is determined that, even though nearest neighbor defect dipole alignment is not likely in this system, a net polarization of a distributed defect dipoles can explain the depolarization current and EPR behavior.\n\nSmall Length Scales (Nearest Neighbor Defect Interaction)\n\n\tFinally, data on the defect association of oxygen vacancies with manganese and iron acceptors in BaTiO3 single crystals is presented.  A new resonance feature is found in manganese doped BaTiO3 samples that is argued to be a signal related to   defect complexes.  It is determined, using Newman superposition analysis, that defect association is minimal for these particular systems doped with acceptor concentrations of 0.5mol%.    These nearest neighbor defect complexes only exist in small concentrations; they are not the majority Mn2+ related defect center.  These defect complexes are experimentally shown to orientate along the direction of spontaneous polarization in the ferroelectric phase.  The time-dependent orientation of these defect centers can be observed using in situ EPR techniques.  The relative signal intensity of these defect complexes, however, when compared to the signal intensity of fully coordinated manganese centers suggest that nearest neighbor oxygen vacancy defect association is minimal in this system.  As a result, higher order defect complexes (defect complexes with oxygen vacancies in next nearest, next next nearest, etc.. neighbor positions) must be considered when modeling oxygen vacancy transport in the vicinity of an acceptor point defect center.  \n\n\tIn conclusion, a first approximation potential energy landscape model, based on the assumption that Coulombic interactions provide a larger driving force for defect association compared to strain interactions, can be used to describe the effect of temperature, dopant concentration, and applied field on the distributed site occupancy of oxygen vacancies in the vicinity of a counter charged ion.  In the past, experimental techniques like EPR and bulk conductivity experiments have not been able to describe the local distribution of oxygen vacancies in the perovskite lattice.  Predicting the probability of site occupancy using the model introduced here allows a single, unified, physical description of the local lattice potential which describes the low temperature conductivity and depolarization phenomena.  The potential landscape model can also be used to explain the differences between defect association behavior in SrTiO3 and BaTiO3.  Proposed future EPR work will lead to an improved association model that can account for the combination of strain as well as electrostatic driving forces.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10197], "author_name_tesi": "Maier, Russell Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Maier", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Russell", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clive A Randall", "Susan\ufffdTrolier\ufffdMcKinstry", "Patrick M Lenahan", "Shujun Zhang", "Long Qing Chen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clive A Randall, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan\ufffdTrolier\ufffdMcKinstry, Committee Chair", "Patrick M Lenahan, Committee Member", "Shujun Zhang, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["oxygen vacancy", "EPR", "impedance", "defect complex", "ionic conductivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MORPHOLOGY STUDY OF ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAIC MATERIALS AND ELECTROACTIVE POLYMERS\n\n", "id": "8322", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "374", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ultrafast infrared polarization resolved pump/probe spectroscopy was used to study the anisotropy of the electroactive polymer 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (EHA).

Between 2001 and 2011, Pennsylvania residential electricity sales increased by two and a half times the number of new customers, accounting for almost one third of the state\u2019s total electricity consumption. Our ability to meet demand by acquiring new energy sources faces several challenges. Confusion surrounds the physical and economic accessibility of remaining fossil fuel sources. Immense land use requirements and subsequent environmental impacts challenge a total shift to renewable energy sources. The laws of thermodynamics limit the potential for new technology to efficiently convert raw energy to consumable sources. As a result, any rational strategy to meet future energy demands must involve conservation. \n\nConservation is a pro-environmental behavior, an act intended to benefit the environment surrounding a person. I posit that a transdisciplinary model, the community landscape model of the pro-environmental behavior, unifies the conceptually analogous - yet disparate - fields of landscape, community, and behavior towards explaining residential energy conservation actions. Specifically, the study attempted to describe links between the physical environment, social environment, and conservation behaviors through a mixed-method framework. Two Pennsylvania townships \u2013 Spring and East Buffalo townships \u2013 were selected from an analysis of housing, electricity consumption, and land cover trends. Key informants from both townships informed the design of a survey instrument that captured the utility consumption, residential conservation actions, energy and environmental values, types and levels of community engagement, perceived barriers, and socio-demographic information from 107 randomly selected households. \n\nA mixed-method analysis produced evidence that place-based values and intention to participate in the community were significantly linked to lower utility consumption in households.

This event seems to indicate that American neighborhoods are vulnerable to disturbances in the real estate market. Identifying this challenge provides an opportunity to explore innovative methods for assessing the vulnerability and sustainability of neighborhoods. The typical image of a suburb is commonly considered to be less sustainable, and more vulnerable, than typical urban cities. The historic spatial and demographic separation between private suburban housing and public urban housing seems to reinforce the perception that suburbs lack diversity. However there currently lacks a method for measuring diversity and vulnerability in neighborhoods.\n\nEcology provides good models for assessing vulnerability. Healthy ecosystems exhibit a strong relationship between diversity and a system\u2019s ability to adapt, or be resilient, to a changing environment (Folke 2002). This study translates this concept and proposes that diversity in a neighborhood can be measured by observing the differences, or the heterogeneity, of a neighborhood\u2019s physical and demographic attributes. Sustainable neighborhood planning attributes are identified in the United States Green Building Council\u2019s (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Neighborhood Development rating system (LEED 2010), and the Congress for New Urbanism\u2019s Charter (CNU 2011). Greendale, Wisconsin is an ideal location for this project because of its history of progressive social and economic goals, its variety of spatial qualities, and its robust composition of attributes as a greenbelt town. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and U.S. Census data are used to measure and visualize the spatial distribution for each attribute in Greendale. This information was observed at the neighborhood, subdivision, and individual property lot scale.\n\nInterpretations of spatial distribution identify several common concepts related to the spatial configuration, livability, social, and landscape qualities of the neighborhood. Future research directions consider the role of spatial distribution in planning documents, such as LEED-ND and Congress for New Urbanism Charter.

A background of the characterization methods I use in this thesis, conducting probe atomic force microscopy (cp-AFM) and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), is provided in chapter 1.  Several attempts are performed to create the ideal top metal contacts on SAMs by metal vapor phase deposition in order to prevent the metal penetration inducing critical defects of the molecular electronic devices.    The scanning probe microscopy (SPM), such as cp-AFM, contact mode (c-) AFM and non-contact mode (nc-) AFM, in ultra high vacuum conditions are utilized to study the process of the metal-SAM interface construction in terms of the correlation between the morphological and electrical properties including the metal nucleation and filament generation as a function of the functionalization of long-chain alkane thiolate SAMs on Au.  In chapter 2, the nascent condensation process of vapor phase Al deposition on inert and reactive SAMs are studied by SPM.  The results of top deposition, penetration, and filament generation of deposited Al are discussed and compared to the results previously observed by spectroscopic measurements.  Cp-AFM was shown to provide new insights into Al filament formation which has not been observed by conventional spectroscopic analysis.  Additionally, the electronic characteristics of individual Al filaments are measured. Chapter 3 reveals SPM characterization of Au deposition onto \u2013COOH terminated SAMs utilized with strong surface dipole-dipole intermolecular interaction based on hydrogen bonding and ionic bonding potentially preventing the metal penetration.  The observed results are discussed with kinetic paths of metal atoms on each SAM including temporal vacancies controlled by the intermolecular interactions in SAM upon the comparison with the spectroscopic results previously reported.  The results in chapter 2 and 3 strongly suggests that AFM based characterization technique is powerful tool especially for detecting molecular-size local phenomena in vapor phase metal deposition process, especially, the electric short-circuit filaments growing through SAMs, which may induce critical misinterpretation of M3 junction device properties.  In chapter Chapter 4, an altered metal deposition process on inert SAM with using a buffer layer is performed to diminish the kinetic energy of impinging metal atoms.  SPM characterization reveals an abrupt metal-SAM interface without any metal penetration.  Examined electric characteristics also revealed typical non-resonant tunneling characteristics of long chain alkane thiolate SAMs.  In chapter 5, the buffer layer assisted growth process is used to prepare a nano particles-SAM pristine interface on SAMs to control the metal-SAM interaction in order to study the fundamental issue of chemical enhancement mechanism of SERS.  Identical Au nanoparticles-SAM-Au M3 structures with different Au-SAM interactions reveal a large discrepancy of enhancement factors of ~100 attributed to the chemical interaction.  In chapter 6, Raman spectroscopy of M3 junction is applied to the characterization of molecular electronics devices.  A crossed nanowire junction (X-nWJ) device is employed for in-situ electronic-spectroscopic simultaneous characterization using Raman spectroscopy.  A detailed study reveals the multi-probe capability of X-nWJ for in-situ Raman and in-elastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) as vibrational spectroscopies to diagnose molecular electronic devices.  In chapter 7, aniline oligomer (OAn) based redox SAMs are characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic methods under different chemical redox states by reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), Raman, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and AFM in order to elucidate the mechanism of electric switching molecular junctions previously reported.  Obtained results are discussed in terms of the chemical and geometrical conformations of molecules in closely packed SAM domains.  In chapter 8, in-situ Raman spectroscopy and cp-AFM microscopic techniques are applied to study the electric switching characteristics of X-nWJ incorporating OAn based SAM.  The results of tunneling current and in-situ Raman spectroscopy are discussed with the conformational change of OAn component.

Recently, research emphasis is leaning towards barium-based relaxors, as these are environmental friendly lead free oxide. Among the doped BaTiO3 systems, BaZrxTi1-xO3 (BZT) solid solution has attracted considerable attention in both bulk and thin film due to its potentiality for various device applications. Although BaTiO3-BaZrO3 system was identified as a solid solution as in early 1950s most studies were focused on the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant, the nature of the phase transitions and the ferroelectric relaxor behavior of this materials in lower concentration (x< 0.40) of Zr in Ba(ZrxTi1-x)O3 system over the years. In this thesis, we have studied structure-property correlation of the various Ba(ZrxTi1-x)O3 compositions and a new complete phase diagram of Barium Zirconate Titanate, Ba(ZrxTi1-x)O3 has been developed in the composition range 0&#8804;x&#8804;1.00. Barium Zirconate Titanate, Ba(ZrxTi1-x)O3 system depending on the composition, successively depicts the properties extending from simple dielectric (pure BaZrO3) to polar cluster dielectric, relaxor ferroelectric, 2nd order like diffuse phase transition, ferroelectric with pinched phase transitions and then to a proper ferroelectric (pure BaTiO3). So far there has been no other single solid solution system that demonstrates all complex aspects of ferroelectricity.\nBa(ZrxTi1-x)O3 (BZT) ceramics of the several compositions have been prepared by convention solid state synthesis route. All the BZT compositions were verified to be single phase perovskite by studying the room temperature XRD behavior of these compositions. Dielectric behavior of the BZT ceramics has been studied with and without bias in the temperature range from 300 K to 15 K. The dielectric properties of the material show typical relaxor-like behavior for the BaZrxTi1-xO3 compositions with 0.25<x<0.75. However, in the Zr4+ rich BaZrxTi1-xO3 solid solution compositions (0.80&#8804;x&#8804;1.00) polar cluster like behavior has been observed\nIn contrary to the classic relaxor ferroelectrics like PMN, PZN etc where intrinsic disorder prevails, in our present investigation we have introduced the disorder gradually through breaking the long range translational symmetry of BaZrO3 by the incorporation of Ti4+ ion in BaZrO3 lattice to observe the relaxor behavior in a non-ferroelectric material like BaZrO3 with low dielectric constant (<40). From the thermal hysteresis in dielectric behavior and d.c. field dependent dielectric studies it has been concluded that with the incorporation of Ti4+ ion in the BaZrO3 matrix BaZrxTi1-xO3 compositions (x&#8805;0.80) start showing polar-cluster like behavior. Beyond an optimum content of polar BaTiO3 in the non polar matrix of BaZrO3 probably a critical size and distribution density of the polar regions are reached when polar cluster like BaZrxTi1-xO3 ceramics start showing the relaxor-like behavior (x&#8804;0.75). This has been further confirmed from the calculation of degree of relaxation (&#947;) and Vogel-Fulcher freezing temperature (TVF).\nTo enhance our understanding the relaxor behavior in BaZrxTi1-xO3 ceramics pyroelectric, thermal strain measurements have been carried out from the cryogenic temperature to very high temperature (~650 K). Powder neutron diffraction measurements have been carried out to determine the structure of the BZT relaxor compositions. Structural analysis of the powder neutron diffraction by Rietveld refinement reveals the global structure of the BZT relaxors as cubic. High q-resolution neutron scattering data has been collected on the BZT relaxor compositions by triple axis spectrometer. However, no such splitting in the Bragg peaks of BZT ceramics has been observed even at 4 K and mirror the results obtained from the powder neutron diffraction data predicting the global structure of BZT relaxors as cubic. The local structure of the BZT ceramics has been investigated by Raman spectra. It is seen from the Raman investigation that local polar regions exist in the BZT ceramics even at 550 K at which temperature both end members of the phase diagram BaZrO3 and BaTiO3 are cubic in pure form. From the detailed investigation on the structure and properties of BaZrxTi1-xO3 compositions it can be said that BZT is an engineered material designed by self-assembled polar nano-regions resulting some unusual properties, which can not be predicted from its constituents BaTiO3 and BaZrO3. Hence BaZrxTi1-xO3 is qualified as meta-materials. \nFurther we have shown that one can engineer a meta-material, which can show dielectric relaxation behavior even none of the constituents of the materials does not show such properties. We have shown a potential approach to fabricate the relaxor materials by making the ceramic composite of environmental friendly Ba-based diffuse ferroelectric BaZrxTi1-xO3 (x= 0.20 and 0.25) with non-ferroelectric MgO. \nMagnetoelectric composites were prepared using both conventional sintering and single mode microwave sintering techniques in the environment of the E-field. In thesis work PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3-31% PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) has been used as the ferroic material and ferrites like CoFe2O4 and Mn0.1Zn0.9Fe2O4 are used as the magnetostrictive materials to make the magnetoelectric metamaterial composites. The magneto-electric coefficients on these samples were calculated by applying the magnetic field and observing the changes in the electric polarization in the composites. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6293], "author_name_tesi": "Maiti, Tanmoy ", "last_name_ssi": "Maiti", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tanmoy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amar S Bhalla", "Ruyan Guo", "Leslie Eric Cross", "Dinesh Kumar Agrawal", "Jiping Cheng"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Amar S Bhalla, Committee Chair", "Ruyan Guo, Committee Chair", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member", "Dinesh Kumar Agrawal, Committee Member", "Jiping Cheng, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Relaxor Ferroelectrics", "Magnetoelectrics", "Nanocomposite", "Electroceramics", "Metamaterial"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Conceptual Model of Nontornadic Supercell Thunderstorms", "id": "9881", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4593", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study uses dual-Doppler observations of nontornadic supercells obtained by ground-based mobile Doppler radars and idealized numerical simulations in order to develop a conceptual model of a nontornadic supercell, particularly at low levels and on the submesocyclone scale.  There are relatively few dual-Doppler studies of supercells in the history of severe storms research owing to the relative rarity of supercell occurrences within dual-Doppler radar networks, and the majority of the dual-Doppler studies feature tornadic supercells.  Moreover, the submesocyclone scale and lowest few hundred meters generally have not been well-observed in prior studies, which usually have analyzed either pseudo-dual-Doppler airborne radar observations or data from fixed radar networks.  In addition to the fact that a steady state must be assumed for relatively long time periods when analyzing dual-Doppler observations from airborne radars (typically 5-7 minutes), the resolution is coarser than what is afforded by ground-based mobile radars because aircraft must maintain larger distances from the mesocyclone for safety reasons.  In regards to ground-based dual-Doppler networks comprising fixed radars, the baselines are usually long (40-75 km baselines are common); thus, the centers of the dual-Doppler lobes, where the geometry is most favorable for accurate wind retrievals, are at a greater range from the radars, resulting in a relatively coarse resolution and inability to observe the lowest few hundred meters owing to radar horizon limitations. In the first part of this dissertation, five nontornadic supercell thunderstorms are analyzed using high-resolution dual-Doppler radar data obtained by a pair of mobile ground-based radars. Three out of five observed supercells had well-developed low-level rotation. The observed low-level kinematic fields of the nontornadic supercells with low-level rotation are compared to the low-level kinematic fields of tornadic supercells that have been previously documented. In previous studies, tornadic and nontornadic supercells have had strikingly similar kinematic characteristics on the mesocyclone scale.  Thus, discrimination between tornadic and nontornadic supercells has been very difficult (probably fewer than 25\\% of supercells are tornadic). \n\nIt is determined that the observed low-level kinematic structure of nontornadic supercells is qualitatively very similar to the low-level kinematic structure of tornadic supercells, notably two out of three observed nontornadic storms had a ``bent-back' rear-flank gust front just like the tornadic supercells, and one of those also had a dual rear-flank gust front, a feature that previously has been observed only in tornadic supercells. The low-level mesocyclone in the nontornadic supercells extends to the lowest analysis level in the three cases having low-level rotation, but the low-level circulation in nontornadic mesocyclones is much weaker than in tornadic mesocyclones. Also, the divergence associated with rear-flank downdrafts is stronger in nontornadic supercells than in tornadic supercells. Vortex line analyses in the observed nontornadic storms show that the vorticity field structure is consistent with baroclinic generation of horizontal vorticity and subsequent tilting into the vertical by an updraft, as has been shown in recent observational and numerical simulation studies.\n\nOne major limitation of the observational part of this study is the lack of thermodynamic observations.  Thermodynamic retrievals from the dual-Doppler wind syntheses were found to be insufficiently accurate for any rigorous quantitative analysis.  In the second part of this study, a series of idealized, dry three-dimensional numerical simulations are used to gain some understanding of the relationship between the low-level thermodynamics and kinematics of supercells, assuming that the idealized simulations can replicate the evolution of the low-level kinematic fields observed in actual supercells.  The idealized simulations emulate the generation of near-surface rotation beneath supercell-like (i.e., helical) updrafts in a way consistent with our present understanding of the importance of a downdraft in environments in which vertical vorticity is initially absent at the surface.  In the simulations herein, the initial conditions are specified to be horizontally homogeneous but vertical wind shear and veering winds with height are present.  A heat source is introduced,  resulting in a cyclonically rotating updraft having maximum rotation at midlevels and no rotation at the surface.  Once an approximately steady state is achieved, a heat sink is introduced at low levels in proximity to the helical updraft.  The resulting downdraft and outflow generate rings of baroclinic horizontal vorticity that encircle the heat sink, and this vorticity is subsequently tilted by the vertical velocity gradients associated with the downdraft-updraft couplet such that a couplet of vertical vorticity develops at the surface, straddling the line that joins the downdraft and updraft extrema.  The intensity of the vortices that develop at the surface depends on the degree to which the baroclinic vorticity can be tilted and stretched, which depends in large part on the extent to which the negatively buoyant low-level air originating in the heat sink can be lifted by the overlying updraft driven by the heat source.  \n\nIn all cases, the cyclonic member of the vorticity couplets that develop at the surface become dominant, and this bias is presumably attributable to the overlying updraft possessing updraft-scale cyclonic rotation.  The most intense cyclonic vortices develop when the outflow and associated baroclinic horizontal vorticity from the heat sink is strong enough to spread beneath the overlying updraft, but is not so cold that the air parcels within the outflow cannot be drawn upward by the overlying updraft.  Three modes of what  is referred to as \"tornadogenesis failure\" also are noted.  (Even though the simulations do not explicitly resolve tornado-scale motions, we casually use the terminology \"tornadogenesis failure\" to refer to the inability of intense sub-mesocyclone-scale vortices to develop in the model.)  The first failure mode occurs when the cold pool does not develop or just a weak cold pool (potential temperature deficits near the vortex less than 2 K) develops briefly. In the presence of a stronger cold pool, the baroclinically generated vortex lines are tilted upward and interact with the updraft. Tornadogenesis occurs when the vertical vorticity is stretched by the main updraft.  The second failure mode occurs when the cold pool intensity is stronger than in the tornadogenesis case (potential temperature deficits  near the vortex about 4--8 K). In this mode of tornadogenesis failure, the gust front bends back in a similar manner to the simulations that resulted in tornadogenesis but tornadogenesis never occurs. In the case of the second tornadogenesis failure mode the vortex lines emanating from the near-ground vorticity maximum form arches that rise only up to about 3 km AGL and then descend in the rear flank to the south of the vorticity maximum.  The third failure more occurs when the cold pool potential temperature deficit is 8 K or higher. In that case, the gust front rushes ahead of the main updraft. The vertical vorticity is generated along the gust front but the vortices are very shallow. The vortex lines in this case rise only up to 200 m AGL before tilting into the horizontal.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4560], "author_name_tesi": "Majcen, Mario ", "last_name_ssi": "Majcen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mario", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Markowski", "Paul Markowski", "Yvette Pamela Richardson", "Johannes Verlinde", "Joshua Wurman", "Andrew Mark Carleton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Markowski, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Markowski, Committee Chair", "Yvette Pamela Richardson, Committee Member", "Johannes Verlinde, Committee Member", "Joshua Wurman, Committee Member", "Andrew Mark Carleton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thunderstorm", "supercell", "nontornadic", "tornado", "tornadogenesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "INTERMOLECULAR CONJUGATE ADDITION OF CARBON NUCLEOPHILES TO NITROSOALKENES AND STUDIES TOWARD A TOTAL SYNTHESIS OF \nANGUSTILODINE, ALSTILOBANINE A, AND ALSTILOBANINE E\n", "id": "12036", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4278", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An efficient procedure for the alkylation of nitrosoalkenes has been developed in which an array of potassium ester enolates were found to add in Michael fashion to various nitrosoalkenes generated via the Denmark protocol from \u0192\u00d1-chloro-O-TBS ketoximes and \u0192\u00d1-chloro-O-TBS aldoximes.  Using this methodology, a number of different \u0192\u00d1-alkylated oxime constructs were synthesized including systems which contain vicinal quaternary centers.\nA total synthesis of the structurally unique monoterpene indole alkaloids angustilodine (167), alstilobanine A (169), and alstilobanine E (168) has been initiated.  Initial exploratory studies identified indole-2-acetate ester enolates as suitable nucleophiles for conjugate additions to 3-piperidone derived nitrosoalkenes.  The Michael adduct 266, which contains the indole-piperidine substructure found in alkaloids 167-169, was prepared from the conjugate addition of the monoanion of indole-2-acetate 218 to the 3-piperidone derived nitrosoalkene 265.  However, subsequent functionalization of the indole C-3 was found to be difficult.\nA more convergent and highly efficient reaction was developed, which employed the conjugate addition of the dianion derived from 2,3-disubstituted indole 286, containing an oxoacetate moiety at the indole C-3, to nitrosoalkene 265 to prepare Michael adduct 315 in nearly quantitative yield.  Additionally, an efficient stepwise deoxygenation sequence was developed to reduce the ketone in 3-oxoacetate 315 after all attempts to directly reduce this moiety in the related system 291 failed.\nAttempted conversion of the indole containing oxime 325 to ketone 326 using standard deoximation reactions led to low yields and/or product degradation.  Therefore, a mild protocol for the reductive deoximation of ketoxime pivalates was developed and was found to be compatible with the indole containing ketoxime pivalates 354 and 359 as well as various other model ketoxime pivalates.  Ketone 360 was subsequently converted to the key keto-acid 361 which was subjected to Romo\u00a1\u00a6s intramolecular aldol lactonization conditions to stereoselectively form pentacyclic \u0192\u00d2-lactone 362 which contains the cis-azadecalin ring system found within the alkaloids 167-169.\nNumerous strategies have been examined for installing a C-17 hydroxymethyl group and completing the total synthesis of alkaloids 167-169.  It was discovered that intermolecular alkylation of the enolate derived from indole ester 374 with formaldehyde produces the hydroxymethyl compound 393 containing the undesired stereochemistry at C-17.  On the other hand, the C-17 carbon could be installed with the proper stereochemistry via a silicon-tethered intramolecular ester enolate alkylation to provide the cyclic siloxane 408.  However, numerous attempts to oxidize siloxane 408 and its derivatives to a hydroxymethyl compound under standard Fleming-Tamao conditions failed.  Preliminary experiments using the Woerpel modification to the Fleming-Tamao oxidation on cyclic siloxane 449 have identified this reaction to be potentially useful for generation of the C-17 hydroxymethyl unit.  Future optimization and implementation of this procedure will provide the late stage intermediate triol 463, which will be used to complete the total synthesis of angustilodine (167) and alstilobanine E (168).  A Barton-McCombie deoxygenation of the primary alcohol in cyclic siloxane 449 will produce siloxane 469, which should undergo a similar oxidation en route to a total synthesis of alstilobanine A (169).\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4251], "author_name_tesi": "Majireck, Max Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Majireck", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Max", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven M Weinreb", "Scott Trent Feldman", "Steven M Weinreb", "Raymond Lee Funk", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven M Weinreb, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott Trent Feldman, Committee Member", "Steven M Weinreb, Committee Chair", "Raymond Lee Funk, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["indole", "total synthesis", "Michael addition", "Nitrosoalkene", "alkaloid"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Extensive Elastic Compliance and Mechanical Loss in the k31 Mode PZT Plate: New Methodology and Comprehensive Analysis", "id": "14360mpm5835", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14360", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dielectric, elastic, and piezoelectric constants, and their corresponding losses in piezoelectric materials are defined under constant conditions of two categories; namely, intensive (i.e., E, electric field or T, stress), and extensive (i.e., D, dielectric displacement or x, strain) ones because of the electromechanical coupling effect. In the conventional IEEE Standard methods, only the intensive loss factors can be measured directly in the piezoelectric k31 mode rectangular plate specimen, while only the extensive loss factors can be measured directly in the k33 mode rod specimen. Then, the corresponding extensive or intensive parameters were derived indirectly from the coupling factor k31 or k33, and the so-called \u201cK\u201d matrix. However, the extensive loss parameters, calculated through this indirect method, could have large uncertainty, due to the error propagation in the calculation.  In order to overcome this problem in lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) k31 mode rectangular plate ceramics, extensive losses should be measured separately from the measurable intensive ones. We propose a new mechanical-excitation methodology, using a non-destructive testing approach by means of a partial electrode configuration of the PZT specimen, instead of the conventional full electrode configuration. For this purpose, a non-electrode (NE) sample was prepared, where the electrode covered only 10% of the top and bottom surfaces at the center to actuate the whole sample, and also monitor the responding vibration. The admittance spectrum of this sample corresponds to PZT properties under dielectric displacement D constant condition. Furthermore, ceramics with partial-electrodes (PE) were also prepared to create short and open circuit boundary conditions, attributing to resonance and anti-resonance modes. In the proposed way, we were able to measure both intensive and extensive elastic compliances and mechanical losses directly for the first time. The accuracy of this new method is compared with the conventional measurements by use of indirect calculations. The preliminary results (by neglecting the 10% actuator part difference at this point) were obtained, which were in good agreements (less than 3% difference) with the previous indirect method. \nFurthermore, we derive the exact analytical solution by considering the actuator part for calculating the resonance vibration mode and mechanical quality factors in a partial non-electrode sample, parametrically, with respect to \u201ca\u201d, the portion of the middle electrode. This is achieved by solving the dynamic and constitutive equations in a composite bar with both electrode (intensive losses) and non-electrode (extensive losses) boundary conditions. The result suggests that the almost accurate value of the extensive elastic compliance and mechanical loss can be obtained even for a specimen up to a = 0.4 (i.e., 40% covered by the electrode). This analytical solution for the partial electrode samples has the benefit of being more precise and simple to use, comparing with the other ones, such as finite element simulation and equivalent circuit approach.\nSome parts of this thesis are reproduced from \u201cM.

In order to determine the functional role of amines, in vivo studies have primarily used rats and mice as model organisms. This thesis concerns the development of an electrochemical detection method for in vivo measurements of dopamine in the nanoliter-sized adult Drosophila melanogaster central nervous system (CNS). A cylindrical carbon-fiber microelectrode was placed in a fly brain region containing a dense cluster of dopaminergic neurons while a micropipet injector was used to exogenously apply dopamine to the area. Changes in dopamine concentration in the fly were monitored in vivo with background-subtracted fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). Distinct differences were found for the clearance of exogenously applied dopamine by the dopamine transporter in the brain of a wild-type fly vs. a mutant fly lacking dopamine transporter function. The measured current response due to oxidation of dopamine at the electrode surface increased significantly for wild-type flies following treatment with cocaine which is a known dopamine uptake blocker. The current remained unchanged for mutant flies under the same conditions. These results demonstrate the validity of using this novel analytical technique to monitor dopamine uptake in Drosophila.\n    \nThe in vivo method described in this thesis has been used to study mechanisms that underlie drug addiction from a physiological perspective. In addition to being a valuable tool for the analytical chemistry field, this work is of significant interest to the neuroscience community. Dopamine neurotransmission is believed to play a critical role in addiction reinforcing mechanisms of drugs of abuse. Little is known about the in vivo nature of drug interactions with invertebrate transporters, mainly because of the lack of techniques available for quantifying neurochemicals in such small native environments. Hence, the effects of several psychostimulants on dopamine clearance in the Drosophila melanogaster CNS have been investigated with in vivo electrochemical detection. FSCV was used to quantify changes in dopamine concentration in the fly brain when cells were exposed to cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, or methylphenidate. Clearance of exogenously applied dopamine was significantly decreased in the wild-type fly following all drug treatments. In contrast, dopamine uptake remained unchanged when identical treatments were employed in mutant flies lacking functional dopamine transporters.\n    \nAlthough the understanding of the complex actions of cocaine in the brain has improved, an effective drug treatment for cocaine addiction has yet to be found. During the last decade, methylphenidate has been investigated as a potential medication for cocaine addiction treatment. Methylphenidate binds the dopamine transporter and increases extracellular dopamine levels in the CNS similar to cocaine but is thought to elicit fewer addictive and reinforcing effects. Several studies that have investigated the effects of oral methylphenidate taken by cocaine users have reported mixed results. I utilized the Drosophila model system to investigate the mechanism behind treating cocaine addiction with methylphenidate. The results suggested oral consumption of methylphenidate sufficiently blocks the Drosophila dopamine transporter, and further inhibition of the transporter by cocaine applied directly to the brain was undetectable. These data highlight the possibility that methylphenidate could be used as a treatment for cocaine addiction and demonstrate the great potential of Drosophila as a model system for future drug abuse research.\n    \nChemical, electrical, and optogenetic methods to stimulate dopamine release in the adult Drosophila CNS with FSCV detection were investigated. The results suggested that the noninvasive optogenetic stimulation method is capable of initiating targeted neurochemical release in the Drosophila CNS. Dopamine release has been shown to cause pH fluctuations in the rat brain which can interfere with electrochemically measured signals; therefore, a pH sensor was developed for use in the fly.\n    \nThe fabrication and characterization of a novel voltammetric pH microelectrode sensor is described. This sensor has been used to detect pH changes in Drosophila associated with in vivo neurotransmitter release. Voltammetric pH sensors measure changes in the redox-potential of a surface-bound, electrochemically active species as a function of pH. While this approach to measuring pH has been demonstrated with a variety of quinone-modified electrodes, up until now, none have been developed with biocompatible materials that exhibit activity on a physiological time scale in a relevant pH range.\n    \nVoltammetric reduction of the commercially available diazonium salt Fast Blue RR (FBRR) onto the carbon-fiber surface provided a one-step, reagentless procedure for surface modification of a carbon-fiber microelectrode. This produced a 5-&#956;m diameter sensor with a pH-sensitive quinone molecule covalently bonded to the carbon surface. FSCV was used to probe the redox activity of the FBRR molecule as a function of pH. Calibration of the sensor in solutions ranging from pH 6.5 to 8.0 resulted in a linear pH-dependent anodic peak potential response. Flow-injection analysis was used to characterize the modified microelectrode which responded to acidic and basic changes as low as 0.005 pH units in < 2 s. The long-term stability of the FBRR microelectrode pH sensor was tested by continuously applying potential to electrodes in pH 7.5 physiological saline solution for 2.5 h (corresponding to 45,000 voltammetric sweeps). This is an ample time window for in vivo electrochemical measurements in Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, the pH sensor was successfully used to measure dynamic pH fluctuations in vivo following dopamine release in the nanoliter-sized CNS of Drosophila.\n    \nThe results obtained from the analytical tools developed for in vivo detection of dopamine and pH changes in the fly suggest the validity of using Drosophila as a model system to study neurotransmission.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3949], "author_name_tesi": "Makos, Monique Adrianne", "last_name_ssi": "Makos", "middle_name_ssi": "Adrianne", "first_name_ssi": "Monique", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing", "Andrew Ewing", "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Richard W Ordway", "Michael L Heien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Ewing, Committee Chair", "Mary Elizabeth Williams, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Michael L Heien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrochemistry", "microelectrode", "cyclic voltammetry", "pH electrode", "Drosophila"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Optimal Persistent Monitoring Using Coordinated Soaring", "id": "21866", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9857", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Coordinated soaring by a flock of small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAVs) provides a means of conserving fuel while performing aerial tasks.

Nanoaluminum (nAl) is subjected to a progression of experiments to analyze its reactivity in various combustion environments and experimental setups.  The set of tests consists of: 1) a fully heterogeneous flame spread system, 2) a semi-homogeneous sonicated thermite system and 3) a quasi-homogeneous self-assembled thermite system.  \n     The flame spread experiment physically separates the nAl from the gaseous oxidizer allowing for a well-understood convective, diffusive, reactive system to be analyzed.  Spread rates for nAl are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than typical solid fuels, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) and cellulose.  This brings about a fingering combustion instability in normal gravity conditions that previously, has only been demonstrated in microgravity conditions.  A scaling analysis is used to predict trends, and a stability map is created based on the non-dimensional Lewis and Damk\u00c3\u00b6hler numbers that predicts when a continuous flame front will transition to a fingering instability.  \n     A nanoscale thermite is created via sonication of nAl and nanocopper-oxide (nCuO) particles and experiments are performed to examine the effect of adding a diluent to the system.  Both aluminum-oxide and long alkyl chain hydrocarbons severely hinder the propagation rate, however, experiments suggest that hydrocarbon addition could help with the material\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sensitivity to electrostatic discharge.  Because of the hydrocarbons required for self-assembly, these experiments also give an indication of how the self-assembled material will react.\n     A nAl/nCuO thermite is self-assembled via electrostatic forces.  Scanning Electron Microscopy images show a portion of the material has assembled into microspheres having diameters from 1-5\u00ce\u00bcm.  This is the first known energetic nanocomposite built with a bottom-up engineering approach.  The combustion properties of the self-assembled material are compared to that of the sonicated material, with similar amounts of added hydrocarbons. Unlike the sonicated material, the self-assembled material is able to achieve ignition and propagate the full length of the microchannel.  This gives indication that electrostatic self-assembly is a viable method for building energetic materials from the bottom-up, and could potentially increase the intimacy of the mixing and allow for custom tailoring of the combustion properties.  \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3243], "author_name_tesi": "Malchi, Jonathan Yaniv", "last_name_ssi": "Malchi", "middle_name_ssi": "Yaniv", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter", "Robert John Santoro", "David Lawrence Allara", "Vigor Yang", "Grant Alexander Risha", "Steven Son", "Timothy Foley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter, Committee Chair", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member", "David Lawrence Allara, Committee Member", "Vigor Yang, Committee Member", "Grant Alexander Risha, Committee Member", "Steven Son, Committee Member", "Timothy Foley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermite", "self-assembly", "combustion"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Metabolic Response To Temperature By Soil Microorganisms", "id": "7960", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2079", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Because of quick changes in temperature in forest litter between and within seasons and the anticipated continued increase in global surface temperatures, it is important to better understand the metabolic response to temperature by soil microorganisms.  Notably, researchers have revealed that different soil dwellers may not metabolically respond to temperature in similar manners.  In the case of ectomycorrhizal fungi, their respiration comprises a significant portion of total soil respiration, which is a flux ten times greater in size than that from fossil fuel emissions.  Concern exists that a positive feedback may occur between soil respiration and temperature.  If ectomycorrhizal fungi are capable of adjusting their metabolic response to temperature, they might partially ameliorate that feedback.  In the case of decomposer communities, their activity digests organic soil carbon pools, a large amount of which is found in temperate and boreal forests across the globe.  Small proportional changes in the concentration of carbon in soil may cause forest soils to be a large source or sink of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.  Again, the metabolic response of decomposer communities to temperature might determine the size of their carbon demand on forest soils, or put another way, how much CO2 they return to the atmosphere.  The goal of my research was, therefore, to assess the metabolic response to temperature by ectomycorrhizal fungi and decomposer microorganisms at a variety of time scales.  \n\nOn a shorter time scale, I examined whether ectomycorrhizal fungi acclimated their respiration to three different incubator temperatures over the course of one week.  Out of 12 ectomycorrhizal fungal isolates, Suillus intermedius, Cenococcum geophilum, and Lactarius cf. pubescens exhibited significant acclimation to temperature.  Ectomycorrhizal fungal isolates also displayed significant differences in temperature sensitivity, or Q10.  As the earth warms, those ectomycorrhizal fungi that acclimate to temperature will demand less carbon from their host plant and will add less carbon to the atmospheric carbon dioxide pool than those that do not.  The fact that variation occurs among ECM fungal species in their ability to acclimate and in their sensitivity to temperature indicates that the response of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community as a whole will be determined by the structure of that community.         \n\nOn an evolutionary time scale, I investigated whether ectomycorrhizal fungi collected from contrasting latitudes vary in their respiratory response and sensitivity to temperature.  Respiration by ectomycorrhizal fungi from Alaska was higher than that of fungi from Pennsylvania across measurement temperatures, when compared at incubation temperatures that reflected their environment of origin or at common incubator temperatures.  Estimated growth rate and temperature sensitivity were also lower for ectomycorrhizal fugal isolates from Alaska.  These pieces of evidence suggest that ectomycorrhizal fungi are thermally adapted to the thermal regime of their latitudes of origin.  Presumably, this allows ectomycorrhizal fungi from different latitudes of origin to have similar carbon demands from their hosts.\n\nIn contrast with the abilities of many plants and some ectomycorrhizal fungi, decomposer communities show very little acclimation ability over the course of a week.  The ability of decomposer communities to acclimate may influence decomposition and soil carbon content.  At different times during the year, however, decomposer communities were able to change their respiration as prevailing temperatures changed but not at all time points.  This suggests that more than just temperature is important in affecting respiration at different times of year.  Decomposer community structure, substrate availability, and moisture might potentially change at different times of year, all of which have the potential to affect respiration.\n\nIn summary, my results suggest that soil microorganisms display some differences in metabolic response to temperature.  Some ectomycorrhizal fungi acclimated their respiration while, for the most part, decomposer communities largely did not acclimate their respiration.  In the one instance (May 2007) where decomposers significantly acclimated their respiration, the reduction in respiration across measurement temperatures was small in comparison with ectomycorrhizal fungi when they acclimated.  Notably, the sensitivity to temperature by both ectomycorrhizal fungi and decomposer communities from the same red pine plantation in Pennsylvania was quite similar, which indicates that they might proportionally change their respiration rate in the same manner.  When ectomycorrhizal fungi from Alaska and Pennsylvania were compared, our results indicate that their respiratory responses to temperature appear to be adapted to their thermal regime from their latitude of origin.  The experiments in my dissertation highlight the facts that 1) much variability exists between different soil microorganisms in their metabolic response to temperature, 2) much variability also exists within a group of soil microorganisms (i.e. only 25% of ectomycorrhizal fungal isolates acclimated), and 3) different time scales can be quite important when examining metabolic responses to temperature.

Kinesins are required for several processes, including organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, cell division, and transport.  Because plant cells lack an animal-like centrosome, the large number of kinesins may be important to organize microtubule arrays (i.e., preprophase band (PPB), spindle, and phragmoplast) during acentrosomal division.  The \u201cheroic age of microscopy\u201d has revealed that several proteins are involved with this process.  The work presented here uses protein domain analysis to identify plant-specific kinesins with unique domain structure.  Several of these proteins were further studied to determine their role in plant cell division.\n\tOne member, AtKINUa, contains an armadillo repeat domain and a motor domain ungrouped in phylogenic analysis.  Because of plant-specific domain structure, and conserved lineage through sequenced plant genomes, I hypothesized that AtKINUa had a fundamental function in plant cell division.  Investigation through microscopy revealed that AtKINUa localizes to the microtubules of the PPB in a cell-cycle dependant manner.   Through mutagenesis work, I have shown that AtKINUa contains a destruction box motif necessary for the localization pattern observed.  This works provides evidence for a plant-specific kinesin involved with PPB organization and/or early spindle formation.\n\t   I also completed work to understand the role protein motifs (i.e., small protein sequences with unique function) may contribute to the divergent evolution of paralogous kinesins, AtKIN14a and AtKIN14b.

At the time of the Spanish Conquest the main locus of metal production in Mesoamerica was the Tarascan region of western M\u00e9xico. Scholars have argued that mining and metallurgy evolved into a state industry, as metal adornments used as insignias of social status and public ritual became closely associated with political control. In spite of its importance, however, Tarascan metallurgy is poorly documented. The extractive processes involved and the organization of the different aspects of this production are virtually unknown. This thesis outlines the design, implementation and results of an archaeological project carried out at Itzipar\u00e1tzico, a Tarascan locality near Santa Clara del Cobre, M\u00e9xico, where evidence indicates that copper metal production took place from the Late Postclassic throughout the Contact period, and continues until today. This pioneer research has required the employment of multiple strands of evidence, including archaeological survey and excavation, ethnoarchaeology, experimental replication, and archaeometallurgy. Intensive surface survey located concentrations of manufacturing byproducts (i.e. slag) on surface that represented potential production areas. Stratigraphic excavation and subsequent archaeometallurgical analysis of physical remains have been combined with ethnohistorical and ethnoarchaeological data, as well as comparative analogy, to propose a model for prehispanic copper production among the Tarascans. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the nature of metal production and its role in the major state apparatus. Although small in scale, this study provides valuable insights into the development of technology and political economy in ancient Mesoamerica and offers a contribution to general anthropological theories of the emergence of social complexity.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [670], "author_name_tesi": "Maldonado, Blanca Estela", "last_name_ssi": "Maldonado", "middle_name_ssi": "Estela", "first_name_ssi": "Blanca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Paul Raymond Howell", "Helen P Pollard", "Thilo Rehren", "David Lee Webster", "William T Sanders"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Chair", "Paul Raymond Howell, Committee Member", "Helen P Pollard, Committee Member", "Thilo Rehren, Committee Member", "David Lee Webster, Committee Member", "William T Sanders, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ancient Technologies", "Preindustrial Copper Production", "Tarascan State", "Mesoamerican Metallurgy", "Craft Production", "Archaeometallurgy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Nuclear Interactions of the Rous sarcoma virus Gag Polyprotein with the Unspliced Viral RNA", "id": "28799", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12260", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Retroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that encode viral enzymes for the reverse transcription of the RNA genome into a DNA provirus, which integrates into the host chromosome. The integrated proviral DNA is transcribed into viral RNA (vRNA) by the host RNA polymerase II. The unspliced vRNA has three fates. First, it can be spliced into sub-genomic mRNAs that encode for viral proteins. Second, it can remain unspliced to serve as the mRNA for the translation of the Gag and Gag-Pol structural proteins. Third, it can be packaged as genomic RNA (gRNA) in new virions. \n\tGag is thought to select the unspliced gRNA for packaging. Although it was previously thought that Gag functioned solely in the cytoplasm, the Gag proteins of multiple retroviruses have recently been observed to traffic through the nucleus. Data from our laboratory suggest that Gag nuclear trafficking for the avian oncoretrovirus, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), is linked to efficient gRNA packaging. For RSV Gag mutants that have reduced nuclear trafficking, packaging is decreased. Restoration of Gag nuclear trafficking rescues RNA packaging. RSV Gag is imported into the nucleus by the host karyopherins Importin-\u03b1/\u03b2, Importin 11, and TNPO3. RSV Gag exits via the host nuclear export protein Crm1. Our biochemical evidence shows that Gag interaction with Crm1 is enhanced by Gag binding to nucleic acid. Together these data suggest that Gag is interacting with the vRNA in the nucleus. The goal of the work presented in this dissertation is to visualize Gag: RNA complexes in the nucleus.\n\tUnder steady-state conditions RSV Gag is primarily located in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane with a small portion of the Gag present in the nucleus. To visualize Gag: vRNA complexes in the nucleus, we created an infectious proviral construct containing 24 copies of MS2 stem loops (RC.V8-24x) labeled with MS2-YFP. Using confocal microscopy, we observed co-localization between RSV Gag and the RC.V8-24x in the nucleus. An RSV Gag nuclear export mutant that accumulates in distinct nuclear foci (Gag.L219A) co-localizes with vRNA in the nucleus at high levels compared to non-vRNAs. Interestingly, deletion of cis-acting sequences in the vRNA, known to be required for Gag: RNA interactions, did not greatly decrease co-localization of the vRNA with Gag. \nGag.L291A preferentially co-localizes with the vRNA in the nucleus. However, a low but consistent level of co-localization exists with non-viral and nascent RNAs, suggesting a localization mechanism tied to transcription. Gag.L219A co-localizes with splicing factors SF2 and SC35, which are known to bind to RNAs co-transcriptionally. Further, overexpression of Clk1, a kinase known to phosphorylate these splicing factors causing them to travel to sites of active transcription, promotes increased co-localization between Gag.L219A and these splicing factors. Additionally, Gag.L219A nuclear foci formation is prevented by the transcription inhibitor actinomcyin D. Together, these data suggest that RSV Gag is localizing to sites of active transcription. We hypothesize that RSV Gag is traveling to sites of RNA synthesis to co-transcriptionally select the unspliced vRNA for packaging into new virions.\nTo determine whether Gag: RNA nuclear interactions are conserved among retroviruses, we utilized a cell line that contains a stably integrated, doxycycline-inducible HIV-1 provirus that expresses HIV-1 Gag fused to GFP. The unspliced HIV-1 RNA was visualized via fluorescence in situ hybridization using probes directed against the gag coding sequence. Interestingly, HIV-1 Gag also co-localizes with its unspliced vRNA in the nucleus. These data allow us to speculate a purpose for Gag nuclear trafficking in retroviral replication that includes localizing to sites with high levels of vRNA, as a mechanism to pair the Gag structural protein with the gRNA for subsequent movement to the plasma membrane for packaging.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11646], "author_name_tesi": "Maldonado, Rebecca ", "last_name_ssi": "Maldonado", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leslie Joan Parent", "Sarah Bronson", "Jianming Hu", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "David Joseph Spector"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Chair", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Retrovirus assembly", "Nuclear Trafficking", "RNA packaging"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "IT POLICIES FOR DEVELOPMENT:\nANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF FREE LIBRE\nOPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE INITIATIVES OF\nTHE BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA", "id": "10257", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1711", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years the two concepts of economic development and technological advancement have\nbecome entwined so that they have, in many cases, come to mean the same thing.

These results also provide new insights into the physical structure of the plasma giving rise to these echoes and also establish a firmer basis for the modeling of the plasma processes that cause meteor trails to become field-aligned while underlining the importance of carefully distinguishing event radio science as a prelude to specifying the role of these plasma processes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [351], "author_name_tesi": "Malhotra, Akshay ", "last_name_ssi": "Malhotra", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Akshay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John David Mathews", "John David Mathews", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Julio Urbina", "Hampton Nelson Shirer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John David Mathews, Dissertation Advisor", "John David Mathews, Committee Chair", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "Hampton Nelson Shirer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Radio Science", "Meteors", "Radar", "Aspect Sensitivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "MODELING AND OPTIMIZATION OF INDIVIDUAL WHEEL ELECTRIC DRIVE ABS AND TRACTION CONTROL", "id": "10822", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2109", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the advent of new technology in the field of automobiles and battery technology, the opportunity of using electric and hybrid vehicles has increased.

This research study investigates the opportunity of implementing enhanced safety and control measures in modern hybrid electric vehicles through the use of individual motors for both front wheels. Hybrid vehicles with individual motors on both front wheels have an added advantage over the conventional vehicle because different torques can be applied to the individual motors which make managing the motors in closed loops possible. This helps optimize the system by control of traction and yaw, increasing vehicle stability and operational safety.\n\nA literature review of Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) systems was conducted to establish the state of the art in the field of hybrid electric vehicle dynamic control.

Examples of such applications include reconstructing the haplotypes of viruses replicating within a host, identifying insertional polymorphisms of mobile elements amongst individuals in a species, and characterizing diversity in populations of cancer cell types in an individual. Although a plethora of methods use an existing or assembled reference sequence for characterizing diversity, the usage of de novo methods can be beneficial for studying diversity in a population of closely related genomes. This dissertation aims to develop de novo computational methods for studying diversity in such samples using NGS data. \n\nDe novo methods rely only on the inherent NGS data collected from a sample and can be applied to study the diversity in organisms where limited prior knowledge is available. In the first part of the dissertation, I discuss a clustering pipeline for clustering NGS data that was obtained from sites of integration of a mobile element in the genome in a panel of individuals. Typically, reads from individuals can be mapped to a reference genome to determine the location of an element-host integration site. However, host regions flanking a mobile element can be modified by the presence of the element and reference genomes are not available for all species. Clustering methods provide an alternative for analyzing such integration site datasets. Here, each cluster ideally represents reads from a single integration site. The main contributions in this chapter are (i) A pipeline for clustering NGS reads from integration site junctions using UCLUST clustering algorithm that empirically determines the optimal clustering threshold; (ii) The optimal threshold is determined based on internal clustering measure, $I-index$, which assesses clusters for small intra-cluster diameters and large inter-cluster distance. We evaluate and test our proposed pipeline to determine the optimal clustering parameters and show improved results on simulated and real datasets. \n\nThe second and major portion of the dissertation focuses on de novo reconstruction of viral haplotypes in a viral population using paired-end NGS data. We have proposed MLEHaplo, a maximum likelihood de novo assembly algorithm for reconstructing viral haplotypes. Using the pairing information of reads in our proposed Viral Path Reconstruction Algorithm (ViPRA), we generate a small subset of paths from a De Bruijn graph of reads that serve as candidate paths for true viral haplotypes. Our proposed method MLEHaplo then generates a maximum likelihood estimate of the viral population using the paths reconstructed by ViPRA. We evaluate and compare MLEHaplo on simulated datasets at different sequence coverage, and on real datasets. MLEHaplo reconstructs full length viral haplotypes in most of the small genome simulated viral populations.  While reference based methods either under-estimate or over-estimate the viral haplotypes, MLEHaplo limits the over-estimation of the size of true viral haplotypes, and reconstructs the full phylogeny of the input viral population. \n\n\nAs NGS data is fraught with sequencing errors which significantly impact de novo reconstruction of viral haplotypes, in Chapter 4 we proposed a frame-based representation of k-mers for detecting sequencing errors and rare variants for such data. Frames are sets of non-orthogonal basis functions, traditionally used in signal processing for noise removal. We define a frame for genomes and sequenced reads to consist of discrete spatial signals of every k-mer of a given size. We show that each k-mer in the sequenced data can be projected onto multiple frames and these projections are maximized for spatial signals corresponding to the k-mer's substrings. Our proposed classifier, MultiRes, is trained on the projections of k-mers as features used for marking k-mers as erroneous or true variations in the genome. We evaluate MultiRes on simulated and real viral population datasets and compare it to other error correction methods known in the literature. MultiRes has 4 to 500 times less false positive k-mer predictions compared to other methods, essential for accurate estimation of viral population diversity and their de novo assembly. It has high recall of the true k-mers, comparable to other error correction methods. MultiRes also has greater than 95% recall for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), has low false positive SNP predictions, while detecting higher number of rare variants compared to other variant calling methods for viral populations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12161], "author_name_tesi": "Malhotra, Raunaq ", "last_name_ssi": "Malhotra", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Raunaq", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raj Acharya", "Raj Acharya", "Paul Medvedev", "Kamesh Madduri", "Mary Poss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raj Acharya, Dissertation Advisor", "Raj Acharya, Committee Chair", "Paul Medvedev, Committee Member", "Kamesh Madduri, Committee Member", "Mary Poss, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["De novo assembly algorithms", "viral population reconstruction", "dynamic programming algorithm"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Ultrasonic Guided Wave Propagation in Hollow Cylinders with Axial Periodicity", "id": "21844", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7202", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ultrasonic guided waves are finding increasingly utility in the field of nondestructive testing (NDT); most notably, in the qualitative screening of buried pipeline.

Therefore, we investigate opportunities for\nenergy and performance improvements in  order of decreasing scale of size. \nFirst, we consider opportunities for improving energy efficiency\nat the whole multi-processor system scale. We then investigate\nsingle node optimizations, starting with single-core and\nmoving towards multi-core power and performance optimizations.\n\n<p>At the multi-processor system scale, we start by considering opportunities for improving workload\ndistribution in parallel applications where computational\ndependencies and parallelism across the computer nodes \nare described by a tree.  We introduce a new multi-pass\nworkload-to-processor distribution technique and a workload distribution quality \nmeasure which we call critical overload. Our mapping scheme decreases the worst-case\ncritical overload for some cases from approximately 60% to 27%. On average, our technique\nhalves the critical overload for our test suite from nearly 50% for the original mapping\nto 25%. However, the workload imbalance \nis not completely eliminated. Thus,  we consider opportunities for converting the remaining\nworkload imbalances into energy savings by using dynamic voltage and\nfrequency scaling (DVFS) and ``just-in-time' computation principles. We\nintroduce three schemes that offer up to a 21% reduction in\nenergy consumption on average across our test suite\nwithout degrading application performance.\n\n<p>At the scale of a single node of a multi-processor system, we consider power and performance\noptimizations for single-core and multi-core architectures.\nWe begin by\ninvestigating interactions between hardware features and sparse applications\nproperties on single-core processors.

Next, we\npropose new hardware features aimed at optimizing performance and energy\nconsumption of sparse scientific applications on single-core processors. \nWe introduce a load miss predictor and a phase-aware adaptive hardware selection\ncontrol.

The two essays that form the core of my thesis investigate innovation coordination in the open source community model of product development.  For this purpose, a social network approach is used to understand the effects of network structure that arises due to relationships between open source projects and developers.\nIn the first essay we build on the notion of the criticality of social networks for the new product development process.  We rely on organizational founding literature to suggest that the network structure at the inception of a new product development project would have a lingering effect on the time to development of the new product.  We test this assertion in the context of open source software development projects, where the open source community has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional firm-based software development initiatives.  The open source community builds products through online collaboration, products whose source code is in the public domain.  In this open source environment, we conceptualize a product development process consisting of two stages: (1) some projects transition from ideas to some development activity and (2) for the projects that make the transition at the first stage, some projects mature into \u2018marketable\u2019 products.  Specifically,  we hypothesize how network structure that surrounds a project at inception will play a role in determining which projects will stay inactive as against being active (stage 1), and influence the time to market for that the projects that become active (stage 2).  We test the hypotheses with data from 817 new open source projects from SourceForge.net, the largest forum of open source projects on the Internet.  Results from simulated maximum likelihood estimation of a Type II Tobit model specification provide support for the hypotheses that network structure at inception of a project impacts whether the project becomes active and the time to first release of the project.   \nIn the second essay we address issues relating to the participation of large firms in the open source software development community.  The network structure that exists among open source projects is changing continuously due to the nature of collaboration in such communities.  As the value and quality of resources available to the open source projects depends on the network configurations that surround the projects, it becomes important to understand what impacts these changes and what the consequences will be.  Relying on social capital theory, we develop a model in which projects change their network connections by constantly evaluating the utility they derive from their current location in the network structure.  We hypothesize that two important network characteristics namely, embeddedness and structural holes affect the network change process.  We test the hypotheses with data from 43 open source projects that are being sponsored by a large firm on SourceForge.net, the largest forum of open source projects on the Internet.  We build a stochastic actor-oriented model to specify the effects of social capital on the dynamics of network evolution.  We estimate our model using a method of moments approach and find support for the hypotheses that network driven social capital plays a key role in determining evolution of network structure and success of open source projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2139], "author_name_tesi": "Mallapragada, Girish ", "last_name_ssi": "Mallapragada", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Girish", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary L Lilien", "Rajdeep Grewal", "William T Ross", "John C Liechty", "Reka Z Albert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary L Lilien, Committee Chair", "Rajdeep Grewal, Committee Chair", "William T Ross, Committee Member", "John C Liechty, Committee Member", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["new product development", "innovation", "collaboration", "social networks", "open source"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A language theoretic framework for decision and control of autonomous systems", "id": "9418", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2088", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Autonomous systems are increasingly prevalent\nin many application areas such as military Command and Control, industrial manufacturing, and medical systems. However, analysis of such systems becomes intractable when modelled by classical methods like differential/difference equations. Discrete-event systems are increasingly being used to model and control such systems and a body of literature called supervisory control theory (SCT) has emerged. Traditionally, SCT uses a qualitative method called maximal permissiveness to arrive at optimal supervisors. A quantitative performance index based on a measure of formal languages has been proposed to overcome the shortcomings of qualitative design in SCT. The research reported in this thesis has adopted the concept of language measure to develop a comprehensive framework for decision & control of autonomous systems. A consistent framework based on language theory is built to address sensing, planning and action aspects of autonomous systems. The proposed framework is demonstrated by its\napplication to well known problems in robotics such as obstacle avoidance and path planning. The discrete-event models are constructed and pertinent parameters have been identified from the physical dynamics of the system via a system identification. This approach creates a seamless\ntransition from the continuous dynamics to the discrete-event control by eliminating the need to manually design the discrete-event models of the plant dynamics and control specifications. In the language-theoretic setting, autonomous perception is also addressed using a tool called symbolic dynamic filtering (SDF). Application of SDF as a feature extractor in a domain independent manner is demonstrated and pattern classifiers are constructed to recognize behaviours autonomously. A new type of pattern classifier based on the langauge measure is proposed and is shown\nto be faster than traditional Bayesian classifier with comparable robustness.

The oil embargo of 1973 gave the United States a chance to see how much it relies on foreign oil. The resource for energy was not readily available as it had been.  The country found itself in an economic bind with a severe threat of more shortages to come.  The focus on the energy crisis increased in the late 1980s (DOE, 2008).  The notice started to arise of the adverse effects after the shortage began.  The air emissions and water pollution posed many negative effects to the environment.  It was believed for a long time that awareness was enough to address the energy issues and how they are related to consumption.  However, with continuously growing population and industrialization, and extensive dependence upon our cars we found and that our dependence upon petroleum is very strong.  Fossil fuels and other mineral deposits cause waste and pollution and are non-renewable. Through the use of fossil fuels, the US has increased acid rain, smog, respiratory illness and made major negative contributions to greenhouse gas emissions.  \nThese energy problems cannot be separated from environmental and sustainability challenges.  Sustainability is a relatively new goal to ensure the quality of life currently and for the future generations while preserving the environment and the economy.  Developing sustainable practices is important for the continuous development of our nation\u2019s and the world\u2019s energy supplies.  Sustainable Development is a cross-disciplinary system formed of interacting technical and non-technical sub-systems.  Some of the most important sub-systems include: Socio-economical; Political and Moral/Ethical subsystems as well as other science and engineering components, which form together with sustainable engineering the sub-system of the Technology.  Although we do not live only on energy, the most important challenge facing this nation at the present time is proper energy use and practice. These attempts are trying to reverse several global environmental deterioration factors.  This will require innovative ideas coupled with other sustainability sub-systems to build a sustainable economy.  To achieve sustainability we must think of survival.  It is essential for us to optimize the use of energy resources and to consume only what we truly need.  To reduce our energy usage we can switch to alternative energy sources.  In choosing alternative energy sources, we will be considering many challenges. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is one approach to handle a complex and crucial challenge.  In this research, previous data from LCAs of alternative energy sources will be used to compare alternatives side by side.  The assessment will begin with the raw materials used to create the energy.  A sustainable metric will be completed through the research conducted using LCA.  With new developments, it is important to interpret the technology in relation to sustainability indices.  An analysis of the technology used by other alternative energy sources will help in determining the relative sustainability provided by this energy alternative.  \nThe dependency on foreign oil has pushed the development of resources to its limits.  There are several alternatives to non-renewable fossil fuel energy.  In a landmark 1953 speech, President Dwight D. Eisenhower hailed nuclear power as a great potential source of domestic energy (Passero, 2006, 61).  Its fuel is available for a long period of time, and today thirty one nations have nuclear power (DOE, 2008).  Nuclear energy is also clean and very efficient.  In contrast, nuclear power plants are not always feasible due to their complexities, difficulties and costs of building and maintaining nuclear power plants.  Another abundant alternative energy source available is solar power.  Positive aspects of solar energy are its safety and reliable distribution of energy.  On the other hand, solar energy\u2019s negatives outweigh its positives, which include substantial start up costs and relative expensive when compared to other alternatives.  Other disadvantages include storage and, sometimes, weak performance.  A fairly new and upcoming alternative is biomass energy.  Bio-fuel is a fuel produced from biomass.  The main four bio-fuels of interest are bio-hydrogen, bio-ethanol, bio-butanol and bio-diesel (the bio-fuels are ordered by molecular size).  Biomass-driven energy has high efficiency and energy balance.  It also has very little adverse environmental effects and helps to reduce poverty in third world countries.  On the other hand, there is a concern of a rise in food prices; however this concern can be overcome by producing bio-fuels from agricultural wastes and not agricultural food products.  Also some bio-fuels do not require change of exiting engines, some require minor changes and others require major changes.\nOne of the main purposes of this research is to complete a metric as an index for sustainability that can be used for a biomass-derived fuel through researching energy alternatives using the tool, of life cycle assessment.  This research in general and its main purposes in particular will help raise public awareness of alternative energy sources and their links to a more sustainable way of living.  This thesis is structured in five major parts including the theory of sustainability and life cycle analysis.  Also, the history and its technologies of solar, nuclear and biomass-driven energy will be included.  In addition, the environmental, economic/political and social impacts will be addressed for each energy source.  In the final chapters, the results of the life cycle assessment comparison and metrics will be highlighted and concluded.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4401], "author_name_tesi": "Mallette, Michele ", "last_name_ssi": "Mallette", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Michele", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Pollution Control", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Said Elnashie"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Said Elnashie, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bio-fuel", "Bio-ethanol", "Sustainability", "Energy"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Identifying and Explaining Instability in the General Model of Policy Diffusion", "id": "23871", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10903", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Policy diffusion research has deep roots in political science and continues to grow as a research program. Over the last 25 years, scholars assembled a body of knowledge one piece at a time using event history models that focus on the adoption of a single innovation. This approach generated new knowledge about specific predictors of adoption; however it also created a fractured testing of the general model of policy diffusion. In response, scholars recently began returning to an older approach of aggregating adoption data in order to determine the generalizability of the policy diffusion model. This dissertation bridges the two approaches and further builds on the macro-level approach by testing the general patterns of innovation adoption while also pushing forward our understanding of the causal mechanisms underlying the process. It finds that the general model of diffusion applies at a high level of aggregation, however there is substantial variation in its components across polices, time, and throughout the diffusion lifecycle. It raises questions about the generality of policy diffusion research and argues that more attention needs to be placed on identifying and explicating the variegated causal mechanisms that motivate policy diffusion.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10493], "author_name_tesi": "Mallinson, Daniel Jacob", "last_name_ssi": "Mallinson", "middle_name_ssi": "Jacob", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Lowery", "Peter K Hatemi", "Michael Barth Berkman", "Christopher Jon Zorn", "John W Gastil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Lowery, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter K Hatemi, Committee Member", "Michael Barth Berkman, Committee Member", "Christopher Jon Zorn, Committee Member", "John W Gastil, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["policy diffusion", "federalism", "state politics", "social conformity"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The roles of reproductive function, body composition, and metabolic status in bone health of young exercising women", "id": "18754", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8979", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Exercising women frequently present with menstrual dysfunction and low bone mineral density (BMD), consequences of an energy-deficient state in which energy intake is inadequate to compensate for energy expenditure.  Understanding the factors contributing to bone health in exercising women with exercise-associated menstrual disturbances (EAMD) as well as the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment strategies for the prevention or reversal of low BMD is essential for the appropriate management of this health problem.  The purpose of this dissertation was to explore the determinants of bone health in exercising women with severe EAMD in an effort to gain insight into effective treatment strategies for the prevention and reversal of low BMD.  To this end, this dissertation includes four studies that 1) compare volumetric BMD, bone geometry, and estimated bone strength between amenorrheic and eumenorrheic exercising women, 2) explore the respective roles of reproductive function, metabolic status, and body composition in areal BMD and estimated bone geometry, 3) assess the impact of an intervention of increased caloric intake on bone health and related factors in exercising women with EAMD, and 4) examine the responses of two amenorrheic exercising women to a 12-month intervention involving an increase in energy intake.  We observed the following main findings:  1) exercising women with amenorrhea had smaller bone area and, consequently, lower estimated bone strength at the tibia compared to their eumenorrheic counterparts;   2) among exercising women, reproductive function appeared to play a key role in BMD at a site primarily composed of trabecular bone; whereas, lean mass was one of the most influential predictors of BMD and estimated bone geometry at weight-bearing sites;  3) an intervention of increased caloric intake successfully improved the energetic and metabolic environment, resulting in favorable changes in body composition and recovery of menstrual function.  Overall, among exercising women with impaired bone health as a consequence of severe EAMD, weight gain and resumption of menses which coincide with increases in fat mass, lean mass, and estrogen concentrations may be beneficial for bone health.  A similar intervention of longer duration with a larger sample is necessary to confirm these findings.

Thunderstorms are believed to be the major charging sources of this circuit. In this dissertation, we present our studies on the contribution of thunderstorms to the Global electric Circuit. We examine the current that is driven to the ionosphere and to the ground before, during and after single negative cloud-to-ground (CG) and intra-cloud (IC) lightning discharges. A numerical model has been developed, that calculates the quasi-electrostatic field before the lightning, due to the slow accumulation of the charge in the thundercloud, and after the lightning by taking into account the Maxwellian relaxation of the charges in the conducting atmosphere and accounting for the dissipation stage of the thunderstorm development. From these results, the charges that are transferred to the ionosphere and to the ground are calculated. We demonstrate the significance of considering the pre-lightning and the dissipation stages and accounting for realistic distribution of the conductivity inside of the thundercloud for the accurate calculation of the charge flow to the ionosphere and to the ground. We show that the charge transfer to the ionosphere depends mainly on the altitudes of the charges inside the thundercloud and their spatial separation. The amount of charge that is transferred to the ground, due to currents flowing in the vicinity of the thundercloud during a transient time period following a lightning discharge, is significantly affected by the conductivity distribution in the thundercloud and can be several times smaller than the amount of charge that is transferred to the ionosphere during the same time period. Moreover, we show that the duration of each of the thunderstorm life cycle stages affects the results. Furthermore, we show the influence of the corona currents on the overall current system.\n\nWe extend the model to include the whole domain of the GEC. We investigate different types of boundary conditions for the proper modeling of the global current flow in the presence of a single storm and the resulting potential difference that is created. We compare this model in the steady state limit with a static model that has been developed in previous published studies.\n\nWe apply the model to a case of an experimentally measured thunderstorm. We investigate the Wilson current that flows from its top towards the ionosphere as a function of a sequence of different types of lightning discharges, the flash rate and the conductivity distribution. We compare the results with the measurements and we make conclusions regarding the validity of the modeling concept.\n\nWe develop a time-dependent fluid model that is able to calculate self consistently the time dynamics of the conductivity distribution along with the time dynamics of the thunderstorm electrical properties. This model takes into account several atmospheric processes such as the ionization due to the galactic cosmic rays radiation, the ion-ion recombination, and the attachment of ions to cloud particles. We study the regimes at which the previous models that assume constant conductivity over time are valid and we quantify the similarities and differences between these two models. \n\nFinally, we model the lightning discharge channel using a three-dimensional cartesian fractal model. The purpose of this model is to simulate several types of lightning discharges that occur in realistic thunderstorms and calculate the amount of charge that is removed or neutralized from each thunderstorm. At the same time we used this model to quantify the potential differences produced in a developing IC lightning discharge for given thunderstorm electric configurations. We present a case of a +IC lightning discharge in a realistic thunderstorm configuration that leads to a very high (~300 MV) potential difference, and show how a delay in the development of the negative leader with respect to the positive one in a bidirectional leader system can facilitate a high potential difference in the negative leader head region, which favors the production of terrestrial gamma ray flashes. Terrestrial gamma ray flashes are high energy (up to 100 MeV) photon bursts originating from the Earth's atmosphere in association with IC lightning discharges.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10627], "author_name_tesi": "Mallios, Sotirios ", "last_name_ssi": "Mallios", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sotirios", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko", "Victor P Pasko", "John David Mathews", "Michael Matthew Micci", "Timothy Joseph Kane"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko, Dissertation Advisor", "Victor P Pasko, Committee Chair", "John David Mathews, Committee Member", "Michael Matthew Micci, Committee Member", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Global Electric Circuit", "Thunderstorm", "Lightning"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Women's Perspectives and Experiences in Passionate Friendships", "id": "fq977t769", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12878", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "*Please see attachment", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12339, 12340], "author_name_tesi": "Maloch, Janelle Kirstie", "last_name_ssi": "Maloch", "middle_name_ssi": "Kirstie", "first_name_ssi": "Janelle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counseling Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen J.

NanoPPX templates are deposited using a modified vapor deposition technique called oblique angle polymerization (OAP) which directs the monomer flux at an angle (typically ~10\u00ba) to the substrate. In a typical procedure to prepare hybrid nanostructures, an aromatic ligand, such as pyridine, is first physisorbed onto the nanoPPX surface by means of treatment with either aqueous solution of the ligand or ligand vapors. Subsequently, a Pd(II)-based colloidal dispersion is covalently ligated to the pyridyl N-sites that provides the catalytic sites where metal reduction is facilitated. Deposition of various metals such as, but not limited to, Ni, Co, Cu, and Ag can be carried out onto the Pd(II)-laden nanoPPX films using an appropriate electroless plating bath. Besides metals, thin layer of ceramics (<i>e.g.</i>, TiO<sub>2</sub>) can also be deposited using the noncovalent functionalization methodology. Metals or ceramic layer is deposited conformally to the underlying PPX nanorods and exhibits high adhesion strength despite the presence of noncovalent forces at the interface. In contrast, analogous plating procedure on conventionally deposited (<i>i.e.</i>, without any directional constraint to the monomer flux) \u201cplanar\u201d (devoid of any nano-morphological features) PPX films show no or patchy metallization with poor adhesive properties. A statistical investigation using factorial analysis suggests that the ligand adsorption condition (<i>i.e.</i>, aqueous or vapor treatments) profoundly impacts the morphology of the metal layer due to the pyridine orientation at the nanoPPX surface. \nThe adsorption and stabilization of pyridine molecules occurs <i>via</i> preferential  \t&#960;-&#960; interactions with the aromatic moieties of the PPX chain. A detailed investigation of the nanoPPX porosity using gas physisorption study and a complementary study of pyridine adsorption using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) suggest that irreversible pyridine penetration occurs into the micropores of size ~1&#8722;2 nm that dominates the nanoPPX structure. On the other hand, planar PPX film cannot incorporate enough ligand due to lack of micropores necessary for pyridine stabilization, resulting in poor metallization. \nThe thesis also explores three applications of these hybrid nanostructures prepared by the noncovalent route in which the quasi-periodicity of the PPX nanorods and the tunability of the deposited metal nanostructured morphology are effectively leveraged. In the first application, Co membranes grown on nanoPPX surface, exhibiting highly interconnected porous structure, are shown to function as excellent catalysts for hydrogen production from NaBH<sub>4</sub> decomposition.  The second application employs the quasi-periodicity of the underlying nanoPPX morphology by using Ag/nanoPPX hybrid nanostructures as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) platforms for RSV gene detection. Finally, a preliminary investigation exploring the prospects of TiO<sub>2</sub>/nanoPPX nanocomposites as orthopaedic implant coatings is presented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4583], "author_name_tesi": "Malvadkar, Niranjan Arvind", "last_name_ssi": "Malvadkar", "middle_name_ssi": "Arvind", "first_name_ssi": "Niranjan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melik C Demirel", "Melik C Demirel", "Ivica Smid", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald", "David Lawrence Allara", "Walter J Dressick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melik C Demirel, Dissertation Advisor", "Melik C Demirel, Committee Chair", "Ivica Smid, Committee Member", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Member", "David Lawrence Allara, Committee Member", "Walter J Dressick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Titania", "Parylene", "Electroless Plating", "Surface Functionalization", "SERS", "Noncovalent"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Microbiome and Epigenetics: Two Keys to the \ndevelopment of Personalized Medicine\n", "id": "25153", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10628", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation has two parts: first describes the analysis of microbiomes of the lower respiratory tract of healthy and diseased chickens. The second describes the epigenetic landscape that determines the gene transcription levels in the erythroid differentiation model.  Multicellular animals are complex machines and can no longer be thought of as stand alone organisms. Animals host microbial communities termed microbiomes, which play vital roles in many aspects of an animals life including immune function and nutrient processing. Animal physiology and habits have been shown to affect resident microbiome composition, which in turn affect animal physiology. Understanding host microbe interactions and their ramifications is thus essential in my pursuit to understand human health. Further complicating matters, each microbiome interacts with only a subset of host cell types. Nearly every host cell contains identical DNA yet express radically different phenotypes. These differences in phenotype are brought about by epigenetic effect. Epigenetic factors represent heritable changes, which are not apparent in DNA sequence alone. They include items such as histone modifications, transcription factors and DNAse hypersensitive sites.  Epigenetics vary amongst individuals but also amongst cell types within individuals. Understanding epigenetic regulation of gene transcription is  essential to understanding human health and has gained much interest in the development of personalized medicine. I conducted fundamental research aimed at advancing both the understanding of resident microbiome and also epigenetic gene regulation. Microbiome studies were conducted in Chickens from Pakistan with the primary goal of identifying potentially novel emerging infectious diseases. I also studied epigenetic gene regulation in an in vitro model system for erythroid maturation. I found that the lower respiratory microbiome of healthy chickens was dominated by relatively few bacterial taxa.  Moreover  the microbiome of healthy chickens varied with respect to the environment. I was also able to identify differences in microbiome composition between healthy and diseased birds, suggesting the discovery of potential novel pathogens representing emerging infectious disease in the region. In my model system for erythroid maturation I found epigenetic landscape near the transcription start site (TSS) to be sufficient to predict a gene as actively transcribed or silent. Moreover, I was able to relate change in epigenetic landscape with change in gene transcription level in cases of extreme transcription level change. Overall, these results indicated epigenetic landscape near the TSS sets a gene as either permissive or non permissive with respect to transcription.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10264], "author_name_tesi": "Malys, Tyler ", "last_name_ssi": "Malys", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tyler", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cooduvalli S Shashikant", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Michael Mugo Mwangi", "Matam Vijay Kumar", "Peter John Hudson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cooduvalli S Shashikant, Dissertation Advisor", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Michael Mugo Mwangi, Committee Member", "Matam Vijay Kumar, Committee Member", "Peter John Hudson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microbiome", "Epigenetics", "Personalized Medicine", "Agriculture", "Pathogen Identification", "Erythropoiesis", "Pakistan", "Gene Expression"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Teacher, Counselor, and Administrator Perception of the Role of the School Counselor in Comprehensive Career and Technical High Schools in Pennsylvania\n", "id": "8205", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5692", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nThis descriptive study examined internal support as a construct for the success of the integration of guidance curriculum.

Traditional composting is associated with a number of environmental problems such as the emission of offensive odors and waste water run-off during handling. In addition, after the production of a crop of mushrooms, there is the problem of disposal of spent mushroom substrate (SMS). Thus, preparation of a suitable substrate for mushroom production without the generation of offensive odors and the possible re-use of SMS for the production of a second crop of mushrooms are desirable. The goals of this research were to evaluate two substrates for the production of A. bisporus: a) non-composted substrate (NCS) consisting of red oak sawdust (28%), millet (29%), rye (8%), peat (8%), ground alfalfa (4%), ground soybean meal (4%), wheat bran (9%) and CaCO3 (10%) and b) SMS. Treatments included 1) NCS and SMS alone and in combination, 2) spawn carriers, 3) strains, 4) supplements, 5) time of supplementation, and 6) substrate moisture content. The substrates were sterilized in very high porosity filter plastic bags and then spawned and incubated. Mushrooms were harvested for two flushes and yield, biological efficiency (BE) and mushroom size were determined. The highest yield and BE (27.2 kg/m2, 144.3%) were from 1:1 NCS/SMS spawned with casing inoculum (CI) and supplemented with 10% Target\u00ae at casing. The largest mushrooms were obtained from NCS spawned with CI and supplemented at spawning with 3,000 mg/kg Micromax\u00ae (57.3 g/mushroom). Mushrooms containing the highest solids content (9.9%) were harvested from NCS spawned with CI (60% moisture content). Supplementation of NCS/SMS with Micromax\u00ae, a commercial micronutrient, had no significant effect on yield and BE. However, the addition of 0.9% Micromax\u00ae (d.w.) to NCS significantly increased yield by 72% (from 8.5 kg/m2 to 14.6 kg/m2). This work shows the potential to produce relatively high yields on NCS or on mixtures of NCS/SMS and that a combination of supplements that contain protein, carbohydrate and micronutrients added at spawning or at casing resulted in improved mushroom yields.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1512], "author_name_tesi": "Mamiro, Delphina Peter", "last_name_ssi": "Mamiro", "middle_name_ssi": "Peter", "first_name_ssi": "Delphina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel J Royse", "Donald Durwood Davis", "Gary William Moorman", "Charles Peter Romaine", "Robert Bruce Beelman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel J Royse, Committee Chair", "Donald Durwood Davis, Committee Member", "Gary William Moorman, Committee Member", "Charles Peter Romaine, Committee Member", "Robert Bruce Beelman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biological efficiency", "non-composted substrate", "spent mushroom substrate", "Agaricus bisporus", "mushroom yield", "supplements"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Touching Relationships: Sensory Processing in Parent-child Interactions", "id": "15424", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7875", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using parent-report measures, prior studies have shown that sensory processing is related to social, emotional, and regulatory development.

Second, if a separate energy Lithium-ion energy storage is used for demand response, using the battery to meet demand response goals without a health-conscious control policy might accelerate battery degradation and reduce expected battery lifetime. Third, proper knowledge of battery aging behavior to construct a health-conscious control policy may not be available. \nIn a broad sense, this dissertation is motivated by the datacenter industry\u2019s growing electricity demand, and the associated costs and carbon emissions. In 2013, US datacenters overall used 91 billion kWh of electricity, at an estimated cost of $6.7b. By the year 2020, this consumption is projected to increase up to 140 billion kWh/year, which is equivalent to the output of 50 power plants with nearly 150 million metric ton of carbon emission. The current literature relies on empirical battery models in its examination of the datacenter demand response problem. These models are quite limited in their ability to capture the fundamental physical phenomena affecting battery behavior. Therefore, the ability of energy storage systems to handle demand response loads needs to be studied from the electrochemical point of view. \nIn addition to using a suitable battery model, a control scheme is also necessary to optimally utilize batteries for demand response. Optimal battery utilization, in this case, means using the batteries to minimize the electricity cost as much as possible with minimum battery degradation. If not optimized for health, a demand response control policy might cause premature failure and shorter end of life (EOL) of batteries and offset the economic benefit of demand response. This research intends to study how amortized capital and operating expenses can be reduced by utilizing energy storage devices from the perspective of electrochemical battery model-based control. This research also focuses on developing a collective learning algorithm to learn battery degradation behavior over time in a distributed datacenter setting to improve health-conscious demand response. \nThe above ideas are presented in this dissertation with the following studies: The first study uses a one-dimensional, physics-based model of a valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) battery to examine the degree to which battery energy availability during power outages is affected when datacenter UPS systems are used for demand response. The second study builds on the idea of using a separate Lithium-ion battery pack for demand response assuming the availability of a separate energy storage system for emergency power. This study focuses on developing an optimal control strategy for demand response to (i) maximize the dollar savings attainable through peak shaving, while (ii) minimizing battery degradation. The dissertation solves this multi-objective optimization problem using a second-order model of battery charge dynamics, coupled with a physics-based model of battery aging via solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth.  The third study presents a stochastic control framework to handle the inherent uncertainty in datacenter power demand for health-conscious demand response using lithium-ion battery packs. The optimal control problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) problem where uncertain power demand is modeled as a first-order Markov chain. The fourth study examines the degree to which a large-scale datacenter employing distributed lithium-ion batteries for demand response can learn the aging and degradation dynamics of the underlying batteries by measuring their input/output current/voltage data.   Altogether these studies form a foundation for improving current practices of energy storage modeling and control for demand response in terms of electricity cost, and battery aging.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13861], "author_name_tesi": "Mamun, Abdullah-Al ", "last_name_ssi": "Mamun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abdullah-Al", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hosam Fathy", "Hosam Fathy", "Christopher D.

FHWA estimates that $20.5 billion will need to be invested annually in order to eliminate the United States\u2019 bridge deficient backlog by 2028. Bridge deck deterioration is one of the primary concerns and cost factors for transportation agencies. Pennsylvania has one of the highest percentages of structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges in the USA. This thesis is structured in two papers/studies related to the performance of concrete bridge decks in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe first paper summarizes the results of expert survey and field investigations of early-age bridge deck cracking in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  The goal was to use field data to identify factors that contribute to or reduce early-age cracking in concrete bridge decks and to assess the effect of cracks on long-term durability performance of bridge decks.  First, a survey of 71 PennDOT personnel was conducted to collect and document their experience with early-age cracking and its relation to long-term deck performance. Next, inspection data from 203 bridge decks were collected and analyzed to evaluate the effect of concrete mixture proportions and properties, construction methods, and rebar type on the propensity to experience early-age deck cracking. The results suggest that limiting the total cementitious materials content (e.g., to 620 pcy) and the maximum compressive strength (e.g., to 5000 psi at 28 days) is advisable to reduce deck cracking.  In addition, epoxy-coated rebar showed good corrosion resistance even in cracked concrete.\n\nThe second paper focuses on evaluating the deterioration behavior of concrete bridge decks over time. Considering the stochastic nature of infrastructure deterioration, studies have found that time-based probabilistic models are the most accurate for performance prediction. In this paper, a semi-Markov time-based model based on Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) Weibull fitted-parameters is developed. For this purpose, approximately 30 years of in-service performance data for over 22,000 bridges in Pennsylvania were utilized. The proposed approach attempts to relate deck deterioration rates to various explanatory variables such as structural specifications and environmental factors. Furthermore, the effect of remediation on bridge deck deterioration and service life are also evaluated and quantified based on in-service performance data.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11488], "author_name_tesi": "Manafpour, Amir ", "last_name_ssi": "Manafpour", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amir", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aleksandra Z Radlinska"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aleksandra Z Radlinska, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Concrete cracking", "Field inspections", "Concrete Bridge Decks", "Semi-Markov Model", "Probabilistic Deterioration Modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Engineered Interfacial and Structural Porous Media Architecture for Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells", "id": "18091", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8379", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this work is to explore engineered interfacial and structural architecture in fuel cell diffusion media. Emerging electrochemical storage and conversion devices have been under significant development in the past two decades, and the optimization of the interfacial and structural properties of their components presents a complex, multidisciplinary challenge. Interfaces in electrochemical devices must transport heat, mass, and current in an optimized manor to help sustain the electrochemical reaction and efficient operation. Engineering the interfacial and structural architecture of components in electrochemical devices such as fuel cells can yield significant performance breakthroughs that will make them increasingly economically viable for commercial implementation.\nThis dissertation investigates engineered interfacial and structural architecture in fuel cell materials, namely the catalyst layer (CL) and the diffusion media (DM). Cracks were introduced in the CL in order to modify the CL|DM interface. The gas-phase transport and performance of cracked CL was compared to a standard CL. Based on insights gained from the cracked CL investigation, the diffusion media were modified using laser treatment. Perforations were introduced via lasers on samples of virgin DM that contained hydrophobic content. Depending on laser choice, some laser-cut samples displayed a \u201cheat affected zone\u201d (HAZ) at the catalyst layer | microporous layer interface, characterized by a region surrounding each perforation where hydrophobic content was removed. Experimental techniques such as polarization testing, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, neutron radiography, Tafel slope analysis, and others were used to characterize the impact of the laser-modified DM and give fundamental insight into the modified multi-phase transport. A key result of this dissertation proved a 25% increase in power density by optimizing the perforation diameter and the diameter of the heat affected zone. It was shown that the perforation and the heat affected zone uniquely contribute to the performance changes. Namely, the perforation allows for membrane rehydration while the cell is operated with 50% relative humidity inlet gas streams and the heat affected zones redistribute and retain liquid water, leading to improved gas-phase transport. Experiments were conducted to understand the fundamental transport characteristics. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8295], "author_name_tesi": "Manahan, Michael Peter", "last_name_ssi": "Manahan", "middle_name_ssi": "Peter", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew M Mench", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Md Amanul Haque", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew M Mench, Dissertation Advisor", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Chair", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer electrolyte fuel cell", "diffusion media", "laser", "electrochemical energy", "interface", "interfacial modification", "hydrogen"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Effects of a test taking strategy on postsecondary computer assisted chemistry assessments", "id": "24924", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10987", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Metacognitive test taking strategies have proven advantageous in improving content-based test scores in a wide variety of disciplines and age/grade levels using traditional paper-and-pencil tests.

Systems are now much more complex and can support an indefinitely large number of collaborators, from anywhere in the world, doing any imaginable task. While the systems keep getting more and more complex, and seemingly better and better,  humans have yet to truly adapt to these new, virtual, environments. Many of the things that are taken for granted in face-to-face collaborations are completely absent from distributed teamwork. \nOne such of this is transactive memory systems, which are simply, the knowledge of who knows what. While these transactive memory systems are formed easily in face-to-face communication, there has yet to be support for them in a virtual environment. In order to better understand how transactive memory may work, this thesis explores other domains in which distributed group work is common:\n1.\tAwareness\n2.\tCommon Ground\n3.\tTeam Mental Models\nBased on this review of other domains, this thesis proposes a set of design requirements that may be useful in fulfilling the requirements of a transactive memory system. These design requirements are based on a multidisciplinary research approach and provide a generic set of heuristics that can be used in a multitude of systems. Based on these design requirements a system for GeoCollaboration called GeoTMS was designed. This system is explicitly designed to be a front end plug-in for other systems and datasets. It utilizes a new system architecture which will allow programmers to easily and seamlessly integrate it into their own systems.\nFor usability and demonstration purposes, GeoTMS was attached to the NeoCITIES Simulation Engine. This system allowed GeoTMS to be tested across graduate students to better understand the interactions and usability within the interface.\nThis thesis summarizes the results of these studies providing an overview of the system integration and the methods for analysis. Based on these studies, future design and research directions are proposed for the GeoTMS Interaction Environment.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6394], "author_name_tesi": "Mancuso, Vincent Francis", "last_name_ssi": "Mancuso", "middle_name_ssi": "Francis", "first_name_ssi": "Vincent", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Mike Mc Neese", "Michael Mc Neese"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Mike Mc Neese, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Mc Neese, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Decision Making", "GeoTMS", "Distributed Teams", "geocollaboration", "transactive memory", "GIS", "NeoCITIES", "awareness", "common ground", "team mental models", "think-aloud", "HCI"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "An Interdisciplinary Evaluation of Transactive Memory in Distributed Cyber Teams\n", "id": "15347", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7613", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the modern workplace, collaboration is no longer only a face-to-face process. When working together, it is common for teams to rely on technology and operate across geographic, temporal and cultural boundaries. Most research, when looking at distributed teams, takes a uni-disciplinary perspective and fails to address the entire problem space. Because of the technological complexities, deluge of information, and interpersonal interactions, research must address this problem with an interdisciplinary lens.\nRather than looking at collaboration as a broad concept, this dissertation focuses on extracting, and experimenting on the concept of transactive memory. Put simply, transactive memory is the knowledge of \u201cwho knows\u201d what in collaborations. Research unanimously agrees that transactive memory is a positive mediator in improving team collaborating. Through transactive memory, teams can encode information on the knowledge possessed by others, and leverage the specializations of each collaborator to improve their performance and reach their goals quicker. To understand how we can move transactive memory into this interdisciplinary space, this dissertation reviews previous research from the cognitive, social/organizational, and technological perspectives on transactive memory. The cognitive outcome focuses on identifying how teams form, store, and leverage transactive memory to improve their performance. On the other hand, the social/organizational side, rather than looking at outcomes at the individual and team level, focuses on how transactive memory systems affects larger social structures and can be leveraged in organizations to improve performance. Finally, the technological perspective focuses on using previous research in the other perspectives as a design rational in a system design process. \nBased on a review of each of these perspectives, and an understanding of current interdisciplinary research interests and issues, a set of six propositions for future research in transactive memory are proposed. To address a sample of these directions, this dissertation presents an interdisciplinary study to assess transactive memory systems in the technologically complex environment of cyber security. Specifically, this study focused on answering three main questions to account for the cognitive, social/organizational and technological perspectives:\n\n1.\tHow do distributed teams form, maintain and utilize transactive memory systems?\n2.\tWhat are the behavioral, social and organizational outcomes of transactive memory systems in distributed collaborations?\n3.\tHow to best design collaborative interfaces to better support transactive memory formation, utilization and maintenance in distributed teams?\n\nThe understanding of transactive memory, as well as research from cyber security informed the design and development of a new scaled-world simulation to study transactive memory and team collaboration. Set within the context of distributed cyber teams, teamNETS supports the collaborative processes, and decision-making tasks that are present in real cyber security environments. \nTo address the overarching research objectives, 66 teams of three participated in a human-in-the-loop scaled world simulation experiment. The two main independent variables for this study were the presence of shared virtual feedback and the transactive memory structure (integrated vs. differentiated) of the team. In addition to these manipulations, other measures allowed the assessment of transactive memory perceptions, utilization, and content, situation awareness, and team perceptions. While there were no direct effects on team performance for any of the independent variables, there were numerous interesting behavioral findings. The results showed that contrary to expectations, the shared virtual feedback was detrimental to team collaboration. Additionally, while transactive memory structure had no impact on performance, teams in the two conditions took part in very different styles of collaboration.\nContributions of this research include a more informed understanding of transactive memory, and the role of shared virtual feedback in distributed teams. This research also led to the development of a new simulation platform, teamNETS, to allow future studies to ask questions that are more complex and study teams in a more realistic collaborative decision making environment. Based on the proposed research directions, the experimental findings, and the new simulation, this research can be used to inform future interdisciplinary research in not only transactive memory but other constructs of team cognition and collaboration.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7548], "author_name_tesi": "Mancuso, Vincent Francis", "last_name_ssi": "Mancuso", "middle_name_ssi": "Francis", "first_name_ssi": "Vincent", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Michael Mc Neese", "Susan Mohammed", "David J Hall", "John Yen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Michael Mc Neese, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Mohammed, Committee Member", "David J Hall, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["team cognition", "transactive memory", "scaled-world simulation", "cyber security", "interdisciplinary", "distributed teams"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Scalable and robust algorithms for clustering large scale networks", "id": "16386", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8049", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Several social and technological systems around us can be modeled as a network or a graph. The topology of such networks is known to play a major role in understanding and predicting the system behavior. A topological feature which has been observed across several domains is the formation of clusters. A cluster or module or community is a subset of vertices which have high density of con- nections between cluster members and few connections leaving the cluster. The knowledge of clusters is extremely useful in a variety of domains - product rec- ommendations in social networks, characterizing functions on unknown proteins in protein interaction networks, product placement and promotions in retails net- works. In this thesis, we focus four problems addressing different aspects of graph clustering. Firstly, we propose an algorithm which can detect disjoint clusters in graphs. We optimize an existing quality function, called modularity, which quantifies the quality of a given partition. Therefore, detecting clusters is equiva- lent to finding a partition which maximizes modularity. Due to the combinatorial nature of the modularity maximization it is hard to find optimal solutions. We propose an ant colony optimization based heuristic which can detect near optimal partitions in a reasonable amount of time. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm on various social network data sets. Our second problem addresses the issue of detecting robust graph partitions. The motivation behind this problem is to detect partitions which not only maximize modularity but are also immune perturbations in network topology. In several real world setting, perturbations in network topology can be expected due to noisy experimental data. We develop a robust optimization based max-min optimization model in order to define a ro- bust graph partition. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm which can detect a robust partition while maintaining scalability. The usefulness of robust partitions in illustrated on both real and artificial networks. The third problem deals with detecting multiple diverse alternative partitions with high modularity scores. It\niii\nhas already been reported that several dissimilar partitions may exist with quite similar modularity scores. We propose an approach to detect alternative graph partitions by modifying the network topology forcing clustering algorithm to de- tect diverse partitions. We confirm the existence of diverse partitions in several real world networks. A case study is presented for a retail graph (book co-purchase network) at amazon.com illustrating the utility of our approach. As a part of the fourth problem, we propose a first principles definition of a cluster which does not have any limitations of modularity based approaches. Moreover, our approach is able to detect overlapping clusters. We show that our definition of a cluster has a direct correspondence with the nash equilibrium of a non-cooperative game. We define a clustering game and show the existence of a nash equilibrium. Both parallel and non-parallel algorithms are proposed which have a near linear time running time. We compare our approach to existing overlapping cluster detec- tion techniques when tested on artificial networks.

In addition, our ability to model of the formation of both terrestrial and giant planets has improved significantly due to new computing techniques and the continued exponential increase in computing power. In this dissertation I expand on existing theories of terrestrial planet formation to include systems similar to those currently being detected around nearby stars, and I develop new observational techniques to probe the chemistry of gas-rich circumstellar disks where such planetary systems may be forming.\n\nOne of the most significant characteristics of observed extrasolar planetary systems is the presence of giant planets located much closer to their parent star than was thought to be possible. The presence of ``Hot Jupiters', Jovian-mass planets with very short orbital periods orbiting nearby main sequence stars, has been proposed to be primarily due to the orbital migration of planets formed in\norbits initially much further from the parent star.  Close-in giant planets are thought to have formed in the cold outer regions of planetary systems and migrated inward, passing through the orbital parameter space occupied by the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System; the migration of these planets would have profound effects on the evolution of inner terrestrial planets in these systems.\n\nI first explore this scenario with numerical simulations showing that a significant fraction of terrestrial planets could survive the migration process, and possibly eventually return to circular orbits relatively close to their original positions.  A fraction of the final orbits are in the Habitable Zone, suggesting that planetary systems with close-in giant planets are viable targets for searches for Earth-like habitable planets around other stars.\n\nI then present more realistic dynamical simulations of the effects of a migrating giant planet on a disk of protoplanetary material embedded in a gaseous disk, and the subsequent post-scattering evolution of the planetary system. I numerically investigate the dynamics of several types of post-migration planetary systems over 200 million years: a model with a single migrating giant planet, a model with one migrating and one non-migrating giant planet, and a model excluding the effects of the gas disk. Material that is shepherded in front of the migrating giant planet by moving mean motion resonances accretes into \"hot Earths\", but survival of these bodies is strongly dependent on dynamical damping. Furthermore, a significant amount of material scattered outward by the giant planet survives in highly excited orbits; the orbits of these scattered bodies are then damped by gas drag and dynamical friction over the remaining accretion time.  In all simulations Earth-mass planets accrete on approximately 100 Myr timescales, often with orbits in the Habitable Zone. These planets range in mass and water content, with both quantities increasing with the presence of a gas disk and decreasing with the presence of an outer giant planet. I use scaling arguments and previous results to derive a simple recipe that constrains which giant planet systems are able to form and harbor Earth-like planets in the Habitable Zone, demonstrating that roughly one third of the known planetary systems are potentially habitable.\n\nFinally, I present results from a search for new molecular tracers of warm gas in circumstellar disks using the NIRSPEC instrument on the Keck II telescope.  I have detected emission from multiple ro-vibrational transitions in the $v=1-0$ band of hydroxyl (OH) located in the inner circumstellar regions of two Herbig Ae stars, AB Aurigae and MWC 758.  I analyze the temperature of the emitting gas by constructing rotational diagrams, showing that the temperature of the gas in both systems is approximately 700K.  I calculate a secure column density for molecules in the upper vibrational state, and discuss the ramifications of various excitation processes on the extrapolation to a total column density of OH. I also calculate an inner radius for the emitting gas, showing that the derived R_in is equivalent to that found by near-IR imaging. I compare these results to models of circumstellar disk chemistry as well as observations of other chemical diagnostics, and discuss further improvements to excitation models that are necessary to fully understand the formation and thermal conditions of the detected OH gas.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [279], "author_name_tesi": "Mandell, Avram M.", "last_name_ssi": "Mandell", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Avram", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steinn Sigurdsson", "Michael J Mumma", "Eric D Feigelson", "John Andrew Nousek", "Richard Alan Wade", "Christopher Howard House"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steinn Sigurdsson, Committee Chair", "Michael J Mumma, Committee Member", "Eric D Feigelson, Committee Member", "John Andrew Nousek, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Wade, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["planet formation", "habitable planets", "astrobiology", "circumstellar disks"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Dynamics of Brain and CSF Growth in the Developing Hydrocephalic Mouse\n", "id": "9601", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2686", "abstract_tesi": "Hydrocephalus is a disorder resulting in the enlargement of cerebral ventricles due to abnormal CSF production, circulation, or absorption. Even with the rapid advancement of neuroimaging technology, shunt valve design, and surgical techniques, patient outcomes of those with hydrocephalus have changed very little in the past 50 years. In order to characterize and manage hydrocephalus, previous studies have either used a linear measurement of ventricle size and cortical thickness or a ratio of ventricle to brain size, failing to fully characterize morphological changes. Ventricular sizes do not offer a direct indication of cognitive function and seem to be out of context without corresponding and arguably more important brain volume measurements. While previous work has shown that hydrocephalus may result in cortical compression and an increase in water content in periventricular white matter, it remains unclear how hydrocephalic brain volumes change over time and whether brain volume can be a useful tool in the diagnosis and decision to treat hydrocephalus. This study shows the first serial quantification of the development of brain and ventricle volumes in normal and hydrocephalic mice from the postnatal age of two to twelve weeks. Hydrocephalus was induced by a percutaneous injection of kaolin (aluminum silicate) into the cisterna magna and the mice were imaged with high-field MRI. Two responses were seen: the hydrocephalic brain volume either increased faster than normal when substantial edematous brain tissue was seen, or displayed growth consistent with control animals when there was no obvious sign of brain edema. These two responses were shown to be significantly different using linear discriminant analysis. Additionally, no hydrocephalic brain grew slower than controls, suggesting the skull was able to expand to compensate for the increased volume. This study shows the first evidence of brain growth faster than normal in the untreated hydrocephalus of neonatal patients. It is not only feasible to use MRI to quantify the development of brain and ventricle volumes in hydrocephalic patients, it is essential to fully understand the morphological changes of hydrocephalus.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2681], "author_name_tesi": "Mandell, Jason Gregory", "last_name_ssi": "Mandell", "middle_name_ssi": "Gregory", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Webb", "Andrew G Webb", "Steven Schiff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Webb, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew G Webb, Thesis Advisor", "Steven Schiff, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["magnetic resonance imaging", "kaolin", "Hydrocephalus"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF A SEISMIC DISSIPATING MECHANISM FOR PRECAST CONCRETE CLADDING PANELS\n", "id": "7449", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2357", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-01-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Modern earthquake-resistant design aims to isolate architectural precast concrete panels from the structural system so as to reduce the interaction with the supporting structure and hence minimize damage. The present study seeks to maximize the cladding-structure interaction by developing an energy dissipating cladding system (EDCS) that is capable of functioning both as a structural brace, as well as a source of energy dissipation. The EDCS is designed to provide added stiffness and damping to buildings with steel moment resisting frames with the goal of favorably modifying the building response to earthquake-induced forces without demanding any inelastic action and ductility from the basic lateral force resisting system. Because many modern building facades typically have continuous and large openings on top of the precast cladding panels at each floor level for window system, the present study focuses on spandrel type precast concrete cladding panel. The research work was divided broadly into four main phases: literature study; preliminary study; component level study; and building level study. The preliminary design of the EDCS was based on existing guidelines and research data on architectural precast concrete cladding and supplemental energy dissipation devices. In the component-level study, the preliminary design was validated and further refined based on the results of nonlinear finite element analyses. The stiffness and strength characteristics of the EDCS were established from a series of nonlinear finite element analyses. Using elastic theory, simple expressions were derived to approximate the lateral stiffness of the EDCS. In addition, a simple mathematical model of the EDCS was developed to facilitate the preliminary design of buildings incorporating EDCS. From the results of the nonlinear time history analyses performed on a 9-story and a 20-story moment frames, the EDCS was found to be effective in reducing interstory drift and member forces through the combined action of added stiffness and energy dissipation.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2342], "author_name_tesi": "Maneetes, Hathairat ", "last_name_ssi": "Maneetes", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hathairat", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali M Memari", "Linda Morley Hanagan", "M Kevin Parfitt", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali M Memari, Committee Chair", "Linda Morley Hanagan, Committee Member", "M Kevin Parfitt, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cladding panel", "energy dissipation", "seismic"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Role of Prosocial Motives in Predicting Emotional Labor Strategy and Service Performance: Understanding the 'Why' as Well as the 'How'\n\n\n", "id": "12459", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5697", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Positive employee displays, or \u2018service with a smile,\u2019 predict customer satisfaction. Thus, it is important to understand how employees create such positive displays. One way of understanding how employees create positive displays is through the use of emotional labor, or emotion regulation done for a wage.  Two strategies have been focused on in the literature; surface acting (SA), or expression modification, and deep acting (DA), or feeling modification.  It is often found that DA relates positively to performance and SA has no relationship. Self Determination Theory and Relational Job Design theory are drawn on to posit that prosocial motives for work are an important individual difference to help increase the field\u2019s understanding of when DA and SA are used and when they predict service performance. It was predicted that prosocial motives would be positively related to DA, and unrelated to SA (hypothesis 1). It was also predicted that while DA would mediate an indirect relationship between prosocial motives and rapport (hypothesis 2), prosocial motives would moderate the negative relationship between SA and rapport (hypothesis 3). Using a field sample of grocery store clerks to test the hypotheses, it was found that prosocial motives were positively related to DA and were negatively related to SA. DA was found to be unrelated to rapport, and thus did not mediate the relationship between prosocial motives and rapport. Prosocial motives did not have a main effect on rapport. Finally, support was found for an interaction between SA and prosocial motives when predicting rapport. When SA was high, performance was nearly the same, regardless of motives. However, when SA was low, those with high prosocial motives were found to be higher performers than those with low prosocial motives. The findings suggest that one must either engage in SA or be prosocially motivated to perform well, but that there is no added benefit of having both. This supports the notion that researchers need to understand why as well as how employees behave at work to understand service performance.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5692], "author_name_tesi": "Maneotis, Sarina  M.
