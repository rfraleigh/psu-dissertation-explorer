The latter copolymers were acrylate rich. Several other metal salts also catalyze the homopolymerization of MMA in the presence of MAO. The addition of galvinoxyl had no effect on the polymerization ability of these systems. EPR experiments suggest that the commonly employed radical traps, galvinoxyl, DPPH, and TEMPO, are destroyed by methyl aluminoxane (MAO), thereby enabling radical polymerizations to proceed despite the addition of these traps to the reaction mixture. Thus, probing for a radical polymerization mechanism through the use of stable radical traps may not be valid for such systems employing MAO. \nThe addition of the Lewis acid, Sc(OTf)3, to 2,2\u2019-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) initiated copolymerizations of both methyl acrylate (MA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) with 1-alkenes results in increased reaction rate and increased incorporation of the latter monomer into the polymer backbone.

Earlier models found that a monotonically decreasing relationship existed between the average speed and flow in the network. However, a monotonically decreasing relationship is only practical under free-flow or light conditions; therefore, these earlier models were only able to describe the uncongested regime. Recent work has shown that the average flow and density of a network are related and can dynamically describe both uncongested and congested conditions in an urban network. This relationship, known as the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), can be used to describe large-scale network dynamics and develop network-wide control strategies to improve efficiency. \n\nThis work examined the accuracy of combining data from fixed sensors and mobile probe vehicles to estimate traffic states in real-time. Formulae were developed to estimate the average flow, density, speed, accumulation, and exit flow, along with the uncertainty of these estimates. The methodology was tested using data obtained from several micro-simulated networks to replicate realistic urban transportation networks. Tests using the micro-simulated models showed that estimations were within 10% of the true value for average flow, density, accumulation, and exit flow when 20% of the circulating vehicles served as probes and average speed estimations were shown to be even more accurate. In addition, the mobile probe estimation methodology was used to inform a network-wide perimeter metering strategy on an idealized grid network. These results were compared to metering based on actual traffic states, and the results illustrated that metering can significantly reduce total travel times compared to the non-metering case if 25% of the vehicles in the network serve as probe vehicles. In general, this work shows that the estimation method may be used to inform network-wide metering strategies, which improve network stability and reduce congestion without additional costly infrastructure improvements.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9606], "author_name_tesi": "Nagle, Andrew Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Nagle", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vikash Varun Gayah"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vikash Varun Gayah, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram", "Mobile Probe Vehicles", "Traffic Flow Theory", "Intelligent Transportation Systems"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Reveals Dynamic and Structural Characterization of Zea Mays Primary Cell Walls", "id": "15221bnn1", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15221", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (ssNMR) methods are used to elucidate the architecture and arrangement of polysaccharides in the grass cell wall (CW). Our understanding of physical interactions between cellulose and hemicellulose components in intact CWs is very limited. These interactions contribute towards CW cohesiveness and recalcitrance against enzymatic deconstruction. Previous ssNMR work has investigated model systems, such as Arabidopsis and Brachypodium, whereas most cellulosic feedstocks in the future are expected to originate from sugarcane, switchgrass, Miscanthus, maize and other species in the grass family (Poaceae). This dissertation work makes use of multi-dimensional ssNMR methods and 13C-enriched cell walls from the grass species Zea mays (maize) to address interactions between glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the most predominant hemicellulose, and other polysaccharides.  Unique to the Poaceae family, \u03b2-(1,3- 1,4)-D-glucan (MLG) is the second most abundant hemicellulose in the maize CW (and is absent from Arabidopsis and Brachypodium).  The maize grass CW is estimated to be constituted of 20-30 % cellulose, 20 \u2013 40 % xylans, 10 \u2013 30 % MLG, 5 % pectins, and 1- 5 % xyloglucan (XyG).  \n\nTo identify polysaccharide interactions, the maize coleoptile (the rapidly growing organ) CW was investigated.  Novel findings include the presence of xylan in a two-fold (2 residues per 360\u00b0 twist) and three-fold (3 residues per 360\u00b0 twist) backbone configuration, which implicates the location of xylan in the CW.  MLG was revealed for the first time en muro for the maize coleoptile. Polymer dynamics studies revealed two distinct domains of MLG: a rigid domain responsible for binding cellulose and a mobile domain that is indicative of filling space with other non-cellulosic matrix polymers. The two-dimensional experiment, proton driven spin diffusion (PDSD), also identified cross peaks that suggest MLG is in close proximity to cellulose but not as intimately as GAX\u2013cellulose interactions. One-dimensional (1D) ssNMR and monosaccharide analysis revealed that approximately 15 % of the coleoptile cell wall is composed of pectin, specifically homogalacturonan (HG).  All of these results lead suggest the presence of a grass cell wall structure that is distinct from the CW described for Brachypodium system. \n\nMaize coleoptiles were treated with  (i) Bacillus subtilis endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase (XynC), (ii) Bacillus subtillis endo-1,3:1,4-\u03b2-D-glucanase (lichenase), and (iii) XynC followed by lichenase to access and assess the key hemicellulose, GAX and MLG. The results suggested a low-substituted (ls)GAX extensively binds cellulose in a two fold backbone conformation, while a three-fold backbone conformation of high-substituted (hs)GAX fills the interfibrillar space.  MLG binds cellulose, but not to the extent of GAX.  It was also shown that MLG binds the lsGAX when associated with cellulose.  These findings were summarized in a cartoon model of all possible hemicellulose interactions within the grass cell wall of maize coleoptiles.  \n\nAdditional maize systems including mesocotyls, true leaves, and roots were investigated to structurally characterize the CWs.  Subtle differences were identified among different organs of the maize seedling, which may offer insights into the relationship between CW structure and organ growth/function.   In all, these studies led to a more complete understanding of the grass CW structure and dynamics.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16635], "author_name_tesi": "Nagle, Brittney Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Nagle", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Brittney", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin James Lear", "Benjamin James Lear", "Philip C Bevilacqua", "Miriam Arak Freedman", "Daniel J Cosgrove"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin James Lear, Dissertation Advisor", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Chair", "Philip C Bevilacqua, Committee Member", "Miriam Arak Freedman, Committee Member", "Daniel J Cosgrove, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["solid-state NMR", "maize", "cell walls", "primary cell walls", "Zea mays"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Vertical Food Production:  Applications and Modeling", "id": "29498", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12455", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Faced with the challenge of feeding a world of 9.6 billion people by 2050, landscape architects, producers, consumers, community, government, for-profit, and non-profit partners must consider agricultural designs that meet social and environmental goals; account for the true cost of food, including subsidies and externalities; address a changing climate, wasted food, and lack of food access; and reduce reliance on non-renewable forms of energy such as fossil fuels.  \n\tIn this study, the researcher explores the viability of vertical walls as an alternative growing strategy for urban agriculture where land is limited, contaminated, or expensive.  The thesis considers the ecosystem services provided by green walls, as well as the practical methods of growing produce through experimentation.

The researcher then assessed the relationship between biomass and sun hours for the preliminary development of a model that predicts crop biomass productivity of food walls experiencing different light levels.  However, solar exposure is one of several significant parameters that determine crop productivity of a vertical food wall.  The thesis discusses other inputs/outputs for a vertical food wall extension needed to increase the accuracy of model predictions in variable environments.\n\tIn addition, the thesis explores the costs and benefits of implementing food walls in the urban environment depending on the priorities of the grower and the ecosystem service benefits prioritized.

They can be found in permafrost and oceanic environments.  The amount of natural gas trapped into worldwide hydrate deposits has been estimated at 18000 trillion m3 of methane [1] and it surpasses the world natural gas proven reserves (180 trillion m3 [2]) by two orders of magnitude. Fossil fuel based energy is still a major source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Hence, it contributes greatly to the issues of global warming and climate change. Geological sequestration of carbon dioxide appears as the safest and most stable way to reduce such emissions for it involves CO2 entrapment into hydrocarbon reservoirs and aquifers. Indeed, CO2 can also be sequestered as hydrates while assisting in the dissociation of in-situ methane hydrates. This approach could help mitigate the emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere and improve the economics of carbon dioxide sequestration and natural gas production from hydrate deposits. The proposed research focused on investigating the feasibility of the CO2-CH4 exchange in hydrates as a gas hydrate mining method through experimental studies and numerical modeling of the exchange, as well as the application of a life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach to the evaluation of CO2 emissions resulting from the use of the replacement technique. Under the limitations of our numerical model and experiments, we were able to establish the influence of initial reservoir temperature and pressure on the performance of the exchange. We also noticed the influence of the presence of excess water during the exchange. These observations have been confirmed in the relevant literature.

In particular, it focuses on the ability of Energy Efficiency (EE) resources to engage in arbitrage through bids into the RPM. There is currently no published research on the effect of this type of arbitrage behavior. This study provides the first analysis of capacity market arbitrage behavior by evaluating the market conditions necessary to engage in arbitrage and the implications that it has on market performance.\n\nTwo different models are used to analyze arbitrage opportunities within the bidding structure of PJM\u2019s RPM. A decision model, which assumes perfect information, and an option-based valuation model accounting for uncertainty are used to determine the conditions under which there is an incentive for parties to engage in arbitrage. Empirical sensitivity analysis is conducted using RPM auction data from PJM and building load data from the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Through this analysis, conditions are derived under which parties bidding energy efficiency capacity into the RPM have incentives to either follow through with investment in this capacity, or instead, to engage in arbitrage by covering their bid by purchasing lower priced capacity available in the short term market. \n\nThe results of the empirical analysis provide threshold values for capacity market auction prices, which determine whether or not owners of energy efficiency resources would engage in arbitrage or follow through with an efficiency upgrade. The results of this analysis are very similar for both the recursive and perfect information models. For large commercial buildings with a peak demand of greater than 1 MW, the arbitrage strategy is profitable in expectation for the perfect information model when the total nominal capital investment cost is greater than 9.9 times the nominal annual energy savings resulting from that efficiency upgrade. Similarly, the decision to delay and engage in arbitrage will be made in the recursive game when the capital investment to annual energy savings ratio is greater than 8.8:1. For medium-sized commercial buildings with a peak demand between 0.25 and 1 MW, the arbitrage strategy is expected to be profitable, for the perfect information model, when the ratio of the total capital investment to annual energy savings is greater than 9.0:1 and is never used when this ratios is less than 8.6:1. For the recursive game, the decision to delay is made when the capital investment to annual energy savings ratio is greater than 8.6:1. For small commercial buildings, with a peak demand of less than 250 kw, the arbitrage strategy is expected to be profitable when the total capital investment to annual energy savings ratio is greater than 9.0:1 and will never be profitable when this ratio is less than 8.6:1. The decision to delay and engage in arbitrage will be made for the recursive model when this ratio is greater than 8.6:1. \n\nIn comparison with typical efficiency upgrades, there is a moderate potential for owners of energy efficiency resources to engage in arbitrage. Most efficiency projects have a total capital investment to annual energy savings ratio of about 4:1, however there are a large number of efficiency upgrades that are undertaken with a total capital investment to annual energy savings ratio between 5:1 and 10:1. Compared to a profitable capital investment to energy savings ratio of about 9:1 for arbitrage activity, there is significant opportunity for efficiency resource owners to engage in capacity market arbitrage. \n\nI conclude that the arbitrage opportunity identified in this research may lead to market failures within the RPM if the bidding strategy is widely adopted by market participants. The cost of meeting installed capacity requirements may increase due to a potential shift from a three-year forward market to something closer to a spot market for capacity. In more extreme circumstances, this behavior may result in resource adequacy problems for PJM. As a result, it is recommended that PJM limit arbitrage activity by adopting policy changes to further regulate the bidding structure of the RPM. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8777], "author_name_tesi": "Nagy, Stefan ", "last_name_ssi": "Nagy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Stefan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy efficiency", "capacity", "capacity market", "PJM", "arbitrage", "electricity", "resource adequacy"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "MODULATION OF MICROGLIA AND CD8+ T LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION BY PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRESS-INDUCED HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS TYPE-1 ENCEPHALITIS\n\n\n\n", "id": "7095", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "522", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The immunosuppressive nature of glucocorticoids has been well documented both in vitro and in vivo.  This glucocorticoid-mediated immunosuppression has also been observed in immune cells within the central nervous system (CNS).  Although microglia function is diminished upon treatment with glucocorticoids in vitro, the impact of glucocorticoids on microglia function in vivo has not been fully investigated.  To determine the interaction between glucocorticoids and microglia within the CNS, we used a restraint model of psychological stress to elevate corticosterone levels in mice.  Quantification of microglia from stressed mice indicated that four sessions of stress induced the proliferation of microglia.  This proliferation was a function of corticosterone-induced activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor within the CNS since blockade of corticosterone synthesis, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), or the NMDA receptor each prevented stress-induced increases in microglia number.  In addition, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 prevented increases in microglia following exogenous corticosterone administration to non-stressed mice.  We conclude that activation of the NMDA receptor and subsequent microglia proliferation is a downstream effect of elevated corticosterone levels.  These findings demonstrate that elevated levels of glucocorticoids are able to activate microglia in vivo and suggest that stress is able to induce a pro-inflammatory response within the CNS.\n\tDespite these findings, the impact of stress-induced pro-inflammatory responses on CNS inflammation is still not well understood.  To determine the effect of corticosterone-induced, NMDA receptor-mediated activation on CNS inflammation, we utilized a murine model of stress-induced herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE).  We have previously demonstrated that psychological stress enhances the development of HSE in mice by delaying the infiltration of HSV-specific CD8+ T cells into the brain.  To determine the immune mechanisms by which stress promotes the development of HSE, we examined the role of the GR and the NMDA receptor in the development of HSE.  Our findings demonstrate that blockade of either the GR or the NMDA receptor enhances survival following HSV-1 infection in stressed mice to levels similar to non-stressed mice.  Subsequent studies determined the effect of GR and NMDA receptor blockade on immune function by specifically examining both microglia and CD8+ T cell activation.  Stress inhibited expression of MHC class I by microglia and other brain-derived antigen presenting cells (CD45hi) independent of either the glucocorticoid receptor or the NMDA receptor, indicating that stress-induced suppression of major histocompatability complex (MHC) class I expression in the brain does not affect survival during HSV-1 infection.  Blockade of the NMDA receptor, however, diminished HSV-1-induced increases in class I expression by CD45hi cells from non-stressed mice suggesting that blockade of the NMDA receptor may limit CNS inflammation.  Also, while CD8+ T cell activation and function in the brain were not affected by stress, the number of CD8+ T cells in the superficial cervical lymph nodes (SCLN) was decreased in stressed mice via GR-mediated mechanisms.  These findings indicate that stress-induced hypocellularity is mediated by the GR while NMDA receptor activation is responsible for enhancing CNS inflammation.  The combined effects of GR-mediated hypocellularity of the SCLN and NMDA receptor-mediated CNS inflammation during stress promote the development of HSE.  Taken together, these studies demonstrate that stress-induced modulation of immune function enhances the susceptibility of the CNS to HSV-1 infection.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [519], "author_name_tesi": "Nair, Aji ", "last_name_ssi": "Nair", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Harold Bonneau", "Ian Alexander Simpson", "Todd Schell", "Ralph Norgren", "J Kyle Krady"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Chair", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "Ralph Norgren, Committee Member", "J Kyle Krady, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microglia", "central nervous system", "CD8+ T cells", "glucocorticoids", "NMDA receptor", "herpes simplex virus", "psychological stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Synthesis and application of functional polymeric nanofibers\n", "id": "7666", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6000", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The central objectives of this thesis are to develop engineering based approaches for the synthesis of functional (conducting) nanofibers and biocatalytic nanofibers; and to exploit the use of biocatalytic nanofibers for enzyme based applications. Despite several advances in template synthesis, the release and re-capture of nanomaterials produced within the template still remains a critical issue. This difficulty may be avoided if one can produce and transfer nanomaterials directly to the target substrate while they are produced from an ordered array of nano-scale reactors without disintegrating the reactor array. The first part of this thesis aims at developing a nano-manufacturing technique for the continuous synthesis and extrusion of ordered arrays of polymeric nanofibers from nanoporous templates. As a poof of concept the synthesis and extrusion of polyethylene nanofibers by heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta polymerization within nanochannels of robust anodized aluminum oxide membranes is described.\nThe second part of this thesis aims at the development of nano-manufacturing techniques for the synthesis of conducting polymer composite nanofibers. Conducting polymers such as polypyrrole and poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) have a great potential in the field of flexible electronics, nano-electronics and bio-sensing. However, despite its superior thermal and environmental stability it suffers from being intractable. Conducting polymers such as polypyrrole is insoluble and infusible in almost all solvents - a limitation that prevents it from being processed into useful devices, especially at the nanoscale. Due to the same reason, nanofibers of these polymers cannot be directly fabricated by convenient methods such as electrospinning. To address this issue, electrically conducting composite nanofibers are produced by a two step process. First, electrospinning is used to synthesize template fibers loaded with suitable oxidants. Second, the template fibers are exposed to the monomer vapors which diffuse into the templates and are oxidized to form the conducting polymer. Electrically conducting polypyrrole-polyethylene-oxide (PPy-PEO) nanofibers, polypyrrole shell-polystyrene core (PPy-PS) nanofibers and poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) shell \u2013polystyrene core (PEDOT-PS) nanofibers were synthesized in this way. The effect of two different oxidants \u2013 ferric chloride and ferric toluenesulfonate, on the polymerization process was also investigated. The nonwoven mat of nanofibers was also exploited for gas sensing applications. \nThe third part of this thesis focuses on the fabrication of nanofibers for enzyme based biocatalytic applications. Fabrication of highly stable enzyme coatings on the nanofibers is described. To improve the enzyme loading onto electrospun nanofibers an alcohol dispersion technique has been formulated. The dispersed nanofibers containing covalently attached enzymes or crosslinked enzyme coatings have been exploited as continuous flow reactors. Stability of the enzyme coatings in highly reactive environments has been investigated.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5992], "author_name_tesi": "Nair, Sujith ", "last_name_ssi": "Nair", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sujith", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim", "Michael V Pishko", "Darrell Velegol", "Qing Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim, Committee Chair", "Michael V Pishko, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrospinning", "polyethylene", "polypyrrole"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "BRANCHED CHAIN AMINO ACIDS SUPPLEMENTATION OF DRINKING WATER AND DIET INDUCED OBESITY", "id": "10663", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "429", "abstract_tesi": "Recent studies have implicated amino acids, branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), or Leu alone in improvements of adiposity, body weight control, insulin sensitivity or energy expenditure in humans and rodent models.

The potential effects of these changes on local wildlife habitat have not been previously quantified. In this study, I quantified these changes in a three-stage process. This involved: 1) generating vegetation maps for 1941 and 2005 at the 16 ha grid resolution, 2) quantifying and analyzing the vegetation change between these two years, and 3) using the vegetation change data for both years to estimate changes in suitable habitat for the Northern Goshawk (Accipter gentiles), the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), the Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), the California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis), the American Marten (Martes americana), and the Fisher (Martes pennanti) using the California Wildlife Habitat Relations system.

Based on the observed vegetation changes and their effect on the suitability of habitat for these species, I propose several management schemes. Because dense stands and remnants of \u201cold-growth\u201d forests are present in the ELRD\u2019s southern and western sections, these areas should be maintained to promote California Spotted Owl, American Marten, and Fisher.

I focus on statements from the Passions of the Soul, where Descartes claims that at conception the soul falls in love with the blood located in the heart. I attempt to understand this passage in the context of Late Scholastic and Early Modern philosophy and medicine. I conclude that the mind-body problem is in fact a problem of self love: why does the divinely created soul love this particular body?\nAlthough Descartes eliminates substantial forms from his theory of nature, he still insists that the soul is the only substantial form in nature. Following his predecessors such as Francisco Suarez and physician Jean Fernel, Descartes believes that the soul joins with the body on the basis of certain dispositions or accommodations. Physicians such as Fernel or William Harvey believed that the body contained a divine element within it, be it a spirit or the blood itself, that worked as a hinge joining the divinely created spirit and the sexually reproduced body. Descartes believes that this disposition is the blood located in the heart. \nHowever, Descartes theory runs aground when he asserts that this disposition is strictly mundane, featuring no divine element whatsoever, and having the same structure as other kinds of inorganic heat. Descartes believes that the nature of this heat and the movement of the blood that creates it are derived from the semens, which are themselves utterly mundane. This stands in contrast to his predecessors who believed that the divine nature of the blood was derived from the divinity of the semen, as the most divine components of the semen combined to create the heart. Because Descartes denies the involvement of any supernatural spirit or substance in the process of generation, he must assert that the body, and its dispositions, is like any other matter. While his predecessors could coherently believe that the soul loves a human body because the human body has a distinctly divine element, the uniformity of Cartesian nature leaves Descartes without an explanation of this union. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2654], "author_name_tesi": "Nale, John Elias", "last_name_ssi": "Nale", "middle_name_ssi": "Elias", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Lambert Bernasconi", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi", "Emily Rolfe Grosholz", "Jennifer Mensch", "Mark Stewart Morrisson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Lambert Bernasconi, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi, Committee Chair", "Emily Rolfe Grosholz, Committee Member", "Jennifer Mensch, Committee Member", "Mark Stewart Morrisson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Descartes", "Mind-Body Problem", "Blood", "Race", "Generation", "Sex", "Love", "Jean Fernel", "William Harvey", "Ficino"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "STUDIES IN MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS OF FUSARIUM SPECIES\n", "id": "6258", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1942", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-02-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Species of Fusarium cause disease on plants, animals and humans, and many produce mycotoxins.  Three different studies involving molecular phylogenetics of Fusarium species were carried out.  Fusarium avenaceum has been associated with severe outbreaks of crown and stem rot of lisianthus, and Fusarium solani with caladium tuber rot outbreaks in Florida.  In the first study, we sequenced parts of two genes, translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef) and beta-tubulin (benA), in F. avenaceum.  Phylogenetic analyses showed F. avenaceum isolates to be monophyletic with strong bootstrap support and genealogical concordance.  Isolates from lisianthus were scattered within the F. avenaceum clade.  The low degree of phylogenetic divergence contrasted with a high degree of vegetative incompatibility structure among isolates from lisianthus.  Pathogenicity tests of several F. avenaceum isolates including those from other hosts showed the ability to cause disease on lisianthus suggesting that any F. avenaceum is potentially a pathogen of lisianthus.\nIn the second study, we investigated the evolutionary origins of F. solani isolates from caladium.  Portions of the benA and tef genes were sequenced in 57 isolates and a subset of 20 isolates were chosen to sequence the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) and nuclear large sub unit (NLSU) of the rRNA gene.  The individual and combined analysis of the genes showed two new clades associated with caladium within clade 3 of the F. solani species complex (FSSC).  There were significant differences in growth rate and pigmentation between clades suggesting that these were two different species that cause disease on caladium.  These species appear to be closely related to opportunistic human pathogens commonly found in our environment.\nIn the third study, F. solani isolates were obtained from soil and from perithecia found on bark and fruit in primary forests of Sri Lanka and Australia.  Portions of the tef, ITS and NLSU genes were sequenced in over 100 isolates.  All soil-derived isolates from Sri Lanka were in Clade 3 and most ascospore isolates in Clade 2 respectively, while all isolates from Australia were in Clade 3.  These results shed light on the possible taxonomic revision and epitypification of F. solani.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1924], "author_name_tesi": "Nalim, F.

Assembly planning includes other areas such as resource allocation, line balancing, work cell layout etc. Assembly sequencing can be defined as the ordering of collision free operations which bring all the parts together when the geometric description of all the parts in the final assembly is given. Assembly costs account for more than 50% of the production costs. A good assembly plan can reduce the production costs by a huge amount. We consider assembly sequencing problem in this thesis. Automating the assembly planning process will help the designers make the decisions which will result in better assembly planning and hence reduced production time and costs. \nIn order to automate the assembly sequence generation, we need the CAD data of the final assembly. In this thesis, STEP files are taken as input to generate the assembly sequences for a given assembly, as it is the most commonly used CAD format. Assembly sequences are generated by representing the CAD information from the STEP files as Liaison graph and blocking graph. Liaison graph is the graph which represents the contact information between any two parts in an assembly. Blocking graph represents the blocking relations between all the parts in an assembly. Once the Liaison and blocking graphs are generated, feasible assembly sequences are generated from those two graphs. \nAs the number of components increases, time required to assemble the parts increases exponentially. In order to reduce the assembly/ disassembly time, it is necessary to group different parts into subassemblies. These subassemblies can be assembled/ disassembled in parallel which results in saving a lot of time. The information from the liaison graphs and fasteners is used in generating subassemblies from the assembly STEP file. \nAn assembly sequence is considered optimal when the sequence generated is feasible, i.e. it satisfies all the geometric constraints and the assembly cost associated with that sequence is minimal when compared to all other sequences. Assembly cost can be computed based on several criteria such as the number of direction changes, number of gripper changes, and the similarity in consequent assembly operations. Since the assembly sequence planning problem is highly constrained and large scale problem, genetic algorithms have been used to find the optimal assembly plan. Through sampling the feasible solutions by using relevant criteria, the time to compute optimal solution can be reduced considerably. Genetic algorithms are used to reduce the computation time drastically. As the traditional genetic algorithms will generate a lot of infeasible solutions during evolution, this will reduce the efficiency of algorithm. To address this issue, a new guided genetic algorithm is presented which deals only with feasible assembly sequences at every point of evolution. The criteria used to compute the assembly cost is the number of reorientations/ direction changes. Finally, all these algorithms are implemented on two test cases to illustrate their effectiveness\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8392], "author_name_tesi": "Nallamothu, Phani Teja", "last_name_ssi": "Nallamothu", "middle_name_ssi": "Teja", "first_name_ssi": "Phani", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar R.

While many transcriptional programs that govern EMT are well studied, little is known about how the cytoskeleton contributes to EMT progression.  Here, we find that the expression levels of cytoskeletal associated proteins are increased during transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 induced EMT which correlates with cytoskeletal rearrangements and increased exertion of contractile forces by cells. Furthermore, we find that inhibition of ERK 1/2 and p38 MAPK dramatically impacts the acquisition of myofibroblast characteristics during EMT.  These studies identify key cytoskeletal associated signaling pathways that regulate the development of myofibroblasts and suggest approaches to promote myofibroblast development for reparative functions or to abrogate the activation of myofibroblasts in pathological contexts.

Experimental validation of these correlation solutions are performed computationally and in an underwater environment. The computational experiments are designed to test highly controlled variations to the idealized case (e.g. sound field content, transducer phasing issues, additive output noise, etc.). Additional verification is provided from physical tests measuring the correlations between a pair of acoustic vector sensors in a large reverberant tank which is excited acoustically with broadband noise.

A new class of polyolefin copolymers with an\ninterpenetrating network (IPN) structure is considered as a practical and comprehensive\nsolution for oil spill recovery and cleanup.\nAfter discussing some background information (Chapter 1) and current sorbent\ntechnology (Chapter 2), I will explain my research approach and experimental results,\ninvolving various polyolefin absorbent materials for oil and hydrocarbon spill recovery.\nTo understand the structure-property relationship in polyolefin absorption capacity and\nkinetics, a systematic study (Chapter 3) was first conducted using a series of semicrystalline\nethylene/1-octene copolymers (LLDPE thermoplastics with a broad range of\ncrystallinity) and amorphous cross-linked 1-decene/DVB (x-D/DVB) copolymers\n(elastomers with a wide variety of crosslinking density). They are swellable but not soluble\nin any hydrocarbon liquids under ambient temperature conditions. The absorption\nevaluation involved various hydrocarbon liquids, including solvents (hexane, cyclohexane,\nand toluene), refined oil products (gasoline, diesel, and petroleum oil) and Alaska North\nSlope (ANS) crude oil. In general, the absorption capacity is controlled by the network\nstructure. The maximum absorption capacities of semi-crystalline LLDPE and amorphous\nx-D/DVB elastomer with toluene can reach 35 and 43 times that of the polymer mass,\nrespectively. However, with the complex oils, the absorption profile is determined by a\niv\ncombination of absorbate composition and absorbent network structure and morphology.\nBoth polymer systems exhibit poor absorption performance with ANS crude oil.\nThe systematic study provides important information about how the polymer structure\nand morphology affects the hydrocarbon absorption capacity and kinetics. Thus, a new\npolyolefin IPN structure was designed and fabricated by the combination of two polyolefin\ncopolymers, including semicrystalline LLDPE thermoplastics and amorphous x-D/DVB\nelastomers (Chapter 4). The IPN structure allows the formation of porous morphology with\nrelatively high free volume between two intertwined rigid and soft polymer chains, which\nenhances the diffusion of highly viscous hydrocarbon liquids and the swelling capacity of\nthe polymer matrix. Some resulting polyolefin IPN structures show a very high\nhydrocarbon absorption capacity (>40 times by weight) and fast kinetics for all examined\nhydrocarbon absorbates, independent on the type of organic solvents and oils. The selective\noil absorption (without water) offers buoyancy, stability, and easy recovery on water\nsurfaces. In addition, the recovered oil swollen gel, containing >97% oil and <3%\npolyolefin (which is completely thermally degradable to small hydrocarbon molecules), is\nsuitable for the regular oil-refining process (an economical, no waste, and no pollutant\napproach).\nOnce the desirable polyolefin IPN structure was validated in the laboratory, a scale-up\nstudy was performed with the target of developing a commercial process that can be used\nfor the large-scale production (Chapter 5). More than 20 pounds polyolefin IPN material\nhave been delivered to DOI BSEE for an operational test at the Ohmsett (NJ, USA) facility.\nThey had successfully examined the recovery of ANS crude oil spilled in seawater (salinity\n29-33 ppt) under outdoor cool weather environment with similar 40 times ANS oil\nv\nabsorption capacity and fast kinetics.

Therefore, studies of evolution of these gene families are expected to give some insights into the evolution of morphological characters. With this in mind, the following four related studies were conducted. (1) The origin and diversification of MADS-box genes controlling flowering in plants were studied. The results suggested that the ancestor of floral MADS-box genes diverged from the group of MADS-box genes controlling development of vegetative tissues about 650 MYA. The results also suggested that several classes of floral MADS-box genes already existed around the time of the Cambrian explosion, which is much earlier than the time of the origin of flowering plants. (2) The patterns of duplication and loss of MADS-box genes in the genomes of Arabidopsis and rice were studied. It was shown that type I MADS-box genes which were poorly characterized biochemically and functionally have experienced a higher rate of birth-and-death evolution than the type II MADS-box genes. Further analyses suggested that segmental duplication occurred more frequently in type I genes than in type II genes, indicating a higher rate of birth-and-death evolution in type I genes than in type II genes. (3) A simple statistical method for predicting the gene regions that are functionally differentiated between duplicate genes was developed. This method is to compare the evolutionary rates of two genes using sliding window analysis and identify the regions (or windows) of significant rate differences as possible candidates for functional differentiation. This method was applied to 23 pairs of closely related MIKC-type MADS-box genes from petunia. Of the 23 pairs, 14 pairs showed a significant rate difference. Interestingly, most of the predicted regions were within the K-domain, which is important for the dimerization of MADS-box proteins. These predicted regions may be chosen for further experimental studies. (4) The pattern of duplication and loss of homeobox genes in the 11 species of bilateral animals was studied. There are more than 200 homeobox genes in the genome of vertebrates and about 100 homeobox genes in the genome of invertebrate studied. On the basis of a phylogenetic analysis, it was estimated that there were at least 88 homeobox genes in the MRCA of the 11 species. Of the 88 genes, similar numbers (&#8776; 50 ~ 60) of homeobox genes left at least one descendents (or survived) in the genome of each species, and many genes have been lost in a lineage-specific manner. The genes that survived in each evolutionary lineage experienced frequent gene duplication events, and some of duplicate genes were lost much later. Because the gene losses studied here are losses of ancient duplicate genes, these gene losses are very likely to have caused the evolutionary changes of morphological and/or physiological characters. These results suggested that gene loss might also have contributed to phenotypic evolution.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3244], "author_name_tesi": "Nam, Jongmin ", "last_name_ssi": "Nam", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jongmin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Masatoshi Nei", "Hong Ma", "Claude W De Pamphilis", "David Michael Geiser"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Masatoshi Nei, Committee Chair", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Claude W De Pamphilis, Committee Member", "David Michael Geiser, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MADS-box gene", "Homeobox gene", "Molecular evolution", "comparative genomics", "functional differentiation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Prescription Drug Policies and Health Care: Studies on Medicare Part D Program, State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs, and Off-label Prescribing Practices", "id": "22830", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10357", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigated three prescription drug policy areas, aiming to fill in the gap in the research toward reforming health care in a positive direction: (1) Medicare Part D program, (2) state prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), and (3) off-label prescribing practices.  \nThe Medicare Part D program study examined Part D\u2019s effects on health outcomes and Medicare spending for Parts A and B among Part D beneficiaries who previously lacked prescription drug coverage, using Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) Cost and Use files for 2004-2007, which are combined with Medicare claims and other administrative data, and a difference-in-differences model, estimating Part D\u2019s treatment effects between 2005 and 2007.  The results showed that Part D benefits did not have statistically significant effects on health outcomes and Medicare Parts A and B spending among the study population.

The main data used are (1) de-identified individual-level mortality data obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and (2) bridged-race population estimates data produced by the U.S. Census Bureau in collaboration with NCHS.  The PDMP effects on drug overdose mortality rates were estimated using three different fixed effects models.

To achieve precise fluid and particle handling capabilities required for such applications, microacoustofluidics (i.e. the merger of acoustics and microfluidics) has shown great potential. \nThe primary motivation of this dissertation is to revisit the formulation of the governing equations for microacoustofluidics in an fluid-structure interaction (FSI) context to develop a numerical formulation that is transparent with regards to the reference frames as well as the time-scale separation. In this context, we present a generalized Lagrangian formulation by posing our governing equations over a convenient mean configuration that does not coincide with the current configurations. The formulation stems from an explicit separation of time-scales resulting in two subproblems: a first-order problem, formulated in terms of the fluid displacement at the fast scale, and a second-order problem formulated in terms of the Lagrangian flow velocity at the slow time scale. Following a rigorous time-averaging procedure, the second-order problem is shown to be intrinsically steady, and with exact boundary conditions at the oscillating walls. Also, as the second-order problem is solved directly for the Lagrangian velocity, the formulation does not need to employ the notion of Stokes drift, or any associated post-processing, thus facilitating a direct comparison with experiments. Because the first-order problem is formulated in terms of the displacement field, our formulation is directly applicable to more complex fluid-structure interaction problems in microacoustofluidics.\nWe also present a comparison of the generalized Lagrangian formulation with the typically employed Eulerian formulation and highlight the superior numerical performance of our formulation to aid easier comparison with the experimental observations.\nNext, we describe the fluid and particle motion in acoustically-actuated, confined, leaky systems. The investigated model system is a microchip typically used for biomedical analyses; a liquid-filled polydimethylsiloxane microchannel driven acoustically by inter-digital transducers. Through a combination of quantitative experimental measurements and numerical results, we reveal the full three dimensional motion of the fluids and suspended particles. By varying the size of suspended particles, we capture the two limits for which the particle motion is dominated by the acoustic streaming drag to which it is dominated by the acoustic radiation force. The observed fluid and particle motion is captured numerically without any fitting parameter by a reduced-fluid model based on a thermoviscous, Lagrangian velocity-based formulation. Through a combination of experimental observations and precise numerical boundary conditions, we remove the existing ambiguity in the literature concerning the acoustic streaming direction as well as the critical particle size for which the particle motion switches between the aforementioned two limits. Further, combining experimental and numerical results, we indirectly determine the first-order acoustic field of the vertically-propagating pseudo-standing wave as well as give an estimate of the actual displacement on the piezoelectric substrate. Through a combination of a simplified analytical model and our numerical results, we demonstrate that these \u201cpseudo-standing\u201d waves owe their origin to the small yet significant reflections from the fluid and channel wall interface and are the primary reason for the vertical focusing of particles. We present numerical results for the vertical focusing of both positive as well as negative contrast neutrally-buoyant particles and provide the design criteria for the microchannels to achieve desired vertical focusing locations. We also demonstrate the ability to tune the focusing locations of particles in both horizontal as well as vertical direction by tuning the phase difference between the incoming surface acoustic waves (SAWs) and the applied acoustic power.\nFurther, we outline the extension of the presented generalized Lagrangian formulation for FSI problems in microacoustofluidics. To this end, we present \u201cproof-of- concept\u201d results concerning the tracking of a fluid sub-domain inside a microacoustofluidic device.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15235], "author_name_tesi": "Nama, Nitesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Nama", "first_name_ssi": "Nitesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Francesco Costanzo", "Tony Jun Huang", "Jonathan Pitt", "Francesco Costanzo", "Peter Butler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Francesco Costanzo, Dissertation Advisor", "Tony Jun Huang, Committee Chair", "Jonathan Pitt, Committee Member", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Member", "Peter Butler, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microfluidics", "Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian Method", "Acoustofluidics", "Surface Acoustic Wave", "Finite Element Method", "Immersed Finite Element Method", "Fluid-Structure Interaction", "Acoustic Streaming", "Acoustic radiation Force"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Nature-inspired optimization of quasicrystalline\narrays and all-dielectric optical filters and\nmetamaterials", "id": "16100", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8139", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Quasicrystalline solids were first observed in nature in 1980s. Their lattice geometry is devoid of translational symmetry; however it possesses long-range order as well as certain orders of rotational symmetry forbidden by translational symmetry. Mathematically, such lattices are related to aperiodic tilings. Since their discovery there has been great interest in utilizing aperiodic geometries for a wide variety of electromagnetic (EM) and optical applications. The first thrust of this dissertation addresses applications of quasicrystalline geometries for wideband antenna arrays and plasmonic nano-spherical arrays. The first application considered is the design of suitable antenna arrays for micro-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) swarms based on perturbation of certain types of aperiodic tilings. Due to safety reasons and to avoid possible collision between micro-UAVs it is desirable to keep the minimum separation distance between the elements several wavelengths. As a result typical periodic planar arrays are not suitable, since for periodic arrays increasing the minimum element spacing beyond one wavelength will lead to the appearance of grating lobes in the radiation pattern. It will be shown that using this method antenna arrays with very wide bandwidths and low sidelobe levels can be designed. It will also be shown that in conjunction with a phase compensation method these arrays show a large degree of versatility to positional noise. Next aperiodic aggregates of gold nano-spheres are studied. Since traditional unit cell approaches cannot be used for aperiodic geometries, we start be developing new analytical tools for aperiodic arrays. A modified version of generalized Mie theory (GMT) is developed which defines scattering coefficients for aperiodic spherical arrays. Next two specific properties of quasicrystalline gold nano-spherical arrays are considered. The optical response of these arrays can be explained in terms of the grating response of the array (photonic resonance) and the plasmonic response of the spheres (plasmonic resonance). In particular the couplings between the photonic and plasmonic modes are studied. In periodic arrays this coupling leads to the formation of a so called photonic-plasmonic hybrid mode. The formation of hybrid modes is studied in quasicrystalline arrays. Quasicrystalline structures in essence possess several periodicities which in some cases can lead to the formation of multiple hybrid modes with wider bandwidths. It is also demonstrated that the performance of these arrays can be further enhanced by employing a perturbation method. The second property considered is local field enhancements in quasicrystalline arrays of gold nanospheres. It will be shown that despite a considerably smaller filling factor quasicrystalline arrays generate larger local field enhancements which can be even further enhanced by optimally placing perturbing spheres within the prototiles that comprise the aperiodic arrays.\nThe second thrust of research in this dissertation focuses on designing all-dielectric filters and metamaterial coatings for the optical range. In higher frequencies metals tend to have a high loss and thus they are not suitable for many applications. Hence dielectrics are used for applications in optical frequencies. In particular we focus on designing two types of structures. First a near-perfect optical mirror is designed. The design is based on optimizing a subwavelength periodic dielectric grating to obtain appropriate effective parameters that will satisfy the desired perfect mirror condition. Second, a broadband anti-reflective all-dielectric grating with wide field of view is designed. The second design is based on a new computationally efficient genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method which shapes the sidewalls of the grating based on optimizing the roots of polynomial functions.

Here, we have studied the atomic-scale reaction pathway of a surface-catalyzed reaction and utilized single-molecule spectroscopy to identify adsorbates.

FSW is characterized by complex physical processes like non-Newtonian viscoplastic flow, frictional and deformational heat generation and stick--slip flow boundary condition at the tool workpiece interface. To add to the complexity, large convective heat transport aided by viscoplastic material flow makes the process three dimensional in nature. A review of literature reveals the following gaps in numerical modeling of FSW: (a) no three dimensional model exists which considers spatially variable heat generation, variable slip condition at the tool workpiece interface and viscoplastic flow, (b) robustness of existing models has not been tested by modeling FSW of different alloys, (c) the transport of alloying elements across weld interface in dissimilar welds has not been studied numerically and  (d) the existing models do not have mechanism for improving reliability and they cannot work backwards, i.e. provide a set of welding process variables that will result in the desired weld characteristics. The goal of this thesis is to address these important issues.\t\n\nWith a focus to develop a quantitative understanding of the FSW process, a comprehensive three dimensional heat transfer and plastic flow model is developed. The model can predict variables such as temperature and velocity fields and torque based on the given welding parameters like weld velocity, tool rotational speed and axial pressure. It considers tool design dependent spatially variable heat generation rates, deformational work, non-Newtonian viscosity as a function of local strain rate, temperature and the nature of the material and temperature dependent thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity and yield stress. It is shown that the temperature fields, cooling rates, the plastic flow fields and the geometry of the thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) can be adequately described by solving the equations of conservation of mass, momentum and energy in three dimensions with appropriate boundary conditions and constitutive equations for viscosity. The model is tested for four different alloys: 1) AA 6061-T6, 2) 1018 Mn steel, 3) 304L stainless steel and 4) Ti--6Al--4V which have widely different thermophysical and rheological properties. Numerically computed temperature fields, variations of peak temperatures with FSW variables and TMAZ geometry were compared with the experimental results.\n\nCurrently, due to unknown parameters in existing transport phenomena based models, the computed temperature and velocity fields and torque may not always agree with the corresponding experimentally determined values and may not show the same trend as experimental results for a range of welding variables. Here, it is shown that this problem can be solved by combining the rigorous phenomenological process sub-model with a multivariable optimization scheme called Differential Evolution. The values of the uncertain model input parameters from a limited volume of independent experimental data which includes temperature measurements obtained using thermocouples and torque measured using dynamometers.  This approach resulted in agreement between the phenomenological model and the experimental results with a greater degree of certainty. It is tested for FSW of: 1) dissimilar AA 6061-T6 to AA 1200, 2) 1018 Mn steel and 3) Ti--6Al--4V. Independent thermocouple and dynamometer measurements are also used for validation and verification of results. Improvement in the reliability of the numerical model is an important first step towards increasing its practical usefulness. \n\nAlso, one of the reasons why current models do not find extensive applications is because they cannot be used to tailor weld attributes. The aim of the present research is to develop a reliable bi--directional model which can find wide use in manufacturing and process control. It is shown that by coupling a reliable model with an evolutionary search algorithm, we can find multiple sets of welding parameters to achieve a target peak temperature and cooling rate in welds. The model is tested for dissimilar welds of AA 6351 and AA 1200.  \n\nFSW is being increasingly used for dissimilar metal joining. Models are needed to calculate the redistribution of alloying elements when two alloys with dissimilar alloying element contents are joined. The transport and mixing of magnesium from Mg--rich AA 6061 alloy into a commercially pure aluminum AA 1200 was examined experimentally and numerically at various locations in the welded workpiece. The concentration of the solute is measured in transverse cross-sections across the weld-center line at various depths from the top surface of the workpiece. The measurement was done using electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) of polished transverse-cut friction-stir welded samples. The comparison of the experimental and computed concentration profiles of magnesium shows imperfect mixing of the plasticized alloys during FSW. The plasticized material seem to move in layers without significant diffusive interlayer mixing.\n \nA comprehensive model for FSW is developed with capability of calculating temperature fields, material flow patterns and concentration fields in both similar and dissimilar welds in three dimensions. The model is tested for the FSW of alloys with widely different thermophysical properties. A mechanism for improving reliability and ability to provide guidance to tailor weld attributes is incorporated into the model to increase its practical usefulness. This is done by by combining the transport phenomena based model with Differential Evolution algorithm to minimize the objective function based on limited volume of experimental thermal cycles and torque measurements.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5445], "author_name_tesi": "Nandan, Rituraj ", "last_name_ssi": "Nandan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rituraj", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tarasankar Debroy", "Long Qing Chen", "Christopher L Muhlstein", "Panagiotis Michaleris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tarasankar Debroy, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Christopher L Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Panagiotis Michaleris, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["torque", "reliability", "differential algorithm", "viscoplastic flow", "friction coeffiecient", "finite volume method", "parametric study", "friction stir welding", "aluminum alloys", "heat generation", "heat transfer", "variable slip"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Modeling the impact of H63D HFE polymorphism on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)", "id": "18728", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8924", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The etiology underlying or the genetic basis for the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS (sALS), which accounts for the majority of all cases, remains unclear. There is increasing evidence for an association between H63D HFE and ALS, with meta-analysis suggesting the presence of H63D HFE increases the risk of ALS 4-fold. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to evaluate the effect of H63D HFE on ALS pathogenesis. We generated two animal models to address our main objective. \nFirst, by generating a mouse model carrying H67D HFE (homologous to human H63D), we demonstrated that H67D HFE alters brain iron homeostasis and creates an environment for increased oxidative stress. The current paradigm relating to HFE gene variants holds that the blood-brain-barrier protects the brain from loss of iron homeostasis resulting from HFE mutations. Our findings provide direct in vivo evidence to challenge this paradigm and establish new models for neuroscience research. Second, by generating a double mutant mouse line (SOD1/H67D) carrying both H67D HFE and SOD1(G93A) mutation, I provided evidence that H63D HFE is a disease modifier for ALS. The presence of H67D HFE shortens survival and accelerates disease progression in the SOD1 transgenic mouse model of ALS (G93A). We identified mechanisms underlying this phenotype and demonstrated that elevated oxidative stress and increased gliosis associated with altered iron homeostasis contributes to accelerated disease in double mutant (SOD1/H67D) mice. \nTogether, our studies suggest that H63D HFE is a genetic modifier for ALS independent of environmental factors and causes functional consequences in the brain and the spinal cord. These animal models can be used as a preclinical model to study how gene-environment interactions impact disease mechanisms and will aid in developing treatment strategies incorporating patient stratification by HFE genotype when assessing therapeutic interventions. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8765], "author_name_tesi": "Nandar, Wint ", "last_name_ssi": "Nandar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wint", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "James Robert Connor", "Zachary Simmons", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Patricia Grigson", "Sang Yong Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Dissertation Advisor", "James Robert Connor, Committee Chair", "Zachary Simmons, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Patricia Grigson, Committee Member", "Sang Yong Lee, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["H63D HFE", "ALS", "Iron", "Oxidative stress", "Gliosis", "SOD1(G93A)"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF BLADE BOUNDARY LAYER TRANSITION AND DAYTIME ATMOSPHERIC TURBULENCE ON WIND TURBINE PERFORMANCE ANALYZED WITH BLADE-RESOLVED SIMULATION AND FIELD DATA", "id": "13525tnn113", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13525", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Relevant to utility scale wind turbine functioning and reliability, the present work focuses on enhancing our understanding of wind turbine responses from interactions between energy-dominant daytime atmospheric turbulence eddies and rotating blades of a GE 1.5 MW wind turbine using a unique data set from a GE field experiment and computer simulations at two levels of fidelity.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the stability state of the lower troposphere has a major impact on the coherent structure of the turbulence eddies, with corresponding differences in wind turbine loading response. In this study, time-resolved aerodynamic data measured locally at the leading edge and trailing edge of three outer blade sections on a GE 1.5 MW wind turbine blade and high-frequency SCADA generator power data from a daytime field campaign are combined with computer simulations that mimic the GE wind turbine within a numerically generated atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)  flow field which is a close approximation of the atmospheric turbulence experienced by the wind turbine in the field campaign. By combining the experimental and numerical data sets, this study describes the time-response characteristics of the local loadings on the blade sections in response to nonsteady nonuniform energetic atmospheric turbulence eddies within a daytime ABL which have spatial scale commensurate with that of the turbine blade length. This study is the first of its kind where actuator line and blade boundary layer resolved CFD studies of a wind turbine  field campaign are performed with the motivation to validate the numerical predictions with the experimental data set, and emphasis is given on understanding the influence of the laminar to turbulent transition process on the blade loadings.\n\nThe experimental and actuator line method data sets identify three important response time scales quantified at the blade location: advective passage of energy dominant eddies (~ 25 - 50 s), blade rotation (1P, ~3 s) and sub-1P scale (< 1 s) response to internal eddy structure. Large amplitude short-time ramp-like and oscillatory load fluctuations result in response to temporal changes in velocity vector inclination in the airfoil plane, modulated by eddy passage at longer time scales. Generator power is found to respond strongly to large-eddy wind modulations. The experimental data show that internal dynamics of blade boundary layer near the trailing edge is temporally modulated by the nonsteady external ABL flow that was measured at the leading edge, as well as blade generated turbulence motions.\n \nA blade boundary layer resolved CFD study of a GE 1.5MWwind turbine blade is carried out using a hybrid URANS/LES framework to quantify the influence of transition on the blade boundary layer dynamics and subsequent loadings, and also to predict the velocity magnitude data set measured by the trailing edge rakes in the experiment. A URANS based transition model is used as the near-wall model, and its ability to predict nonsteady boundary layer dynamics is assessed for flow over an oscillating airfoil exhibiting varying extents of nonsteady behavior. The CFD study shows that, at rated conditions, the transition and separation locations on the blade surface can be quite dynamic, but the transitional flow has negligible influence on the determination of the separation location and the overall pressure distribution at various blade sections, and subsequently the power output. But this conclusion should be accepted with caution for wind turbines running in off-design conditions (e.g. with significant yaw error, off-design pitch or rapid changes in pitch), where massive separation and dynamic stall may occur. Analysis of the near-blade flow field shows strong three dimensional flow in the inboard regions, which can possibly weaken the chordwise flow in the relatively outboard regions and make them more prone to separation. The trailing edge velocity profiles show qualitative resemblance with some specific cycles observed in the  field experiment. The factors leading to the observed differences from the experimental data are also mentioned\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13817], "author_name_tesi": "Nandi, Tarak Nath", "last_name_ssi": "Nandi", "middle_name_ssi": "Nath", "first_name_ssi": "Tarak", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Brasseur", "James Brasseur", "Sven Schmitz", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Eric G.

Water produced from PEFC operation can freeze at subzero temperatures, hindering reactant transport and covering reaction sites, thereby making the start-up extremely difficult or even impossible. Gas purge is most commonly used to enhance the cold start capability by removing residual water from a PEFC prior to engine shutdown. A closely related PEFC performance issue lies in the complex dynamic response of a PEFC near freezing point, immediately after a successful start-up (post-cold start). The presence of all three phases of water during ice melting calls for a three-phase transient model to understand the governing physics of PEFC post-cold start for effective prediction, control and optimization of cell performance, which is not yet explored. This work addresses these PEFC performance issues closely interconnected to the problem of cold start, namely gas purge and three-phase transients (including both cold start and post-cold start).\nGas purge process is investigated in detail using a previously developed two-phase, transient purge model based on the multiphase-mixture  formulation. The effect of vapor diffusivity on purge effectiveness is assessed through the use of Helium purge as opposed to Nitrogen purge. The effects of purge temperature, porosity, tortuosity, wettability of the porous media and initial liquid saturation on purge effectiveness are delineated. Purge characteristics along the flow direction is investigated and a significantly slower water removal is observed towards the outlet section. Both 2D and 3D model predictions are compared against experiments and better agreement is observed at higher purge temperatures.\nA one dimensional, three-phase, transient PEFC model is developed which is capable of capturing complex dynamic cell behavior starting from a subzero temperature towards normal operation. Ice formation at subzero temperature (cold start), ice melting at freezing point, and liquid water transport process are captured through a coupled heat and water transport model, and the cell performance near freezing point is analyzed. Using cold start part of this model, the effect of catalyst layer (CL) pore volume (or CL thickness) on both isothermal and nonisothermal cold start performance of a PEFC is studied. The cold start operational time or product water is shown to approach a minimum nonzero asymptotic value as the CL is gradually made infinitesimally thin. It is shown that the self start-up can be achieved even with an ultra thin (~1 \u00b5m) CL, given certain adjustments to cell design and material properties such as cell thermal mass and membrane water diffusivity, and a design map for self-start-up of such a PEFC from various subfreezing temperatures is presented.\nThe effect of dynamic loading and the resulting electrode flooding and consequent performance loss in terms of voltage drop during post-cold start is studied. The model is calibrated and validated against experimental data and a reasonable agreement in terms of voltage dropdown and subsequent recovery time is observed. The effect of different operating parameters on post-cold start cell dynamics is elucidated. Finally, a simplistic algebraic model for water transport during post-cold start is hypothesized and presented, which shows a better predictive capability.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7837], "author_name_tesi": "Nandy, Ashis ", "last_name_ssi": "Nandy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ashis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Chao Yang Wang", "Seungjin Kim", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Seungjin Kim, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PEM Fuel Cell", "Three-phase transients", "Cold start", "Gas purge", "Catalyst layer"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Molecular Dynamics Simulations of MATRIX ASSISTED LASER DESORPTION (MALD)", "id": "12682", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7020", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis analyzes the desolvation process of analyte molecules from the matrix clusters in Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption (MALD).  The key idea of this research is that analyte molecule ejection may depend on the microscopic details of analyte interaction with itself and with the matrix. Intermolecular matrix\u2013analyte interactions have been studied by focusing on 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB; matrix) and amino acids (AA; analyte) using Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics (CHARMM) force field. A series of AA molecules have been studied to analyze the DHB\u2013AA interaction. A relative scale of AA molecule affinity towards DHB has been developed with the interaction of Glutamic acid 1.5 times more attractive to DHB than DHB itself and Alanine (Ala) three times less attractive to DHB. We incorporate the acquired knowledge of essential chemical interactions from the CHARMM investigation in the simulations. Simulations have been performed using a coarse grained hybrid model called breathing sphere and bead-spring model focusing on intermolecular matrix-analyte bead and analyte bead-analyte bead interactions. The breathing sphere model approximates DHB as the matrix and the AA molecule is modeled as the analyte using the bead-spring model. Independently, the effect of having the matrix-analyte bead or analyte bead-analyte bead interaction three times less attractive than the matrix-matrix bead interaction has been tested. It has been found that analyte bead-analyte bead interactions have no contribution towards analyte desolvation. On the other hand, intermolecular matrix-analyte bead interactions play a central role. A weaker matrix-analyte bead interaction produces desolvated analyte molecules as compared to the stronger matrix-analyte interaction which produces analyte molecules clustered with matrix molecules. Mechanistically, stronger matrix-analyte bead interaction potential results in high density of matrix molecules locally present around the analyte molecule which assists in early agglomeration of the analyte molecule along with matrix molecule entrapment. Weaker matrix-analyte interaction potential produces a low density of matrix molecules around the analyte molecule. There is no clustering of matrix molecules around the analyte molecule and hence no assistance is provided by the matrix molecules. The analyte molecule collapses on itself taking longer to agglomerate resulting in a desolvated analyte molecule.

Previous studies have explored some of the questions related to catalytic properties of enzymes in single- and multi-step reactions occurring in nature, pointing out the effects of diffusion, enzyme fluctuations, cell size, colocalization of enzymes on the reaction rates. Except in special cases, the rate of a reaction is not well expressed by an Arrhenius rate expression, and the effective activation energy varies with temperature, as the rate limiting step shifts from reaction to diffusion. The effects of temperature depend on nature of the reaction, organization of the cell, cell topology, enzyme activity, rate constants, as well as diffusion coefficients and related variables. Therefore, it is challenging to determine the effective activation energy of a reaction because it may be loosely related to a potential energy barrier height. \nWe report MC simulations of temperature effects on single- and multi-step enzymatic reactions with varied rate constants and diffusion coefficients for reaction- and diffusion-limited reactions. For typical systems, in which the intrinsic reaction rate is more sensitive to temperature than diffusion, the overall reaction is rate-limited at low temperatures and diffusion-limited at high temperatures. The effective activation energy shifts to a much lower value as temperature is increased. Our results show, temperature dependence of enzyme-catalyzed reactions within a cell may be only loosely related to a potential energy barrier height. The effective activation energy may be strongly affected by coupling of reaction and diffusion. In the case of a single step enzymatic reaction with fixed diffusion coefficients and varied rate constants, the MC simulations show that as the temperature increases, the effective activation energy decreases. Furthermore, increasing the cell reaction volume by three orders of magnitude causes the effective activation energy to decrease approximately by a factor of four. Conversely, a different behavior is observed for reactions with fixed rate constants and varied diffusion coefficients. Irrespective of the reaction cell volume, as the temperature increases, the reaction rate remains unchanged and the reaction approaches the diffusion limit. However, the effective activation energy increases by approximately a factor of six when the cell reaction volume decreases by three orders of magnitude. The complexities increase for multi-step enzymatic reactions requiring colocalization of an enzyme pair in the same spatial vicinity and simultaneous or successive enzyme fluctuation activity for a successful reaction. Our MC simulations for multi-step enzymatic reactions highlight the subtle role of temperature for reactions with fixed rate constants and varied diffusion coefficients, where above a threshold temperature, the reaction is dominated by the intrinsic reaction rate and remains unaltered irrespective of the enzyme pair separation undergoing fluctuations with same frequency. Hence, these studies highlight the important effect of temperature in single- and multi-step enzymatic reactions and its role in determining the relationship between intrinsic and effective activation energy as the reaction shifts from reaction-limited to diffusion-limited behavior. Further, the cellular topological spatial variations are found to drastically affect the system behavior depicting \u201cfractal-like kinetics\u201d. Irrespective of the same fractional volume occupied by the cellular obstructions, the geometric pattern affects the reaction rates. Effective diffusivities are highly dependent on the diffusivities of the species in the various media, cellular topologies and temperature. The fractal effects are found to be largest for temperature driven diffusion-limited reactions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8279], "author_name_tesi": "Nangia, Shivangi ", "last_name_ssi": "Nangia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shivangi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Bernhard Anderson", "Mark Maroncelli", "Lasse Jensen", "Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Bernhard Anderson, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Monte Carlo", "enzyme catalyzed reactions", "activation energy", "temperature", "diffusion", "colocalization"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Environmental Degradation, Resource Scarcity and Children\u2019s Welfare in Malawi: School Attendance, School Progress, and Children\u2019s Health\n", "id": "6219", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1962", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-10-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The thesis investigates the effects of natural resource scarcity on child quality, showing that long hours of work spent in fuel wood and water collection activities influence children\u2019s education and health in Malawi. Malawi people are primarily rural and subsistent. More than 90% use firewood as their main source of cooking energy.  However, Malawi experiences deforestation and water scarcity problems. These have significant consequences for the quality of people\u2019s lives, particularly women and children who are primarily responsible for collection of natural resources. To investigate the effects on children\u2019s schooling and health, data from 1997-98 Malawi Integrated Household Survey conducted by the Malawi National Statistics Office in conjunction with the International Food Policy Research Institute are used. Supplementing these are Malawi GIS fuel wood availability, forest cover and biomass assessment data and qualitative data obtained through focus group interviews with Malawian women. Bivariate probit models of school attendance or school progress with participation in natural resource-collection work are estimated to test and correct for potential endogeneity of these decisions. Potential endogeneity of resource-collection work hours is also corrected for, using two-stage conditional maximum likelihood (2SCML) estimation. A multinomial logit model of alternative work-schooling choices is also estimated. The research finds that children\u2019s school attendance and school progress are negatively affected through increased work that results from scarcity of natural resources. Girls are disproportionately disadvantaged. Therefore, the traditional division of labor contributes to gender differentials in Malawi\u2019s education. However, increased number of women in a child\u2019s household partially mitigates the negative impact of natural resource-collection work. The results also suggest that inequalities in fuel wood availability across regions of Malawi may be causing regional disparities in education.  These results establish an environment-education nexus in the population-environment-poverty interactions debate. The research also shows that young children\u2019s health is negatively affected by natural resource scarcity, establishing a negative environmental degradation-child quality relationship. This is crucial for informing sustainable development policy efforts. The research also contributes to understanding the effects of domestic child labor on schooling.

Research has shown that thrombosis in the Penn State pulsatile LVAD, on a polyurethane blood sac, is largely a function of the underlying fluid mechanics and may be correlated to wall shear rates below 500 s-1.  Given the variability in animal trial heart rates and systolic durations, it is useful to understand the fluid mechanics of pulsatile LVADs under these circumstances.  Studies were performed on the Penn State pulsatile 50 cc LVAD to characterize shear rates in thrombolytic regions.  Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to capture planar flow in the pump body for beat rates of 75-150 bpm and systolic durations of 38-50%.

The first part relates to classification, more specifically, to classifier ensembles (multiple classifier systems) for binary classification (two-class) problems. In the second part of this work, we explore some of the issues in cluster validation as relates to genomic data.\n\nClassifier ensembles have proved to be promising and useful in various applications. The basic idea is to build a team of classifiers and combine their outputs in order to obtain a more 'robust' classification, as opposed to relying on the output of a single classifier. The outputs of the classifiers could be combined in a number of ways. Majority voting is a simple yet useful combination scheme.\n\nOur contribution in the area of multiple classifier systems includes the formulation of the problem of computing the upper and lower bounds of majority voting accuracy for an ensemble of binary classifiers as a linear program (LP). The resulting analytical framework can be used for performing a variety of analyses related to voting. Diversity and complementarity are considered as desirable properties in an ensemble of classifiers, however there is no widely accepted characterization of these concepts, thus making an objective evaluation difficult. Many of the measures defined in the literature are formulated in terms of  correct/incorrect classifications, these are referred to as error-diversity measures. We show that the analytical framework mentioned above can be used effectively to evaluate error-diversity measures and explore whether there is a useful relationship between the selected diversity measures and the ensemble accuracy.\n\nNext, we explore some of the issues in cluster validation in the context of microarray data. Clustering is often an important first step in the analysis of genomic data, cluster validation is an important step in cluster analysis. We assess the suitability of standard cluster validation techniques for microarray data.\nOften an important goal in clustering genomic data is to group genes based on underlying biologically relevant criteria such as functions. It is often of interest to compare a clustering result with an external clustering, for instance comparing  the grouping of genes obtained by applying  a clustering algorithm on microarray data against a reference grouping i.e. a ``gold standard'. We propose a  measure for the distance between two membership matrices and suggest when this could be a suitable choice for the above purpose. We use standard network flow algorithms for finding the measure.

With developing countries struggling with power deficiency, energy storage coupled with renewable sources of energy can act as a short to medium term solution by providing power and kick-starting economic growth from stagnation. It can bring down dependence on thermal and nuclear power in the long run, which are both expensive to develop and run. Battery Energy Storage is also being developed using different materials and technologies serving different purposes. This thesis reviews several different types of batteries along with its advantages and disadvantages. Further, this thesis focuses on the electrochemistry of Redox Flow Batteries, most recent developments, its applications and a case study. The long lifetime of a redox flow battery adds tremendous value in maintaining and \nbuilding energy capacity for a micro grid or for an expanding community. There are several drivers for energy storage adoption in developing countries. A synopsis of drivers behind flow battery adoption along with the power deficit specific to India is examined. New energy technologies have \nhigh costs of development, which are passed on to the consumers. However, unaffordable technologies are not a solution until they become affordable. A breakdown of costs in manufacturing flow batteries are investigated. An evaluation of manufacturing flow batteries both \nin India and the U.S has been prepared. Further, opportunities for cost reduction are identified. A detailed economic analysis of the cost of adoption and operational costs has been explored while examining the feasibility and adoption of technology for a tourist hotel in the desert region of Udaipur, Rajasthan in India. The results indicate that manufacturing flow batteries in India not only has a higher initial cost than Lead Acid batteries but also has similar pay back periods.

One defining feature of any federalist process is the pattern of inter-governmental fiscal flows. My research is an attempt to uncover the logic behind the pattern of fiscal flows in the Russian Federation. The general consensus seems to be that there is no discernible pattern to these flows and at best they are determined purely by politically troublesome behavior by the regional players. Contrary to these viewpoints, I find that initial conditions are important in determining the redistributive pattern and there is a sound economic and political logic to this pattern.\nThe study highlights the importance of the diversity in industrial structures across Russian regions in this highly industrialized and interdependent economy. The sudden change in the exchange environment from a planned economy to a market-based economy coupled with the decentralization process shifted the focus to the inherited industrial structure of the region. Regions were variously equipped to survive in a market based economy without any centralized coordination. The federal government seeks to maximize support across regions by appropriately selecting the optimal redistributive shares. The rules of redistribution are framed under a \"veil of ignorance\" in the Rawlsian sense. This objective function of the federal government yields a redistribution pattern whereby regions which are ill-equipped to survive in a market economy are subsidized by taxing the regions with market friendly industrial endowments. The support maximization function also generates larger transfers to regions with greater political differences in terms of ethnic composition of the population. The evidence thus suggests an economic and political integration motive. Initial differences in ethnic composition are important in explaining the pattern of redistribution.\nThese results are based purely on initial differences in industrial structure, geographic location of region and composition of the population. To facilitate comparison with other work, political behavioral variables were incorporated into the transfers function. The results suggest that rewarding politically troublesome behavior may have been a small part of the overall logic of redistribution to maximize support across regions. By showing that these rewards do not constitute the dominant logic of redistribution, this study resolves the free-rider puzzle posed by earlier studies. Further, I identify the fundamental economic factors underlying the regional propensity to subsidize. The existing literature squarely blames the federal government for making bad transfers thus encouraging regions to spend on subsidies. In contrast I suggest that the expenditures on subsidies at the regional level is a response to the inherited industrial non-competitiveness. Finally I outline the implications of this study for the Chechnya dispute, for comparative studies of China and Russia, incentives for industrial restructuring and for the literature on fiscal federalism.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5095], "author_name_tesi": "Narayan, Ramaswami Badri", "last_name_ssi": "Narayan", "middle_name_ssi": "Badri", "first_name_ssi": "Ramaswami", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barry William Ickes", "Spiro E Stefanou", "Eric Bond", "N Edward Coulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barry William Ickes, Committee Chair", "Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Member", "Eric Bond, Committee Member", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Initial Conditions in Transition Economies", "Interregional Redistribution", "Fiscal Federalism", "Soviet Industrial Structure and transition"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Targeting Hiv Tat-mediated Transcription By Complementary Therapeutic Modalities", "id": "17550", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8376", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) still claim over 2 million lives annually, despite the emergence of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) over 15 years ago. The main cause for this has been the advent of viruses resistant to the HAART therapy. Besides this, there is very irregular adherence to the recommended therapy for HIV/AIDS because of the highly unpleasant side-effects prevalent due to the drugs used in conventional therapy. Due to these reasons, there is a need to establish additional forms of therapy against this disease.\nThere is a considerable amount of epidemiological data suggesting a direct relation between selenium status and the severity of HIV infections. The mechanism underlying this effect has not been studied in detail, although it has been suggested that selenium supplementation alleviates oxidative stress by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway. Selenium exerts its antioxidant effects via incorporation into selenoproteins as selenocysteine. We show here that selenium, via incorporation into the antioxidant selenoenzyme, thioredoxin reductase-1 (TR1), inhibits HIV replication in macrophages by modulating the activity of a crucial HIV transcription factor, Transactivator of transcription (Tat). Our data suggests that TR1 reduces the disulfides in Tat which are important for its activity.\nAnother mechanism by which selenium may inhibit HIV replication, besides incorporation into macrophages, is to cause the inhibition of the lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) activity of the enzyme, p300 (KAT3B). We present data in this thesis suggesting that selenium, via the upregulation of endogenous levels of the cyclopentenone prostaglandin (CyPG) \u039412-PGJ2, inhibits the activity of p300 by covalently modifying a key cysteine residue in the enzyme active site. Furthermore, another CyPG, 15d-PGJ2, which is formed endogenously as a result of selenium supplementation, covalently binds to and inhibits the transactivation activity of Tat. Exogenous addition of 15d-PGJ2 and other Michael acceptor electrophiles such as celastrol, inhibits Tat-mediated transcription and HIV replication in cell culture.\nThus, we show here that selenium can inhibit HIV replication by inhibiting the activity of Tat by affecting its modification, and that this inhibition may be enhanced by treatment with compounds of natural origin which covalently modify the Cys-thiols which are highly conserved in the Tat proteins across different HIV strains worldwide.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8292], "author_name_tesi": "Narayan, Vivek ", "last_name_ssi": "Narayan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vivek", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Shantu G Amin", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Andrew Thomas Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Shantu G Amin, Committee Member", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Member", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HIV transcription", "Transactivator of transcription", "Selenium", "Michael acceptor electrophiles", "Thioredoxin reductase"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Origins and Evolution of Weak Low Ionization Quasar Absorption Line Systems", "id": "8206", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "524", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis examines the physical nature of the gaseous structures selected by weak MgII quasar absorption line systems. The classic quasar absorption systems such as damped Lyman-$alpha$ absorbers (DLAs), sub-DLAs and other Lyman Limit systems are widely studied because of their established association with galaxies of a wide range of morphology and luminosity. In contrast, weak MgII absorbers represent a population(s) that does not appear to be directly associated with luminous galaxies. Nonetheless, at z ~ 1, they outnumber the strong MgII absorbers by a factor of 3:1, and also account for a large fraction (> 25%) of the high column density regime of the Lyman-alpha forest. Moreover, a significant fraction of the weak MgII gas clouds have metallicities that are 0.5 - 2 dex higher than the average metallicity of DLA absorbers. In spite of such unique properties, the astrophysical structures and processes associated with weak MgII systems remain unidentified. \n\nIn this thesis, I present results from UV and optical spectroscopic surveys, of ~ 100 quasars, offering a full census of weak MgII absorbers over the last 10 Gyr cosmological history of the universe, corresponding to 0 < z < 2.4. At z < 1, the redshift number density (dN/dz) estimation for weak MgII absorbers conforms with an apparent lack of evolution for a static population, in a LCDM universe. However, in the context of an evolving extragalactic ionization background radiation, which diminishes in intensity by a factor of ~ 8 from z = 1 to z = 0, the estimated dN/dz, at z = 0, for a static population of absorbers is a factor of ~ 2 larger than the observed dN/dz. This suggests that the gaseous structures that produce weak MgII absorbers are evolving from z = 1 to z =0, and are regenerated at a rate that is consistent with the observed dN/dz. Towards,high-z (z > 1), the dN/dz evolves with the number density reaching a peak at z = 1.2, thereafter declining such that there may not be a large separate population of weak absorbers at z > 2. I hypothesize this observed trend is indicative of the weak MgII clouds, at high-z, being kinematically connected to galaxies that produce strong MgII absorption. \n\nPhotoionization models have suggested the weak MgII absorbing structures are unstable over astronomical timescales, because of pressure imbalance between a high density, low ionization gas phase traced by CIV lines, and a low density high ionization phase traced by MgII. The constraints on the temperature were derived from high resolution data at R = 45,000 or lower, which allowed for T ~ 10,000 K. The inference on pressure imbalance, which influences the stability of the absorber, would change if the true Doppler parameter of the low ionization lines are smaller than those derived at R = 45,000. This possibility is explored using superhigh spectral resolution (R = 120,000, FWHM = 2.5 km/s). Subaru/HDS observation of the quasar PG 1634+706, in which I demonstrate that the low ionization lines in weak absorbers are already sufficiently resolved at $R = 45,000$. The weak MgII absorbers indeed possess a phase structure that creates pressure imbalance which makes them physically transient over astronomical time-scales. \n\nI also present results from the analysis of the chemical and ionization conditions in a sample of 100 weak MgII absorbers identified in the VLT/UVES archive of quasar spectra. The analysis shows that the metallicity in a majority of the absorber's low ionization gas clouds is constrained to Z > 0.1Z_solar. It also reveals the presence of two populations, with different chemical enrichment profiles, contributing to the weak MgII absorption: (1) weak absorbers that are iron-rich, with N(FeII) ~ N(MgII), which are more common towards low (z ~ 1) redshift, and  (2) weak absorbers that are iron deficient with N(FeII) < N(MgII), detected at both low (z < 1) and high (z ~ 2) redshifts. \n\nThe thesis concludes with discussions on the physical nature of the gaseous structures selected by weak MgII absorbers. The fraction of iron deficient weak absorbers are chemically enriched gas clouds in the circumgalactic environments where the gas is diffuse and optically thin in HI. The absorber might correspond to interstellar gas expelled from star-forming galaxies, into their extended halo, in correlated supernova events. Some fraction of this population is also likely to arise along sight lines that intercept tidally stripped material residing in circumgalactic environments. This scenario will be more common towards high-z (z ~ 2) where the fraction of interacting galaxies, and proto-galaxies with irregular luminosity profiles are observed to be high. In these respects, weak MgII quasar absorption systems are analogous to high velocity cloud (HVC) structures at the interface of galaxies and their surrounding intergalactic medium. Additionally, the sub-population of iron-rich weak MgII absorbers, that are common only at low-z (z < 1) must be tracing Type Ia SN enriched gas in small, high metallicity pockets in dwarf galaxies, tidal debris, or other intergalactic structures. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [521], "author_name_tesi": "Narayanan, Anand ", "last_name_ssi": "Narayanan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anand", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jane Camilla Charlton", "Eric D Feigelson", "Derek Brindley Fox", "Gordon Paul Garmire", "Milton Walter Cole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jane Camilla Charlton, Committee Chair", "Eric D Feigelson, Committee Member", "Derek Brindley Fox, Committee Member", "Gordon Paul Garmire, Committee Member", "Milton Walter Cole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["quasar absorption lines", "galaxies", "intergalactic medium", "spectroscopy", "absorption lines", "circumgalactic gas", "high velocity clouds"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Selective Modulation of the AH Receptor Leads to Repression of Complement Factor Gene Expression", "id": "13944", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7316", "abstract_tesi": "Modulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activity by a class of ligands termed selective AHR modulators (SAhRMs) has been demonstrated to attenuate pro-inflammatory gene expression and signaling, including repression of cytokine-mediated induction of acute phase genes (e.g, Saa1) .  These effects are observed to occur through an AHR-dependent mechanism that does not require canonical signaling through dioxin response elements (DREs). Previously, we have demonstrated that the SAhRM, 3\u00b4,4\u00b4-dimethoxy-\u03b1-napthoflavone (DiMNF) can repress the cytokine-mediated induction of complement factor genes.  Here, we report that activation of the AHR with DiMNF can suppress the cytokine-mediated induction of the membrane complement regulatory protein (mCRP) CD55, which, when expressed on host cells, facilitates the decay of the complement component 3 (C3) convertase, thereby protecting the cell from complement mediated lysis. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the cytokine-mediated expression of the mCRP, CD46, is also repressed by DiMNF.  Tumor cells often exhibit elevated CD55 and CD46 expression on the cell surface in the inflammatory microenvironment of the tumor and it is thought that such enhanced expression represents a means of escaping immune surveillance.  DiMNF can repress the cytokine-mediated induction of CD55 mRNA and protein. Luciferase reporter analysis have identified possible response elements on the CD55 promoter, which may be targets for this repression.  CD97 is the receptor for CD55 and this binding has been shown to play a role in the development of inflammation and leukocyte trafficking, as well as stimulate tumor cell migration and angiogenesis.  We report here that DiMNF is capable of repressing cytokine-mediated induction of CD97 expression in addition to CD46 and CD55.   A C3 deposition assay with [125I]-C3 revealed that repression of cytokine-mediated CD55 expression by DiMNF led to an increase of C3 deposition on the surface of Huh7 cells, which would likely stimulate the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and lead to complement-mediated lysis.

Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) have emerged as one of key architectures for current systems. Hence this thesis proposes and evaluates sofware based techniques to improve the robustness of CMP based systems. The techniques used involve analyzing the applications and then modifying them according to the desired robustness metric. While several hardware based techniques exist to alleviate several robustness concerns, analyzing an application's behvior allows these methods to be called on less frequently or in some cases tunes the usage of the hardware method.\n\nThe three aspects of robustness that are studied in this thesis are: reduction of thermal emergencies, protection against soft errors and the security of data accessed by applications.\nIn order to prevent excessive reliance on a hardware based cooling mechanism the proposed methods in this thesis map and schedule the application threads such that\nthe power density on any processor or router in the architecture is reduced. The detection of soft errors in the memory is improved by carefully\nchanging the temporal order of computations in the different redundant threads in a CMP. Results show that there is an increase in the number of soft errors detected by the proposed approach.\nThe security of data accessed by mutually untrusting parallel threads is studied\nand an algorithm to perform wordload balancing between these threads is presented. The algorithm is successful in improving reducing the standard deviation of the workload assigned to the different threads.

Helicopter rotor blade spars are conventionally designed as monocoque structures.  Blades of the proposed Heavy Lift Helicopter are envisioned to be as heavy as 800 lbs when designed using the monocoque spar design.  A new and innovative design is proposed to replace the conventional spar designs with light weight grid-stiffened composite shell.  Composite stiffened shells have been known to provide excellent strength to weight ratio and damage tolerance with an excellent potential to reduce weight. Conventional stringer--rib stiffened construction is not suitable for rotor blade spars since they are limited in generating high torsion stiffness that is required for aeroelastic stability of the rotor. As a result, off-axis (helical) stiffeners must be provided. This is a new design space where innovative modeling techniques are needed. The structural behavior of grid-stiffened structures under axial, bending, and torsion loads, typically experienced by rotor blades need to be accurately predicted. The overall objective of the present research is to develop and integrate the necessary design analysis tools to conduct a feasibility study in employing grid-stiffened shells for heavy-lift rotor blade spars. \n\nUpon evaluating the limitations in state-of-the-art analytical models in predicting the axial, bending, and torsion stiffness coefficients of grid and grid-stiffened structures, a new analytical model was developed.

Analyses were performed using an existing state-of-the-art and newly developed model to predict the torsion, bending, and axial stiffness of grid and grid-stiffened structures with various stiffening configurations. These  predictions were compared to results generated using finite element analysis (FEA) to observe excellent correlation (within 6\\%) for a range of parameters for grid and grid-stiffened structures such as grid density, stiffener angle, and aspect ratio of the stiffener cross-section. Experimental results from cylindrical grid specimen testing were compared with analytical prediction using the new analysis. The new analysis predicted stiffness coefficients with nearly 7% error compared to FEA results. From the parametric studies conducted, it was observed that the previous state-of-the-art analysis on the other hand exhibited errors of the order of 39% for certain designs. Stability evaluations were also conducted by integrating the new analysis with established stability formulations.  A design study was conducted to evaluate the potential weight savings of a simple grid-stiffened rotor blade spar structure compared to a baseline monocoque design. Various design constraints such as stiffness, strength, and stability were imposed. A manual search was conducted for design parameters such as stiffener density, stiffener angle, shell laminate, and stiffener aspect ratio that provide lightweight grid-stiffened designs compared to the baseline. It was found that a weight saving of 9.1% compared to the baseline is possible without violating any of the design constraints.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5990], "author_name_tesi": "Narayanan Nampy, Sreenivas ", "last_name_ssi": "Narayanan Nampy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sreenivas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Smith", "Edward C Smith", "Charles E Bakis", "Farhan S Gandhi", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Smith, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward C Smith, Committee Chair", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member", "Farhan S Gandhi, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["composites", "structures", "rotor blades", "grid-stiffened", "grid", "spar", "heavy-lift rotor blade", "buckling", "stiffness", "strength"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Restricted versions of the two-local Hamiltonian problem", "id": "19025", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9127", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Hamiltonian of a physical system is its energy operator and determines its dynamics.

The writers considered for this study include the Argentine Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cort\u00e1zar, the Mexican Carlos Fuentes, and the Puerto Rican Rosario Ferr\u00e9. In the short stories chosen for this dissertation, these writers establish characters whose objective is to explore, through fiction, an itinerary of knowledge. In these stories, the authors establish a path that the literary character and the reader will travel together and each story will give them a chance to reflect on their personal and universal history. The chosen short stories present a unique complexity, which allows their protagonists to discover or deepen their knowledge of their own existence with details that were unknown to them at the beginning. This discovery brings humanity to the protagonists and allows them to build a reality in the narrative with which the reader will become close. In this journey, the reader will eventually identify himself as a mirror image or a double of the character. Therefore, the characters will develop throughout two separate but parallel paths: the first, as a character fiction, the second through the illusion of fiction as a mirror of the reader and of his/her existential doubts.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4001], "author_name_tesi": "Nardone, Maria Chiara ", "last_name_ssi": "Nardone", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Maria Chiara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Julia Cuervo Hewitt", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt", "Laurence E Prescott", "Mary Elizabeth Barnard", "Thomas Oliver Beebee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Julia Cuervo Hewitt, Dissertation Advisor", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt, Committee Member", "Laurence E Prescott, Committee Member", "Mary Elizabeth Barnard, Committee Member", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["short stories", "latin american", "characters"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Diffusion Flame Studies of Solid Fuels with Nitrous Oxide", "id": "28898", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12363", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fundamental counterflow combustion studies and static-fired rocket motor experiments were conducted to investigate baseline solid fuel (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, HTPB) and aluminized solid fuel combustion under varied pressure environments using gaseous oxygen (GOx) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Combustion experiments were coupled with a detailed model developed to understand GOx and N2O combustion with pyrolyzing HTPB under pressurized environments. \nThe pressure influence on N2O decomposition is studied in detail describing the flame structure, and solid fuel combustion. Counterflow combustion experiments and model results show solid fuel regression rate increases with pressure for a fixed momentum flux. The flame structure thins, due to the faster kinetics, and shifts towards the regressing fuel surface with increasing pressure. Flame temperature increases with pressure as well, due to decreasing radical formation, increasing the surface temperature gradient, resulting in enhancement of solid fuel pyrolysis. Heat release from N2O decomposition and pyrolyzed fuel oxidation occurs in two distinct stages under atmospheric conditions, while at elevated pressure (1.827 MPa) the exothermic peak associated with oxidation becomes distributed over a wide spatial domain containing many reactions with large exothermicities. The flame structure with N2O exhibits the same trends as O2 following decomposition. Leakage of O2 and NO into the fuel pyrolysis zone also decreases with increasing pressure, indicating faster reaction rates. Over the range of pressures investigated, the diffusion flame produced by combustion of HTPB pyrolysis and N2O decomposition products was always positioned on the oxidizer side of the stagnation plane, which also shifted toward the fuel surface with increasing pressure. \nAluminized solid fuel combustion experiments coupled with spectroscopic analysis of the flame zone detected AlO emission only when combusted with gaseous oxygen, indicating ignition of the aluminum was not achieved using N2O, and/or significant amounts of aluminum were not leaving the fuel surface. With both oxidizers, aluminum was observed to collect in the melt layer formed on the solid fuel surface. \nMotor combustion experiments were conducted to evaluate the propulsive performance of N2O/HTPB and N2O/aluminized HTPB system having a 6.5 and 26 \u00b5m Al particle size, with loading up to 10% by weight.

In this approach, coal particles are burned in a medium of oxygen (O2) and recycled flue gas (RFG) consisting primarily of CO2 and/or H2O so that the product is a near-pure stream of CO2. The CO2 rich flue gas obtained using this approach, as compared to flue gas from existing conventional power plants, can be more readily sequestered or utilized for oil recovery because of lesser amount of impurities. One of the significant barriers for implementing this approach is the need for an expensive oxygen generation unit. Currently, the RFG approach is being evaluated for its feasibility in existing and new coal-fired power plants. \n\tIn order to realize the full potential of oxy-fuel combustion, researchers are applying commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools to predict the carbon burnout, CO and NOx emissions, flame stability and heat transfer to boiler walls. However, in numerical studies, the effect of higher concentrations of CO2 on heat transfer is typically accounted for, but its effect on coal pyrolysis behavior and char burnout is usually neglected. In experimental studies, conflicting results have been published and the discrepancies remain unresolved. The overall objective of this thesis is to modify the existing char-oxidation kinetics sub-model in a commercially available CFD tool FLUENTTM by including user defined functions (UDFs) and more appropriate intrinsic activation energy values to capture the effect of elevated levels of CO2 on char burnout and CO emissions. This study\u2019s experimental investigation attempts to identify coals that are more suitable for oxy-coal combustion for further reducing un-burnt carbon and NOx emissions compared to combustion in air. \n\tIn order to achieve these objectives, pyrolysis and combustion tests were conducted in a lab-scale drop tube reactor (DTR) at furnace wall temperatures of 1,173-1673 K using high-volatile (hvCb) and low-volatile (lvb) bituminous coal samples. The results show that pyrolyzing the coal particles in CO2 changes the physical properties of resultant chars and the split of coal-N between the volatile and char fractions. However, these changes appear to be caused by the contribution from char-CO2 reaction and not due to a change in gas phase chemistry. \n\tThe modified char-oxidation model uses a more appropriate intrinsic approach to account for the transition in rate controlling regime based on differences in char reactivity towards O2 and CO2.  In the model, activation energy for the char-O2 and char-CO2 reactions is taken as an average of activation energies estimated from the onset of maximum to 80% conversion. Model calculations at lower heating rates and temperature condition in TGA using intrinsic rate parameters and physical properties of char accurately capture the transition from a kinetically controlled regime (Zone I) to an intra-particle diffusion controlled regime (Zone II). However, at higher heating rates and temperature condition in DTR, char burnouts are predicted to be ~5 times lower than the measured values. This under-prediction of the char burnout is attributed to the uncertainty in measured activation energy value (by about 13 kJ/mol) which was not reflected in TGA condition due to lower operating temperature. \n\tDuring combustion tests, a higher CO, lower NOx, and lower char burnout are observed for combustion in a 21% O2/79% CO2 mixture, as compared to combustion in air. The computational prediction showed that the majority of the differences in NOx emissions between the two combustion media are the result of a decrease in gas temperature due to higher specific heat of CO2 compared to N2 and not due to coal-N retention in char in a CO2-rich environment. As expected, burnout measurements in the DTR showed a rapid increase in char burnout with temperature for the lvb coal compared to that of the hvCb coal during combustion in a 21% O2/79% CO2 mixture in contrast to combustion in air. Reactivity and activation energy measurement of the two coal chars towards O2 and CO2 in the TGA showed that the observed increase in char burnout in DTR during combustion in a 21% O2/79% CO2 mixture arises from higher activation energy and reactivity of lvb coal char toward CO2, as compared to hvCb coal. \n\tModel prediction from a pilot-scale facility shows that a higher char burnout during oxy-coal combustion occurs because of higher O2 partial pressure (30%) compared to combustion in air. A significant increase in char burnout due to contribution from char-CO2 reaction is predicted only for lvb coal. A higher reduction in NOx emissions is predicted for hvCb coal, as opposed to lvb coal because of differences in flame temperatures during oxy-coal combustion, as compared to combustion in air.\n\tOverall, the results obtained in this study indicate that for oxy-coal combustion approach, a high-volatile coal is more suitable to achieve lower NOx emissions and a low-volatile coal is beneficial to achieve lower un-burnt carbon.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5019], "author_name_tesi": "Naredi, Prabhat ", "last_name_ssi": "Naredi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Prabhat", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Alan W Scaroni", "Ljubisa R Radovic", "Semih Eser", "Daniel Connell Haworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Chair", "Alan W Scaroni, Committee Member", "Ljubisa R Radovic, Committee Member", "Semih Eser, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Char reactivity", "thermogravimetric analysis", "drop tube reactor", "modeling", "CFD", "oxy-coal combustion", "NOx", "CO emission", "burnout"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "A NEUTRON SCATTERING INVESTIGATION OF THE MICROSCOPIC DYNAMICS OF H2 ADSORBED ON SINGLE-WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES", "id": "6165", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1400", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Neutron scattering has been used to investigate the microscopic dynamics of H2 adsorbed on bundles of single-walled carbon nanotubes.  Properties of the adsorbed H2 in the presence of the local environment provided by single-walled carbon nanotube bundles have been studied through measurements of the rotational spectrum and the single-particle momentum distribution.  A strong anisotropy in the local environment of the molecules is indicated by a substantial difference in the adsorbed molecules rotational spectrum with respect to that for a free-rotor. While, a relatively low value of 87\u00b110 K for the mean kinetic energy of the adsorbed H2 indicates that their extent of localization is not substantial.  The large effect in the rotational behavior in conjunction with the low mean kinetic energy indicates preferential adsorption in the groove sites on the exteriors of the bundles.  Further information is provided by the time-dependent intensities of peaks in the rotational spectrum of the adsorbed H2.  Such behavior has been used to study the ortho-to-para conversion of the adsorbed H2.  These studies reveal that the conversion is well described by a first order process with a rate constant of 1.43 \u00b10.3 hr-1.  Translational diffusion of the adsorbed H2 has also been probed, as a function of temperature, with quasielastic neutron scattering.  Self-diffusion coefficients extracted follow a thermally activated behavior with a pre-exponential factor of 1.94\u00b1.82x10-7 m2/s and an activation energy of 92\u00b120 K.  This behavior is consistent with that observed for HD on graphite and indicates that the H2 is diffusing on the two-dimensional external surface of the tubes in a bundle.  Additional information is provided by the temperature-dependent intensities of the different components in the quasielastic spectra.  These temperature-dependent intensities are well described by a simple three-state model.  In this model, the molecules are initially adsorbed in the linear groove sites and as the temperature is increased the molecules can directly desorb from the bundles or they can move to the surface where they can either undergo translational diffusion or desorb from the tubes.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1389], "author_name_tesi": "Narehood, David George", "last_name_ssi": "Narehood", "middle_name_ssi": "George", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul E Sokol", "Milton Walter Cole", "Peter C Eklund", "Ljubisa R Radovic"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul E Sokol, Committee Chair", "Milton Walter Cole, Committee Member", "Peter C Eklund, Committee Member", "Ljubisa R Radovic, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydrogen", "Nanotubes", "Neutron Scattering", "Dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Understanding the Performance: Learning Identity and Domestic Violence", "id": "6579", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2234", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-11-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\nThis interpretive ethnography sought to understand identity as a learning process in the context of domestic violence survivors.

In this study, the effect of various stressors on Nrf2 protein content and DNA-binding in the rat retina is determined, including the effects of prolonged dark adaptation and diabetes.   \nIn addition to an interest in Nrf2, recent attempts to restore oxidative balance by dietary supplementation with antioxidants have proven to be potentially therapeutic in humans and animal models of retinal degenerative disease.  Of particular interest is zeaxanthin, a retinal-protective macular pigment, which is reduced in retina of individuals with diabetes.  In this study, the streptozotocin-diabetic rat model was used to determine the therapeutic potential of daily zeaxanthin treatment on retinal apoptosis, synaptic protein synaptophysin content, visual function, morphology, and the oxidative stress response proteins Nrf2 and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1).  \nPhosphorylated Nrf2 and NQO1 protein, as measured by immunoblot, were significantly reduced in retinas of STZ-diabetic rats compared to controls, suggesting an impaired defense against oxidative stress.  Inner retinal thinning, outer retinal thickening, and photoreceptor outer segment thinning determined by OCT, combined with loss of synaptophysin protein, provided structural and molecular changes that may contribute to the loss of visual function observed in STZ-diabetic rats.  The therapeutic effect of zeaxanthin treatment was limited to preventing apoptosis in STZ-diabetic rats compared to control groups.     \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11593], "author_name_tesi": "Nassrallah, Zeinab ", "last_name_ssi": "Nassrallah", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zeinab", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alistair J Barber", "James Robert Connor", "Gregory Michael Holmes", "Patricia Mclaughlin", "Jennifer W Baccon", "Alistair J Barber"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alistair J Barber, Dissertation Advisor", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Gregory Michael Holmes, Committee Member", "Patricia Mclaughlin, Committee Member", "Jennifer W Baccon, Committee Member", "Alistair J Barber, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nrf2", "Optical coherence tomography (OCT)", "zeaxanthin", "optokinetic testing"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Motion Estimation from Range Image Pairs\n\n", "id": "9043", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1434", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As rapidly as new sensor technologies become available to researchers, the usefulness\nof their integration into intelligent systems is explored.

The supply chain is modeled as a single warehouse supplying a product to several retailers which in turn satisfies the end consumer demand. The supply chain operates under a decentralized control, i.e., each location is managed by an independent decision maker (DM).\n\nIn the first model, using the conventional single cost objective framework we propose a new coordination scheme that enables the warehouse to better manage its inventory and at the same time meet the retailers\u2019 demands without deviating too much from their requirements. To avoid the problem of estimating marginal cost information and to incorporate the DM\u2019s preference information, a more realistic multiple criteria model is then developed. To account for discounts in shipping, actual freight rate functions are used to model transportation costs between the stages. The conflicting criteria considered are: 1) capital invested in Inventory 2) annual number of orders 3) annual transportation costs. While the first two models deal with deterministic demand and constant lead time, the third model deals with stochastic demand and random lead time. In addition to the above three criteria, fill rate is used as a fourth criterion to measure customer satisfaction. The multiple criteria models are solved to generate several efficient solutions.

The decision making process is simulated by using an executive from the company to be the DM for the warehouse. The preference information is obtained using standard multi-criteria techniques to generate the set of efficient solutions. The DM adjudged the multi-criteria methodology to be a more effective decision making tool since he had to evaluate tradeoffs and use his judgment to choose the most preferred solution. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [581], "author_name_tesi": "Natarajan, Ajay ", "last_name_ssi": "Natarajan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ajay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Timothy William Simpson", "John Eugene Tyworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Chair", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "John Eugene Tyworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multi-Criteria optimization", "Single Objective optimization", "Inventory policies", "Transportation", "Inventory", "Supply Chain", "Stochastic modelling", "Supply chain Case Study"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "REGULATION OF HIV TRANSCRIPTION IN T CELLS\n", "id": "11085", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4526", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nCD4+T cells are the primary target of HIV infection, and depletion in CD4+T cell\ncount corresponds with disease progression leading to aquired immunodeficiency\nsyndrome (AIDS). The current treatment for AIDS employs the administration of highly\nactive antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which has not been successful in completely\neliminating HIV infection since the virus persists in a subset of cells harboring latent\nprovirus. A number of events contribute to HIV transcriptional latency including lack of\ntranscription factors, repressive chromatin structure, epigenetic modifications of the\nDNA, the inability of Tat to recruit functional PTEFb or poor processivity of RNA\npolymerase II. Latent provirus can be reactivated when T cells are activated by signals\ndownstream of the T cell receptor and the costimulatory molecule CD28. I have studied\ntwo facets of HIV transcription; how signals downstream CD28 induce HIV transcription\nand the role of NELF and Pcf11 in repressing HIV transcription by regulation\ntranscription elongation.\nActivation through the T cell receptor (TCR) and the costimulatory receptor\nCD28 supports efficient HIV transcription as well as reactivation of latent provirus. In\norder to characterize critical signals associated with CD28 that regulate HIV-1\ntranscription, I generated a library of chimeric CD28 receptors that harbored different\ncombinations of key tyrosine (Y) residues in the cytoplasmic tail, Y173, Y188, Y191 and\nY200. I found that Y191 and Y200 induce HIV-1 transcription via the activation of NF-\n&#954;B and its recruitment to the HIV-long terminal repeat. Y188 modifies positive and\niv\nnegative signals associated with CD28. Importantly, signaling through Y188, Y191 and\nY200 is required to overcome the inhibition posed by Y173. CD28 also regulates PTEFb\nactivity, which is necessary for HIV-1 transcription processivity, by limiting the release\nof PTEFb from the HEXIM1-7SK inhibitory complex in response to T cell receptor\nsignaling. My studies reveal that CD28 regulates HIV-1 provirus transcription through a\ncomplex interplay of positive and negative signals that may be manipulated to control\nHIV-1 transcription and replication.\nWe have previously established an important role of negative elongation factor\n(NELF) in regulating HIV transcription in latent cell lines by inducing promoter proximal\npausing. I have extended these studies by evaluating the role of NELF in infected T cell\npopulations, including primary CD4+ T cells. Depleting NELF in HIV infected CD4+ T\ncells increased the release of virus. This increase in virus production corresponded to\nenhanced transcription elongation, emphasizing the role of NELF in maintaining a paused\nRNA polymerase II complex and limiting HIV transcription. Furthermore, I have shown\nthat NELF interacts with Pcf11, a transcription termination factor. Pcf11 has been shown\nto cause premature termination of the paused elongation complex and I demonstrated that\ndepletion of Pcf11 in CD4+T cells induces HIV elongation and transcription. In fact,\ndepletion of both NELF and Pcf11 increases basal HIV transcription, suggesting that they\nact in concert in the same biochemical pathway. I propose that NELF recruits Pcf11 to\nthe paused polymerase complex, coupling promoter proximal pausing with premature\ntermination. These studies confirm that NELF mediated promoter proximal pausing and\npremature termination by Pcf11 are critical early check points in HIV transcription.\nv\nOverall, my studies provide new insights into the factors that regulate RNA\npolymerase II processivity and their overall impact on HIV transcription and latency, as\nwell as identifying signals downstream of T cell activation which reactivate latent\nprovirus. How these results may lead to the development of novel strategies to purge\nlatent provirus from cellular reservoirs that harbor HIV are discussed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4495], "author_name_tesi": "Natarajan, Malini ", "last_name_ssi": "Natarajan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Malini", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Avery August", "Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Avery August", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "David Scott Gilmour"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Avery August, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Chair", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pcf11", "Transcription", "NELF", "HIV", "CD28", "T cell activation"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "A PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCESS TO FABRICATE THIN FILMS AND PATTERNS OF UNSUBSTITUTED POLYTHIOPHENE", "id": "6802", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5852", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Polythiophenes have great potential in the field of electronics, sensors, solar-cells, displays so on. Despite its superior thermal and environmental stability and ease of synthesis, unsubstituted polythiophene is not widely utilized in the aforementioned applications. One of the main reasons is its intractability. The unsubstituted polythiophene is insoluble and not fusible, hence cannot be processed into useful devices using conventional micro-fabrication methods. To address this issue an in-situ photochemical polymerization process is developed and detailed in this thesis. The process involves vapor deposition of monomer 2,5-diiodothiophene on a substrate in ambient condition, followed by UV irradiation of the deposited precursor film in an argon environment.  The photochemical process synthesizes polythiophene directly from the monomer adsorbed on a substrate thus avoids the intractability issues of unsubstituted polythiophene in fabrication of thin films and patterns. \nThe most significant contribution is the discovery of photo-activated Ullmann coupling reaction. Photo-activation of a thin film of 2,5-diiodothiophene on a copper substrate produces unsubstituted polythiophene with an average conjugation length of  ~ 7, while the same process on Au, Pt, Pd, and SiO2 produces polymer of conjugation length ~ 4. This enhanced conjugation length on copper is explained by the mediation of Ullmann coupling pathway in the photochemical reaction. The photo-activation of monomer molecules removes the need for reflux at a high temperature as in conventional Ullmann coupling reaction and enables in-situ Ullmann coupling synthesis of thin films and micro-patterns of unsubstituted polythiophene from the monomer film in ambient conditions.\nExperimental evidences showing a decrease in the extent of mediation of Ullmann coupling with an increase in the thickness of monomer are presented. A diffusion-reaction model is developed to qualitatively explain the experimental evidences. Also, a stochastic model is developed to explain the mass spectrum of polythiophene synthesized on non-reactive substrate such as glass. Extent of reaction is calculated by fitting this model to the experimental results. \nA mask-less technique for fabrication of periodic patterns of polythiophene is also demonstrated by regio-selective condensation of 2,5-diiodothiophene followed by photochemical conversion of the condensed monomer into polythiophene. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5849], "author_name_tesi": "Natarajan, Sudarshan ", "last_name_ssi": "Natarajan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sudarshan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong H Kim", "Henry C Foley", "Themis Matsoukas", "Ayusman Sen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seong H Kim, Committee Chair", "Henry C Foley, Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polythiophene", "Photochemical", "Ullmann coupling", "Thin films"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Node Misbehavior Detection and Secure Trust Metadata Management in Mobile Networks", "id": "16136", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8053", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The topic of study of this dissertation is node misbehavior detection and secure\ntrust metadata management in mobile networks. For concreteness, two classic\nmobile networks, delay-tolerant networks and mobile ad-hoc networks, are chosen\nas the context of this study.\n\nIn a Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN), data originating from a source node may\nbe delivered to the destination node, despite the non-existence of end-to-end connectivity between them at all times. In an adversarial environment such as a\nbattlefield, DTN nodes could be compromised to launch Denial-of-Service (DoS)\nattacks by generating excess data, to cause an overflow of the limited resources\nof the legitimate nodes, hence decreasing the network throughput. A node may\nalso display selfish behavior by generating more data than allowed, to increase its\nthroughput and to decrease the latency of its data packets. In this dissertation,\nsuch a DoS attack and selfish data generation behavior is termed a resource-misuse\nattack. Two types of resource-misuse attacks are studied, breadth attacks and\ndepth attacks. Accordingly, different schemes to detect these attacks are proposed.\nTrace-driven simulations using both a synthetic and a real-world trace show that\nthe detection schemes have low average detection latency and additionally, probabilistic detection of the depth attack has low false positive and false negative\nrates.\n\nNodes may also display selfish or malicious behavior in a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). Since the nodes in a MANET are generally resource limited, some\nnodes could refuse service to other nodes to conserve their resources, thereby exhibiting selfish behavior. Also, since a MANET is often deployed in uncontrolled\nenvironments, some nodes could be compromised by an adversary and directed\nto act maliciously. A trust management framework in a MANET is useful to infer if nodes behave in a selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action\ncould be taken, in order to maximize network performance. In this dissertation,\na scalable semantics-aware trust metadata management scheme to partition and\nstore an information network of trust metadata of nodes in a MANET is proposed.\nIn this scheme, trust metadata created by individual nodes is propagated to and\nstored at certain geographic locations in the network itself, based on its semantics.\nA network entity, such as a trust authority (TA) (e.g., the network administrator), could then send queries of various types in the network to obtain the trust\nmetadata of its interest, and thereby evaluate the behavior of nodes and make\nprompt decisions (e.g., revoking malicious nodes). The simplicity of this scheme\nfor trust metadata propagation and retrieval, and its robustness to node failures,\nmembership changes and mobility, make it a promising choice for trust metadata\nmanagement in a MANET. Simulation results that evaluate this scheme based on\nsome trust management metrics demonstrate its performance benefits.\n\nA trust metadata management scheme for a MANET is also required to be secure. Misbehaving nodes could attempt to prevent trust metadata from eventually\nreaching the concerned network entity (e.g., a TA), to escape detection of their misbehavior. In this dissertation, a secure and scalable trust metadata management\nscheme for a MANET is designed.

Specialized hypothalamic neurons localized to the lamina terminalis detect changes in plasma osmolality or sodium (Na+) concentrations; the CNS integrates these inputs and coordinates downstream homeostatic responses to restore extracellular fluid (ECF) sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations and osmolality back to normal levels. The mechanism by which hypothalamic neurons detect changes in circulating plasma NaCl concentrations or osmolality is not known. Central infusion of hypertonic NaCl in rats stimulates thirst, increases sympathetic nerve activity, and raises plasma vasopressin levels. These homeostatic responses to increased plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NaCl concentrations are attenuated by pretreatment with the non-voltage gated Na+ channel antagonist benzamil. Among other channels, benzamil targets the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Although the ENaC contains three subunits, (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3), the ENaC\u03b1 subunit is expressed in the hypothalamic nuclei containing osmo-or Na+-receptors. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ENaC\u03b1 subunit may be a brain Na+-detector that is important in helping the CNS detect changes in body fluid homeostasis. \nThe first aim of this thesis is to determine whether the ENaC\u03b1 subunit contributes to hypernatremia-induced thirst responses. This research question was investigated using novel mice generated with brain-specific deletion of the ENaC\u03b1 subunit (ENaC\u03b1lox/loxNestinCre). Behavioral experiments measuring cumulative water intakes demonstrated ENaC\u03b1lox/loxNestinCre mice had attenuated water intake in response to sc injections of hypertonic NaCl compared to control (ENaC\u03b1lox/lox) mice. In contrast, ENaC\u03b1lox/loxNestinCre and ENaC\u03b1lox/lox strains drank similar volumes of water in response to hyperosmolality and extracellular dehydration induced by subcutaneous (sc) injections of hypertonic mannitol and isoproterenol, respectively. This suggests that the ENaC\u03b1 subunit may be a brain- Na+ detector as it is critical for normal thirst responses induced by hypernatremia but not hyperosmolality or extracellular dehydration. Manipulation of ENaC\u03b1-expressing neurons in the lamina terminalis is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of this potential brain Na+-detector. \nRecent new technologies, such as Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), have transformed the neuroscience field with the ability to remotely manipulate subpopulations of neurons. The second aim of this thesis was to determine if DREADDs technology can be implemented in the lamina terminalis to manipulate body fluid homeostasis. This research question was investigated using behavioral thirst experiments, single-unit recordings, and in-vitro electrophysiology. Male C57BL/6 mice received a stereotaxic microinjection of the excitatory DREADDs construct, hM3Dq, into the subfornical organ (SFO). After viral infection, mice received sc injections of clozapine N-oxide (CNO) and cumulative water intakes were recorded. Post-hoc immunohistochemistry for the hemagglutinin (HA)-Tag confirmed that mice expressing the DREADDs construct in the SFO (termed SFO-mice) drank significantly more water and 0.3M NaCl in response to sc CNO compared to mice lacking DREADDs expression in the SFO (termed SFO-x mice). CNO also significantly increased the number of Fos-positive neurons in the lamina terminalis of SFO mice. In-vivo single-unit recordings demonstrated that intravenous (iv) injections of CNO increased the action potential firing rate of Angiotensin II (AngII)- or Na+-responsive SFO neurons, but not SFO-x neurons. Similarly, in-vitro patch-clamp experiments indicated that bath application of CNO produced membrane depolarization and increased neuronal discharge in SFO vs SFO-x neurons. Finally, chronic activation of SFO neurons, via administration of CNO in the drinking water, increased 24-hour water intakes in SFO, but not SFO-x mice.  Therefore, DREADDs technology can be used to acutely and chronically manipulate SFO neuronal activity and alter body fluid homeostasis. \nWith these results in mind, DREADDs technology can now be utilized to manipulate subpopulations of lamina terminalis neurons, such as ENaC\u03b1-expressing neurons, to determine their significance in maintaining body fluid homeostasis. As a whole, the neuroscience field can utilize DREADDs technology to further investigate the neuronal mechanism underlying osmoregulation.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14602], "author_name_tesi": "Nation, Haley Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Nation", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Haley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean Stocker Ph.D ", "Sean Stocker Ph.D. ", "Kirsteen Browning Ph.D. ", "Patricia McLaughlin D.Ed.

Although one type of detector may not be able to perform as excellent as helium-3 in every metric, a detector with modest absolute neutron detection efficiency combined with additional capabilities, such as spectroscopy, could potentially fill some of the need left from the dwindling supply.  The key concerns in addressing this current need are speed, accuracy, and precision in detecting and measuring the properties of neutron sources.  A major challenge facing the nuclear security community is the detection and characterization of special nuclear material for safeguards applications.  Special nuclear material (SNM) emits both neutron and gamma radiation, but at a low rate.  Gamma rays emitted by SNM can be readily shielded by high-Z materials.  In contrast, fast neutrons can be more penetrating through high-Z materials, providing an opportunity for detection of SNM.  Furthermore, the ability to measure neutron energy could enhance the ability to identify the presence of SNM, especially if neutron energy can be measured on an event-by-event basis.     \n\nIn this work, the development of a fast neutron detector that can potentially provide direct energy measurement of the incident neutron on a single-event basis is discussed.  A capture-gated technique is used to identify thermalization events of incident neutrons, which are representative of incident neutron energy.  Specifically, spectroscopic measurements conducted with a glass-polymer composite neutron detector are examined and light yield as a function of incident neutron energy is characterized.  The neutron scintillator constructed utilizes both pulse height and pulse shape discrimination to achieve outstanding gamma rejection, with one of every 10^8 gamma events misidentified as a neutron.  Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to define capture gating timing acceptance windows and to substantiate the correlation of the total light output produced in neutron thermalization to the incident neutron energy.  Other simulations were performed to show the relative capture efficiency at various neutron energies.  The cylindrical detector used in this work is 5.08 cm in diameter and 5.05 cm in height and was fabricated using 1-mm square lithium glass rods and scintillating polyvinyl toluene.

Administrative units such as census tracts, block-groups and blocks can therefore hardly fit the demands of the concept. Nevertheless, census units, in particular census tracts, have remained the single most common neighborhood proxy in neighborhood effects research, mostly because of their availability and practicality. While new sophisticated approaches to operationalizing the neighborhood are being developed, \u201chow much\u201d and under what circumstances the use of census units affects the results of neighborhood effects research remains to be assessed. Here, I present a Monte Carlo simulation experiment based on census data from Los Angeles County and parameters derived from models estimated on data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood survey (LA.FANS), to assess the sensitivity of neighborhood effects to measuring the neighborhood at the \u201cwrong\u201d scale of the census geography. Through strategic manipulation of the simulation scenarios, I find that scale effects can introduce substantial downward bias into neighborhood effects estimates. The magnitude of the bias depends, however strongly on how much the distribution of neighborhood characteristics changes when being aggregated at different scales. Census tracts constitute the most robust measurement in all scenarios. Block-groups perform similarly to tracts and can therefore not serve as \u201cmiddle ground\u201d between tracts and blocks. Because block-groups are in average about one third of the size of tracts, boundary issues are unlikely to affect the prediction of neighborhood effects. The neighborhood level variance and thus, the commonly used intra-class correlation coefficient are highly sensitive to mis-measurement, with bias possible in both directions.

Over the last decade, approximately 1500 children were placed in Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Austria, and other nations (Selman, 2012a). Known as \u201coutgoing cases\u201d these adoptions pivot on the birthparents\u2019 choice of a foreign family, and placement usually occurs within hours or days after birth. Birthparents may request ongoing contact with the adoptive family, a practice differing radically from the dominant paradigm of international adoption (ICA). In contrast to the formidable volume of psychological, legal, educational, and policy-focused research related to ICA, there exists almost no empirical literature on the experience of outgoing U.S. adoptions, even as the practice continues. This study\u2019s purpose was to explore and describe (a) the historical, legal, and socio-cultural context of U.S. outgoing adoptions to Canada and the Netherlands, (b) the pre-and post-adoption education, preparation, and informal learning activities Canadian and Dutch adopters engaged in when adopting U.S. infants, and (c) how adopting children from the United States affected meanings of self, family, community, culture, country, and worldview for Canadian and Dutch adoptive parents. \nA narrative inquiry approach, and cross-national case study design was used to explore the ICA experience of 12 Canadian and eight Dutch families that had adopted U.S. infants over the last 15 years. Participants\u2019 narratives revealed several key findings: (a) The ICA experience of Canadian and Dutch adopters\u2019 of children from the U.S. differs substantially from that found in the contemporary paradigm of intercountry adoption; (b) Canadian and Dutch families substantially adapted and expanded their adoption-related learning beyond mandated or sponsored adoption agency, organization or state-based trainings;  (c), the presence or possibility of a level of open adoption in an intercountry adoption process was a mediating agent in parent learning, experience and meaning; and, (d) U.S. outgoing intercountry adoptions reveal a new model of intercountry adoption practice.  This research indicates that outgoing U.S. adoptions reflect a new, hybrid form of intercountry adoption, which calls for new content in training and preparation for prospective parents, new levels of pre-and post-adoption support for all members of the adoption triad, and provocative new considerations for intercountry adoption stakeholders\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9732], "author_name_tesi": "Naughton, Dana Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Naughton", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Dana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Esther Susana Prins", "Esther Susana Prins", "Fred Michael Schied", "Margaret Ann Lorah", "Joseph M Valente"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Esther Susana Prins, Dissertation Advisor", "Esther Susana Prins, Committee Chair", "Fred Michael Schied, Committee Member", "Margaret Ann Lorah, Committee Member", "Joseph M Valente, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["international adoption", "outgoing adoptions", "U.S. adoptions", "lifelong learning", "narrative inquiry"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Paths To New Conceptualizations Of Literacy \nin Chinese EFL Teachers \n", "id": "21642", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9650", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the last 15 years in China, dissatisfaction with the outcome of students\u2019 English studies has led to changes in exams and textbooks, as well as efforts to equip teachers to use new methods.  Shifts in public policy, material resources, and understandings of learners\u2019 needs have led to greater expectations that Chinese English teachers should further develop students\u2019 abilities to use English communicatively.  However, it is challenging for teachers to alter their approaches to instruction, and little is known about what supports this process.  This dissertation investigates how professional development activities can support teachers in developing a new understanding of instruction, specifically, conceptualizing English literacy practices as communicative activities.\n\nIn this project, a 21 week seminar was created to support Chinese university teachers in reconceptualizing literacy, utilizing Kern\u2019s (2000) concept that \u201cliteracy involves communication.\u201d  The seminar was designed to develop what Vygotsky (1986/1934) called \u201ctrue concepts,\u201d genuine psychological tools that combine theoretical knowledge with practical knowledge.  The seminar not only provided teachers with information about literacy and literacy-based instruction, but utilized activities to allow them to interact communicatively through texts.  Qualitative methods were used to investigate the ways in which the teachers\u2019 understanding of literacy changed through their participation in the seminar, and sociocultural theory provided a theoretical framework for tracing the conceptual development of three focal participants.  The focal participants\u2019 classes were observed seven times during the year.  These observations and three debriefing meetings, as well as the seminar discourse, were examined to find how the teachers\u2019 concepts of literacy developed.  \n\nThis study found that two fundamental concepts impacted the participants\u2019 development of new conceptualizations: their prior understandings of literacy, and the position they assigned pedagogical theory in relation to their instruction.  Each teacher engaged with the means of mediation in the seminar in different ways, but all appropriated some new understandings of literacy and utilized new literacy activities.  This study supports teacher educators by revealing differing paths of conceptual development in individual teachers.  It also illustrates Vygotsky\u2019s contention that true concepts restructure cognition, allowing teachers to respond flexibly to new situations and preparing for future pedagogical learning.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9410], "author_name_tesi": "Nauman, Gretchen Allegra", "last_name_ssi": "Nauman", "middle_name_ssi": "Allegra", "first_name_ssi": "Gretchen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen E Johnson", "Joan Kelly Hall", "Athelstan Canagarajah", "Meredith Christine Doran", "Xiaoye You"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen E Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan Kelly Hall, Committee Member", "Athelstan Canagarajah, Committee Member", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Member", "Xiaoye You, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Teacher professional development", "English as a Foreign Language (EFL)", "literacy", "Chinese teachers"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Discourse of Female Marriage-based Immigrants in Taiwan\n", "id": "8998", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2273", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation aims 1) to analyze the multiple discourses of female marriage-based immigrants (FMIs) in Taiwan, which emerged in late 80s and have spread and evolved in the past decades, and 2) to develop a refined approach of critical discourse analysis (CDA) addressing the analytical needs for scrutinizing those discourses. \nData used in this dissertation include 1) 82 news articles on/about FMIs as \u201cforeign brides,\u201d \u201cforeign spouses,\u201d and \u201cnew immigrants\u201d, published in a one-month period (10/1-10/31, 2006), 2) 179 news articles on/about \u201cfalse marriage,\u201d a lexical item that has been used predominantly to describe FMIs\u2019 marriages, dated from 1986 to 2006, and 3) 16 narratives by FMIs, published in 2005.\nResearch foci of this dissertation are 1) the labeling of FMIs in main stream news media, 2) the voices of FMIs and related social groups/individuals in the news, 3) the co-existing and contesting representations of them in public discourses, and 4) the (re)appropriation of linguistic items longue dur\u00e9e in discourses of FMIs.\nThe methodology of this dissertation synthesizes Norman Fairclough\u2019s Functional linguistic approach and Ruth Wodak\u2019s Discourse-historical approach of CDA with modifications in 1) broadened coverage of data by including both mainstream and alternative discourses and a longitudinal collection of texts, 2) analytical emphases on dialogical relationship between discourses, and on the trajectory of language evolvements and shifts of discourse over time, and 3) cross-language sensitivity as multiple languages are involved in research.\nThis dissertation may contribute to 1) our understanding of FMIs and relevant social groups (e.g. women, immigrants, ethnic minorities, economically or socially unprivileged groups), 2) the promotion of social change addressing discursive/ideological inequity faced by FMIs, 3) accumulation of knowledge in related fields (e.g. critical applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, gender studies, media studies, cultural anthropology), and 4) the refinement of previously developed approaches of CDA.     \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2253], "author_name_tesi": "Navarre, Amber Hsinyi", "last_name_ssi": "Navarre", "middle_name_ssi": "Hsinyi", "first_name_ssi": "Amber", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sinfree Bullock Makoni", "Sinfree Bullock Makoni", "Sandra J.

There is evident in the works of Benedetti, Vald\u00e9s, and Panero a tension brought about by the needs of the present (the acceptance of exile, the forging of a new life) and the pull of the past, made ever present by their ethical commitments to their countries of origin. The migratory movements that have transpired since the second half of the 20th century through the present era of globalization give immediate relevance to the dissertation. \n\u201cNarciso ante su exilio\u201d: The chapter locates the topic of exile and identity in the context of the postmodernist experience, discourse and politics; it introduces the three writers and comments on the most important fact they have in common: the tension of living between two temporalities and spatialities. It is in that space of hybridity, in the splintered signification of the subject of representation, that the new political object is created.\n \u201cMario Benedetti en la primavera rota de su exilio\u201d presents Benedetti\u2019s only novel written in exile in the context of the rest of his literary career and of his political commitment as an intellectual. Primavera con una esquina rota, with its strong testimonial component and its advocacy of a definite assimilation to the new country, manifests the paradoxes of the experience of exile better than the poetry of the author in the same period. After experiencing exile the writer has to face the collapse of the foundations that justify his fight for a redeeming politics. The tension articulated in the text exemplifies the presence of hybridity, a factor that before his exile he considered to be a flaw in an intellectual\u2019s work. \n \u201cZo\u00e9 Vald\u00e9s en su b\u00fasqueda pendular de la identidad\u201d locates this author in the context of Cuban contemporary writers and analyzes two of her most recent novels: Querido primer novio and El pie de mi padre. In view of her other works, these two novels contribute to mark a pendular movement in the career of this Cuban writer. This movement perfectly accounts for the need to fight for Cuban democracy and against Castro\u2019s regime and, at the same time, for the need to constantly reinvent oneself as an individual. Writing itself is in the novels of Vald\u00e9s the space of self-reconstruction and her texts display the contradictions that the experience of exile imply.\n \u201cLeopoldo Mar\u00eda Panero y su manifiesto filial\u201d introduces the theme of insanity into the discourse of identity and exile. Aware of the poststructuralist theory, and committed to an asylum for more than thirty years, Panero conceives the insane subject as deterritorialized and engages himself in a radical critique of any institutionalized discourse. The text as the only space to prove himself alive and a palimpsestic notion of writing comprise this writer\u2019s poetics. His essays and the short story \u201cAll\u00e1 donde un hombre muere, las \u00e1guilas se re\u00fanen\u201d are analyzed in this chapter. Borges is one of the main sources for this short story, which is, at the same time a literary manifestation of Derrida\u2019s \u201cPlato\u2019s Pharmacy.\u201d\nConclusion: This chapter compares and contrasts the different forms in which these authors have confronted the paradoxical experience of exile and explains how their discourses call for a change in the Western inclusion of the margins into its hegemonic discourse. I explore the significance of their constant reinvention through writing in the present moment in which the generalization of migratory movements is shattering the foundations of what has always constituted Western discourse. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4750], "author_name_tesi": "Navarro Albaladejo, Natalia ", "last_name_ssi": "Navarro Albaladejo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Natalia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aida Beaupied", "Anibal Gonzalez Perez", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt", "Thomas Oliver Beebee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aida Beaupied, Committee Chair", "Anibal Gonzalez Perez, Committee Member", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt, Committee Member", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hispanic Exile Literature", "Hispanic Subaltern Studies", "Postmodernity and Identity Formation in Hispanic L"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Examining Structural Constraints in Bilingual Language Processing and Speech Production", "id": "28852", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12425", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the most important findings in studies of bilingual language processing is that bilinguals co-activate information from both languages across a variety of contexts and domains. While previous studies have reported syntactic co-activation/interaction, very few have examined co-activation of lexical-syntactic information in production and its relation to domain-general cognition. Here we investigate whether bilingualism modulates the use of subtle syntactic constraints in the L2 via a-adjectives (e.g., afraid, alive), which have been shown to resist prenominal use despite their adjectival status (Boyd & Goldberg, 2011). English-monolinguals, Spanish-English bilinguals (immersed in their L2), and German-English bilinguals (immersed in their L1) performed a sentence production task that elicited the use of prenominal and relative clause constructions. The task yielded three main findings. First, while all groups exhibited the a-adjective constraint, bilinguals were overall more stable in their preference. A follow-up analysis revealed that this pattern was related to errors on filler trials: those who prenominalized 3rd person singular verbs (the sings* boy\u2026) were more likely to also prenominalize a-adjectives, and this effect was found to be strongest in a subgroup of monolinguals. Crucially, bilinguals as a whole were less prone to generating these errors. Given the task\u2019s level of difficulty, we argue that bilinguals may have performed the task differentially using a proactive strategy. Second, Spanish-English bilinguals were slower overall producing correct sentences, potentially reflecting inhibition of L1 syntactic information, but German-English bilinguals showed similar latencies to monolinguals, possibly indicating less cross-language interference. Finally, sentences containing a-adjectives were overall produced slower, even when compared to filler trials involving relative clauses, suggesting activation that both lexical and syntactic information are activated at the onset of planning.

In this thesis we consider two different approaches to address this problem. \n\nWireless optical communications, also known as free-space optical (FSO) communications, is a cost-effective and high bandwidth access technique. One major impairment over wireless optical links is the atmospheric turbulence, which occurs as a result of the variations in refractive index due to inhomogeneities in temperature and pressure fluctuations. In this thesis error control coding as well as diversity techniques in conjunction with multirate fractal modulation will be used over wireless optical links to improve the error rate performance.\n\nPowerline Communication is another candidate in the list of solutions for the last mile problem. Originally designed for power delivery rather than signal transmission, power line has many non-ideal properties as a communications medium. In the next part of the thesis, we will first review the low voltage (LV) power-line channel model and noise characteristics, where two major problems are the multipath fading and impulsive noise. We will discuss different approaches to address these problems.

This process generates significant volumes of wastewater as a by-product, called production water (PW), a saline solution composed of hydraulic fracturing fluids (HFF) and the natural brine that originates from the underground geology.  PW used in this study had high total dissolved solids (TDS) (~208,000 mg/L), and electrical conductivity (EC) (215 mS/cm) and the \u201cfingerprint\u201d elements (Brantley et al., 2014) Ba (1300 mg/L) and Sr (3040 mg/L), making this stock compositionally typical of water produced in Marcellus shale formation natural gas development.  This waste fluid can impact the local vegetation, soil, and groundwater supplies when mechanical failure or human error leads to an accidental release.  In order to develop a scientifically defensible protocol for deciding when, and to what extent, remediation is necessary in the event of a PW release, the impacts on vegetation, soil, and groundwater must first be quantified.\nThe principal goal of informing practices for PW spill remediation was accomplished through the documentation of effects on vegetation, soil properties, and leachate characteristics under two scenarios of Marcellus gas PW application to grassed soil columns.  Treatments consisted of a control (distilled water to simulate rain water) and eleven other PW dilutions with EC levels of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 80, and 100 mS/cm.  The first phase comprised of a single application of PW, or one-time PW spill event, followed by daily simulated rain events for six weeks approximating natural monthly precipitation rates primarily to explore concentration tolerance thresholds for vegetation exposure.  Phase 2 simulated a continuous spill (such as from a pipe leak) over the course of one month, with smaller daily applications of PW punctuated by larger weekly rain events.  \nIn both phases, plant health was evaluated via weekly SPAD 502 meter chlorophyll levels and visual observations, as well as and final plant biomass yield. Soil characterization was also completed at the conclusion of each phase for monitoring of soil contaminant level changes due to PW applications and compared to Pennsylvania Act 2 soil remediation standards.  Phase 2 had additional assessments of soil column effluent arising from continuous PW applications in the context of state and federal drinking water criteria.  \nIn Phase 1, vegetation in the 0-30 mS/cm PW treatments did not differ significantly in health from the control group.  Fescue and ryegrass, the predominant grasses in the reclamation seed mix, have a soil salinity tolerance of 8-10 mS/cm (Swift and Koski, 2013).  Clover, a moderately salt-sensitive crop, may be a better early indicator for vegetation stress.  SPAD 502 chlorophyll meter readings for the 40-50 mS/cm treatments were significantly higher than the control, suggesting a stimulatory effect in those treatments; this apparent stimulation could possibly be explained as a response to the plant available portion of the Total Kjehldahl-N (TKN) in the applied PW.  Whereas chlorophyll readings would suggest a stimulatory effect (or increase in leaf nitrogen) after an applied PW EC 30 mS/cm, gravimetric yield has an inverse relationship to the SPAD 502 chlorophyll readings, showing a gradual detrimental effect on growth beginning at an applied PW EC of 40 mS/cm.  All vegetation exposed to the top two treatments (80 and 100 mS/cm) experienced complete mortality within four days of the PW application. \nAt the conclusion of Phase 1 soil was extracted from all columns and the concentrations of six metals were measured at three depths for each treatment level.  A composite of the three depths at each treatment level were tested via the Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP) for Cl and Ba. Ca and Mg results did not show clear trends, likely due to confounding losses by plant uptake, while average lead concentrations remained near background soil concentration throughout the experiments.  Ba, Sr, and Na all showed an increase in average soil concentrations with treatment level; concentration increases from the lowest to highest treatment were ~60, 100, and 470 ppm, respectively.  The DEP policy limit for chloride is 250 mg/L, a number which all soil treatments fell below (no treatment exceeded 80 mg/L).  The Ba levels in the SPLP analyses were all below detection (<0.005 mg/L).\nThe most noteworthy difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 vegetation is that overall it took a smaller PW EC to completely kill vegetation for the continuous spill scenario in Phase 2.  Vegetation mortality occurred at applications \u226445 mS/cm in a continuous spill in which there was less immediate \u201crelief\u201d from soil salinity in the form of rain events.  Results suggest that the total accumulation of constituents (total volume of applications) and not the EC of any single treatment is the main cause of impacts to plant biomass.   \nConcentrations of six metals (Ba, Sr, Pb, Ca, Mg, Na) were measured at depths of 0-5.08, 5.08-10.16, 10.16-15.24 cm (0-2, 2-4 and 4-6 inches) for each treatment level at the conclusion of Phase 2.  Ba, Na, and Sr increased with increasing treatment level and had statistically higher (\u03b1 = 0.05) concentrations in the top 5 cm (2 in) of the soil column.  Notably, Ba was largely conserved in the soil. \nThe Phase 2 SPLP-Cl- in the top 5.08 cm of column suggested an applied PW EC of 40 mS/cm as an approximate threshold for compliance with the chloride regulatory limit. The soil EC levels for the applied PW EC of 40 mS/cm treatment over the 4-week Phase 2 experiment averaged 3 mS/cm, which could be used as a practical benchmark for estimating, a priori, whether an impacted soil exceeds the SPLP Cl- regulatory limit.  Phase 2 also showed that effluent chlorides continued to increase as the PW applications became more concentrated.  Soil EC (and hence, salinity) was influenced by rain events but the progressive spill continued to increase soil EC even with flushing.  Results indicate that it is important to catch a spill early and prior to rainfall to minimize the amount of salinity that is washed down through the soil column.    \nColumn leachate was generated through weekly 2.5 cm (1 in) rain events in Phase 2.  Similar to the positive trend in soil EC with time, column leachate EC continued to climb each week except that by Week 4 leachate EC appeared to have reached a plateau. In Week 1 the average ratio of leachate EC/applied PW EC was about one-third.  By Week 4 the soil has become saturated enough with salts that more of the TDS was making its way into the column effluent such that effluent EC reached two-thirds of the applied PW EC. Effluent Cl- continued to increase as the PW applications became more concentrated and there was a strong linear relationship (R2 = 0.9667) between the leachate Cl- concentration and EC.   \nThis study has implications regarding natural attenuation versus the excavation and removal (\u201cdig-and-haul\u201d) approach for \u201csmall\u201d spills (\u226442 gal) of PW.  A PW spill assessment and response decision matrix was developed to determine when natural attenuation would be acceptable under the current regulatory framework.  First, soil must be removed or otherwise remediated if surface vegetation is substantially damaged.  Next, since Ba behaved conservatively in the soil, the soil Ba concentration can be estimated using inputs of spilled PW EC, spill volume and impacted area and compared with Act 2 or EPA soil screening levels to determine if remediation is required. Likewise, remediation is recommended if soil EC exceeds the threshold of 3 mS/cm (related to SPLP chloride >250 mg/L).  If none of the previous steps necessitate \u201cdig-and-haul,\u201d it is proposed that impacted area may be naturally attenuated pending final confirmation that the SPLP-Cl- standard has been met.  Refinement of threshold parameters through further data collection would strengthen the proposed matrix.  It is hoped that in the future the matrix will be incorporated into the protocol for addressing small spills of PW at gas well sites.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11568], "author_name_tesi": "Navitsky, Laura Olivia", "last_name_ssi": "Navitsky", "middle_name_ssi": "Olivia", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydraulic fracturing", "Marcellus Shale", "production water", "barium", "chloride", "total dissolved solids", "electrical conductivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Comparison of Thrombus Susceptibility for Two Pulsatile 50 cc Left Ventricular Assist Devices", "id": "15381", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7769", "abstract_tesi": "Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have proven successful as a bridge to transplant and more recently as a viable destination therapy.  Despite increasing survival rates, destination therapy for pulsatile devices remains limited by adverse events including thrombus formation within the device.  Thrombosis is correlated to the fluid dynamics within the device and has been shown to be a result of sustained wall shear rates below 500 s-1 on polyurethane, a material similar to that used within the Penn State pulsatile LVAD. A rotating disk is used to assess platelet adhesion to the device specific polyurethane urea material used for the blood sac within the Penn State LVAD. The effects of altered shear exposure upon adhesion are quantified across a physiologically relevant shear range.  Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is then used to compare flow within two 50 cc LVAD designs to measure flow patterns and quantify wall shear rates in regions known to be susceptible to thrombus formation, from previous in vivo studies, to determine which design limits platelet adhesion to the greatest extent.  The two designs differ in their front face geometry while maintaining identical stroke volume and port orientations. The V1 model has an outward facing \u201cdome\u201d whereas the front face of the V2 model is flat. \n\nA thrombus susceptibility metric, adapted from a computational study of the Penn State LVAD, is applied to objectively compare pump designs over the entire cardiac cycle.  For each design, there are regions where wall shear rates remained below 500 s-1 for the entire cardiac cycle resulting in high thrombus susceptibility potential.  Results of this study indicate that V2 has an overall lower propensity for thrombus formation and is the better design.  Results of the study are correlated to findings of platelet and fibrin deposition on an implanted blood sac from a V2 device and are also compared to computations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7701], "author_name_tesi": "Navitsky, Michael Anthony", "last_name_ssi": "Navitsky", "middle_name_ssi": "Anthony", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Keefe B Manning"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Keefe B Manning, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["thrombosis", "ventricular assist device", "fluid mechanics", "platelet adhesion"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "LA FONCTION MYTHIQUE DES ARTS DU SPECTACLE : L\u2019IDENTIT\u00c9 DIASPORIQUE ET LA PRODUCTION ARTISTIQUE  INTERCULTURELLE", "id": "13991aen5079", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13991", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The dissertation proposes a new concept of the \u201cmythical function.\u201d An activity assumes this function as its main role within a culture when it takes place in a liminal space.

The focused file of flowing particles analyzed by illuminating a laser light and collecting scattering signal from the particles demonstrated a 2.37% coefficient of variation (CV).

In order to improve performance of the cells, the ionic conductivity of the ion exchange membranes (IEMs) have been studied by many research groups and a considerable number of IEMs and materials have been synthesized to show high conductivities in wide ranges of temperature and humidity.\nThe measurement of ionic conductivity is crucially important in order to evaluate the performance of a newly synthesized material. Conventionally, the in-plane gas phase measurement has been used for thin-film organic membranes and the through-plane gas phase measurement has been used for inorganic-based membranes. However, the in-plane method measures the conductivity in a different direction from the operating condition of PEMFCs and AFCs. In order to overcome this problem, we applied the through-plane measurement for the thin-film membrane and compared the results with those of the conventional in-plane measurement. Similar approach was implemented for the liquid phase measurements.\nAs a result, we found that the ionic conductivities in the membrane measured in the through-plane direction were significantly lower than those measured in the in-plane direction. Thus, we concluded that the through-plane measurement has some challenges to be solved and the through-plane measurement should be carried out more carefully than the in-plane measurement.\nIn addition to these studies, we have investigated newly synthesized OH- conductive inorganic materials using x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the ionic conductivity measurement in the through-plane direction. The materials showed high conductivities comparable to other reported inorganic materials in the low temperature and low humidity ranges. However, their conductivities are much lower than the conventionally used in potassium chloride-based electrolyzers. Therefore, we need further improve the ionic conductivity of the OH- conductive inorganic materials for the development of an efficient AFC.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6295], "author_name_tesi": "Naya, Tomoki ", "last_name_ssi": "Naya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tomoki", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Serguei Lvov", "Serguei Lvov", "Sridhar Komarneni"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Serguei Lvov, Thesis Advisor", "Serguei Lvov, Thesis Advisor", "Sridhar Komarneni, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ion exchange", "conductivity", "fuel cell"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "IMPLEMENTATION OF GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES FOOD SAFETY STANDARDS ON MID-ATLANTIC STATES AND NEW YORK PRODUCE FARMS", "id": "13527rkn112", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13527", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the wake of multistate outbreaks and subsequent economic cost and health causalities, food industry stakeholders formulated policies for their produce suppliers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s guidance on Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) have been the basis for most of the industry initiated GAP certifications or audit processes. In this food safety regulatory setting, a third-party audit is a critical tool to ensure neutral and impartial assessment of safety standard compliance by the produce growers. Growers reported audit burden when they have to meet multiple duplicative standards and GAP audits. In response to the growing audit burden, the United Fresh Food Safety and Technology Council harmonized GAP standards. The Produce GAPs harmonized food standards are accepted by major food retailers and auditing agencies. \n\tIn this given scenario, which recognizes the undeniable significance of GAPs in preventing microbial contaminations of produce, it is not always the case that growers were able to have successfully implemented GAPs on their farms and pass the audits. Therefore, it becomes necessary to assess the areas of frequent GAP noncompliance along with the barriers that growers are facing in implementing GAP programs. The study employed \u201cevaluation and monitoring\u201d stage of a policy cycle model and a mixed method approach to assess the implementation GAPs of harmonized food safety standards by the produce growers of Mid-Atlantic states and New York. The primary purpose of the study was to identify the food safety standards of frequent noncompliance, aspects of noncompliance, barriers to GAP implementation and risk assessments, and GAP information sources. \n\tProduce USDA GAPs harmonized audits (field operations and harvesting) for the 2013-14 growing season were treated as a principal on-farm evaluation tool. Audits from Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia were accessed and analyzed to identify standards as well as criteria of GAP noncompliance. Based on the findings from the analysis of 166 audits, a paper survey was designed and administered to 212 USDA harmonized GAPs certified growers of those six states. In total 116 usable mail surveys were analyzed to validate the findings from the audits, identify challenging food safety standards, and assess the barriers to GAP compliance and risk assessments. \n \tAnalysis of audits and surveys produced both confirmatory and contradictory findings. The across-validated evidence pointed to problematic food safety standards that included having a food safety policy for subcontractors, documentation of corrective actions, policy for glove use, workers\u2019 compliance with hygienic practices, and writing water management plan and testing procedures. There were no significant differences in the proportions of growers who rated complying with food safety standards as a challenging task in states such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. Time and cost were two significant constraints for GAP incorporation. Preparing a risk assessment plan and understanding auditors\u2019 expectations were major barriers to carrying out risk assessments on the farms. \nSurvey respondents mostly obtain GAP information from Cooperative Extension, sell their produce to resellers and expressed their intention to renew their GAP certificate annually. Findings of the study have implications for Extension and outreach agencies to improve and tailor on-farm food safety programming. Emphasizing and prioritizing the problematic requirements in food safety programs, Extension can better assist the growers to successfully implement GAP programs on their farms and prepare them for the audit. Further study is necessary to determine the effect of farm size, marketing channels, and barriers on GAP compliance. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13603], "author_name_tesi": "Nayak, Roshan Kumar", "last_name_ssi": "Nayak", "middle_name_ssi": "Kumar", "first_name_ssi": "Roshan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Ewing", "John Ewing", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Connie Devine Baggett", "Luke F Laborde"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Ewing, Dissertation Advisor", "John Ewing, Committee Chair", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Connie Devine Baggett, Committee Member", "Luke F Laborde, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Food Safety Standards", "GAPs", "Mid-Atlantic States", "Extension", "Produce Growers"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "OPTIMIZATION OF HONEYCOMB CORE SANDWICH PANEL TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF AIR BLAST LOADING\n", "id": "11192", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5645", "abstract_tesi": "Optimization of the honeycomb core sandwich panel to minimize the effects of air blast loading is analyzed and presented in this thesis. The sandwich panel consists of three layers in which honeycomb core is embedded in between two face plates. The honeycomb core has a great potential to absorb the impact energy of the blast by undergoing cyclic plastic buckling deformation. This energy absorption is not only influenced by the cell sizes but also by the face plate size and geometry which are essential in maximizing the energy absorption of the core by providing external supports. The core also stiffens the sandwich by maintaining larger gap between the face plates. So the main purposes of the core are to reduce the transmitted acceleration to the back plate and also to reduce the back face plate deformation. The optimization study investigates the size and shape of the face plates, and depth and cell size of the core. Mass of the sandwich and the maximum plastic strain of the face plates are constrained.  The optimization is carried out in two different ways (I) response surface optimization and (II) direct optimization using Differential Evolution. In the response surface method Design Expert software is used to create response equations from the response values determined from sampled points based on central composite face centered design method. The response equations are used in FMINCON, a gradient based optimizer in MATLAB optimization toolbox, for optimization. Function evaluations are done using LS-DYNA.  Honeycomb core is modeled as a continuum solid structure with equivalent mechanical properties. The equivalent mechanical properties are determined by virtual testing method and parameterized in terms of the important honeycomb cell parameters. The results obtained shows that stiffer front face plate minimizes the back face plate deformation and acceleration by effectively transferring the blast load to a larger area of the core. Low dense core is found to be suitable for minimizing the back face acceleration whereas relatively high dense and high depth core is found to be useful for minimizing the back face plate deformation. The results are compared with solid flat plate and with shape optimized solid plate of equal mass. Honeycomb core sandwich structure proves to be much more effective over a shape optimized solid plate of equal mass in reducing the transmitted acceleration. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5642], "author_name_tesi": "Nayak, Sumanta Kumar", "last_name_ssi": "Nayak", "middle_name_ssi": "Kumar", "first_name_ssi": "Sumanta", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ashok D Belegundu", "Ashok D Belegundu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ashok D Belegundu, Thesis Advisor", "Ashok D Belegundu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Blast load", "Honeycomb core sandwich", "Optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "DESIGN OPTIMIZATION OF HONEYCOMB SANDWICH PANELS FOR BLAST LOAD MITIGATION", "id": "15295", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7698", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A general process for optimization of a honeycomb core sandwich panel to minimize the effects of air blast loading is presented in this dissertation. This process can also be readily applied to other types of cellular core. The panel geometry consists of two metal face plates with a crushable honeycomb core. Metallic sandwich panel with a cellular core such as honeycomb has a great potential to absorb the impact energy of the blast by undergoing cyclic plastic buckling deformation at a nearly constant stress. The core also provides higher bending stiffness to weight ratio of the sandwich by maintaining larger gap between the face plates. The ability of the core to absorb the impact energy and provide stiffness is not only influenced by its cell size and height, but also by the thickness and shape of the face plates. Optimization is necessary as there is strong coupling between the several variables and the physics, which makes parametric studies relatively ineffective. The optimization study investigates the size and shape of the face plates, and depth and cell size of the core, to minimize dynamic deflection or acceleration of the backface plate. Constraints on total mass and on plastic strain in the face plates are imposed. A design of experiments (DOE) based response surface optimization method is used. Response equations are determined using the central composite face centered method, which are then interfaced to a gradient based optimizer in the MATLAB optimization toolbox. Function evaluations are done using LS-DYNA finite element (FE) software. \nConsidering the high computation time involved in the FE simulation of detailed honeycomb cells, an alternative technique is used to simplify the honeycomb core modeling and to reduce computation time. Specifically, virtual testing is used to develop a homogenized model for the stress-strain curve of the honeycomb core. The homogenized model is validated by comparison to existing results in the literature as well as to detailed FE models of test specimens. The homogenization approach can be readily applied to other types of cellular core.\n\nFor deflection minimization, results produce a stiffer front face plate which effectively distributes the blast load to a larger area of the core and also produce a stiff core by increasing both core density and core depth. For acceleration minimization, results again produce a stiffer front face plate, but accompanied by a sufficiently soft core. The mechanism of lowering the backface acceleration is by absorbing energy with low transmitted stress. Strain rate effects on the results are discussed. Further, a clear cut comparison between monolithic metal plates and sandwich plates, for the same loading and failure criteria, is presented here.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer",

efficiently transport the materials gathered in space to Earth or other space based depots. The focus of this thesis is on such return trajectories from Lagrange point orbits to Earth. Since travel in space is currently very expensive, it is desired to utilize more efficient methods to travel through space. Current trajectory design methods require a lot of computational resource which contributes to mission cost. This thesis presents an approximate, computationally inexpensive method to scan the available search space and obtain the locations and trajectories associated the with lowest \u0394V, which can be used as an initial guess that can be later used in advanced methods to obtain \u0394V optimal trajectories. The use of invariant manifolds in the Earth-Moon system is proposed for this purpose. The three-body system is studied and a simplified methodology for the design of trajectories from the Lagrange point orbits is presented. The techniques to generate the invariant manifold associated with Lagrange point orbits is presented. To obtain the best possible trajectory based on \u0394V requirements, an optimization scheme is introduced to select the best location on the manifold to initiate transfer. While gradient based methods have been previously used to study optimal trajectories in the three-body system, these are computationally very expensive. Therefore, this thesis tackles the computational requirements associated with design of the space trajectories in the Earth-Moon-spacecraft three-body system for space transportation. The solver used to survey the search space of the invariant manifold is presented. The two-body approximation is utilized to provide quick, preliminary study of the transfers in space, allowing the mission designer to be able to devise a suitable trajectory in the three-body system using the insights from the two-body approximation. Essentially, the burden of finding the location of the transfer point with the minimum \u0394V  transfer is offloaded to the particle swarm optimization algorithm that uses a simplified Lambert's solver to scan the search space on the manifold and provide the patch point with the lowest \u0394V. The solver used here is validated using the results obtained from literature for transfers from Earth to a Lagrange point orbit. Validation results show that the technique used is able to provide fairly accurate results for a two-impulse scenario at a very significant computational advantage. Then, the method is used to generate results for Earth return trajectories. The \u0394V requirements from Lambert's solver for halo and Lyapunov orbits of L_1,L_2 points are presented. The trends obtained using this method shows the location of orbit insertion in the LEO that has the potential of providing the lowest \u0394V. The present analysis suggests that it is possible to reach almost any inclination from the manifold of a halo LPO without incurring huge \u0394V costs if the target location for insertion along the final orbit's true anomaly is either at the ascending or the descending node. \u0394V was found to increase as the point of insertion approached a true anomaly corresponding to maximum z-component displacement from the equator. These trends seem to hold for higher inclinations of the final orbit. Similar trends seem to hold for transfers from Lyapunov orbit as well. The results and initial and final \u0394V vectors obtained by this method has the potential to be used as an initial guess for gradient-based methods. Finally, ways to improve upon the solver and the optimization algorithm are suggested. The technique maybe combined with gradient-based methods to quickly and with reasonable accuracy locate the point on the manifold in the vicinity of the optimal point and then a detailed analysis may be pursued for better and more \u0394V optimal results.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13698], "author_name_tesi": "Nayyar, Mollik ", "last_name_ssi": "Nayyar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mollik", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr David Spencer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr David Spencer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Three body system", "Lagrange points", "manifolds", "optimization", "particle swarm", "PSO", "Dynamical Systems", "Optimal Transfers", "Astrodynamics", "Lagrange Point Orbits", "LPO", "Lambert's Problem"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "IDENTIFYING BALLAST FOULING USING STATISTICAL PATTERN RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES ON SMARTROCK DATA", "id": "15244sun51", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15244", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Railroad ballast serves different functions including draining water from track and distribution of the train loads. The ballast layer deteriorates and becomes fouled with time due to ballast particle abrasion and breakage as well as subgrade soil intrusion. Ballast fouling has become one of the most commonly seen track defects that can lead to inconsistent track performance. In the case of fouling, the ballast strength will decrease when it is wet (usually referred to as \u201cmud-spot\u201d) due to the lack of particle interlocking and lubrication effect of fine materials. However, both of the ballast strength and stiffness will increase dramatically when it is in dry condition as the ballast particles are well confined (Qian, 2016). This inconsistency in track behavior can cause higher deterioration rate of other track components such as rail and sleeper. Therefore, identifying mud spots in a timely manner is a critical issue in ballasted track maintenance. \n\nThe main purpose of this thesis is using advanced sensor networks and statistical pattern recognition techniques to identify ballast fouling by studying the relationship between ballast fouling condition and ballast particle movement. To that end, several field experiments were carried out with the aim of monitoring and recording the particle movements under different ballast conditions. In particular, two sections with the same traffic but different track conditions: one with clean ballast and the other with mud pumping, were chosen. The SmartRock (Liu, 2015) is used to obtain ballast particle movement information under traffic. The SmartRock is a wireless sensor device built using the 3D printing technology and resembles the real ballast particles in terms of shape, inter particle friction and specific gravity. This sensor device has the ability to record translational and rotational movement of a single ballast particle under dynamic loading and transfer the real-time data via Bluetooth to a base station. The autoregressive (AR) model was then applied to each of the acceleration and rotation time histories collected from the SmartRocks embedded in the two sections, during which the autoregressive coefficients will be obtained. Those coefficients will serve as damage indicators to identify ballast fouling severities.  The results and important findings are highlighted in this thesis.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16949], "author_name_tesi": "Nazari, Saharnaz ", "last_name_ssi": "Nazari", "first_name_ssi": "Saharnaz", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Hai Huang", "Dr. Tong Qiu", "Shihui Shen", "Xinli Wu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Hai Huang, Thesis Advisor", "Dr. Tong Qiu, Thesis Advisor", "Shihui Shen, Committee Member", "Xinli Wu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ballast Fouling", "Railway", "SmartRock", "Statistical Pattern Recognition Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "WHEN SOUTOURA (DIGNITY, RESPECT, AND PRIVACY) MATTERS MOST: UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING HIV/AIDS STIGMA IN THE FAMILY CONTEXT IN SENEGAL", "id": "8810", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3600", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As of the end of 2005, there were 25.8 million people living with HIV/AIDS (PLA) throughout the world (UNAIDS, 2006). As a result, the fight against AIDS has become two-fold: preventing new infections and improving the life of the individuals living with the disease. At the center of the work on improving the life of PLAs is the fight to eliminate stigma because of its damaging impact on PLAs\u2019 treatment, their physical and social well being as well as their overall quality of life. \n\tThe present study addresses this void by exploring HIV/AIDS stigma in the family context from the lens of PLAs in Dakar, Senegal. The focus on the family context of stigma accounts for the strong family structures in most African communities. Furthermore, the voice of PLAs is still not adequately heard. Since PLAs are the ones primarily affected and impacted by stigma and the study is concerned with obstacles to their treatment and well being, this perspective is essential. Thus, overall goal is to understand PLAs\u2019 perceptions of stigma and family communication and develop an assessment tool of HIV/AIDS stigma in the family context in Africa. \n\tIn the first phase, 4 focus groups and 10 individual interviews were completed. Eight key features of family stigma were identified: 1) Cultural and social stigma, 2) dynamic stigma , 3) financial or need-based stigma, 4) double stigmas, 5) strategic disclosure decisions, 6) stigma and social-familial relationships, 7) recounting specific stigmatizing behaviors, as well as 8) stigma and self-concept.\n\tIn the second phase of the study, the family stigma communication scale was developed and administered.

The primary goal for this facility is for use in subjective testing in concert hall acoustics, specifically on the perception of Listener Envelopment (LEV). The array is equipped with 30 two-way loudspeakers constructed to have a flat frequency response from 60 Hz to 20 kHz (after digital equalization) along with two subwoofers. The loudspeaker-based auralizations are performed using third-order, near-field compensated Higher-Order Ambisonics (HOA). To provide flexibility in creating different sound fields with different perceptions of LEV, auralizations were created using simulations. These simulations were then used in a subjective study looking at LEV. Simulated impulse responses were created using a room simulation program, created in MATLAB. This program uses a hybrid simulation technique of the image source method and statistical reverberation, simulating the geometry for a simple rectangular room. With fine control over the room\u2019s auralization parameters, a wide variety of auralizations were created, altering the room\u2019s size, reverberation time (T30), early-to-late energy balance, and overall A-weighted sound pressure level. The Ambisonic signals for the auralizations were simulated in MATLAB, and then the signals were decoded into loudspeaker signals using VST plug-ins in the digital audio workstation REAPER. Twenty-one musicians rated their perceived LEV for the auralizations using a graphic interface developed in Max 7 (IRB Protocol #41733). The interface allowed real-time switching between auralizations, providing side-by-side comparison of stimuli. The results of various one-way Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) analyses showed that for all 21 subjects, no clear differences in LEV ratings were found. This finding directly contradicts previous research done on the topic of LEV. Individual trends for each subject were analyzed, and three groups of subjects emerged, showing differing relationships between envelopment and level. One group rated louder sounds with higher LEV, a second group rated quieter sounds with higher LEV, and a third group showed no trend between LEV and level. Using these subject groupings, one-way ANOVAs were conducted for each group separately, and significant differences in LEV ratings were found. For the first two groups, a regression analysis also revealed a significant linear trend between envelopment rating and A-weighted level, with positive and negative slopes, respectively. Future work is needed to verify these findings with more subjects. Also, more work is needed to verify the validity of the lack of differences in LEV from changes in reverberation time, early-to-late ratio, and hall size.

Physical soil quality factors measured were soil organic carbon content, bulk density, aggregate stability, hydraulic conductivity, water retention, and soil plasticity. The research trial was performed at the Penn State Southeast Research and Extension Center in Landisville, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania (40\u00b0 2&#8242; 23&#8243; N, 76\u00b0 18&#8242; 16&#8243; W) from 2003 to 2007 on a well-drained Hagerstown silt loam (Fine, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Hapludalfs). Crop rotations were corn monoculture with winter fallow period, soybean/corn single crop rotation with winter fallow period, corn double-cropped with rye, corn double-cropped with barley, soybean/corn rotation double-cropped with rye, and alfalfa.  All crops were harvested for silage except soybeans. Effects of crop rotations and crop intensification on soil quality were limited to the top 5 cm of the soil, with no significant effects in the 5-30 cm depths.  Corn monoculture resulted in low bulk density, high hydraulic conductivity, and low aggregate stability.  The soybean/corn single crop rotation led to higher bulk density and lower hydraulic conductivity than corn monoculture, but similar aggregate stability.  Alfalfa resulted in higher aggregate stability than corn monoculture, but had similar bulk density and lower hydraulic conductivity than corn monoculture.  Soil organic carbon content was not affected by rotation.  Addition of rye as a double-crop only improved aggregate stability when grown as a double-crop with corn monoculture.  Double-cropped barley did not result in any significant improvement in measured parameters. The results of this study suggest limited potential for soil quality improvements with cropping intensification and crop rotation diversification when most above-ground biomass is harvested.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6520], "author_name_tesi": "Neal, Wesley James", "last_name_ssi": "Neal", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Wesley", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sjoerd Willem Duiker", "Sjoerd Willem Duiker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sjoerd Willem Duiker, Thesis Advisor", "Sjoerd Willem Duiker, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["soil quality", "crop rotation", "cropping intensity", "double crops"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "AGONIST-SPECIFIC MECHANISMS OF CANNABINOID TOLERANCE IN PRECLINICAL MODELS OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC PAIN", "id": "15260cmn181", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15260", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cannabinoids demonstrate substantial potential as pain therapeutics, particularly for treatment of types of chronic pain that do not currently have effective therapies.  One barrier to their use is that tolerance develops after prolonged treatment, where more drug is required to achieve previous effects.  Tolerance develops as a result of changes in receptor signaling, including receptor desensitization.  Desensitization is caused by phosphorylation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK), and subsequent association of the receptor with arrestin.  We have previously found that tolerance to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u22069-THC) is mediated by two distinct signaling mechanisms.  Mice expressing a mutant form of CB1, in which the serine residues at two putative phosphorylation sites necessary for desensitization are replaced by non-phosphorylatable alanine (S426A/S430A), display reduced tolerance to the antinociceptive and hypothermic effects of \u22069-THC.  However, we have found that tolerance to the effects of \u22069-THC on nociceptive pain is only prevented by subsequent inhibition of activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in desensitization-resistant S426A/S430A mice. The objective of this study is to understand the mechanisms of tolerance to WIN55,212-2 and CP55,940, both synthetic, high potency cannabinoid agonists.  We found that tolerance to CP55,940 was not significantly altered in S426A/S430A mice in either thermal (tail flick) or inflammatory (formalin test) antinociceptive pain assays or in a model of chronic cisplatin-induced neuropathic pain.  In contrast, tolerance to WIN55,212-2 was significantly delayed (although not abolished) in these tests in desensitization-resistant mice.   Interestingly, we observed contrasting effects of inhibiting JNK signaling using the JNK antagonist SP600125 on cannabinoid tolerance.  Disruption of JNK signaling, which consistently delays development of antinociceptive tolerance to \u22069-THC, actually accelerated tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of CP55,940.  Tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of WIN55,212-2 was unaffected by SP600125. Collectively, these findings show that tolerance to cannabinoid agonists develops through different mechanisms, where GRK- and \u03b2arrestin2-mediated desensitization of CB1 may be the predominant mechanism responsible for tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of WIN55,212-2 while JNK signaling contributes to tolerance to CP55,940, and raises the possibility of complex agonist-specific mechanisms of tolerance for different cannabinoid agonists.  A greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these effects is important for the development of better cannabinoid-based therapies, particularly for more effective pain management therapies.

Michelangelo came not simply from a noble family, but from one that had lost its wealth, and, therefore, its relevance among the Florentine patriciate.

In the process of building these arguments, I reconsider some major themes central to previous analysis of Michelangelo: his poverty and attitude toward money, and his biography (especially as seen through Condivi\u2019s account), in addition to his artistic accomplishments.

Increasing the temperature of the combustion gases entering the turbine improves engine efficiency and power output; consequently, the turbine inlet temperatures have reached levels exceeding the melting point of the blade materials.  Internal cooling of the turbine blades is vital to maintaining turbine blade longevity and durability.  Rib-roughened channels in the blade core are commonly used to increase turbulence and secondary flows that aid the transport of energy.  In addition, the ribs increase the convective heat transfer surface area.  Past research has focused on two ribbed wall configurations, and worked to identify the most favorable rib design that will produce maximum heat transfer with minimal pressure loss.  This paper presents an analysis of various rib configurations for a one ribbed wall configuration, by comparing the effect of pitch, aspect ratio, and rib orientation on both heat transfer and friction augmentation.  Heat transfer measurements were made using infared camera thermography in the fully developed region of the channel.  Additionally, the effect of total wetted area versus planform area was investigated.  \nExperimental measurements were taken in a closed-loop recirculating channel with a parallel-plate channel test section.

Results indicate heat transfer augmentation was higher with a pitch-to-rib height ratio of 5 compared to 10.  Similarly, the pitch-to-rib height ratio of 5 caused higher friction factor augmentation.  The results also indicate aspect ratio did not affect the ribbed side heat transfer augmentation; however, the 2.86:1 aspect ratio cases had higher augmentation on the unribbed side compared to the 5:1 case.

As a result of the Australia plate tearing, the two subducting sections are offset by the 280 km long San Cristobal Trough (SCT) transform fault, which acts as a Subduction-Transform Edge Propagator (STEP) fault. \n\nThe formation of this transform fault provides an opportunity to study the mechanics of lithosphere tearing and the evolution of a newly created plate boundary. In 2014, at the western terminus (the tearing zone) of the SCT, two earthquakes (MW 7.4 and MW 7.6) occurred with disparate mechanisms (dominantly thrust and strike-slip respectively), which I interpret to indicate the tearing of the Australia plate as its northern section subducts and southern section translates along the SCT. Analyses of these 2014 events indicate lithosphere tearing is accommodated along a complex network of faults.    \n\nAs distance from the tear increases, both the magnitude and frequency of earthquakes along the transform increase reflecting the coalescence of fault segments into a through-going structure. Over the past several decades, there have been several instances of larger magnitude earthquakes migrating westward along the STEP through a rapid succession of events. A recent May 2015 sequence of MW 6.8, MW 6.9, and MW 6.8 earthquakes followed this pattern, with an east to west migration over three days. However, neither this 2015 sequence, nor a previous 1993 progression, ruptured into or nucleated a large earthquake within the region near the tear. SCT sequence termination outside the region of the newly formed fault happens even though Coulomb Failure Stress analyses reveal that the tear end of the SCT is positively loaded for failure by the earthquake sequence. Changing seismicity patterns along the SCT are also mapped by b-value variations that correspond to the rupture patterns of these propagating sequences. These seismicity pattern changes along the SCT reveal a fault maturation process with strain localization driven by cumulative slip.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12389], "author_name_tesi": "Neely, James Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Neely", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin Patrick Furlong", "Charles James Ammon", "Donald Myron Fisher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin Patrick Furlong, Thesis Advisor", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Donald Myron Fisher, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Earthquake", "Subduction Zone", "Solomon Islands", "Lithosphere Tearing", "STEP Fault", "Transform Boundary", "Plate Boundary"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "To disclose or not to disclose: Investigating the stigma and stereotypes of autism in the workplace", "id": "xp68kg20b", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13145", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represent a large and growing population that possess a host of skills valuable to many organizations.

While much has been learned about these properties and much advancement has been made in utilizing them for many applications, we are still only beginning to understand their origins and how they can be enhanced by altering the polymer structure.  In this thesis, structure-property relationships are analyzed in a variety of PVDF-based polymers with varying chemical and crystalline structures.  The work consists of three parts as distinguished by the property under investigation:  electromechanical effects, electrical energy storage, and the electrocaloric effect (ECE).  First is the electromechanical effects, where a large converse piezoelectric effect is discovered in P(VDF-HFP) (HFP: hexafluoropropylene) copolymer.  The nature of the piezoelectric property is linked to the structure change through a detailed structural analysis to provide explanation to the large and unusual electromechanical strain response.  P(VDF-HFP) is further investigated for its use as an energy storage capacitor and various processing methods are utilized to alter the crystalline structure and study the effects on the energy storage characteristics.  The results indicate that uniaxial stretching is beneficial in improving energy storage efficiency up to a certain draw ratio (4-5\u00a1\u00d1 the original length), but as the draw ratio is increased and the polar \u00a3] crystalline phase becomes more prominent, ferroelectric losses become detrimental to the energy storage efficiency.  Furthermore, the effects of biaxial stretching on the crystalline structure are examined.  The data suggests that biaxial stretching of extruded films to a similar draw ratio as the uniaxially stretched blown films produces a similar composition of crystalline structure.  In view of the fact that the structure-property relationships show that the polar crystalline phase contributes to energy losses in the material, electron irradiation is examined as a method of destabilizing the \u00a3]-phase in P(VDF-HFP) and P(VDF-CTFE) and reducing ferroelectric energy loss.  A structural analysis confirms that the defects introduced into the crystalline structure of both polymers by the irradiation does indeed increase the composition of the nonpolar \u00a3-phase.  Furthermore, analysis of electric displacement-electric field (D-E) hysteresis loops indicates improvements in energy storage efficiency as a result of irradiation.  The final portion of this dissertation probes a property previously unstudied in polymeric materials, the ECE.  The results show that applying an electrical field to a polar polymer may induce a large change in the dipolar ordering, and if the associated entropy changes are large, they can be explored in cooling applications.  With the use of the Maxwell relation between the pyroelectric coefficient and the ECE, it was determined that a large ECE can be realized in the ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) (TrFE: trifluoroethylene) copolymer at temperatures above the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition (above 70\u00a2XC), where an isothermal entropy change of more than 55 J/(kgK) and adiabatic temperature change of more than 12\u00a2XC were observed.  We further show that a similar level of ECE near room temperature can be achieved by working with the relaxor ferroelectric polymer of P(VDF-TrFE-chlorofluoroethylene).   Furthermore, the difference in temperature dependence of the electrocaloric effect in P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) suggests different entropy change mechanisms.  The contribution to polarization from nanopolar domains in the terpolymer at low temperature is not as effective at generating large entropy change as the paraelectric to ferroelectric transition.  Moreover, the adiabatic entropy change \u0192\u00b4S is proportional to the square of the electric displacement D (\u0192\u00b4S = -1/2 \u0192\u00d2\u00a3GD2) in both systems and the coefficient \u0192\u00d2 increases with temperature in the terpolymer as opposed to the copolymer where \u00a3] is temperature independent.  This temperature dependent behavior of \u0192\u00d2 is caused by the ferroelectric relaxor nature of the polymer in which the polarization response from the nano-polar regions does not generate much entropy change. Consequently, the ECE effect in the relaxor ferroelectric terpolymer is smaller than that in the normal ferroelectric copolymer.  Moreover, a study of quenched terpolymer samples as compared to annealed samples with higher crystallinity shows strong correlation between the ECE and crystallinity, suggesting that the ECE occurs predominantly in the crystalline regions of the semicrystalline polymers.  \t", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [760], "author_name_tesi": "Neese, Bret P.", "last_name_ssi": "Neese", "middle_name_ssi": "P.", "first_name_ssi": "Bret", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Qing Wang", "Michael T Lanagan", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Qing Wang, Committee Chair", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer", "ferroelectric", "piezoelectric", "electrocaloric effect", "PVDF", "capacitor"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Frightening Masculinity: Gothic Affect and Antebellum Manhood\n", "id": "11448", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "641", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project engages novels and short stories written by Herman Melville, Charles Brockden Brown, Edgar Allan Poe, George Thompson, Theodore Winthrop and Julia Ward Howe.  It elucidates the ways that these authors addressed changing notions of masculine anxiety during the antebellum period.  As several factors challenged contemporary notions of masculinity, including the violent rejection of patriarchy in the Revolutionary War, the changing position of the father in the family, and the pressures of the rising market economy, the inability to successfully adapt to gender conventions became a source of intense anxiety for people struggling to be masculine.  Recognizing the efficacy of Gothic rhetoric for understanding and explaining this anxiety by translating it into fear, these authors used Gothic literature to critique masculine structures and the relationship between masculinity, the body, and desire.  More generally, the project brings together discussions of gender formation, antebellum male affect, and Gothic literature to argue that in order to understand fully the role of affect in the formation of masculinity, we need also to understand the importance of negative affects common to Gothic literature.  Of particular importance is the way that these authors recognized that fear, instead of being simply debilitating, could be a productive source of masculine identity.  Ultimately, this project argues for the centrality of gender to American Gothic literature while expanding our understanding of the role emotion played in the antebellum period and suggesting the importance of all gender practices\u2014normative and non-normative\u2014in the formation of the canon.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [637], "author_name_tesi": "Neff, Brian ", "last_name_ssi": "Neff", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Dean Castiglia", "Christopher Dean Castiglia", "Hester Maureen Blum", "Sean X Goudie", "Amy S Greenberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Dean Castiglia, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Dean Castiglia, Committee Chair", "Hester Maureen Blum, Committee Member", "Sean X Goudie, Committee Member", "Amy S Greenberg, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["manhood", "masculinity", "american gothic", "fear", "gender"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PEER REACTIONS TO COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORK BEHAVIOR\n\n", "id": "9413", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4679", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs) are phenomena that are routinely studied in Industrial Organizational Psychology.  A CWB is defined as a voluntary behavior that \u201cviolates significant organizational norms and in doing so threatens the well-being of an organization, its members, or both\u201d (Robinson & Bennett, 1995, p. 556).  While much is known about what personality traits and situational variables can predict these incidents (e.g. Marcus & Schuler, 2004; Witt & Barrick, 2004), little is known about their consequences.  Two studies, one vignette study with an organizational sample and one self-report study with a sample of employed students, were conducted to examine one consequence of CWBs, coworker reactions to CWBs.  Reactions to CWB were studied in light of two variables associated with a CWB event, behavior serious and outcome severity.  Behavior seriousness measured the actual behavior, or what an individual actually did.  Outcome severity measured the consequences of the CWB, or the result of the individual\u2019s behavior.  These two variables were examined with three categories of reaction variables.  Cognitive reactions were assessed with measurements of distributive and retributive justice.  While distributive justice is a measure of one\u2019s belief about fairness in regards to equity (Greenberg, 1984), retributive justice is a measure of how strongly one feels the individual committing the CWB should be punished (Vidmar, 2001).  There was support for both behavior seriousness and outcome severity affecting retributive justice, but no support for the cognitive reaction of distributive justice. Negative emotions were also examined as a possible consequence of witnessing a coworker commit a CWB; however, none of the hypotheses regarding negative emotions were supported.  Finally, behavioral reactions were examined in regards to speaking to the individual who committed the CWB about the incident, as well as articulated, latent, and displaced dissent (Graham, 1984; Kassing, 1998).  While speaking to the coworker about the incident was not predicted by either behavior seriousness or outcome severity, the two CWB variables did display relationships with the dissent variables.  While a priori hypotheses were made regarding articulated dissent, latent and displaced dissent were examined in an exploratory fashion.  Articulated dissent, which was defined as informing one\u2019s supervisor, or another organizational authority figure about the CWB was related to outcome severity in the vignette study.  Latent dissent, or informing peers about the CWB, was predicted by behavior seriousness in the self report study.  Displaced dissent, or telling an uninvolved third party, such as a friend or a spouse, was predicted by outcome severity in both the vignette and the self report study.  This dissertation contributes to the literature by examining a novel aspect of CWBs, that of coworker reactions.  Additionally, the variable of outcome severity was introduced to the Industrial Organizational literature on CWBs, and in the current set of studies, this variable was found to predict important outcomes, such as retributive justice perceptions, as well as organizational dissent.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4645], "author_name_tesi": "Neff, Nicole ", "last_name_ssi": "Neff", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Lewis Farr", "James Lewis Farr", "Susan Mohammed", "Rick R Jacobs", "Linda K Trevino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Lewis Farr, Dissertation Advisor", "James Lewis Farr, Committee Chair", "Susan Mohammed, Committee Member", "Rick R Jacobs, Committee Member", "Linda K Trevino, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Counterproductive Work Behavior", "Organizational Justice", "Behavior Seriousness", "Behavior Severity", "Organizational Dissent"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "TRANSPORTATION, URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND GREENHOUSE GASES: PATTERNS OF CONSUMPTION AND JUSTICE IN PHILADELPHIA,PA", "id": "6628", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5204", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite evidence that humans are modifying Earth\u2019s climate through greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, the United States has no formal GHG mitigation strategy. To fill the gap, many state and municipal governments have adopted plans to bring about GHG reductions. However, by applying global-scale thinking to local-scale problems, these approaches may place undue emphasis on specific policy makers, while ignoring options for mitigation that are outside of these individuals\u2019 control. This thesis argues for a more substantive view of GHG emissions that asks detailed questions about the causes of GHG emissions. Nevertheless, the foundation to ask such questions does not yet exist \u2013 there is little local information about energy consumption, a proximate cause of GHG emissions. This thesis presents the idea of consumptive landscapes as a lens through which to view GHG emissions. The thesis also presents a method for estimating GHG emissions from transportation in urban areas, using the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area as a test case. A traffic assignment model was applied to commuter origin-destination data, and the results were used to generate GHG emissions maps that were interpreted based on a historical understanding of the region and on contemporary demographic data. The results show that the responsibility for gasoline consumption lies disproportionately with the affluent suburb-to-suburb commuters traveling in automobiles. Conversely, poor populations working in the suburbs use public transport despite the poor quality of service. The results demonstrate that consumption of gasoline is linked to segregation in patterns usually associated with an urban/suburban split. Nonetheless, the results also identify \u201cother\u201d places that are important because their existence suggests alternatives to the urban/suburban dichotomy typically used to describe metropolitan Philadelphia. This \u201cother\u201d category is useful in subverting some of the discursive causes of GHG emissions and in demonstrating that GHG emissions are more than merely economic entities.

Some of the influential factors behind this continuous decline include gender differences in self-efficacy, social encouragement, the CS environment, stereotypes and academic exposure (Beyer, Rynes, Perrault, Hay, & Haller, 2003; Cheryan, Plaut, Davies, & Steele, 2009; Rosson, Carroll, & Sinha, 2011).

A. glabripennis is a serious pest both in China and the U.S. This research project was developed in response to the need for efficient monitoring traps to assess population density and dispersal in the field and to detect new introductions at ports of entry. The first stages of the project aimed at filling the gaps in our knowledge of the effect of semiochemicals on A. glabripennis adult behavior and exploring potential use of these chemicals for monitoring purposes. Semiochemicals studied were the male-produced putative volatile pheromone (blend of 4-(n-heptyloxy)butan-1-ol and 4-(n-heptyloxy)butanal) and plant volatiles. \nThe first series of experiments were conducted using the male-produced blend, its two components and plant volatiles in choice bioassays against a hexane control. In Y-olfactometer and walking wind tunnel bioassays, virgin females were more attracted to the male-produced blend and its alcohol component than males. Virgin males were even repelled at higher doses. These results suggest that the male-produced pheromone plays a role in mate-finding. When plant volatiles were offered in the Y-olfactometer, males were more attracted than females. Out of 12 plant volatiles tested, (-)-linalool, cis-3-hexen-1-ol and linalool oxide were moderately attractive to both genders, while 3-carene and trans-caryophyllene were only attractive to males. Combining the male pheromone blend with (-)-linalool alone or with cis-3-hexen-1-ol attracted significantly more males than did the pheromone alone. Combinations of the pheromone and plant volatiles were also tested in the greenhouse, along with four trap designs, namely InterceptTM Panel, hand-made screen sleeve, Plum Curculio and Lindgren funnel traps. The former two trap designs caught significantly more beetles than the latter two. \nSubsequently, field trapping experiments were conducted in China in the summers of 2007 with Intercept&#61652; panel traps hung on poplar trees and in 2008, with Intercept&#61652; panel traps hung on poplar trees, screen sleeve traps wrapped around poplar trunks, and Intercept&#61652; panel traps hung on bamboo polls 20 m away from host trees. Traps were baited with the A. glabripennis male-produced pheromone alone or in different combinations with plant volatiles. Traps baited with the male-produced pheromone alone caught significantly more females than control traps in both years. The addition of a mixture of (-)-linalool, cis-3-hexen-1-ol, linalool oxide, trans-caryophyllene and trans-pinocarveol to the pheromone significantly increased trap catches of virgin females. Screen sleeve traps baited with a combination of (-)-linalool and the pheromone caught the highest number of beetles overall in 2008, while traps placed on bamboo polls caught the lowest number. While the logistics for the most effective implementation of a trapping program using a mixture of the pheromone and plant volatiles require additional studies, these results indicate that this pheromone has considerable promise as a monitoring tool for A. glabripennis in the field. \nIn order for the results of this project to be effectively used in China and the U.S. for monitoring A. glabripennis populations, a participatory action research (PAR) program was designed to involve local communities, governmental agencies, academic institutions and the forest industry in monitoring efforts. The design includes a program steering committee, composed of members of all target groups, that will carry out diagnosis, prescription, and implementation of the project. Process and Impact evaluations will be conducted continuously during the program timeline of one year, starting in Fall 2009 and ending in fall 2010. Implementation, which involves setting up traps after determining best practices by the local groups, will be conducted during the beetle flight season in Summer 2010. Results of the trapping season will then be evaluated and documented for use in the following field seasons. Expected outcomes range from technical development of an effective protocol for monitoring to empowerment of local communities and farmer cooperatives that will benefit a large variety of Forestry-related activities.\nIn Summary, this thesis led to the discovery of promising lures and trap designs for the monitoring of A. glabripennis populations both in the U.S. and China. It also contributed to our knowledge about the role of male-produced pheromones in mate-finding in this species. The PAR program designed, if applied, should benefit all groups affected by this serious pest and fill the existing gap for effective monitoring strategies.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4075], "author_name_tesi": "Nehme, Maya E.", "last_name_ssi": "Nehme", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Maya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kelli Hoover", "Kelli Hoover", "Edwin George Rajotte", "Thomas Charles Baker", "Melody Ann Keena", "David P Baker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kelli Hoover, Dissertation Advisor", "Kelli Hoover, Committee Chair", "Edwin George Rajotte, Committee Chair", "Thomas Charles Baker, Committee Member", "Melody Ann Keena, Committee Member", "David P Baker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Asian longhorned beetle", "monitoring traps"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Museum Docents' Understanding of Interpretation\n", "id": "10438", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "42", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this qualitative research study was to explore docents\u2019 perceptions of their interpretive role in art museums and determine how those perceptions shape docents\u2019 practice.

Participants demonstrated the theory of constructivism on tours, but some interpretive techniques from the transmission model of learning, such as storytelling, were practiced. The unbounded nature of the content may explain some of the constructivist tendencies. The current model of nonformal education could be expanded.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [43], "author_name_tesi": "Neill, Amanda Crystal", "last_name_ssi": "Neill", "middle_name_ssi": "Crystal", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Ed Taylor", "Edward W Taylor", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Robin Veder", "George W Boudreau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Ed Taylor, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward W Taylor, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Member", "Robin Veder, Committee Member", "George W Boudreau, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hermeneutics", "interpretation", "docents", "museum", "symbolic interactionism"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Interference-Aware Resource Management in Multihop Wireless Networks\n", "id": "9226", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "428", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis is written with an attempt to address some of the challenges of resource allocation in multihop wireless mesh and ad hoc networks. The main focus of this thesis is on CDMA although some of the design issues considered are applicable to TDMA networks. A framework on implementation of different network design components is suggested including power control, routing and scheduling. Also, the deployment issues of each of these network components are investigated and suggestions are made on their design to address the problems involved. These suggestions include a new distributed power control algorithm that provides end-to-end QoS guarantee, an SINR-sensitive link metric for routing, and a hybrid centralized-decentralized scheduling scheme. We also consider a relaying incentivization mechanism in the context of mesh networks for Internet access when selfish but rational users are present.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [422], "author_name_tesi": "Neishaboori, Azin ", "last_name_ssi": "Neishaboori", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Azin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George Kesidis", "John F Doherty", "David Jonathan Miller", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Jun Shu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George Kesidis, Committee Chair", "John F Doherty, Committee Chair", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Member", "Jun Shu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["power control", "CDMA", "ad hoc networks", "mesh networks", "multihop", "wireless", "routing", "scheduling"]}]
