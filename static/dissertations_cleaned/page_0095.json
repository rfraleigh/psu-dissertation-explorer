Neglecting issues of larger communal interests, new planning policies have focused on providing individual homeowners with the right to build higher structures. These new planning policies depend on generic height restrictions to control building height in community spaces regardless of their varying shape, size, and orientation. One outcome of these regulations has been loss of minimum level of solar access in community spaces. This is particularly important since in Nepal solar access in community spaces is integral for the socio-cultural functioning of such public places. This thesis proposes the incorporation of solar access analysis in Nepal\u2019s building bylaws to control the height of buildings in community spaces. Such policy would ensure minimum level of solar access in community spaces, which in turn would support community activities and be beneficial to the entire community.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9335], "author_name_tesi": "Pradhananga, Moondeep ", "last_name_ssi": "Pradhananga", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Moondeep", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rebecca Lynn Henn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rebecca Lynn Henn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Historic city", "public space", "solar", "community", "planning policies"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Fathers\u2019 Parental Leave Use and Relationship Promotion in Fragile Families", "id": "13303bep157", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13303", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research consistently finds that fathers who take a significant amount of time off of work when their children are born are more engaged with their children relative to fathers who do not take  any time off of work and those who take short periods of time off.

Coaxial and tiltrotors are two promising candidates for future of high speed vertical flight. Some advantages of coaxial rotorcraft include efficient use of installed power, low structural weight, ground safety and higher aerodynamic efficiency due to the lower rotor. The blades can not be placed too close in a coaxial rotor as there would be a risk of two blades hitting each other while flapping. One solution to this problem is the use of Advanced Blade Concept (ABC), developed by Sikorsky which uses rigid, hingeless blades. Sikorsky\u2019s S-69 ABC demonstrator was an early example of this design.  However, in such blades, harmonic modes in the lag (in-plane) direction having inherent low aerodynamic damping, can become a concern. The blades being stiff at the root undergo small deflections at the root; therefore, traditional lag dampers are unable to produce adequate levels of damping. Therefore, new damping solutions are sought out for such hingeless blades. A promising approach for achieving a lightweight damping solution is the use of passive damping, engineered intrinsically into the blade structure. This can be achieved by using polymeric nanocomposite with the use of carbon nanotubes.\n\tThis study is focused on predicting the mechanical behavior of reinforced polymer/ carbon nanotube nanocomposite blades. Important mechanisms involve interfacial load transfer micromechanics, strain energy storage, and energy dissipation. The structural damping of the blade is characterized by the overall damping ratio. The developed multi-scale model takes in account different physical variables that relate to the nanotubes and their distribution within the blade. Variables such as the critical stress, which is needed to be reached for onset of damping for each of the nano-inclusions, aspect ratio, volume fraction, and the orientation of the inclusions are of primary interest. Damping predictions are discussed for different cases with varying parameters.\n\tThe micromechanics model used in the study, is an extension of available literature which can model discontinuous fiber reinforcements to capture the behavior of matrix/non-inclusion before the occurrence of interfacial slip. The frictional energy dissipation post slip initiation is assumed to be proportional to the interfacial shear force where slippage occurs. This is done in order to capture the physical nature of \u2018stick-slip\u2019 that the nanotubes undergo. Stick-slip behavior of the nanotubes comes from the reversible Van der Waals bond acting at the interface between the matrix and the nano-inclusion. \nThe model developed in this study is validated by comparing the predications with experimental measurements of loss factor and damping ratio from two different sources for a non-rotor case and a rotor case respectively. The model is able to capture the effect of rotation and consequently different rotational loads on the damping characteristic of the beam. \nThe validated model is used to calculate damping for the first lag bending mode when the beam is subjected to strain field representative of a hingeless rotor blade case. The study first looks at a case where the nano-inclusions are aligned with the direction of loading for the rotor blade. Parametric study is then conducted for the case. The model predicts maximum damping for low critical shear stress in combination with relatively low aspect ratios. The damping trend increases with increase in volume fraction of the nano-inclusions. Damping ratio of 7.3% was observed with the configured parameters for aligned CNTs. Further, non-aligned and randomly aligned nano-inclusions within the beam are modeled and the damping characteristics are obtained. Damping ratio of 8% was observed with the configured parameters for randomly oriented CNTs. Overall, the results suggest significant damping augmentation from the carbon-nanotubes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16076], "author_name_tesi": "Prakash, Keerti ", "last_name_ssi": "Prakash", "first_name_ssi": "Keerti", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Smith", "Charles E Bakis", "Amy Ruth Pritchett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Charles E Bakis, Thesis Advisor", "Amy Ruth Pritchett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanocomposite", "damping", "carbon nanotubes", "interfacial slip", "stick-slip", "randomly oriented", "rotor blade", "rotorcraft"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Control Oriented Modeling and State of Health Estimation for Lithium Ion Batteries", "id": "19316", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9306", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries are attracting signifi\fcant and growing interest due to their many applications, particularly in hybrid and electric vehicles. Their high energy and high power density render them an excellent option for energy storage in these vehicles. Sophisticated battery management systems (BMS) that ensure long battery life and efficient utilization are based on low order electrochemical models that can accurately capture the battery dynamics. This thesis develops reduced order, linear models of Li-ion batteries that can be used for model-based power\ntrain simulation, design, estimation, and control in hybrid and electric vehicles.\nFirst, a reduced order model is derived from the fundamental governing electrochemical charge and Li+ conservation equations, linearized at the operating state of charge and low current density. The equations are solved using analytical and numerical techniques to produce the transcendental impedance or transfer function from input current to output voltage. This model is then reduced to a low order\nstate space model using a system identifi\fcation technique based on least squares optimization. Given the prescribed current, the model predicts voltage and other variables such as electrolyte and electrode surface concentration distributions. A second model is developed by neglecting electrolyte diff\u000busion and modeling each electrode with a single active material particle. The transcendental particle transfer\nfunctions are discretized using a Pad\u0013e Approximation. The explicit form of the single particle model impedance can be realized by an equivalent circuit with resistances and capacitances related to the cell parameters. Both models are then tuned to match experimental EIS and pulse current-voltage data.\n  As Li-ion cells age, they experience power and energy fade associated with impedance rise and capacity loss, respectively. Identi\ffication of key aging parameters in lithium ion battery models can validate degradation hypotheses and provide a foundation for State of Health (SOH) estimation. This thesis develops and simplifies an electrochemical model that depends on three key aging parameters, cell resistance, solid phase diff\u000busion time and the capacity factor. Offline linear least squares processing of voltage and current data from fresh and aged NCM and LFP cells produce estimates of these aging parameters. An adaptive gradient based recursive estimator is also designed that can estimate these aging parameters onboard a vehicle in real time. The estimated parameters vary monotonically with age, consistent with accepted degradation mechanisms such as solid electrolyte\ninterface (SEI) layer growth and contact loss.\n  Finally, a control oriented degradation model is developed for LFP cells by incorporating the aging mechanism of SEI layer growth in the negative electrode with a nonlinear single particle model. This is the major degradation mechanism in LFP cells because the positive electrode does not appreciably age due to its extreme stability. The model predicts the experimentally measured capacity loss and increase in \ffilm resistance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9110], "author_name_tesi": "Prasad, Githin K", "last_name_ssi": "Prasad", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Githin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn", "Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Alok Sinha", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn, Dissertation Advisor", "Hosam Kadry Fathy, Committee Member", "Alok Sinha, Committee Member", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lithium ion batteries", "modeling", "state of health", "estimation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "race and place: investigating racial differences in the spatial patterning of mortality through social capital theory", "id": "19844", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9518", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This paper shows that health outcomes, measured by mortality, have distinct spatial patterning.

Floral scents, composed of a variety of volatile compounds, have been shown to mediate plant-pollinator interactions by attracting foraging species towards rewarding nectar sources.  Because of their volatile nature, however, floral scents will react readily with anthropogenic air pollutants, resulting in a continual degradation of plumes downwind of floral patches. In order to investigate this degradation, a three dimensional, stochastic Lagrangian diffusion model was developed to represent the turbulent dispersion and reaction of floral scent plumes within the turbulent atmospheric surface layer. Additionally, the potential impact on foraging insects was investigated by utilizing a random walk model in order to simulate search behavior, which was then incorporated into the dispersion model. Results indicate that search times could be significantly increased in polluted conditions due to considerable plume degradation and changes in the composition of the floral scent. Model results indicate that this ecological system is sensitive to changes in air quality, especially if species are unable to adapt. The ability to communicate with members of the hive and share knowledge of rewarding sources, however, has been shown to reduce the impacts of scent plume degradation. For solitary species, this added stress could have cascading impacts on the fitness of foraging species due to less time being devoted to other necessary tasks within the hive, and possible nectar shortages because of increased competition.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7102], "author_name_tesi": "Pratt, Kenneth Raymond", "last_name_ssi": "Pratt", "middle_name_ssi": "Raymond", "first_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Dolores Fuentes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Dolores Fuentes, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Floral scents", "turbulent dispersion", "pollution", "honey bee", "insect foraging"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "SOIL CARBON AND NITROGEN SATURATION IN CROP-PASTURE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS", "id": "14493mvp141", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14493", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Integrated crop-pasture systems can produce high grain yields without large inputs of external nitrogen (N). The extraction of N in grain and animal products, as well as gaseous, leaching and runoff losses should be offset by N fixation during the pasture phase of the integrated crop-pasture systems. The N would be timely delivered in moments of fast crop growth. The design of systems based on these intrinsic synergies offer a pathway for sustainable intensification of agriculture. In this dissertation, I propose that the carbon (C) and N cycling in crop-pasture rotations can be explained by soil C (Cs) saturation theory, and some degree of de-coupling of the C and N cycling. To this end, I developed hypotheses that integrate the concepts of C and N saturation. I tested these hypotheses by combing agroecosystem simulation models and soil incubations using stable isotopes tracing techniques. The systems modeled and the soils for incubations were obtained from long-term crop-pasture rotation experiments at the Instituto Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n Agropecuaria (INIA), Uruguay. Rotation systems that included perennial species showed greater N mineralization and immobilization when simulated with the Cycles agroecosystem model. Soil C stocks evolution and subsoil Cs distribution were more accurately simulated when the model included an algorithm for Cs saturation than when excluding it, indicating that this mechanism can explain Cs cycling. Soil sampling showed greater Cs saturation levels on the topsoil of systems including perennial species. The incubation of soils with residues enriched in 13C and 15N showed that Cs decomposition increased as Cs saturation increased, and Cs humification and N retention decreased. This accelerated turnover with increased Cs saturation underpins N supply in crop-pasture systems. Despite the link observed between Cs and N saturation mechanisms, some degree of decoupling was revealed by a decreasing C:N ratio of the retained or newly formed organic matter as Cs saturation increased. This lowering of the C:N ratio indicates higher N than C retention, buffering N losses in relatively Cs saturated soils. Overall, this dissertation supports soil C saturation theory and the implied reduction in the retention of C and acceleration of turnover as saturation increases, and suggests that C saturation is a fundamental pillar of the integrated crop-pasture systems function and sustainability.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16029], "author_name_tesi": "Pravia Nin, Maria Virginia", "last_name_ssi": "Pravia Nin", "middle_name_ssi": "Virginia", "first_name_ssi": "Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Armen Ricardo Kemanian", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian", "Douglas Brian Beegle", "Gregory Wayne Roth", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Marvin H Hall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Armen Ricardo Kemanian, Dissertation Advisor", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian, Committee Chair", "Douglas Brian Beegle, Committee Member", "Gregory Wayne Roth, Committee Member", "Jason Philip Kaye, Outside Member", "Marvin H Hall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["crop-livestock systems", "carbon saturation", "nitrogen saturation", "agroecosystem modeling", "soil organic matter", "crop rotations"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Determining Return-To-Play Predictors Following Non-Season Ending Injuries\n", "id": "8018", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2984", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An objective assessment tool to assist certified athletic trainers (ATCs) in return to play (RTP) decisions of non-season ending injuries is not well established. This creates challenges in the RTP decision making process for sports medicine practitioners. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to 1) identify what disablement and demographic variables that best predict RTP status; 2) establish a normative baseline value of the Disability in Physically Active (DPA) measure; 3) identify DPA components that athletes report most affected by injury; 4) determine if the DPA is a sensitive, objective assessment tool that can be incorporated into the RTP decision-making process; 5) estimate the DPA critical value at which athletes RTP. \nDesign and Setting: Data were gathered from NCAA athletes participating in five of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) universities. Participants were asked to complete the DPA. Participants who suffered from a non-season ending injury were asked to complete the DPA post-injury and returning to participation.   \nParticipants: A sample of 301 participants were included at baseline. An additional 278 participants from a previous study were included to assess normative baseline values.  Twenty-five participants were included in the post-injury and return to participation analysis.  \nMeasurements: Data from the DPA instrument and demographic variables as predictors of RTP were assessed by using multiple regression. Normative baseline values and DPA components most affected by injury were evaluated by comparing means. Sensitivity to change was assessed by calculating effect size (ES). Responsiveness was calculated by constructing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and determining a critical value at which athletes RTP. \nResults: Motion, muscular functioning, and skill performance (agility, balance, precision) accounted for 57.2% of variance in the number of days to RTP. The normative DPA baseline value was 6 points +/- 2. DPA components most affected by injury were pain, impaired motion, difficulty in sport participation, and difficulty performing the skills required for activity. The DPA demonstrated large effects from baseline to injury and injury to return-to-play. A critical value of 6.5 on the DPA was identified through ROC curve analysis for RTP, but overall the DPA score is a weak predictor of RTP (area under the curve = .675). \nConclusions: This study demonstrated that the DPA can detect disablement in the physically active population post-injury and upon returning to participation. In addition, the normative baseline value presents useful information for clinicians who use the DPA to measure disablement. Research should be completed on a larger sample to establish a more robust model of disablement predictors upon returning to participation.   \n\t\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2976], "author_name_tesi": "Preische, Jody ", "last_name_ssi": "Preische", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jody", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William E Buckley", "Dr Craig R Denegar", "Samuel William Monismith", "Dr Carol C Colbeck", "Dr Yvette Ingram"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William E Buckley, Committee Chair", "Dr Craig R Denegar, Committee Member", "Samuel William Monismith, Committee Member", "Dr Carol C Colbeck, Committee Member", "Dr Yvette Ingram, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["disablement theories", "outcomes assessment tool", "DPA", "return-to-play predictors", "disablement", "impairments", "functional limitations"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "QUALIFICATION OF AIRFOIL TRANSITION MEASUREMENTS TAKEN IN THE PENN STATE LOW-SPEED, LOW-TURBULENCE WIND TUNNEL\n", "id": "12412", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "433", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the wind-tunnel testing of laminar flow airfoils, it is generally considered that the turbulence intensity of the facility must be less than 0.08 percent to obtain aerodynamic performance measurements that are representative of those obtained in flight.

Wind-tunnel turbulence intensity provides an estimate of the amplitudes of freestream disturbances in the flow.

Further the potential intergenerational transmission of educational aspirations was explored separately by level of maternal educational attainment at the child\u2019s birth as demographic trends suggest greater increases in youth aspirations have occurred for children born to less educated women. Findings indicate that higher maternal aspirations for children predict the high educational aspirations of their offspring above and beyond youth and parental characteristics.

Specifically, among a sample of youth with the highest educated mothers, maternal aspirations for children and women\u2019s aspirations during adolescence predicted her offspring\u2019s aspiration to attain a Bachelor\u2019s degree or more.\nThe second study explored whether multiple measures of educational aspirations relate to youth educational attainment and whether these relationships vary by youth race/ethnicity in a sample of 1,191 mothers and their 1,660 children. In addition, the study explored whether youth engagement (i.e. hours spent on homework a week) and disengagement (i.e. truancy) mediated the associated between educational aspirations and the likelihood youth earned their high school credentials on time. Findings indicate that youth and maternal educational aspirations for her child were associated with increases in the odds that youth would earn their high school credentials on time, enroll in college and earn a Bachelor\u2019s degree or more. While maternal and youth aspirations were significant predictors of the educational attainment of white youth, youth aspirations were primarily predictive of the educational attainment of black and Hispanic youth. Further, analyses revealed that neither the time youth spend on homework nor their reports of truancy in high school mediate the associations between measures of educational aspirations and the timeliness of their high school credential attainment for all race/ethnicities. \nTaken together, findings from this dissertation suggest that the educational aspirations women have for their children are important determinants for the aspirations their offspring will have as adolescents. Further, both maternal and youth educational aspirations are important predictors of later youth educational attainment, and when explored by maternal educational attainment and race/ethnicity more similarities than differences occur. In sum, this dissertation suggests that theories of racial and ethnic deficits, or group supported counter-cultural norms, should be put to rest as positive generational shifts have occurred increasing the educational aspirations of all youth. Future interventions and education policies should focus on increasing familial and youth information about higher education through resources and assistance to increase the educational attainment of all youth. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9528], "author_name_tesi": "Pressler, Emily ", "last_name_ssi": "Pressler", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott David Gest", "Daphne Hernandez", "Eric Loken", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott David Gest, Dissertation Advisor", "Daphne Hernandez, Committee Chair", "Eric Loken, Committee Member", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Intergenerational", "Transmissions", "Aspirations", "Attainment"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Effects of Contextual Color on Recall: Border Color as a Lesson and Posttest Cue for Factual and Conceptual Information Presented in Computer-based Instruction", "id": "6100", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2038", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This investigation examined the effects of contextual border colors on recall of the to-be-remembered information, when border colors were displayed on-screen during a computer-based instruction module.  The encoding specificity principle (Tulving & Thomson, 1973) posits that contextual cues can only be useful during the posttest if they have first been encoded during the lesson.  It was hypothesized that color (a context cue) would enhance recall when present in both the lesson and the posttest.  Conversely, it was predicted that color would inhibit recall when the color hues in the posttest were intentionally mismatched with those in the lesson.  It was also predicted that color effects would differ by gender, item type, and item difficulty.  To examine the effects of border colors, a posttest-only control group design was used, with lesson condition and posttest condition as the crossed independent variables, with gender as an additional between-groups independent variable, and with two repeated measures: item type and item difficulty.  The dependent variable was cued recall measured with fill-in-the-blank posttest items.  An additional outside control group was also used to control for color motivational effects.\n\nParticipants were 196 undergraduate students randomly assigned to five treatment groups.  Participants read four passages, completed a posttest, read another four passages, and completed a second posttest.  The order of reading passages was crossed to offset sequence effects.  Depending on the treatment condition, participants saw color-coded border colors in both the lesson and the posttest, no border colors in either, border colors in the lesson and not the posttest, and vice-versa.  A fifth group, an additional outside control group, saw border color hues in the posttest that were intentionally mismatched with those seen in the reading passages.  \n\nThe results do not support the hypothesis that color needs to be encoded during the lesson in order to enhance retrieval, contrary to encoding specificity.  The presence of border colors in the lesson had positive, non-significant effects on recall of factual and conceptual knowledge, as measured by a difficult fill-in-the-blank posttest.  However, the presence of border colors in the posttest varied significantly by item type, item difficulty, and gender.  Recall of easy factual knowledge cued with verbatim posttest items was significantly higher when border colors were present in the posttest, whether or not border colors were present in the lesson.  For males, the presence of border colors in the posttest significantly enhanced recall of the to-be-remembered information.  For females, the presence of border colors in the posttest inhibited recall, though this negative effect did not consistently reach significance.

The details of this adaptation are still being explored, including elucidation of the genes involved. The main focus of this research was to further explore gene-environment interactions relative to bone adaptation.  Increasing our understanding of these interactions may someday enable more individualized interventions that consider a person\u2019s genotype when treating bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Adult female mice from two different inbred mouse strains with known differences in skeletal phenotypes, C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2), were exposed to two different regimens of mechanical loading: an aerobic based exercise intervention, treadmill running, and a more resistance based intervention, tower climbing. Ninety mice from both strains were equally divided into running, climbing and non-exercised groups. After five weeks of intervention, the mice were killed and the tissues were harvested from each mouse. \nMorphological parameters of the right femur from each mouse were measured and the bones were scanned using micro-computed tomography in order to evaluate the cross-sectional geometry of the mid-shaft.  Mechanical properties of the femoral diaphysis were then assessed via three-point bending and the femoral neck was broken in a shear test. Differences were found as a function of treatment and genetic strain providing further evidence that bone adaptation in response to physiologically plausible interventions is dependent on genetic architecture.\nTotal RNA from the gastrocnemius and from within the femoral diaphysis was extracted and gene expression was examined using Affymetrix microarrays for each strain and treatment group. Bone related genes were differentially expressed across the two mouse strains and some of these genes co-located with previously identified Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) related to bone architecture and strength. Interestingly, a gene known to play a role in the regulation of the response of bone to mechanical loading had greater expression in tower climbers relative to the controls. \nCage activity, body weight, and food consumption were repeatedly measured during the intervention and hindlimb muscle weights were measured during dissections of the mice. The results indicated differences in activity levels relative to genetic strain. Treadmill running was also shown to have an impact on normal home-cage activity. Treatment and genetic strain effects on body weight and food consumption were found as well. Muscle mass was affected by genetic strain, but treatment did not have an effect. These results provide valuable data for better interpretation of experimental manipulations exploring the influence of genetic strain and exercise on bone adaptation.\n\tBone adaptation is a complex system that is strongly impacted by environmental demand and the genetics involved. Therefore, the gene-environment interaction is an important consideration when studying bone adaptation. There are also many indirect influences on bone such as muscle force that play a significant role.  Understanding the response of bone to methods of enhanced mechanical loading via exercise and the role genes play is of significant value, as is gaining a greater understanding of known confounders.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2216], "author_name_tesi": "Preston, Holly ", "last_name_ssi": "Preston", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Holly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil Sharkey", "Teresa Caroldean Lang", "Neil Sharkey", "Robert Barry Eckhardt", "Douglas Cavener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neil Sharkey, Dissertation Advisor", "Teresa Caroldean Lang, Committee Chair", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Chair", "Robert Barry Eckhardt, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["exercise", "bone", "muscle", "inbred mice", "genetics", "biomechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATING MINORITY STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN AN AUTHENTIC SCIENCE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE  \n", "id": "9530", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5550", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the United States, a problem previously overlooked in increasing the total number of scientifically literate citizens is the lack of diversity in advanced science classes and in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Groups traditionally underserved in science education and thus underrepresented in the STEM fields include: low-income, racial/ethnic minorities, and females of all ethnic and racial backgrounds. Despite the number of these students who are initially interested in science very few of them thrive in the discipline. Some scholars suggest that the declining interest for students underrepresented in science is traceable to K-12th grade learning experiences and access to participating in authentic science. Consequently, the diminishing interest of minorities and women in science contributes negatively to the representation of these groups in the STEM disciplines. \nThe purpose of this study was to investigate a summer science research experience for minority students and the nature of students\u2019 participation in scientific discourse and practices within the context of the research experience. The research questions that guided this study are:  \nThe nature of the Summer Experience in Earth and Mineral Science (SEEMS) research experience\nA. What are the SEEMS intended outcomes? \nB. To what extent does SEEMS enacted curriculum align with the intended outcomes of the program?\n\nThe nature of students engagement in the SEEMS research\nA. In what ways do students make sense of and apply science concepts as they engage in the research (e.g., understand problem, how they interpret data, how they construct explanations), and the extent to which they use the science content appropriately? \nB. In what ways do students engage in the cultural practices of science, such as using scientific discourse, interpreting inscriptions, and constructing explanations from evidence (engaging in science practices, knowing science and doing science)?\n\nThe following data sources were used in this study: SEEMS curriculum and documentation, interviews with program staff and participants, TRIO program documentation, Upward Bound Math Science (UBMS) promotional material, and audio/video recordings and field notes of students\u2019 daily interactions in the research setting.  Findings revealed that students who participated in the research experience were able to successfully engage in some cultural practices of science, such as using inscriptions, constructing explanations, and collecting data.  Analysis and observations of their engagement demonstrated a need for programs similar to SEEMS to focus on: (1) understanding how students make sense of science as they engage in the cultural practices, and (2) incorporating aspects of students\u2019 culture and social practices into the experience.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5541], "author_name_tesi": "Preston, Stephanie Danette", "last_name_ssi": "Preston", "middle_name_ssi": "Danette", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carla Zembal Saul", "Carla Zembal Saul", "Gregory John Kelly", "Dr Scott Mc Donald", "John Daniel Marshall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carla Zembal Saul, Dissertation Advisor", "Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Chair", "Gregory John Kelly, Committee Chair", "Dr Scott Mc Donald, Committee Member", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["learning as cultural practice", "underrepresented groups in science", "discourse in science", "authentic science research experience", "authentic practice", "sociocultural perspective in science"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "A Microsimulation Model Of Activity Patterns and Within Household Interactions", "id": "6239", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4836", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Activity-based approaches to travel demand analysis have gained increasing attention over the past decades.

This thesis is broken into two parts, the first being focused primarily on a novel planar concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) architecture, while the second component is dedicated to understanding the physics of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) operating at high brightness, and methods of enhancing their stability and commercial viability.  The common theme tying these seemingly disparate fields together is the goal of designing and implementing technologically, environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable technologies to allow for better use of the energy that we produce and consume.\n\nThe primary contributions of the work herein are as follows.  First, we demonstrate that planar CPV is capable of outperforming traditional flat-plate silicon PV on a performance basis.  Second, we establish a facile approach to understanding efficiency roll-off OLEDs and LEDs by repackaging standard light-current-voltage (LIV) data into a series of easy-to-interpret plots.  Third, we illustrate a method of converting organic electronics from 2D to 3D structures using kirigami, thereby opening a route to high aspect ratio, high performance OLEDs in novel form factors.  Finally, we establish a route of coevaporating amorphous fluoropolymers with organic semiconductors to enable a significant increase in operational temperatures with little change in the optoelectronic characteristics of functional devices.\n\nWe begin with a broad survey of the state of the global energy landscape, and suggest that low-cost solar power generated via CPV may be part of the solution to the world's future energy woes.  The design principles and fundamental limits of a catadioptric planar microtracking CPV architecture are explored, and we find that in a sunny location like Phoenix, AZ, such a system would be capable of producing 1.7x more energy annually than a traditional flat-panel Si PV module.  This work culminates in a fully automated CPV system <2 cm thick that operates at fixed tilt with a microscale triple-junction solar cell at >660x concentration ratio over a 140 degree field of view.  In outdoor testing over the course of two sunny days, the system operated from sunrise to sunset, reached a peak power conversion efficiency exceeding 30%, and ultimately outperformed a commercial silicon solar cell on an energy per unit area basis, which points towards the feasibility of CPV as a possible alternative to silicon-based PV. \n\nThe second portion of this thesis provides a brief introduction the device physics of OLEDs as well as an overview of display and lighting applications.  We develop and test an AC harmonic light and current based analytical framework to better understand OLED efficiency roll-off, and subsequently extend this technique to light emitting diodes with inorganic emitters.  Various approaches are taken to bring OLEDs from a two-dimensional form-factor into the third dimension, which results in OLEDs with an increased brightness on a per-area basis as well as novel geometries and shapes.  Finally, we endeavor to increase the morphological stability of OLEDs by co-evaporating an amorphous fluoropolymer into their transport layers, which results in improved current-voltage characteristics, addition to a >60 degreeC boost in device operating temperature.  When taken together, these results all indicate that a range of simple solutions exist to vastly improve the performance of OLEDs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16467], "author_name_tesi": "Price, Jared Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Price", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Jared", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Noel Christopher Giebink", "Noel Christopher Giebink", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Jian Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Noel Christopher Giebink, Dissertation Advisor", "Noel Christopher Giebink, Committee Chair", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["OLED", "LED", "CPV", "Photovoltaics"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Mechanistic Dissection of Taurine Alpha-Ketoglutarate Dioxygenase (TauD): A Model Alpha-Ketoglutarate Dioxygenase\n", "id": "6775", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2597", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-09-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThe oxidizing power of oxygen is the basis for the function of the respiratory cycle and is used in many biosynthetic processes.

Stream biofilms appear to play important roles in P assimilation thus representing a valuable transformation of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems.  However, little work has identified parameters explaining variation in uptake rates, evaluated the effect of common disturbance techniques, addressed how increasing P-loads affect assimilative abilities, or estimated the influence of initial assimilatory processes on biofilm P dynamics.  Therefore, there were four central approaches (chapters) to this dissertation: 1) perform an assessment of peer-reviewed literature reporting aquatic microbial P-uptake rates, 2) evaluate the effect of physical disturbance techniques commonly used in benthic biofilm metabolic studies, 3) measure P-uptake rates for benthic biofilms along an experimental and natural nutrient gradient, and 4) evaluate spatio-temporal P fluxes in biofilms.  Regarding the first research approach, several ecological/experimental parameters were found significant in describing and explaining observed variation in published aquatic P-uptake rates: microbial group (benthic, planktonic), source (culture, wild), and sample time (long, short).  This underscored the varied nature of microbial assimilatory kinetics and provided a quantitative synthesis of uptake rates thereby advancing nutrient dynamic models.  The second chapter showed that common biofilm sampling techniques (physical disturbance) caused no differential effects on kinetic parameter estimates (t= 0.69, p= 0.492, df= 33), lending credence to numerous metabolic studies on benthic microbes post-abrasion and highlighting the potential for microbial uptake following scouring events.  The third chapter identified the occurrence of P saturation in some stream biofilms and quantified its effect on the uptake of new P additions, and further concluded that nitrogen was a synergistic nutrient for resident benthic biofilms, particularly in streams of higher productivity (P legacy effect).  Lastly, the fourth chapter demonstrated rapid P exchange processes occurring at early time periods (i.e., \u2264 5 minutes), the magnitude of which seems to diminish over longer periods (i.e., 15 - 30 minutes), further suggesting that experimental time periods scaled to hours or longer obscure such fundamental short-term responses.

The project begins from the premise that the (well-documented) production of social space and the (oft-disregarded) production of narrative space are not so much separable events as complementary forces of historical-cultural production. It argues that literary geographies can best be read using terms and methods that narrative theorists have commonly reserved for other formal structures. This narratology of space reveals that novelistic geographies operate like character systems\u2014that is, as hybrids of real and fictional, structural and referential significance, in a differential network of major and minor nodes. Building on recent work by literary critics and on philosophies of spatial and literary production, Of Minor Spaces demonstrates that settings signify in diverse, dynamic, and, most importantly, definable ways. The project thus extends the \u201cspatial turn\u201d shaping contemporary scholarship into the world and work of fiction itself: it urges us to recognize narrative as, among other things, a set of spatializing practices that can help to reorient the spatial practices of quotidian social life.\nOf Minor Spaces offers more than a formalist methodology. By applying these terms and devices to examples of Victorian and modernist fiction, the project outlines a history of spatial ideologies. Reading novels through a spatial perspective, each chapter maps literary terrains in ways designed to challenge the tidiness of existing narratives of spatial production\u2014and of extant divisions between realist and modernist aesthetics. Chapter One takes mid-Victorian geographic discourses (medical mapping, economic theory) as its vantage onto the geography of Charles Dickens\u2019s Little Dorrit, revealing not only how the narrative landscape negotiates modern abstraction, but also how that negotiation illuminates the dynamics of expansion and intensification under credit capital. Chapter Two relates Victorian sensation fiction\u2019s interrogations of interiority, transgression, and compartmentalization to contemporary concerns over normative domesticity and architectural revivalism. Chapter Three examines Thomas Hardy\u2019s A Laodicean in the context of the queer spatial relations permeating late-Victorian culture, from non-Euclidean geometries to non-normative desires.

The investigator used a qualitative research design and selected case study as the method of investigation. To comply with the 1999 National Education Reform Act of Thailand and as a preparation for transferring power to the new school board, this case study investigated all 15 school board members who were selected by the school administration at a large private K-12 Catholic school in Bangkok, Thailand. The individual interviews were conducted in the fall semester of 2002. \nUsing Senge\u2019s (1994) causal-loop model of cause-and-effect relationship and Haines\u2019 (2000) five critical phases of systems thinking as a framework, the study addressed four related issues: (1) What characteristics of \u201csystems thinking\u201d do school leaders exhibit when faced with school-related problems and issues? (2) What characteristics of \u201csystems thinking\u201d do school leaders exhibit when faced with problems and issues from other (nonschool) domains? (3) What characteristics of \u201csystems thinking\u201d do the school leaders employ/use as a means to affect change in the school? (4) What views do the school leaders express about the importance of \u201csystems thinking\u201d in improving schools (or their own areas of expertise)? \nThe results of the research indicated that the school leaders exhibited and identified different types of characteristics of systems thinking\u2014holism, cause-effect relationships, feedback, and external environment\u2014when faced with issues from both inside the school domains and from other nonrelated school domains. The research further showed that the school leaders perceived the meaning and the characteristics of systems thinking and later suggested appropriate means to improve the school and its educational system by applying systems thinking.

Traditionally, the key to creating a sweet wine has been to stop fermentation before the yeast consumes all the grapes\u2019 sugars.  However, alternative practices have been adopted to better meet market demand for these products.  Back-sweetening has become a common practice in which a sweetener is added to wine after fermentation is complete, creating a sweet, high alcohol wine.  However, because there is limited information available about back-sweetening, many wineries may be making uninformed decisions about their back-sweetening practices.  The goals of this thesis were to investigate the dose response functions for sucrose on perceived sweetness in wine and to determine the difference thresholds, as well as the Weber Ratios of sucrose, when back-sweetening white and red table wines with varying acidity levels.  While sucrose is traditionally used to back-sweeten wine, there is a growing demand for sweet wines for calorie conscious consumers.  Thus, a secondary goal was to determine the dose response functions for aspartame on perceived sweetness, as well as the difference thresholds and Weber Ratios of aspartame while back-sweetening a neutral white and red wine without high acidity.  Practically, the data collected indicates winemakers have substantial latitude in reducing the amount of sucrose they add to back-sweeten wines before consumers will notice, greater than 20%.  In addition, data collected shows similar results using aspartame to back-sweeten wine and practically that significant changes would need to be made for consumers to perceive a difference in sweetness.  Finally, data supports the assertion that simple water based model systems do not always generalize to complex beverages.

The first study identifies risk factors for both diagnosed and self-reported alcoholism; the second study identifies factors associated with alcohol treatment utilization and produces annual cost estimates for alcohol treatment; the third study determines whether treatment reduces, or offsets, total health care expenditures. \n\n\nThe purpose of the first study was to triangulate between two large (n=10,000+), nationally representative data sources to determine the risk factors for both diagnosed and self-reported alcoholism. Claims data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey are used to examine individuals with diagnosed alcoholism and survey responses to the CAGE questions in the Health and Retirement Study are used to examine individuals with self-reported alcoholism. Chi-squares are used to test for differences in the risk factors, and multivariate logistic regression models are estimated to determine their relative importance.  \n\n\nThe results of this study suggest that there is a substantial disparity between the prevalence of diagnosed and self-reported alcoholism (1.87% versus 4.31% respectively). Chi-square tests revealed significant differences in alcoholism by age, gender, race, ethnicity, income, education, marital status, depression, health status, ability to drive, region, rural/urban residence, household composition and religiosity. Logistic regression results suggest that older men and individuals living in the Midwest may be at particularly high risk for not being diagnosed, and denial may be problematic for other groups, especially those with high incomes and those age 75 and older. \n\n\nThe purpose of the second study was to examine the factors associated with alcohol treatment use among a sample of 390 elderly Medicare beneficiaries already diagnosed with alcoholism and to produce national cost estimates for alcohol treatment. Claims data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey are used in conjunction with the Area Resource File and the Uniform Facility Data Set to examine predisposing, enabling, need, and health care system-level factors influencing treatment. I employ a two-part model, using logistic regression to examine the factors associated with treatment and generalized gamma regression to estimate treatment costs in the 12 months following diagnosis.\n\n\nThe results of study two suggest that about half (52.6%) of elderly individuals diagnosed with alcoholism receive any treatment for alcoholism, and certain groups of diagnosed elderly may be at high risk of under-treatment. The use of alcohol treatment may be related to predisposing factors, such as age, race, education, and marital status; enabling factors, such household composition, income, and insurance; need factors, such as co-morbidities; and health care system factors, such as the supply of alcohol treatment facilities. In addition, treatment may be more expensive and less accessible in rural areas. Predicted costs of alcoholism treatment for individuals diagnosed with alcoholism and with treatment costs greater than zero are $9,714.16 per year. Results of the study particularly highlight the need for targeted interventions to increase treatment seeking among those already diagnosed with alcoholism.\n\n\nThe purpose of the third study was to test the cost-offset hypothesis, (a phenomenon where treatment of alcohol problems reduces the use of medical and psychiatric services), in a national sample of elderly Medicare beneficiaries (n=608).  Five years of claims data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey are used in conjunction with the Area Resource File and the Uniform Facility Data Set to evaluate changes in average monthly health care costs associated with alcoholism treatment. Two distinct methodological approaches, propensity scoring and difference-in-differences, are used to estimate treatment effects. I estimate expenditures using a generalized linear model (GLM) with a gamma distribution and log link after adjusting for predisposing, enabling, need and health system factors. The generalized estimating equation method was used to account for correlated data in the difference-in-difference models. \n\n\nThe results of the two analyses provide some support for the cost offset of alcoholism treatment (e.g., treatment is negatively associated with total health care costs). Compared to those who did not receive treatment, we would expect post-treatment health care expenditures of treated individuals to be 20 to 26 percent lower per month. This implies that treatment may reduce the need for later medical hospitalizations caused by the complications of alcohol abuse or dependence. Although insufficient power likely limited my ability to detect significant differences, the results of this study are encouraging and warrant further study of larger samples of treated and untreated elderly diagnosed with alcoholism over longer periods of time. \n\n\nIn sum, this investigation addresses a significant gap in the health services literature on elderly persons with alcohol problems. Based on demographic projections and alcohol use trends indicating that Baby Boomers have heavier drinking habits than previous generations of older adults, the absolute number of elderly with alcoholism is expected to rise. Therefore, now is the time for policymakers to create access to services and determine how the nation will care for older adults with alcohol problems. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3653], "author_name_tesi": "Pringle, Kristine Elmendorf", "last_name_ssi": "Pringle", "middle_name_ssi": "Elmendorf", "first_name_ssi": "Kristine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis G Shea", "Pamela Farley Short", "Rebecca Wells", "Frank Martin Ahern", "Steven Howard Zarit"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis G Shea, Committee Chair", "Pamela Farley Short, Committee Member", "Rebecca Wells, Committee Member", "Frank Martin Ahern, Committee Member", "Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["elderly", "alcoholism", "alcohol treatment", "cost-offset"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "MULTI-UUV COOPERATIVE SEARCH FOR TIME-CONSTRAINED MCM RECONNAISSANCE\n\n\n", "id": "10030", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5153", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Naval mine counter-measures (MCM) are a focal priority of defense technology, due to the increasingly asymmetric form of underwater hazards to the operation and passage of naval ships.  A major element of the MCM mission is reconnaissance, in which hazards are distinguished from clear space, identified and classified.  Underwater unmanned vehicles (UUV) are the most important component of MCM operation, due to their low cost and the robustness compared to manually executed missions, as well as their ability to collect and process data in parallel to compile data and quickly neutralize threats.  Communication among UUVs allows them to work cooperatively to assist each other in choosing the paths and actions most conducive to mission success.  This work addresses several problems related to cooperative UUV search, including time-constrained search optimization, ideal communication strategies, cooperation among heterogeneous vehicles, and use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to enhance connectivity in a UUV network and distribute UUVs to increase MCM mission efficiency.\nIn the first study, an algorithm is presented that optimizes a time-constrained multi-UUV search by directing each UUV to choose its immediate search task to maximize the information obtained about its environment.  Several communication strategies are presented that demonstrate the trade-off between the amount of bandwidth and power consumed by communication among UUVs and the level of cooperation achieved in the UUV mission, as well as the subsequent effect on MCM mission performance.  Another study describes the motivation for using UUVs of different classes, optimized for different search tasks and topologies, and defines an algorithm for cooperation between two types of vehicles, demonstrating that adding vehicles of one class increase the efficacy of the other\u2019s actions.  The last study introduces the use of a hybrid team of UAVs and UUVs, presenting an algorithm that utilizes the UAVs to expand the communication range of the UUVs and allocate UUVs to interesting search regions to optimize the results of the MCM mission.\nFinally, several potential expansions of this work are presented for future study.  Specifically, some short-term goals are presented, including implementing a turning penalty and modeling acoustic transmitters and information priority in vehicle update, as well as long-term goals, including the addition of a localized control-based algorithm, mine placement pattern recognition, and translation to anti-submarine warfare (ASW).\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5125], "author_name_tesi": "Prins, Ryan Daniel", "last_name_ssi": "Prins", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniel", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Thesis Advisor", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["MCM Reconnaissance", "Unmanned Underwater Vehicles", "Mine Counter-measures", "Time-Constrained"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Ultraviolet Observations Of Core-collapse Supernovae", "id": "22666", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10394", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ultraviolet observations of Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe) have traditionally lagged behind observations in the optical and near-infrared.

We begin with the examination of an extraordinary Type IIn supernova SN 2007pk, which was at the time the earliest observed Type IIn SNe in the UV, and characterize the explosion properties while examining how the early observed UV emission compares with other observed CCSNe at early times. Building upon this we assemble the largest sample of CCSNe in the UV and examine the UV and bolometric characteristics of CCSNe by subtype. Using these bolometric light curves we go on to calculate empirically based bolometric corrections and UV-flux corrections for use by observers when observing filters are limited or UV observations are unable to be obtained. We improve upon this by identifying a small subsample of Type II Plateau SNe which have simultaneous ground based optical - near infrared data, and improve our bolometric light curve calculation method to more accurately determine bolometric light curve, corrections and UV corrections.

Palatable foods, commonly high in fat and sugar content, can engage the reward system and increase motivation to procure and consume such foods, independent of caloric need or nutritional value.  Excessive consumption of highly palatable foods is believed to be a key environmental factor in obesity rates.  Of major concern are the complex and long-lasting changes to various neural systems following obesity.  Among these include changes to mesolimbic dopamine signaling along the central reward pathway; altered dopamine signaling has been linked with both a genetic predisposition for obesity and dietary induced obesity.  \nRecently, more attention has been given to alterations in the gut-brain system that occur with obesity, such as notable differences in the incretin hormone glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1).  Interestingly, obesity-induced GLP-1 deficits appear to be reversed following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, and changes to GLP-1 and similar peptides have been theorized as critical factors in the success of this surgical procedure. While GLP-1 has been clearly defined as both an incretin and a satiety hormone, less is known about the influence of GLP-1 on systems driving hedonic intake and food reward. Furthermore, the debate continues as to the role of GLP-1 in obesity, and its precise impact in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.  \nTo investigate the role of GLP-1 on the dopamine reward system, and how GLP-1 is influenced in obesity, we investigated how temporarily altering the dopamine and GLP-1 systems of lean and dietary induced obese (DIO) rats influenced hedonic intake of palatable solutions using the synthetic GLP-1 agonist Exendin-4 and receptor specific dopamine antagonists. Peripherally administered dopamine antagonists led to significant reductions in the intake of palatable carbohydrates, with notable differences between the two dietary obese groups despite similar body weight gain; one group was fed a high fat-high energy diet and one fed a fat-carbohydrate high energy combination diet. Furthermore, these differences were dependent upon the receptor subtype targeted, with D1 receptor antagonism producing more potent reductions than D2 receptor antagonism, and upon the type of carbohydrate, with sucrose intake more susceptible to dopamine antagonism than fructose intake. These data indicate dopamine signals do change in obesity, and the type of diet leading to obesity can influence the extent and perhaps nature of such changes. This data implies that differential responses may occur to different palatable foods, and indicates why individuals may respond to different treatment regimens with various success rates. \nUsing an identical animal model of two DIO groups, we again compared responses to sucrose and fructose in chow-fed lean and DIO rats after activation of the GLP-1 receptor by the synthetic analog Exendin-4. Exendin-4 (ip) reduced both sucrose and fructose intake, and the magnitude of the effect varied with respect to the obesogenic diet and the type of carbohydrate being tested.  As in the dopamine receptor inhibition tests, all groups reduced sucrose intake following treatment, but the reduction in carbohydrate intake, particularly to fructose, was attenuated in animals made obese on the high-fat compared to the fat-carbohydrate combination diet. \nUpon establishing similar effects to dopamine receptor antagonism and GLP-1 receptor activation peripherally, we then explored the central GLP-1 system, localizing the effects of GLP-1 on both hedonic intake and food-reward. After establishing a role for GLP-1 within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) using behavioral methods, we then examined the anatomical and neural relationship between GLP-1 and the dopamine system using immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology.  Our findings are the first to directly demonstrate that GLP-1 in the VTA is not only behaviorally important, altering both hedonic intake and the motivation to procure sucrose, but may also have powerful influence on the dopaminergic system through the presence of GLP-1 receptors throughout the VTA. GLP-1 receptors were not only found on VTA dopaminergic neurons, but microiontophoretic application of GLP-1 directly upon dopamine neurons also resulted in significantly altered firing. These novel findings represent a powerful new potential role for GLP-1 in the control of intake unrelated to hunger.\nFinally, using an animal model of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, we investigated whether differences would occur between surgical subjects and their dietary obese Sham-operated counterparts in their willingness to work for a sucrose reward, and how GLP-1 receptor activation changed operant responses. When administered peripherally, the long-lasting GLP-1 agonist Exendin-4 did not alter behaviors. When applied centrally, Exendin-4 attenuated the willingness of GBS and Sham rats to work for and consume a sucrose reward, and the GLP-1 receptor antagonist Exendin-9 blocked this effect. Furthermore, when looking at levels of GLP-1 receptor mRNA within the midbrain in our surgical and sham cohorts compared to na\u00efve chow-fed lean controls, we found when comparing Roux-en-Y and Sham animals to our chow controls, the surgical procedure seemed to return receptor levels to a state more congruent with that observed in lean controls.  \nTaken together, these data clearly demonstrate a role for GLP-1 in the control of intake related to palatable, hedonic foods. We described how activation of the peripheral GLP-1 system influences hedonic intake of palatable carbohydrates in a manner similar to blocking peripheral dopamine signaling.  Furthermore, we found that central GLP-1 may play a particularly important role in the seeking and consumption of highly palatable foods by acting directly on the mesolimbic dopamine system.

The biological function of a given RNA often depends on the formation of a distinctive tertiary structure.  The formation of tertiary structure typically develops in a hierarchical fashion using a variety of aromatic stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions, or secondary structural motifs, as building blocks.  In addition to the role of secondary structure in RNA function and interaction in vivo, the thermodynamic stability of secondary structural motifs is critical for tertiary structure formation.  This thesis describes fundamental studies of the molecular basis for thermodynamic stability in RNA secondary structure.\n\nHairpins are the dominant secondary structure in RNA, and are known to function in nucleating RNA folding, RNA-RNA tertiary interactions, and RNA-protein interactions.  The stability and structure of RNA tetraloop hairpins have been studied extensively, with thermodynamic and phylogenetic studies revealing that the majority of conserved tetraloop-closing base pair combinations are exceptionally stable.  This suggests that thermodynamically stable RNA secondary structures may serve important biological roles.  A family of sequences having the motif YNMG (Y = C or U; N = A, C, G, or U; M = A or C) was isolated from a combinatorial library of 4096 sequences using in vitro selection in combination with temperature gradient gel electrophoresis.  Thermodynamic analysis of YNMG and variant tetraloops confirmed optimal stability with Y at tetraloop position 1 and M at position 3.  Similarity in structure and stability among YNMG hairpins was further supported by deoxyribose substitution, CD, and NMR experiments.  Taken together, these results support the existence of a family of UNCG-like tetraloops with the motif YNMG that are thermodynamically stable and structurally similar.\n\nStructural similarity among hairpin tetraloops having the motif YNMG has been independently verified by determination of the solution structures of the CACG, CCCG, and UCAGU tetraloops in other research laboratories.  Moreover, an electrostatic origin for the importance of the closing base pair in imparting thermodynamic stability was determined in the context of these structures.  Finally, phylogenetic and structural data suggested that YNAG tetraloops in particular have enhanced flexibility, which allows tertiary interactions to be maintained in the context of diverse loop sequences and illustrates the relationship between thermodynamic stability and loop flexibility.\n\nNative, functional RNA secondary and tertiary structure develops from a random ensemble of states through discrete folding pathways, or mechanisms.  For nucleic acids, the simplicity of rules governing the interaction of bases leads to structural promiscuity, where a given sequence adopts several non-native folded conformations, or misfolds.  Misfolding occurs most frequently at the level of secondary structure.  In an effort to reduce the conformational heterogeneity commonly experienced by RNA, the modified nucleobase 8-bromoguanosine (8BrG) was introduced into oligonucleotides having the hairpin motif YNMG.  Purine (=R) nucleotides with Br substituted for R H8 are known to preferentially adopt the syn conformation as nucleosides.  The hairpin motif YNMG was chosen as a model system because it has a syn G at position four of the loop that is essential for thermodynamic stability.  Thermodynamic and structural characterization of modified oligonucleotides with the tetraloop sequences UUCG, CGCG, and CGAG by UV thermal denaturation and NMR spectroscopy revealed that 8BrG substitution has a small effect upon the hairpin conformation, while the duplex conformation is strongly destabilized, thus inhibiting dimerization.  These results support a model in which 8BrG-substituted YNMG sequences preferentially adopt the hairpin conformation, likely due to duplex destabilization.  Substantial destabilization of UUCG with 8BrG incorporated into the helical hairpin stem provides further support for a model in which 8BrG substitution shifts the hairpin-duplex equilibrium towards the hairpin conformation by destabilizing the duplex.\n\nCatalytic RNA, or ribozymes, often experience conformational heterogeneity, which limits their functional efficacy.  Substitution of 8BrG into ribozymes having syn purines in their active sites may limit misfolding, and enhance stability and catalytic rates.  The lead-dependent ribozyme, or leadzyme, is an ideal system for testing the utility of 8BrG because solution, crystal, and theoretical structures of this ribozyme differ in the orientation of three G residues in the active site.  A brief overview of current results is presented for 8BrG incorporation in the active site of the leadzyme.\n\nModified nucleotides allow fundamental energetic and kinetic properties of nucleic acids to be probed.  Incorporation of 8BrG for the syn G at loop position four of the YNMG RNA hairpin motif results in enhanced stability relative to the unmodified hairpin based on UV thermal denaturation.  The lack of a discernable effect upon the hairpin conformation in NMR spectra suggests the enhanced stability of the modified sequence arises from a denatured state effect.  Laser temperature-jump (T-jump) experiments support this notion, as unmodified and 8BrG-substituted UUCG have similar unfolding rates, but the folding rate of the modified tetraloop is enhanced approximately 3-fold.  Based on these findings, we propose that 8BrG reduces the conformational entropy of the denatured state, resulting in an accelerated conformational search for the native state and enhanced stability.\n\nIn addition to finding that 8BrG incorporation enhanced the stability and rate of folding, laser T-jump experiments revealed that UUCG hairpins closed by a CG base pair fold faster and unfold slower than hairpins closed by a GC base pair.  Electrostatic isopotential contours calculated using solutions to the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (NLPB) equation indicated that favorable arrangement of electrostatic potentials in the denatured state may drive faster folding for stable hairpins closed by a CG base pair.  This finding suggests that favorable electrostatic interactions in the native and denatured states may enhance stability and folding.\n\nElectrostatic interactions are an important driving force in a variety of biological processes.  There is increasing evidence that suggests electrostatics plays an important role in RNA stability, folding and catalysis.  In particular, electrostatic interactions are likely to play a role in the modulation of pKa values in RNA, and are known to affect the binding of metal ions to RNA.  In an effort to understand the mechanism of catalysis by the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and to identify putative Mg2+ binding sites, surface electrostatic potential maps were calculated on the self-cleaved form of the ribozyme using the NLPB equation.  These calculations revealed several patches of highly negative potential, one of which is present in a cleft near the putative general acid, N4 of C75.  These calculations suggest that distinct catalytic and structural metal ion sites exist on the ribozyme, and that the negative potential at the active site may help shift the pKa for N3 of C75 toward neutrality.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1424], "author_name_tesi": "Proctor, David James", "last_name_ssi": "Proctor", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

The study utilizes this interpretive empirical method to examine the historical context of the debates, their significance within the current U.S. political economy, and the state\u2019s role in these deliberations.\n\tThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) passed the NTSO rule in the 1940s with the belief that the rule would increase diversity of viewpoints and \u201cfair\u201d competition. But since at least the late 1970s, the rule has been viewed as an impediment to broadcasters\u2019 pursuit of the benefits of economies of scale. The continued relaxation of ownership rules such as the NTSO rule has, in part, led to the proliferation of media mergers, for rules that once inhibited large companies from merging have consistently been eased or eradicated in the name of competition. \n\tAt the micro-level, this study focuses on the history of the NTSO rule, the Viacom-CBS merger, and News Corporation\u2019s strategies for fulfilling the company\u2019s special interests. I argue that attacks upon structural regulations once created to prevent media concentration and Federal Communication Commission (FCC) acquiescence are quite alarming when we consider how essential the media are to the democratic political process: to inform the citizenry for purposes of self-governance. At the macro-level, this study focuses on how the logic of capitalism is indeed antithetical to democratic ideals. The short-term goal of media ownership reform via the state, while seemingly necessary to either decrease concentration or stabilize the current U.S. media structure, should be matched with long-term goals of social and economic justice, for democratization will be difficult to achieve if survival remains a constant challenge for a large portion of the U.S. population and an even greater proportion of the global population. As such, I present ways in which media activists can work for change within the current political economic system and propose possible alternatives to the capitalist media system.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2878], "author_name_tesi": "Proffitt, Jennifer M.", "last_name_ssi": "Proffitt", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ronald V Bettig", "Matthew Jackson", "Clay Calvert", "John Philip Christman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ronald V Bettig, Committee Chair", "Matthew Jackson, Committee Member", "Clay Calvert, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["structural regulation", "media concentration", "political economy of communications"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Vision based map-to-image correspondence for attitude estimation in augmented reality applications", "id": "28856", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12420", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation proposes a methodology for attitude correction by matching two\ndifferent representations of the same environment.

This multimodal system can be applied to other biological and biochemical studies at single molecule and macro scale levels without compromising the detection efficiency and spatio-temporal resolution.  Here, fluorescence (confocal and two-photon) and DIC microscopy were used to provide cell morphology and mitochondrial distribution.  Excited-state fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) was used to identify the effects of mitochondrial environments on the quantum yield of Rh123.  FLIM was also used to convert fluorescence intensity images into concentration images.  Fluorescence polarization anisotropy imaging and rotational diffusion was used to probe information concerning structural conformation, hydrodynamic volume, and the surrounding environment of Rh123 in mitochondria.

Although a definitive stoichiometry of gp59 on fDNA was not obtained, several other insights into gp59 and fDNA interactions were.  Decreasing fluorescence lifetime of Hex-labeled fDNA as gp59 concentration increases suggests a spatial proximity that initiates non-radiative pathways.  Fluorescence polarization anisotropy measurements show Hex-labeled fDNA undergoes ultrafast conformational changes (segmental mobility), which are sensitive to the presence of bound gp59.

Three distinct morphologies were identified under various different processing conditions which include primarily starting material nodules, highly fibrillous PTFE, and sintered material. BET surface area measurements are convoluted with the surface areas of individual components such as starting material nodules, high aspect ratio fibers, nodule agglomerates, and varied fiber diameters which all compete with increasing and decreasing effects to provide the total measurable BET surface area.  Jet Blowing PTFE heated to 270 &#61616;C with nitrogen at a pressure of 70 MPa was found to be the optimum processing conditions to produce highly fibrillous products.\nEndothelialization of vascular grafts is critical for the production of artificial organs with enhanced hemocompatibility.

All nPTFE surfaces outperformed, with respect to endothelialization, equivalently treated ePTFE surface.

Nonetheless, in humans, 15% of genes escape XCI and are expressed from both active and inactive Xs. Many of these escape genes are clustered, suggesting their expression is coordinately regulated. An attractive model is that these clustered escape genes are flanked by regulatory sequences such as insulators. To identify sequences that control XCI, I focused on a cluster of human escape genes that includes the Ubiquitin Activating Enzyme E1 gene, UBA1. UBA1 has a distinctive gene structure with five alternative promoters and 5\u2019 untranslated exons that each splice to a single exon 2. Inactive X expression is also unique; two upstream exons are X-inactivated whereas two downstream exons assayed escape XCI. The 2.1 kb between X-inactivated and expressed exons is the smallest inactive X expression boundary and is a tractable region to identify sequences that regulate inactive X expression. To test the prediction that escape domains are regulated by chromatin insulators, eight overlapping constructs within the UBA1 boundary were tested; a 330 bp sequence demonstrated insulator function. Despite similar gene structure and high sequence conservation, all mouse Uba1 transcripts are X-inactivated and the locus lacks insulator activity. The UBA1 insulator is novel; while the insulator-binding protein CTCF has been identified at one XCI expression boundary, CTCF binds the UBA1 locus downstream of the insulator and appears unrelated to inactive X regulation. That the insulator is functional in XCI gene regulation is suggested by epigenetic modifications that specifically demarcate this sequence on the inactive X. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the UBA1 insulator segregates heterochromatin from the euchromatic escape domain. Additionally, DNA methylation differences distinguish the human insulator; this sequence is hypomethylated on the inactive X, whereas the active X is heavily methylated, as is the orthologous sequence that lacks boundary activity on both Xs in mouse. The identification of a novel insulator at the UBA1 expression boundary strengthens the model that escape domains are regulated by chromatin boundaries and pinpoints a region that can be further dissected to identify novel factors that bind and regulate XCI escape.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3390], "author_name_tesi": "Prothero, Katie Eva", "last_name_ssi": "Prothero", "middle_name_ssi": "Eva", "first_name_ssi": "Katie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Laura Carrel", "Laura Carrel", "Sergei A Grigoryev", "Ira Joseph Ropson", "Jiyue Xhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Laura Carrel, Dissertation Advisor", "Laura Carrel, Committee Chair", "Sergei A Grigoryev, Committee Member", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member", "Jiyue Xhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DNA methylation", "X chromosome inactivation", "epigenetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF RESOURCES AND INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES ON CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTALISM\n", "id": "11110", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5350", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While previous research on organizations and the natural environment provides a rationale for general corporate environmental responses, questions remain regarding why firms facing similar institutional pressures respond differently to environmental issues.

This extends institutional theory from an environmental perspective. Second, this research aims to provide a better understanding of how firms' resources and capabilities as well as the institutional pressures they face affect changes in firms' corporate environmentalism. The argument presented by this key contribution is that both resource-based and institutional factors, as well as the relationship between them, affect firms' corporate environmentalism. Third, the empirical results of this study provide pragmatic answers to key questions surrounding the fast-growing \u201cgreen-certified\u201d residential building industry. \n\nThis research is cross-disciplinary, bridging three disciplines: management and organization theory, sustainable development, and forest products. The domain of forest products serves as the context of the investigation, while theoretical arguments are drawn from the research domains of management and organization theory as well as business and sustainable development. In addition, practical implications are drawn from green building programs and the residential housing value chain. The desired outcome of this research is to contribute to all three research domains by providing publishable works for journals in those fields.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5345], "author_name_tesi": "Protpakorn, Ruthairat ", "last_name_ssi": "Protpakorn", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ruthairat", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judd Harrison Michael", "Judd Harrison Michael", "Paul Michael Smith", "Nicole Robitaille Brown", "Timothy Grant Pollock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judd Harrison Michael, Dissertation Advisor", "Judd Harrison Michael, Committee Chair", "Paul Michael Smith, Committee Member", "Nicole Robitaille Brown, Committee Member", "Timothy Grant Pollock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Corporate Environmentalism", "Institutional Theory", "RBV", "Sustainability", "Forest Products Industry"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Optimization of Natural Gas Distribution in Pipeline Networks\n", "id": "26348", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11205", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In natural gas pipeline transportation systems, network operators play a crucial role. Through compression power and pipeline geometry, they master the physics of the systems, allowing them to control the flow of gas between two points. Their decisions impact the entire production chain, from the suppliers to the consumers. Consequently, the management of pipeline systems requires an in-depth analysis of the influence of each decision. Each pressure change in the system may seriously impact the flow of natural gas, deeply modifying the revenue of the entire production and how it is divided between the different actors of the market. It is fundamental to understand how to master the system in order to control the money generated.\nFrom an economic point of view, natural gas pipeline production, transportation and sale creates wealth divided between the different actors in the sector: the profit of the producer, the consumer welfare and a combination of both for the network operator. This social wealth, should be maximized in order to generate the most benefit from the network for society.  In order to do so, it is necessary to understand how much gas is flowing through each pipeline. \nIf pressure values are fixed on an arbitrary basis, the dispatch of natural gas in the network will not be optimized. The loss of social wealth generated can be considerable given the important volumes transported through pipeline those days. In the market of natural gas transportation, if the pressure at the nodes is wrongly chosen, it could be disastrous for a company. How could any producing/transporting company avoid wasting this significant amount of money? What are the solutions available for the natural gas pipeline engineers to dispatch natural gas in order to maximize the social wealth generated?\nThis issue can be stated in the corresponding two situations:\n\u2022\tFor the construction of a new pipeline network, how should the geometry of the different pipes be chosen in order to transport natural gas in an optimal way?\n\u2022\tFor an existing pipeline network, how should the pressure drops be chosen to maximize the social wealth of the producing/transporting company?\nThe goal of this study is to provide network operators with the parameters to answer those situations. By fixing the pressure values at the nodes of the system, it is possible to maximize the economic value generated by the natural gas transportation and sales. Additionally, running the simulation on different natural gas network configurations = inform the company on how to choose the ideal geometry factors of each branch of pipeline.\nMidthun et al. (2009) suggested two different methods to address this problem. The first one, the Independent Static Flow (ISF) method is a straightforward way to find a solution. Neglecting the physics of natural gas, this method assumes that every pipe of the system is running at maximum capacity. The method is very easy to use and implement. Nevertheless, the solution provided is unrealistic: as the physics of natural gas is not respected, it is impossible to practically apply the method on a real network. Hence, this method can only be used to give an idea of how to regulate the flows, and an operator could only try to guess the pressure values at the nodes that could help to get closer this ideal situation on his network. The loss of economic value of natural gas from the arbitrary choices of the operator is a concern. Additionally, the solution arbitrary applied by the operator will generate far less social wealth than the ideal solution given through ISF Method due to the application of the physics of natural gas transportation.\nTo address this issue, the second method proposed by Midthun et al. (2009), the Taylor Development Method, relies on an approximation of the underlying physics to solve for the optimal solution. In order to improve the relevance of the results to the constraints of the pipeline network, Midthun et al. decided to modify the nonlinear constraints of the system, .However, the accuracy of this approach has a price: the more accurate the solution, the more computationally difficult the optimization becomes. \nFigure 1: The fragile optimum for the Taylor Development Method\n\nFigure 1 illustrates this complex choice. Thus, the user remains struggled in a compromise to find the right equilibrium between quality of the result and time (and so money) of computation. The situation is even worse for large network, as the number of constraining equations greatly increases for each additional pipeline on a network.\n\nThis compromise between size of network/quality of results on one hand and computational feasibility on the other hand cannot be satisfying. Today, natural gas companies have to deal with networks of several hundred of pipes. An accurate solution would be too hard to solve for, and decreasing the accuracy expectations may cause a large waste of social wealth. \nIn order to avoid this loss, this paper is suggesting another method, based on Ayala et. al.\u2019s (2013) Linear-Pressure Analog Method. Instead of adding extra constraining equations to take account for the nonlinearities of natural gas physics, it is possible to simplify the system. Assuming a linear relationship between natural gas flow rate with respect to pressure drop, the system become smaller and easier to solve. In other words, physics of natural gas is assumed to be similar to the one of laminar liquid flows. From here, a correction is applied to the solution found, taking account for the nonlinearities inherent in real natural gas behavior. The process is iterated until convergence is reached. This method is both feasible and accurate with limited computational demands. Consequently, with any standard computer, a production/transportation company can obtain the ideal and realistic dispatch of natural gas in its network, and optimize the economic value generated by its natural gas transportation.\n\n\t\t\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10751], "author_name_tesi": "Pruvot, Antoine ", "last_name_ssi": "Pruvot", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Antoine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Luis Ayala", "Chiara Lo Prete", "Andrew Nathan Kleit"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Luis Ayala, Thesis Advisor", "Chiara Lo Prete, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Nathan Kleit, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["pipeline", "pipe", "economic surplus", "natural gas", "weymouth", "flow", "optimization", "distribution", "network"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Using elemental sulfur to optimize/lower soil ph of bentgrass putting greens", "id": "22718", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10290", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soil pH highly influences nutrient availability and root growth during both establishment and maintenance of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) putting greens (PGs). The optimal 1:1 soil pH range for creeping bentgrass is 5.5\u20136.5, yet PG rootzones containing even modest amounts of calcareous sand are often buffered to higher pH values. Furthermore, topdressing sand and/or irrigation water inputs are common sources of added alkalinity. Supraoptimal pH levels have been shown to increase turfgrass disease susceptibility while limiting nutrient availability, root growth, and stress tolerance. The objective of this research was to quantify growth and nutritional status responses of bentgrass PGs to method and/or rate of a single elemental sulfur (So) application. In Sept. 2012, pelletized or flowable So was applied to two internally-drained Penn A-series PGs at rates of 0, 195, 390, 586 kg So ha\u20131 (0, 4, 8, or 12 lbs So 1000 ft2). Response variables measured over the 2013 season were: clipping yield, canopy color and density, soil pH (by 3 rootzone depth segments), soil extractable nutrients, leaf nutrient content, specific root length, and root length density. Soil pH reductions observed within the surface 5-cm and 5 to 15-cm rootzone depths were highly correlated to So rate. Other response variables significantly influenced by linear So rate include leaf nutrient concentrations (Ca, K, Mg, S, Cu, and Fe) and canopy density. While canopy color, determined by dark green color index (DGCI), was not influenced by linear So rate, there was a significant effect of application method. Several of the described experimental variables measured proved statistically significant; however, observed differences were often marginal. Nutrient levels of all treated and untreated plots remained within the sufficiency range of creeping bentgrass. The most notable nutritional difference was that of leaf Mn concentrations. Mean leaf Mn increased approximately 20-40% in treated plots.

DNA is wrapped around histone proteins to form nucleosomes, the basic repeating unit of chromatin. The histone N-termini protrude from the nucleosomal core and are extensively modified during transcription. Many transcription factors harbor domains that will interact with the modified histone N-termini. Additionally, modification of the N-termini can alter the charge of the basic residues resulting in the unfolding of higher order chromatin structures. In S. cerevisiae, the histone N-termini are nonessential and this has allowed for investigations into how N-termini mutations affect the regulation of transcription. Initial characterizations of histone N-termini mutants revealed transcription defects; however, the mechanism of these defects has not been examined. In this study, we explore roles for the histone N-termini in transcription initiation, elongation, termination, and mRNA processing.\nUsing the DNA damage-inducible RNR3 gene, we explore how deletions and lysine to glutamine substitutions would affect transcription induction. We establish that the H2A, H3, and H4 N-termini are important for RNR3 activation. Interestingly, we observe that these transcription defects are the results of different mechanisms. For example, we demonstrate that the H4 N-terminus, specifically, is required for the release of the Crt1-Ssn6-Tup1 corepressor upon DNA damage. Additionally, deletion of the H4 N-terminus results in constitutive SWI/SNF recruitment in a mechanism that likely involves the loss of Isw2 function. Deletion of the H2A N-terminus results in a significant reduction of H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation. The methylation loss in this mutant is suggestive of another form of trans-tail regulation of histone modifications. Our characterization of the histone N-termini in transcription initiation revealed possible roles for the N-termini in transcription elongation. We demonstrate that deletion of the H3 N-terminus or substitution of the H4 lysine to glutamines result in a shift of RNA polymerase density that is indicative of a transcription elongation defect. \nIn the second part of this study, we explore how mutations to the H4 N-terminus affect transcription elongation. Substituting all of the H4 N-terminal lysine residues for glutamines results in genetic interactions with elongation factors and suggests that the H4 lysines have roles in elongation. Interestingly, mutation of only three lysines did not result in growth defects. This implies redundancy among the acetylatable lysines. We also demonstrate that the H4 N-terminus is important for the repression of intragenic transcription at FLO8. This repression mechanism is separate from the Set2-Rpd3 pathway and likely involves the elongation factors Spt6 and Spt16. Further examination revealed novel roles for the H4 N-termini in transcription termination at snoRNAs as well as mRNA splicing. These results suggest that the H4 N-terminus is an important regulator throughout transcription. \nThe final section of this study involves the characterization of novel intra-tail regulation of Set2 by the H3 N-terminus. Deletion of the H3 N-terminus, or substitution of the lysine residues within the tail for glutamine, results in significant defects in H3 lysine 36 tri-methylation. We demonstrate that the H3 N-terminus is not required for the recruitment of Set2, but does stimulate Set2 activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the charge of the H3 N-terminus is important for Set2 activity. We propose a mechanism by which Set2 activity is regulated by novel intra-tail interactions within H3, which can be regulated by modifications to the tail. \nIt has been the goal of this study to better understand the mechanisms by which the histone N-termini regulate transcription. Initially, we expected the histone N-termini to regulate transcription initiation predominantly. However, our characterization of initiation led us to the hypothesis that the histone N-termini regulate multiple facets of transcription. Experiments to test this hypothesis revealed novel roles for the H4 N-terminus in elongation, termination, and mRNA splicing. Additionally, we identified novel intra-tail regulation of Set2 activity and characterized the mechanism.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2909], "author_name_tesi": "Psathas, James Nicholas", "last_name_ssi": "Psathas", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph C.

In addition, research indicates that diets consistent with the Dietary Guidelines improve chronic disease risk factors and are effective for weight loss; yet, few Americans follow these dietary recommendations. Therefore, the Weight Optimization: Revamping Lifestyles using the Dietary Guidelines (WORLD) study evaluated the effects of an intensive, theory-based, nutrition education program for weight management and guided by the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans on clinical, biochemical, and dietary outcomes. The education program, Your Healthy World, was based on the social cognitive theory and delivered using problem-based learning, a format untested in a long-term nutrition education program for consumers. Your Healthy World was tailored for the lower end (20% kcal from fat; lower-fat diet) or upper end (35% kcal from fat; moderate-fat diet) of the Dietary Guidelines recommended range of fat intake. Pre-menopausal, overweight/obese women (n=101; BMI: 25-39.9 kg/m2; LDL-cholesterol: 100-189 mg/dL; aged 21-50 years) were randomized to either a lower-fat or moderate-fat diet in a parallel-arm design. The intervention consisted of 28 education sessions and twice weekly supervised aerobic exercise sessions over the course of one year.\n\nIntention-to-treat analyses (n=101) show that after one year weight loss was similar between the lower-fat and moderate-fat treatment groups (-5.0 and -4.3 kg; P\u00a1\u00afs < 0.0001 compared to baseline). Overall, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations decreased (-0.09 and -0.10 mmol/l, respectively; P\u00a1\u00afs < 0.05) and HDL-cholesterol concentration increased (+0.05 mmol/l; P < 0.05). Since energy and nutrient intakes, specifically total fat intake, did not differ between treatment groups participants were reclassified according to actual fat intake. If average fat intake from months 4 and 12 contributed less than 27.5% of total energy participants were classified as consuming a lower-fat diet; participants consuming a diet in which average fat intake from months 4 and 12 contributed more than 27.5% of total energy were considered moderate-fat consumers. The cutpoint of 27.5% of energy was used since it is the midpoint of the Dietary Guidelines recommendation for dietary fat (i.e., 20-35% of energy from fat). After reclassifying participants, total, LDL, and HDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower and triglyceride concentrations higher in participants reporting consumption of a lower-fat diet compared to participants consuming a moderate-fat diet (P\u00a1\u00afs \u00a1\u00dc 0.05). The strongest predictors of weight loss were changes in aerobic capacity, binge-eating behaviors, baseline body weight and changes in trans fat intake, which together accounted for 20% of the variance in 12-month weight loss. An increase in aerobic capacity, a decrease in trans fat intake, and higher baseline binge-eating behaviors and body weight were associated with greater weight loss.\n\nWhen evaluating the effects of the intervention on diet-related variables in participants providing data at month 12 (n=60), the Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005), a tool to assess adherence to the Dietary Guidelines, was used. The HEI-2005 consists of twelve components (i.e., total fruit; whole fruit; total vegetables; dark green and orange vegetables and legumes; total grains; whole grains; milk; and meat and beans; oils; saturated fat; sodium; and calories from solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars). For most components, higher intakes result in higher scores; however, the saturated fat, sodium, and calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars components, lower intake levels result in higher scores because lower intakes are more desirable. A time effect was seen for increases in total fruit, whole fruit, whole grains, meat and beans, and saturated fat component scores, as well as summary scores, of the HEI-2005 (P < 0.01 for all). Total HEI-2005 scores were not different between participants consuming a lower-fat diet or a moderate-fat diet (80.58 \u00a1\u00c0 1.95 and 74.69 \u00a1\u00c0 1.33, respectively; P = 0.13). Component scores for total vegetables, dark green and orange vegetables and legumes, and whole grains, and total HEI-2005 score increased across tertiles as energy density of the diet decreased (P < 0.01 for all). The strongest predictors of energy density were baseline energy density and changes in scores for the total fruit component, the oils component, and total HEI-2005, which together accounted for 56% of the variance in dietary energy density at month 12. The strongest dietary predictors of weight loss were increases in the total vegetables component score, the oils component score, trans fat intake, the total grains component score, and baseline body weight, which together accounted for 15% of the variance in weight loss at month 12. \n\nResults of the WORLD study demonstrate that lower-fat and moderate-fat diets consistent with the Dietary Guidelines are equally effective for weight management. In particular, study participants were able to maintain weight loss during the maintenance period and did not experience the rebound in body weight often seen in other studies. In support of the Dietary Guidelines recommendations for physical activity, aerobic fitness was the main predictor of weight loss in this study. In addition, findings from this study indicate that women can follow the dietary recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for weight loss and maintenance and improve diet quality as assessed by the HEI-2005. Results from this study support using the Dietary Guidelines for health promotion and chronic disease risk reduction during weight loss and maintenance of a reduced body weight.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6217], "author_name_tesi": "Psota, Tricia Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Psota", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Tricia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Barbara Ann Lohse", "Barbara Jean Rolls", "Sheila Grace West", "Linda Ann Wray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Dissertation Advisor", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Chair", "Barbara Ann Lohse, Committee Member", "Barbara Jean Rolls, Committee Member", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member", "Linda Ann Wray, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lifestyle modification", "physical activity", "diet", "2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans", "weight management", "Obesity/overweight", "nutrition education", "chronic disease risk", "eating behavior"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Measuring the Competitiveness of China's Vegetable Exports in the US Market\n\n", "id": "10083", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4740", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With China\u2019s fast growth in exports of horticultural products, it is very important to study China\u2019s competitive strength.

We present results from two simulations utilizing an underlying scale-free network topology to investigate users\u2019 app adoption behaviors in both an early adoption phase and later adoption periods. The first simulation predictably shows that in the early adoption period, app adoption rates will increase when (1) the interdependent privacy harm caused by an app is lower, (2) installation cost decreases, or (3) network size increases. Surprisingly, we find from the second simulation that app rankings frequently will not accurately reflect the level of interdependent privacy harm when simultaneously considering the adoption results of multiple apps. Given that in the late adoption phase, users make their installation decisions mainly based on app rankings, the simulation results demonstrate that even rational actors who consider their peers\u2019 well-being might adopt apps with significant interdependent privacy harms.\n\nIn the second study, we take an empirical approach to complement our theoretical work. Applying a conjoint study approach, we conduct the first study to quantify the monetary value which app users place on their friends\u2019 privacy (i.e., value of interdependent privacy). Further, motivated by principles of contextual integrity, we examine the effect of data collection context on the valuation of interdependent privacy. We introduce two survey treatments: (T1) friends\u2019 information is not relevant to app functionality, and (T2) friends\u2019 information is relevant to app functionality. The results show that the monetary value (measured in US$) which individuals place on friends\u2019 complete profile information is $1.56 in T1, and $0.98 in T2. In addition, we find individuals in T1 and T2 valuate their own complete profile information at $2.31 and $2.04, respectively. These valuations are significantly higher than the dollar values they place on friends\u2019 complete profile information. We further measure the impact of comprehensiveness of data collection: an app may collect no information about users\u2019 friends, basic information, or full profile information. Data collection context does not significantly affect how users value their friends\u2019 basic information. However, regarding friends\u2019 sensitive information (i.e., their complete profile), users in T1 valuate such information significantly higher than their counterparts in T2.\n\nBoth of these two studies contribute to the technology policy discussion on privacy in social apps by calling for meaningful market signals, e.g., designs that can better reflect the level of apps\u2019 interdependent privacy harm, and mechanisms that inform users of apps\u2019 data collection contexts. We believe such signals will help app users to make better informed decisions, and to more accurately address their own and their friends\u2019 privacy preferences.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10789], "author_name_tesi": "Pu, Yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Pu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yu", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jens Grossklags"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jens Grossklags, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Social Apps", "Interdependent Privacy", "Other-Regarding Preferences", "App Data Collection Context", "Economic Model", "Conjoint Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Towards Models of the Economic Value of Interdependent Privacy in Social App Adoption Scenarios", "id": "13616yxp134", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13616", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the context of third-party social apps, the problem of interdependency of privacy refers to users making app adoption decisions which cause the collection and utilization of personal information of users\u2019 friends. In contrast, users\u2019 friends have typically little or no direct influence over these decision-making processes.\n\nWhile the issue of interdependent privacy grows in practical importance, only a limited number of research studies have appeared on this subject. To address this literature gap, in this dissertation, we discuss three studies that address the problem space of interdependent privacy in social app adoption scenarios. More specifically, this dissertation focuses on quantifying and explaining the monetary value which app users place on their friends\u2019 information, i.e., value of interdependent privacy.\n\nIn Study 1, we conduct a full-profile conjoint analysis study with two treatment conditions which vary the app data collection context (i.e., to which degree the functionality of the app makes it necessary for the app developer to collect friends\u2019 information). Analyzing the data, we are able to quantify how much monetary value app users place on their friends\u2019 and their own personal information in each context. Combining these valuations with the responses to a comprehensive survey, we apply structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis to investigate the roles of privacy concern, its antecedents, as well as app data collection context to work towards a model of interdependent privacy for the scenario of social app adoption.\n\nComplementing Study 1, our second study aims to further explain the valuation of interdependent privacy. In particular, research indicates that social capital, which is an immaterial resource that can yield positive social outcomes, plays an important role in individuals\u2019 decision-making. Motivated by these works, we investigate the complex and still undetermined relationship between interdependent privacy value and social capital. In addition, in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of interdependent privacy valuation, our study also examines its relationships with factors such as individuals\u2019 number of friends within SNSs, and demographics.\n\nWith Study 3, we explore important contextual factors that affect the value which app users attribute to their friends\u2019 information. In particular, we focus on understanding the impact of sharing anonymity (i.e., whether disclosure of friends\u2019 information is anonymous) on the valuation of interdependent privacy. To address this research goal, we conduct a between-subject, choice- based conjoint analysis study with 4 treatments (2 sharing anonymity \u00d7 2 context relevance). Our study confirms the important role that sharing anonymity plays in interdependent privacy valuation.\n\nOur research contributes to a better understanding of individuals\u2019 attitudes and behaviors towards interdependent privacy issues associated with social apps. Based on this understanding, we offer insights, such as suggestions to redesign app permission systems, as well as to introduce new privacy polices, for better addressing individuals\u2019 own and their friends\u2019 privacy preferences.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13748], "author_name_tesi": "Pu, Yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Pu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jens Grossklags", "Jens Grossklags", "Mary Beth Rosson", "Peng Liu", "S.

In particular, the psychocritical (Mezirow, 1991) and developmental perspectives (Daloz, 2003; Kegan, 2000) of transformative learning serve as the theoretical lens. This qualitative study utilized narrative inquiry to examine the perspective of 12 nurses who became patients. Inclusion criteria specified that nurses must: self-disclose as having a significant patient experience after becoming an RN, self-disclose that compassion in professional practice changed as a result of the patient experience, nurses had direct patient interaction as part of their job after the patient experience, and nurses have at least five years of experience. Nurses in the study indicated that the patient experience, and sometimes life experiences, impact the development of compassion in their practice. Findings suggest that before the patient experience, compassion was in the background of nurses\u2019 practice. However, after the patient experience, nurses discussed compassion as being in the foreground of practice; as evidenced by changes in their perspective of the importance of compassion and behavior changes in practice. Nurses, indicated that empathy is a necessary component in expressing compassion.

The presented research comprises the development of models to include the thermal-hydraulic feedback to the Monte Carlo method and speed-up mechanisms to accelerate the Monte Carlo criticality calculation. \nPresently, deterministic codes based on the diffusion approximation of the Boltzmann transport equation, coupled with channel-based (or sub-channel based) thermal-hydraulic codes, carry out the three-dimensional (3-D) reactor core calculations of the Light Water Reactors (LWRs). These deterministic codes utilize nuclear homogenized data (normally over large spatial zones, consisting of fuel assembly or parts of fuel assembly, and in the best case, over small spatial zones, consisting of pin cell), which is functionalized in terms of thermal-hydraulic feedback parameters (in the form of off-line pre-generated cross-section libraries). High accuracy modeling is required for advanced nuclear reactor core designs that present increased geometry complexity and material heterogeneity. Such high-fidelity methods take advantage of the recent progress in computation technology and coupled neutron transport solutions with thermal-hydraulic feedback models on pin or even on sub-pin level (in terms of spatial scale). The continuous energy Monte Carlo method is well suited for solving such core environments with the detailed representation of the complicated 3-D problem. The major advantages of the Monte Carlo method over the deterministic methods are the continuous energy treatment and the exact 3-D geometry modeling. However, the Monte Carlo method involves vast computational time. The interest in Monte Carlo methods has increased thanks to the improvements of the capabilities of high performance computers. Coupled Monte-Carlo calculations can serve as reference solutions for verifying high-fidelity coupled deterministic neutron transport methods with detailed and accurate thermal-hydraulic models. The development of such reference high-fidelity coupled multi-physics scheme is described in this dissertation on the basis of MCNP5, NEM, NJOY and COBRA-TF (CTF) computer codes. This work presents results from studies performed and implemented at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) on both accelerating Monte Carlo criticality calculations by using hybrid nodal diffusion Monte Carlo schemes and thermal-hydraulic feedback modeling in Monte Carlo core calculations. \nThe hybrid MCNP5/CTF/NEM/NJOY coupled code system is proposed and developed in this dissertation work. The hybrid coupled code system contains a special interface developed to update the required MCNP5 input changes to account for dimension and density changes provided by the thermal-hydraulics feedback module. The interface has also been developed to extract the flux and reaction rates calculated by MCNP5 to later transform the data into the power feedback needed by CTF (axial and radial peaking factors). The interface is contained in a master program that controls the flow of the calculations. Both feedback modules (thermal-hydraulic and power subroutines) use a common internal interface to further accelerate the data exchange.\nOne of the most important steps to correctly include the thermal hydraulic feedback into MCNP5 calculations begins with temperature dependent cross section libraries. If the cross sections used for the calculations are not at the correct temperature, the temperature feedback cannot be included into MCNP5 (referred to the effect of temperature on cross sections: Doppler boarding of resolve and unresolved resonances, thermal scattering and elastic scattering). The only method of considering the temperature effects on cross sections is through the generation (or as introduced in this dissertation through a novel interpolation mechanism) of continuous energy temperature-dependent cross section libraries. An automated methodology for generation of continuous energy temperature-dependent cross section libraries has been developed as part of the hybrid Monte Carlo-based coupled core studies at PSU. This tool is used together with the automated cross-section temperature interpolation capability for intermediate points. The automated methodology, combined with the interpolation capability, has considerably reduced the cross section generation time.\nA new methodology for generation and interpolation of temperature-dependent thermal scattering cross section libraries for MCNP5 is introduced as well. Using the interpolation methodology specially designed for thermal scattering cross sections, a thermal scattering grid at the desired temperature was generated. This gives the possibility of performing MCNP5 criticality calculations at the correct moderator temperature and improving the accuracy of the calculations. A cross section update methodology has been included, which efficiently reduces the time of the cross section libraries update.\nSeveral acceleration strategies are introduced and implemented in the hybrid coupled code system. The computation process is greatly accelerated by calculating the 3-D distributions of fission source and thermal-hydraulics parameters with the coupled NEM/CTF code and then using coupled MCNP5/CTF code to fine tune the results to obtain an increased accuracy. The PSU NEM code employs cross-sections generated by MCNP5 for pin-cell based nodal compositions. \nFinally, the hybrid coupled system is automated and enhanced in order to provide the user with an efficient and easy to use high accuracy modeling tool.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1961], "author_name_tesi": "Puente Espel, Federico ", "last_name_ssi": "Puente Espel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Federico", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Dr Stefan Misu", "Prof Robert Edwards", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Victor Nistor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Dissertation Advisor", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Chair", "Maria Nikolova Avramova, Committee Chair", "Dr Stefan Misu, Committee Member", "Prof Robert Edwards, Committee Member", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Member", "Victor Nistor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MCNP5", "COBRA-TF", "NJOY", "NEM", "Coupled Calculations", "BWR"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Hysteresis Model Based Prediction of Integral Abutment Bridge Behavior", "id": "7020", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3602", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Integral abutment (IA) bridge construction has become more common due to desirable performance, however, many design uncertainties still exist, particularly long-term behavior prediction. In order to better understand these design uncertainties, a study of IA bridge behavior through long-term monitoring and numerical modeling has been undertaken. Monitoring and instrumentation consists of three prestressed concrete IA bridges located on I99 in central Pennsylvania. Evaluation of field data reveals hysteretic behavior of IA bridges that may be a significant influence on long-term behavior in addition to creep and shrinkage effects. On the basis of field data and two different problem types; geotechnical and structural, two major sources influencing long-term hysteretic behavior of IA bridges, including soil-structure interaction and yielding of structural connections, are identified. These two hysteretic sources were incorporated in finite element (FE) models using hysteresis elements derived from selected hysteresis models available in the literature for all three instrumented bridges. Also proposed is an alternative condensed hysteresis model in which two selected degrees of freedom at the pile head location are required. Similar types of hysteresis elements employed in the FE models were implemented in the condensed hysteresis models. Equivalent temperature loads to incorporate creep and shrinkage effects by using the AAEM method, ambient temperature loads, and earth pressures were applied to the FE and condensed hysteresis models. Predicted results from all models are compared against field data to evaluate model accuracy. Eight load cases were analyzed with a simulation period of 100 years to determine the relative magnitudes of hysteretic behavior and effects of creep and shrinkage. It is determined from predicted response at the end of the simulation period that the ratios of condensed hysteresis model to 2-D predicted abutment displacements range from 0.81 to 1.08. The ratios of long-term to short-term predicted abutment displacements range from 1.5 to 2.3. The ratios of predicted abutment displacement influenced by hysteretic behavior to short-term predicted abutment displacement are from 1.1 to 1.2 for an elevation near girders, and are from 1.3 to 1.6 for an elevation near abutment bases. These predicted ratios indicate the validity of the condensed hysteresis models and the importance of hysteretic behavior and effects of creep and shrinkage on long-term behavior of IA bridges.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3582], "author_name_tesi": "Pugasap, Kongsak ", "last_name_ssi": "Pugasap", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kongsak", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey A Laman", "Andrea J Schokker", "Daniel G Linzell", "Mian C Wang", "Thomas E Boothby", "Andrew Scanlon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey A Laman, Committee Chair", "Andrea J Schokker, Committee Member", "Daniel G Linzell, Committee Member", "Mian C Wang, Committee Member", "Thomas E Boothby, Committee Member", "Andrew Scanlon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bridge Abutments", "Hysteresis", "Numerical Models", "Monitoring", "Integrals", "Predictions"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "On Modeling and Evaluating the Impact of Corporate Social Responsibility", "id": "x920fw85p", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13099", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has experienced a rather unique and difficult path toward becoming a well-received subject of academic interest likely because there is a certain degree of ambiguity and disagreement with respect to its definition and the nature of the core principles that identify CSR. The existing research has analyzed mainly the business management and finance implications of CSR trying to justify its strategic role. My work takes a very different perspective and attempts to formalize and explain the process through which CSR is created incorporating it into a production framework. To this extent, I develop a joint production model for characterizing the technology and representing the transformation process of multiple inputs into multiple (desirable/marketed and undesirable) outputs. CSR is one of these outputs and plays a mitigation role. The application focuses on the food and beverages manufacturing sector which is particularly interesting as it faces both quite specific and more common CSR challenges. Because of data limitations, a non-parametric DEA approach is used to implement the empirical analysis. The general and flexible production model together with the parsimonious and computationally accessible empirical methodology adopted in this study constitute a powerful framework for characterizing the production technology for CSR, analyzing technical efficiency and deriving a system of internal shadow values for CSR that allows for quantifying the overall value as well as the marginal effect of engaging in socially responsible activities for the firm. The results of the empirical analysis indicate that in the sample of 175 firms considered efficiency levels are very high as approximately 75 percent of the firms are found to be technically efficient. For inefficient and just efficient firms the average shadow value of socially responsible activities is positive, implying that the cost of implementing these activities is compensated by their mitigating impact. For extreme efficient firms the average marginal value of increasing their socially responsible commitment is positive indicating that more CSR is considered beneficial for adding value to the firm. Conversely, the average marginal value of decreasing the CSR effort is negative indicating that lower levels of CSR are perceived as costly and damaging. Consequently, extreme efficient firms want to be compensated for reducing their socially responsible performance. A comparison between an external metric of CSR performance (Sustainalytics' ESG index) and a socially responsible output-specific measure together with an overall efficiency measure developed within the multiple input/output technology framework proposed in my analysis shows that  integrating CSR in the complex dynamics of a production process is important for assessing how firms successfully and efficiently manage the entirety of their production decisions.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12878], "author_name_tesi": "Puggioni, Daniela ", "last_name_ssi": "Puggioni", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Daniela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Spiro E.

Individuals with TBI often present with a poor response to supplemental nutritional support while in intensive care and the mechanisms for this failure remain unknown.  Our own preliminary data show that experimental TBI induces gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility while other experimental models have demonstrated that TBI initiates a cascade of GI mucosal barrier pathologies, all of which are hypothesized to contribute to prolonged dysregulation of nutrient homeostasis. The control of gastric motility is dominated by vagal neurocircuitry and the vagal connection between higher brain regions and the GI tract, referred to as the brain-gut axis, is an important link in the modulation of GI function by homeostatic and emotional processes. It has been shown that TBI induces at least a brief upregulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and the amygdala. Experimental models of stress-mediated gastric dysmotility have demonstrated the role of CRF in GI dysfunction. The central hypothesis of this thesis is that post-TBI upregulation of CRF plays a key role in the central mechanisms leading to post-TBI gastroparesis.  In all experiments, male Wistar rats were used and injured via the fluid percussion model (FP-TBI). Outcomes were measured using a combination of immunohistochemical, molecular, physiological and non-invasive gastric emptying tests. Parameters of lesion severity were determined by peak pressure of the fluid percussion wave, righting time, and mortality rate. Analysis of these parameters revealed that experimental subjects segregated into three basic populations, mild-injury, moderate-injury and fatal-injury. In control rats, t(max) and t1/2 measurements of gastric emptying were not significantly different from FP-TBI at any post-surgical time point. There was a non-significant trend for an elevation of maximum cumulative dose at one week post injury (P=0.08). Immunohistochemical detection of CRF could not reliably be detected by the immunohistochemical protocol employed in this study. Microdissection of the PVN from control and FP-TBI rats yielded no significant differences in CRF mRNA expression between groups (P>0.05). Additionally, microinjection of oxytocin into the DVC of control, mild and moderate FP-TBI rats did not significantly alter gastric tone, although there was a non-significant trend toward a reversal of the effect of oxytocin in moderate FP-TBI. It was concluded from these present data that CRF is not robustly upregulated following the current FP-TBI parameters.

By examining the definition, adoption, commodification, and contestation of local forms of reputed authenticity, I unravel the meaning and implications of being a \u201clocal\u201d in a fragmented American city.

Human studies have shown that addicts will seek and take drugs in lieu of all other activities, including going to work and caring for their children and themselves (Jones et al, 1995; Nair et al., 1997; Santolaria-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 1995).

These effects are thought to be due, at least in part, to the comparison of the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse and natural rewards, as the appraisal of both is mediated by the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system (Grigson, 1997; Grigon, 2008).\n   The severity of the problem and difficulty of treatment are further compounded by the fact that addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease that induces long-lasting changes in brain function and these changes interact with numerous environmental factors (O\u2019Brien, 1997).  Exposure to drugs themselves, physical or psychological stress, and drug-associated cues all reliably induce relapse to drug seeking and drug taking after a period of abstinence in both animals and humans.  Of course, this relapse occurs well after drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors have been acquired.  The data in this thesis will show that several novel factors can be involved in facilitating or preventing the acquisition of drug seeking and drug taking in rats, including sleep deprivation, a history of bingeing on fat, and environmental enrichment.  Chapters 2 and 3 will discuss the facilitative effects of sleep deprivation on acquisition.  Specifically, Chapter 2 will demonstrate that acute sleep deprivation (4-8 h) is capable of augmenting cocaine-induced reinstatement, as well as increasing the rate and efficiency of cocaine seeking and cocaine taking.  Chapter 3 will show that, similar to acute sleep deprivation, chronic sleep restriction (30% sleep loss over six days), akin to that experienced by humans (Hale and Do, 2007; Jean-Louis et al., 2000; National Sleep Foundation, 2008), is also capable of increasing cocaine-taking behaviors.  Chapter 4 will demonstrate how loss of control over one consummatory behavior (i.e., consumption of fat) can lead to loss of control of another (i.e., cocaine intake).  Finally, Chapter 5 will show the protective effects of environmental enrichment on the acquisition of cocaine seeking and cocaine taking.\n   Collectively, the data in this thesis demonstrate that, while some animals are, by nature, more likely to take drug than others, experience can shift this genetic predisposition leading to devastating vulnerability or marked resilience.  Moreover, these manipulations, experienced in adulthood, exerted a robust effect on behavior and, obviously then, on the brain.  This suggests that the facilitative and protective effects of these factors and those of drugs of abuse may be mediated, at least in part, via the same neural substrate, the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, and that this substrate remains highly plastic, even in adulthood.  These data have important implications for the treatment, and possibly prevention, of addiction in humans.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4034], "author_name_tesi": "Puhl, Matthew David", "last_name_ssi": "Puhl", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy", "Jidong Fang", "John Ellis", "Andras Hajnal", "Kelly J Karpa", "Robert J Milner", "Alexandros N Vgontzas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy, Committee Chair", "Jidong Fang, Committee Chair", "John Ellis, Committee Member", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member", "Kelly J Karpa, Committee Member", "Robert J Milner, Committee Member", "Alexandros N Vgontzas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cocaine self-administration", "sleep deprivation", "fat bingeing", "environmental enrichment"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "TECHNIQUES FOR DETERMINING THE RANGE AND\nMOTION OF UHF RFID TAGS\n", "id": "11527", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6364", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The study focuses on determining the range, velocity, and direction of motion of one or more UHF RFID tagged objects present within a broadcast-and-receive range of an RFID tag reader using the Phase- Difference-of-Arrival concept.

Oil sands are also known as tar sands and bituminous sands, are complex mixtures of sand, clays, water and bitumen, which is \u201cheavy\u201d and highly viscous oil. The extraction and separation of bitumen from oil sands requires significant amount of energy and large quantities of water and poses several environmental challenges. \n\tBitumen can be successfully separated from oil sands using imidazolium based ionic liquids and nonpolar solvents, however, ionic liquids are expensive and toxic. In this thesis, the ionic liquid alternatives- deep eutectic solvent, were investigated.  \n\tOil sands separation can be successfully achieved by using deep eutectic solvents  DES (choline chloride and urea) and nonpolar  solvent naphtha in different types of oil sands, including Canadian (\u201cwater-wet\u201d), Utah (\u201coil-wet\u201d) and low grade Kentucky oil sands. The separation quality depends on oil sands type, including bitumen and fine content, and separation condition, such as solvent ratio, temperature, mixing time and mechanical centrifuge.  This separation claims to the DES ability to form ion /charge layering on mineral surface, which results in reduction of adhesion forces between bitumen and minerals and promote their separation. \n\tAddition of water to DES can reduce DES viscosity. DES water mixture as a media, oil sands separation can be achieved. However, concentration at about 50 % or higher might be required to obtain a clear separation. And the separation efficiency is oil sands sample dependent. The highest bitumen extraction yield happened at 75% DES-water solution for Utah oil sands samples, and at 50~60% DES-water solutions for Alberta oil sands samples. \n\tForce curves were measured using Atomic Force Microscopy new technique, PeakForce Tapping Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping (PFTQNM). The results demonstrate that, by adding DES, the adhesion force between bitumen and silica and dissipation energy will decrease comparing to DI water. At higher concentration DES solution (>80%DES), the amount of decrease can be up to 80-90%. In lower concentration, at about 50% decrease was observed.  The results provide fundamental insights into the mechanism of bitumen separation from oil sands. The reduction of adhesion force between bitumen and minerals (silica) in DES media is the main reason which facilitates the separation between them, which by means existence of DES will favor bitumen and minerals separation. \n\tComparing to other techniques, DES based separation is environmentally compatible and economically viable. The separation can easily happen at room temperature. Choline chloride and urea are biodegradable, environmentally compatible, accessible in large scale and easily prepared by mixing and heating (<80 \u00b0C). Further improvement is needed regarding to separation quality and efficiency, either in the direction of developing better separation techniques or by looking for chemical additives which can improve separation and reduce environmental side-effects. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10020], "author_name_tesi": "Pulati, Nuerxida ", "last_name_ssi": "Pulati", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nuerxida", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul C Painter", "Evangelos Manias", "Jonathan P Mathews", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul C Painter, Dissertation Advisor", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Member", "Jonathan P Mathews, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Oil Sands", "Bitumen", "Oil Recovery", "Atomic Force Microscopy", "Peakforce Tapping QNM", "Force Measurement", "Deep Eutectic Solvent"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Characterization of Heat Transfer Coefficient at Micro/nano Scale and the effect of Heated Zone size", "id": "26507", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11646", "abstract_tesi": "Heat transfer mechanism from hot solids to surrounding air is crucial in thermal systems. Thermal management of devices at micro/nano length scales is very important for their reliability as they continue to shrink in size. It is agreed widely that the heat transfer coefficient increases at smaller length scales. This work presents an experimental technique to characterize the heat transfer from micro and nano scale structures using infrared microscopy. The heat transfer coefficient is found to be two orders of magnitude higher than the value at bulk length scales. It also shows an inverse relationship with temperature of the solid which suggests that the solid to air conduction is the dominating mechanism of heat dissipation at small length scales. An empirical relationship is also presented that depends on ratio of surface area to cross-sectional area, temperature differential in the heated solid and its surroundings. The heat transfer coefficient in conjunction with the temperature map from the infrared microscope can be used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimen using a heat transfer model based on micro fin geometry. \nIt is assumed that this size effect on the heat transfer coefficient is due to the size of specimen. An experiment is presented to show the effect of the predominance of the heater size on the heat transfer coefficient.

Emergence of novel materials with variation in parameters like thickness, composition, density, porosity etc., has made it possible to witness exceptional physical properties. Significant research efforts have been directed towards the size dependency of materials\u2019 ability to carry current, heat or mechanical load. This dissertation focuses on thermal properties since very large scale integration of electronics or sensors implies a rapid increase in the heat dissipation density and temperature. Accurate thermal characterization of the materials and their interfaces is essential for a reliable design. It is also essential to design efficient heat removal channels for thermal management of electronics. In this dissertation, we argue that if size effect can breakdown physical laws in individual domains, it can also couple the various domains. Such length-scale induced multi-domain coupling can open novel transduction schemes. For example, thermal properties of materials can be tuned by application of mechanical strain. This dissertation is aimed at studying the size effect on thermal transport phenomenon in materials and the coupling with other physical domains. The objective of this research is to experimentally study the influence of these parameters on thermal properties of solids and to explore the size-induced coupling between physical domains such that these materials can be actively tuned to obtain the desired properties.\nOur experimental framework is based on an Infrared microscopy based technique that maps the temperature field in microfabricated specimens and then perform energy balance to determine its thermal conductivity. This technique was applied to materials with low dielectric constant (low-k) that are used as inter-layer dielectrics to enable faster communication in electronics by reducing the delay time. Typically, lower dielectric constant is achieved by making the material porous, which also lowers the thermal conductivity. The low thermal conductivity measurement is particularly challenging because only high resolution temperature mapping can quantify the thermal gradient. We conducted a systematic study on thermal conductivity of these materials using simple fabrication process. It was found that the thermal conductivity decreases with porosity and increases with density and the values obtained are consistent with the empirical models in the literature.\nInterfaces between dissimilar materials are ubiquitous in electronic devices. From a thermal transport standpoint, the interface is as important as the constituent material. Interfacial Thermal Resistance (ITR) is the property that determines the quality of an interface. ITR is one of the most challenging measurands in experimental heat transfer, particularly for micro and nanoscale thin films. It is also the dominating quantity in thermal management of microelectronic and energy conversion devices. We developed a novel technique that exploits the size dependence of thermal resistance in thin films to magnify the temperature drop at the interface, which is then measured with infrared thermometry. We show that orders of magnitude amplification in interfacial temperature drop is possible by making the specimen freestanding, which facilitates the measurement. We present experimental results on metal\u2013dielectric interfaces involving aluminum, copper, silicon di-oxide and hafnium oxide for validation of the technique. This technique is further extended to measure the ITR of interface between silicon and carbon doped oxide (CDO) which is a low dielectric constant (low-k) and highly porous material albeit using a different fabrication process. \nIn this dissertation, we also present experimental evidence that thermal conductivity is coupled with mechanical strain in thin metal films. This is contrary to the classical understanding that electrons are not scattered appreciably by defects or deformation. Or in other words, metals are not expected to show strain dependent thermal transport. We hypothesize that for grain sizes below the electron mean free path, mechanical deformation mechanism and volume fraction of grain boundaries are drastically different from the bulk. Unlike dislocations (bulk scale deformation mechanism), grain boundaries strongly scatter electrons. Therefore, the very large volume fraction of grain boundaries in nanocrystalline metals lead to thermal scattering reducing the thermal conductivity. To investigate this hypothesis of grain size-induced thermo-mechanical coupling, the thermal conductivity of 100-nm-thick freestanding nanocrystalline zirconium (Zr) films was measured as a function of externally applied mechanical strain. Experimental results show strong mechanical strain\u2013thermal conductivity coupling, thermal conductivity of Zr film dropped from 20 to 13 W/m-K with an increasing strain from 0 to 1.24 %. Thermal conductivity of Zr film is also measured as a function of average grain size ranging from as-deposited 10 nm to as grown 250 nm. The results show that for grain sizes above 10 nm, mechanical strain has no influence over thermal conductivity, which supports the proposed hypothesis.\nAnother key contribution of this dissertation is to exploit the length-scale effects of thermal transport to advance the performance of real-life applications. This is demonstrated with a thin film based Thermoelectric Energy Conversion (TEC) design with a transformative shift from the current state of art commercially available TEC devices. This design applies in-plane thermoelectric elements compared to the universal practice of cross-plane ones. The size dependent thermal resistance and heat transfer coefficient results in very high temperature differential across a thermoelectric element. It also obviates the requirement of forced cooling (which itself demands energy expenditure) to maintain the cold end temperature. Preliminary results show that the device operates at ~ 10% Carnot efficiency at 100 \u00b0C hot surface temperature.\nWe conclude the dissertation by demonstrating some experimental evidence on heat super conduction at room temperature in a bulk material viz., Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3). Ballistic mode of heat transport happens when the phonon scattering is very less or almost absent in the material. The heat carriers are propagated from hot end to the cold end without any gradient in the material. Unfortunately, this kind of heat transport is only seen at ultra-low temperatures (around 4K) or in nanoscale structures at room temperature. Numerous thermal engineering applications including heating, cooling, energy conversion etc. would be very efficient if the heat transfer were ballistic. We present a series of experiments based on Infrared thermography to support this phenomenon in Lithium Niobate at room temperature.\nTo summarize, this dissertation introduces a new experimental technique for thermal characterization of materials and interfaces at small length scales. It also probes the length scale induced coupling between multiple physical domains. Though the majority of it is fundamental in nature, a segment of this dissertation deals with developing a novel thermoelectric generator that has a direct application. The other results obtained in this dissertation will enhance the understanding of thermal properties of materials and act as groundwork for future endeavors in this field.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12500], "author_name_tesi": "Pulavarthy, Raghu ", "last_name_ssi": "Pulavarthy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Raghu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque", "Md Amanul Haque", "Adrianus Van Duin", "Tak Sing Wong", "Michael T Lanagan", "Karen Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque, Dissertation Advisor", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Chair", "Adrianus Van Duin, Committee Member", "Tak Sing Wong, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Outside Member", "Karen Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermal conductivity", "interfacial thermal resistance", "multi-domain coupling", "thin films", "size effect", "thermoelectric"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF  3-DIMENSIONAL NETWORKS OF DIFFERENT NANOCARBONS", "id": "13170lzp130", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13170", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit unique optical, thermal, electrical and mechanical properties. Even though they have been around for more than two decades, there are still many challenges related to the viability of using them for practical applications. One of the main challenges is to engineer their assembly via covalent interconnections to produce macro-scale structures. The first part of this thesis describes recent findings related to a novel and innovative synthesis approach for synthesizing three-dimensional (3-D) CNT networks. In particular, this approach consists of fabricating 3-D covalently interconnected multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) with silicon carbide (SiC) nano- and micro-particles. The material was synthesized by a two-step process involving the coating of MWNTs with silicon oxide (SiOx) via chemical routes, followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). SPS enables the use of high temperatures and mechanical pressures, which are required for the carbothermal reduction of silica and the densification of the material into 3-D composite blocks. Covalent interconnections of MWNTs are created by a carbon diffusion process resulting in SiC formation. Interestingly, the 3-D MWNT composite exhibits high thermal conductivity values (16.72 W m-1 K-1); up to two orders of magnitude higher than comparable nanocarbon-based materials. From an electrical point of view, this material exhibits a semiconducting behavior with an electron hopping mechanism associated to 3-D variable range hopping (VRH). Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to fabricate macro-scale MWNT-based composites with enhanced physical properties from covalent interconnections.\nIt is well known that varying growth conditions and precursor compositions drastically change the structural, physical and electronic properties of CNTs (multi- and single-walled). Elemental doping of CNTs was also explored in thesis, in an effort to establish covalent interconnections between CNTs. The structure-property changes induced by doping were also carefully analyzed and studied.  The synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) doped with silicon (Si) is reported in Chapter 3 of this thesis. It was found that depending on the Si concentration, the bundle electronic transport of SWNTs could be tuned. The Si doped SWNT (Si-SWNTs) samples were grown using an aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) approach. A detailed analysis of the Raman spectra and radial breathing modes (RBMs) of Si-SWNTs led to the conclusion that the diameter of SWNTs is reduced after Si doping. Experimental transport measurements revealed drastic changes in the electrical resistivity of Si-SWNTs when compared to pristine SWNTs. \nThe roles of sulfur and boron during the growth of MWNTs were also explored in this study. These elemental dopants were responsible for significant changes in the nanotube morphology and electronic properties. For example, boron doping induced the formation of \u201celbow\u201d-like junctions on the MWNTs and entangled MWNTs networks, exhibiting a sponge-like texture. In addition, 3-D branched \u201ctentacle\u201d-like structures with numerous covalent junctions were synthesized by adding very small amounts (<1 at%) of boron and sulfur during the AACVD synthesis of MWNTs. Chapter 4 discusses the structure, properties and potential applications of these tentacle-like carbon morphologies. Finally, Chapter 5 describes future work and perspectives related to the controlled synthesis of covalently interconnected 3-D architectures with carbon nanotubes. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12890], "author_name_tesi": "Pulickal Rajukumar, Lakshmy ", "last_name_ssi": "Pulickal Rajukumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lakshmy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mauricio Terrones Maldonado", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado", "Joshua Alexander Robinson", "Nasim Alem", "John V Badding"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mauricio Terrones Maldonado, Dissertation Advisor", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado, Committee Chair", "Joshua Alexander Robinson, Committee Member", "Nasim Alem, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Carbon nanotubes", "three-dimensional networks", "nanocomposite", "Covalent interconnections", "synthesis", "chemical vapor deposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF BENEFICIAL MICROBES ON PLANT-VIRUS-VECTOR INTERACTIONS INVOLVING SOYBEAN", "id": "13424hwp103", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13424", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soil-borne microorganisms can have significant effects on aboveground interactions between plants and other organisms.

As a result, microbe-plant associations may indirectly modify the interactions among plants, herbivorous insects and parasitoids.

We examined how two species of beneficial rhizobacteria\u2014the plant growth promoter rhizobacteria (PGPR) species Delftia acidovorans, which lives in the rhizosphere in close association with root surfaces, and the nitrogen-fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum\u2014influence the interactions of soybean plants (Glycine max cultivar Williams 82) with the herbivorous beetle Epilachna varivestis, which vectors an economically important pathogen of cultivated soybean, Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) and with the parasitoid wasp Pediobius foveolatus. In a multi-factorial experiment, we characterized the volatile organic compounds (VOC), the primary and secondary leaf metabolites and the transcriptome produced by soybean plants in the presence/absence of the two rhizobacteria and with or without infection by BPMV. Our results indicate that BPMV infection and inoculation with beneficial rhizobacteria cause dramatic changes in metabolites and genes related with plant nutrition and defense, with significant consequences for soybean interactions with an important herbivore and virus vector.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13570, 13571, 13572], "author_name_tesi": "Pulido Barrios, Hannier ", "last_name_ssi": "Pulido Barrios", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hannier", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Mescher", "Andrew Stephenson", "Consuelo de Moraes", "John Frazier Tooker", "Cristina Rosa", "Naomi S Altman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Mescher, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Stephenson, Committee Chair", "Consuelo de Moraes, Committee Member", "John Frazier Tooker, Committee Member", "Cristina Rosa, Outside Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Beneficial rhizobacteria", "multi-trophic interactions", "parasitoid wasps", "metabolomics", "transcriptomics", "VOCs", "plant volatiles", "herbivory"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Electron Transfer and the Roles of Flavins during Iron(III) Reduction by Shewanella Oneidensis", "id": "17694", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8647", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThe purpose of our investigation is to explore the terminal electron-transfer reaction of Shewanella oneidensis, a dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium (DMRB), during the anaerobic respiration of Fe3+-oxides. Our study proceeds on two scales: the molecular and the electronic. Our molecular-level work focuses on the binding of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and riboflavin (RBF), the two flavins secreted by Shewanella, which have been shown to be vital for Fe3+-oxide reduction by Canstein et al. (2008), to Fe3+-oxides and aqueous Fe3+ through the use of flow-adsorption calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and Gibbs free-energy and vibrational-frequency calculations. Our electronic-level work focuses on the electron transfer from cytochrome STC, a periplasmic electron-transfer protein of Shewanella, to aqueous Fe3+-EDTA, a proxy system for Fe3+-oxide respiration with well-defined parameters, through the use of Gibbs free-energy and electron-transfer calculations and the results of stopped-flow kinetics experiments previously completed by Qian et al.

By doing this, we can benchmark our computational methods and reveal molecular- and electronic-level details, such as binding structures and electron-transfer rates, that cannot be obtained by experiment alone. Our findings from the first phase of our study are consistent with a functional difference between FMN and RBF as electron shuttles and a possible role of FMN and RBF as chelators during Fe3+ reduction. Our findings from the second phase of our study are consistent with electron transfer from cytochrome to electron shuttle being the rate-limiting step in the overall Fe3+-reduction reaction and reveal important differences between molecular- and electronic-level behavior based on differences between thermodynamic and quantum mechanical processes.

In this thesis, we explore the electronic properties of graphene structures from several perspectives including the magnetoelectrical transport properties of monolayer graphene, gap engineering and measurements in bilayer graphene, and anomalous quantum oscillation in the monolayer-bilayer graphene hybrids. We also explored the device implications of our findings, and the application of some experimental techniques developed for the graphene work to the study of a complex oxide, Ca3Ru2O7, exhibiting properties of strongly correlated electrons.\n\nGraphene's high mobility and ballistic transport over device length scales, make it suitable for numerous applications.  However, two big challenges remain in the way: maintaining high mobility in fabricated devices, and engineering a band gap to make graphene compatible with logical electronics and various optical devices.  We address the first challenge by experimentally evaluating mobilities in scalable monolayer graphene-based field effect transistors (FETs) and dielectric-covered Hall bars.  We find that the mobility is limited in these devices, and is roughly inversely proportional to doping.  By considering interaction of graphene's Dirac fermions with with local charged impurities at the interface between graphene and the top-gate dielectric, we find that Coulomb scattering is responsible for degraded mobility.\n\nEven in the cleanest devices, a band gap is still desirable for electronic applications of graphene.  We address this challenge by probing the band structure of bilayer graphene, in which a field-tunable energy band gap has been theoretically proposed. We use planar tunneling spectroscopy of exfoliated bilayer graphene flakes demonstrate both measurement and control of the energy band gap.  We find that both the Fermi level and electronic structure are highly sensitive to tunnel bias-induced charging in these devices, an effect that is traditionally neglected in other materials.  However, careful consideration of both these effects and non-ideal tunneling processes allows extraction of valuable information from the tunneling spectra.  We compare the tunable insulating state to our transport studies of bilayer graphene-based FETs with similar dielectric environments.  This work, as well as our work on top-gated monolayer-based devices, identifies the integration of graphene and a gate dielectric as being the next great challenge towards the realization of graphene-based electronics.\n\nWe also report the discovery of anomalous quantum oscillations in magnetotransport measurements of monolayer and bilayer graphene hybrids.  In these graphene hybrid structures, the Fermi levels of either portion lock at their interface, and the greatly different energy scales of emergent Landau levels support strong charge imbalance.  The nature the interface states are yet to be clarified.\n\nFinally, we extend the techniques of device fabrication and measurement to exfoliated flakes of a layered material, Ca3Ru2O7.  This strongly correlated electronic system hosts a variety of exotic phenomena at low temperatures, which have been suggested to result from complex $d$-orbital interactions.  We compare transport measurements of flakes to previous studies in bulk crystals, and explore the effects of tuning charge carrier density using an ionic liquid gate to induce densities several orders of magnitude greater than is possible with conventional dielectrics.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7658], "author_name_tesi": "Puls, Conor P", "last_name_ssi": "Puls", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Conor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Ying Liu", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Qi Li", "Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Ying Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Qi Li, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["graphene", "bilayer", "hybrid", "band gap engineering", "impurity scattering", "Ca3Ru2O7"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ENGINEERED BIOMIMICRY: POLYMERIC REPLICATION OF THE SURFACE OF A COMPOUND EYE OF AN INSECT\n\n", "id": "10795", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1532", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The conformal-evaporated-film-by-rotation (CEFR) technique was modified to improve the uniformity of roughly 800-nm-thick films deposited on nonplanar biological templates and this modified-CEFR technique was implemented in the fabrication of high fidelity nickel dies that may be used to produce multiple replicas by casting or stamping. The CEFR technique was developed to produce high-fidelity replicas of the surfaces of biological specimen. By thermally evaporating a robust inorganic material in high-vacuum conditions while rapidly rotating the sample about the surface normal to a substrate on which a biotemplate is mounted while the substrate is held obliquely with respect to the direction of incident vapor flux, it is possible to produce a coating on a biotemplate that conforms to the surface features of the biotemplate. An inorganic replica can be made by removing the original biotemplate by plasma ashing. It was thought that the CEFR technique many not perform ideally when highly nonplanar biotemplates were to be replicated. To investigate if this was the case a series of common blowfly corneas were coated and their thickness and morphological uniformity evaluated. In an effort to adapt the CEFR technique to use with nonplanar biotemplates rotation about a second axis lying wholly in the substrate plane was introduced. The rotation about this second axis was tailored to produce a more uniform time-averaged vapor flux over the whole sample. Film thickness and morphology were observed for both CEFR and modified-CEFR produced films and compared. The modified-CEFR coating showed half the variation in film thickness over the sample when compared to the CEFR produced coating. It was shown that film structure varied over the surface of CEFR produced coatings while the modified-CEFR produced coating exhibited a uniform film structure over the entire sample. \n\nWith the modified-CEFR technique established I set out to produce a die that could be used to produce multiple replicas from a single biotemplate. This was done by a combination of the modified-CEFR technique and nickel electroforming. An approximately 250-nm-thick amorphous nickel film was deposited on an array of blowfly corneas to capture the surface features of the cornea in high fidelity and then a roughly 60-micron-thick structural layer was electroformed onto the thin film layer to give it the structural integrity needed for casting or stamping. The feature resolution of this die was then evaluated and PDMS castings made using the die.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1517], "author_name_tesi": "Pulsifer, Drew  Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Pulsifer", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Drew ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Akhlesh Lakhtakia", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Thesis Advisor", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Conformal-Evaporated-Film-by-Rotation", "Biomimetics", "Biomimicry", "Bioreplication"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Thermally Evaporated Conformal Thin Films on Non-Traditional/Non-Planar Substrates", "id": "19793", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9397", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conformal thin films have a wide variety of uses in the microelectronics, optics, and coatings industries. The ever-increasing capabilities of these conformal thin films have enabled tremendous technological advancement in the last half century. During this period, new thin-film deposition techniques have been developed and refined. While these techniques have remarkable performance for traditional applications which utilize planar substrates such as silicon wafers, they are not suitable for the conformal coating of non-traditional substrates such as biological material.\n\nThe process of thermally evaporating a material under vacuum conditions is one of the oldest\nthin-film deposition techniques which is able to produce functional film morphologies. A drawback\nof thermally evaporated thin films is that they are not intrinsically conformal. To overcome this, while maintaining the advantages of thermal evaporation, a procedure for varying the substrates orientation with respect to the incident vapor flux during deposition was developed immediately prior to the research undertaken for this doctoral dissertation. This process was shown to greatly improve the conformality of thermally evaporated thin films. This development allows for several applications of thermally evaporated conformal thin films on non-planar/non-traditional substrates.\n\nThree settings in which to evaluate the improved conformal deposition of thermally evaporated\nthin films were investigated for this dissertation. In these settings the thin-film morphologies are of different types. In the first setting, a bioreplication approach was used to fabricate artificial visual decoys for the invasive species Agrilus planipennis, commonly known as the emerald ash borer (EAB). The mating behavior of this species involves an overflying EAB male pouncing on an EAB female at rest on an ash leaflet before copulation. The male spots the female on the leaflet by visually detecting the iridescent green color of the female\u2019s elytra. As rearing EAB and then deploying dead females as decoys is both arduous and inconvenient, the development of an artificial decoy would be of great interest to entomologists and foresters. A dead female EAB\nwas used to make a negative die of nickel and a positive die of epoxy. The process of fabricating the paired dies utilized thermally evaporated conformal thin films in several critical steps. In order to conformally coat the EAB with nickel, the substrate stage holding the female EAB was periodically rocked and rotated during the deposition. This process was designed to result in a uniform thin film of \u223c 500-nm thickness with dense morphology. The nickel film was then reinforced through an electroforming process and mounted in a fixture which allowed it to be heated electrically. The corresponding positive die was replicated from the negative die through a series of successive castings. The final EAB positive die was fabricated from a hard epoxy material and attached to a fixture which allowed it to be heated while being pressed into the negative die. Decoys were then made by first depositing a quarter-wave-stack Bragg reflector on a polymer sheet and then stamping it with the pair of matched negative and positive dies to take the shape of the upper surface of an EAB female. As nearly 100 decoys were fabricated from just one EAB female, this bioreplication process is industrially scalable. Preliminary results from field trapping tests are indicative of success.\n\nFor the second setting, a method of developing latent fingermarks with thermally evaporated\nconformal thin films was developed. Fingermarks have long been used to identify the individual\nwho left them behind when he/she touched an object with the friction ridges of his/her\nhands. In many cases the fingermark which is left behind consists of sebaceous secretions which are not clearly visible under normal conditions. In order to make the fingermarks visible and identifiable, they are traditionally developed by either a physical technique which relies on a material preferentially sticking to sebaceous materials or a chemical technique which relies on a reaction with material within the fingermark. In this application, a columnar thin film (CTF) is deposited conformally over both the fingermark and the underlying substrate. The CTF is produced by the conformal-evaporated-film-by-rotation method, wherein the substrate with the fingermark upon it is held obliquely with respect to a vapor flux in a vacuum chamber. The substrate is then rapidly rotated about its surface normal resulting in a conformal film with columnar morphology. This technique was optimized for several substrates and compared with traditional development techniques. CTF development was found to be superior to traditional techniques in several cases. Use of the CTF was investigated for several types of particularly difficult to develop fingermarks such as those which consist of both bloody and nonbloody areas, and fingermarks on fired cartridge casings. The CTF technique\u2019s sensitivity was also compared to that of traditional development techniques. Finally, the CTF technique was compared with\nanother thin film deposition technique called vacuum-metal deposition.\n\nThe final setting in which thermally evaporated conformal thin films were evaluated in this dissertation is to enable the experimental observation of the Dyakonov\u2013Tamm wave. The Dyakonov\u2013Tamm wave was predicted to be guided by the interface of two materials, at least one of which\nis both periodically non-homogeneous in the direction perpendicular to the interface plane and anisotropic. A dense magnesium-fluoride thin film and a zinc-selenide chiral sculptured thin film were selected to provide such an interface. The structural properties of the chiral sculptured thin film were designed to give the zinc-selenide layer, in conjunction with the magnesium-fluoride layer, the optical properties required to support the propagation of a Dyakonov\u2013Tamm wave. The Dyakonov\u2013Tamm wave was first demonstrated in the prism-coupled configuration and then in the grating-coupled configuration. For the case of the grating-coupled configuration, the zinc-selenide-chiral sculptured thin film was deposited on a non-planar substrate consisting of a periodic grating fabricated from magnesium fluoride.\n\nIn concert these three applications of thermally evaporated conformal thin films on nonplanar/\nnon-traditional substrates demonstrate that the poor intrinsic conformality of thermal evaporation can be overcome. Additionally, the poor intrinsic conformality can be overcome while still maintaining the advantages of being able to deposit an array of materials and produce morphologies which are essential to the function of a device of process. The use of thermal evaporation allows thin films with dense morphology to be deposited in the first setting, vertical columnar morphology in the second setting, and a helical morphology in the third setting.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9196], "author_name_tesi": "Pulsifer, Drew  Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Pulsifer", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Drew ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Akhlesh Lakhtakia", "Jian Xu", "Vladimir V Semak", "Carlo G Pantano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Dissertation Advisor", "Jian Xu, Committee Member", "Vladimir V Semak, Committee Member", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Conformal Thin Films", "Thermal Evaporation", "Bioreplication", "Forensics", "Electromagnetic Surface Waves"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development And Validation Of a Test Stake Perception Measure", "id": "17622", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8068", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High stake testing has become a prominent issue in education and there is constant debate regarding the costs and benefits of such practice.

Scoring rubrics are often used to achieve this goal by promoting inter-rater agreement evaluating performances (Johnson, Penny, & Gordon, 2009). More recently, some scholars (e.g., Goffin, Gellatly, Paunonen, Jackson, & Meyer, 1996; Goffin & Olson, 2011; Pollitt, 2004, 2012) advocated for the use of comparative judgment, a scoring procedure adopted from the Thurstone\u2019s (Thurstone, 1927a) Law of Comparative Judgment, to replace scoring rubrics in performance assessment. It was argued that the comparative judgment method holds multiple advantages over scoring rubrics. Empirically, some studies were able to show that evaluations elicited via comparative judgment methods had higher criterion-related validity evidence (Goffin et al., 1996; Goffin, Jelley, Powell, & Johnston, 2009; McMahon & Jones, 2014; Olson, Goffin, & Haynes, 2007; Shah, Bradley, Parekh, Wainwright, & Ramchandran, 2013). However, comparative judgment in its original implementation has major drawbacks including laborious evaluation process, not able to discern the absolute quality of the performance, and unable to communicate the evaluation standards to examinee effectively. In this study, a new implementation of the comparative judgment method termed authentic rubric was proposed. The authentic rubric replaced the scoring categories in the scoring rubric with expert evaluated performances and asked the raters to compare performances to be evaluated against these anchors.\n22 raters were recruited to evaluate 100 argumentative essays using either a holistic rubric or the proposed authentic rubric. The authentic rubrics were constructed by selecting essays evaluated by two professional raters. Five hypotheses related to user experience, psychometric properties of the evaluations, and efficiency of the evaluation process were proposed and tested. Among the five hypotheses, only one was confirmed and showed that raters who used authentic rubric found the evaluation experience to be more enjoyable.

However, the existing literature fails to provide national estimates of the mental health status and the utilization patterns of psychotherapeutic medications of U.S. cancer survivors. In addition, the current literature the current literature has limited information about the ambulatory mental health visits and the utilization of psychotherapeutic medicines by cancer survivors\u2019 spouses. \nObjectives: Therefore, the current study aims to: 1) To describe the mental health status, ambulatory mental health visits, and psychotherapeutic medicines utilization of U.S. cancer survivors and their spouses. 2) To compare mental health status, ambulatory mental health visits, and psychotherapeutic medicine utilization between the oncology population (cancer survivors and their spouses) and the general population. 3) To identify the predictors of mental health status, ambulatory mental health visits, and psychotherapeutic medicine utilization within the oncology population.\nData: The primary source of data is six years (2001-2006) of interviews from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Household Component (MEPS-HC) linked to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). \nStudy population: The compiled data set includes 2,636 individuals with a history of cancer and 1,126 spouses of cancer survivors. Out of 2,636 cancer survivors, 381 are incident cancer cases and 2,255 are prevalent cancer cases. \nMeasures: The unit of analysis is an individual with or without a history of cancer diagnosis, or that person\u2019s spouse. Mental health status is measured by the mental component scores (MCS-12) of the Short Form-12 (version 2) Health Survey, psychological distress is measured by the Kessler Index (K6) scores, and depression is measured by Patient Health Questionnaire. Ambulatory mental health visit is measured by the total annual number of visits made to outpatient department, emergency room, or physician\u2019s office due to mental health disorders. Psychotropic drug utilization is measured by the total annual number of psychotropic drug prescriptions. \nAnalysis: The univariate analysis was conducted using independent t-tests and chi-square to examine statistical differences in mental health status, ambulatory mental health visits and psychotropic drug utilization between the oncology population and the general population. Then, multivariate regression analysis of mental health scores, psychological distress, depression, ambulatory mental health visits, and psychotropic drug utilization was conducted as a function of cancer diagnosis or cancer history, demographic factors, socio-economic factors, and medical factors to determine the relative explanatory power of each set of predictor variables. A separate multivariate regression analysis was conducted for the oncology population, in order to investigate the relative significance of each set of predictor variables within the oncology group.\nResults: Cancer survivors have lower mental health status, higher psychological distress, and higher odds of being depressed than the general population. Similar to cancer survivors, cancer survivors\u2019 spouses have lower mental health status, higher psychological distress, and higher odds of being depressed compared to spouses of non-cancer adults. The utilization of psychotherapeutic medicines is 1.3-1.4 percentage points higher for the oncology population than the general population, but cancer survivors and their spouses are no more likely to make ambulatory mental health related visits than the general population.\nPolicy Implications: This study reinforces the argument that cancer care providers need to routinely screen cancer patients and their spouses for mental health problems and assess their psychosocial health needs. Oncologists and primary care providers should make extensive assessment of the psychological needs of cancer survivors or their spouses with low education or chronic conditions and direct them to appropriate psychosocial services. Cancer care providers, if possible, should provide counseling and psychotherapy services in addition to psychopharmacotherapy services or should link cancer patients and their family members to organizations that provide counseling and psychotherapy services. This study suggests that gynecological cancer survivors have an unmet need for psychosocial services and therefore need routine screening, evaluation and treatment for mental health problems. \nLimitations: MEPS and NHIS lack information about the stage of cancer and the type of treatment. Consequently, we were unable to investigate the influence of cancer stage and treatment modality on mental health status, mental services utilization and psychotherapeutic medication utilization. MEPS and NHIS also lack information about the mental health status of cancer survivors and their spouses prior to cancer diagnosis. As a result, we were not able to assess the influence of prior psychiatric history (or mental health before cancer diagnosis) on mental health status, mental health visits and psychotherapeutic medication utilization after cancer diagnosis. The data do not have adequate sample sizes to describe the mental health status, mental health related ambulatory visits, and utilization of psychotropic medicines of patients with less prevalent cancer sites such as brain and bone cancers. The utilization of psychotherapeutic medications and mental health visits is self-reported, not based on medical records or insurance claims.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5321], "author_name_tesi": "Punekar, Rajeshwari S", "last_name_ssi": "Punekar", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Rajeshwari", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pamela Farley Short", "Pamela Farley Short", "John Raymond Moran Jr.", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "Elana Farace"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pamela Farley Short, Dissertation Advisor", "Pamela Farley Short, Committee Chair", "John Raymond Moran Jr., Committee Member", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Member", "Elana Farace, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cancer Survivors", "Cancer", "Psychotherapeutic Medications", "Ambulatory Mental Health Visits", "Mental Health"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "To Assemble, or not to Assemble: The Initiation of Retroviral Capsid Assembly", "id": "10244", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2688", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "During the complex multistep process of retroviral maturation the immature Gag lattice is cleaved apart prior to the formation of the mature capsid shell. Proper maturation and capsid assembly are required for infectivity. The capsid protein (CA) contains two domains [N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD)] and self-assembles to enclose the genomic RNA and other viral proteins. Retroviral capsids are highly polymorphic, exhibiting a wide-range of structures, and were previously modeled as a lattice consisting of 12 CA pentamers unequally distributed among 150 - 300 hexameric rings. Three CA-CA interfaces form between assembled subunits in the mature capsid: NTD-NTD, NTD-CTD, and CTD-CTD. Very little is known about the mechanism and pathway of assembly that form the mature capsid despite being attractive targets for antiviral therapy. A full understanding of events occurring during maturation, including capsid assembly will require further advances such as: 1. establishing how the cleavage products of Gag reorganize to stimulate capsid assembly during maturation, 2. defining how the CA subunits self-assemble, 3. characterizing the CA pentamer and its interaction with the previously characterized hexamer, and 4. visualizing the capsid lattice at an atomic resolution to guide inhibitor development. Understanding capsid assembly and structure will help to elucidate how the capsid interacts with other viral components to provide necessary functions during the early stages of viral replication. \n\nAncillary information suggests that the assembly of the capsid is nucleated at a specific location in the maturing virion following Gag cleavage. The presumptive nucleation event is explored in greater detail in this thesis using protein from Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a novel in vitro system that, at least for RSV, recapitulates many features of capsid assembly occurring in the virus. Results clearly demonstrate that RSV CA assembles via a nucleation-driven mechanism in vitro. Assembly was demonstrated to be electrostatically controlled and multivalent anionic salts were demonstrated to induce CA to form structures resembling authentic mature capsids. A complex as small as a CA dimer acted as a seed for assembly was demonstrated by isolating intermediates of the capsid assembly pathway. Biochemical evidence combined with genetic analyses supports the proposal that a similar nucleation step happens in the maturing virion. \n\nThe conserved major homology region (MHR) in the CTD was shown to be required for proper initiation of capsid assembly. Lethal MHR mutations were suppressed by secondary substitutions located in the NTD and CTD that increased the propensity of CA to assemble in vitro. The results are consistent with CA undergoing structural transformations during maturation. Proteolytic cleavage of Gag results in the accumulation of a transient CA-SP (spacer peptide, C-terminal of CA) intermediate. CA-SP enhanced the kinetics of in vitro assembly. The data suggest that CA-SP participates in nucleation of capsid assembly and the MHR participates in an early step of assembly. \n\nIdentifying icosahedral particles formed by multimerization of RSV CA protein permitted the development of a pseudo-atomic model for the retroviral CA pentamer. The data are the first description of all three mature CA-CA interactions (NTD-NTD, NTD-CTD, CTD-CTD) forming in pentamers and hexamers. Although further research is needed to understand the polymorphic nature of retroviral capsids, the results provide a major step forward in understanding the architecture of mature capsids at the atomic level. The data further support a model whereby initiation of capsid assembly involves a tripartite interaction between two NTDs and one CTD. The model invokes a critical participatory role not previously described for the interdomain NTD-CTD interaction in forming a functional retroviral capsid.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2683], "author_name_tesi": "Purdy, John Gerard", "last_name_ssi": "Purdy", "middle_name_ssi": "Gerard", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rebecca C Craven", "Rebecca C Craven", "Sarah Bronson", "Ira Joseph Ropson", "David Joseph Spector", "John Warren Wills"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rebecca C Craven, Dissertation Advisor", "Rebecca C Craven, Committee Chair", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["retroviruses", "virus structure", "electron microscopy", "capsid assembly", "nucleation", "CA protein"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Influence of Eukaryotic Microflora on the Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in Compost Slurry\n\n\n", "id": "10388", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "534", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An increasing number of food-borne illnesses are associated with the consumption of fresh produce, leading to a growing interest in the development of strategies to minimize preharvest contamination. Compost made from livestock manure is commonly used as a crop fertilizer and serves as a possible route of transmission for Escherichia coli O157:H7 spread to fresh produce. Therefore, a better understanding of factors contributing to the survival of E. coli O157:H7 in compost material is essential to ensure produce safety. In this study, we hypothesized that the indigenous microflora present in composts adversely affects the survival of E. coli O157:H7.  E. coli O157:H7 exhibited a ~4 log reduction in survival over a period of 16 days. At 37&#730;C, the pathogen was undetectable by day 15. When compost was supplemented with the eukaryotic inhibitor cycloheximide, E. coli O157:H7 exhibited a significant improvement in survival. Analysis of microbial communities present in the compost with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) suggested minor differences in the fungal communities present in cycloheximide treated compost compared to untreated compost over a period of 8 days. However, DGGE profiles of protists showed significant differences in community complexity. In addition we found that in the absence of moisture, there was no significant difference in survival of E. coli O157:H7 in the cycloheximide-amended compost. It is speculated that protists excyst in moisture-rich compost and feed on E. coli O157:H7. This leads us to conclude that predation of E. coli O157:H7 by protists might be a potential mechanism of killing E. coli O157:H7 in compost materials.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [531], "author_name_tesi": "Puri, Amrita ", "last_name_ssi": "Puri", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amrita", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward G Dudley", "Edward G Dudley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward G Dudley, Thesis Advisor", "Edward G Dudley, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["compost", "E. coli O157:H7", "survival"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Formation and Development of Moral Literacy as a Component of Pre-service Teacher Identity", "id": "9832", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1658", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines the contribution to and impact of formal teacher training education programs on the personal and professional development of pre-service teachers\u2019 moral literacy.

A grounded theory methodology was adopted to conduct the study with fourteen pre-service teachers enrolled in an elementary education teacher education program at a large public university in the state of Pennsylvania. \nA number of variables emerged through the analysis process during the research study including \u201centry\u201d, \u201cmotivation to become an educator\u201d, \u201cprofessional relationships, \u201cunderstandings of learning\u201d, \u201cexperiences informing a teacher identity\u201d, \u201cvalues and beliefs\u201d, \u201cexperiences informing moral literacy\u201d, and  \u201cconnections to teaching\u201d.

The overall aim of the current study is the establishment of a unified theory accommodating the various processes and mechanisms involved in the combustion and ignition of aluminum particles at micro and nano scales. A comprehensive review on the ignition and combustion of aluminum particles at multi scales was first performed identifying various processes and mechanisms involved. Research focus was also placed on the establishment of a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation tool to investigate the characteristics of nano-particulate aluminum through three major studies. The general computational framework involved parallelized pre-processing, post-processing and main code with capability to simulate different ensembles using appropriate algorithms. Size dependence of melting temperature of pure aluminum particles was investigated in the first study. Phenomena like dynamic co-existence of solid and liquid phase and effect of surface charges on melting were explored. The second study involved the study of effect of defects in the form of voids on melting of bulk and particulate phase aluminum. The third MD study was used to analyze the thermo-mechanical behavior of nano-sized aluminum particles with total diameter of 5-10 nm and oxide thickness of 1-2.5 nm. The ensuing solid-solid and solid-liquid phase changes in the core and shell, stresses developed within the shell, and the diffusion of aluminum cations in the oxide layer, were explored in depth for amorphous and crystalline oxide layers. In the limiting case, the condition for pyrophoricity/explosivity of nano-particulate aluminum was analyzed and modified. The size dependence of thermodynamic properties at nano scales were considered and incorporated into the existing theories developed for micro and larger scales. Finally, a phenomenological theory for ignition and combustion of aluminum particles was proposed. The whole time history from ignition till particle burnout was divided into five stages. An attempt was made to explore different modes of ignition based on the effect of pressure, temperature, oxidizer, oxide thickness and particle diameter and was investigated using length and time scales involved during ignition and combustion.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4997], "author_name_tesi": "Puri, Puneesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Puri", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Puneesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Vigor Yang", "Richard A Yetter", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Robert Francis Kunz", "Dr Steve Son"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Vigor Yang, Committee Chair", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Robert Francis Kunz, Committee Member", "Dr Steve Son, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ignition and Combustion", "Energetic Materials", "Nano Scales", "Aluminum", "Modeling", "Molecular Dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Influence of Loss Aversion on Mountain Bikers' Behavioral Intentions\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9255", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "376", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Individuals often behave differently in response to potential losses than to potential gains.

It is important to know whether or not members of other linguistic traditions have words for the concept of leisure or related terms.

First, I had researchers identify words related to leisure as well as characteristics associate with the term. Second, I created a survey measuring the perceived similarity of the terms among a sample of academics and a sample of non-academics. Third, I had native speakers of Chinese and Persian complete a translation/back-translation task using the terms in order to identify possible translations of the domain terms for each language. \nThe findings suggest the academic and non-academic samples share some similarities in their perceptions of the leisure terms domain.

Under normal circumstances, this network forces the cells to be non-motile.  However, it is possible for these cells to become motile during embryonic morphogenesis and the metastasis of epithelial cancers.  This movement is prompted by a variety of growth factors such as HGF that can cause epithelial cell line scattering and motility in vitro.  The binding of HGF to its receptor c-Met has the ability to stimulate the activation of PI3-kinase and the small GTPase Ras.  Ras and other subfamily members such as R-ras have been known to play a role in proliferation and cell survival as well as cell migration and morphology. The small GTPase Arf6, which regulates actin cytoskeletal organization and can be activated by HGF, has also been associated with, and is required for, epithelial cell movement. While it is known that R-Ras and Arf6 are both required for epithelial motility, the signaling pathway linking these components to cell shape changes remains unclear.  Therefore, we hypothesize that R-ras and Arf6 are downstream of the HGF-cMet signal transduction pathway to regulate epithelial cell migration. \n\tThe involvement of the Ras related protein, R-Ras, within this pathway was initially investigated via a morphological study.  R-ras activity was altered using either dominant negative or constitutively active mutants and cell morphology and migration was monitored.  A reduction in R-ras activity inhibited cell spreading and scattering after stimulation with HGF while constant R-ras activity led to cell scattering without further addition of HGF, as had been previously shown. The migration promoted by active R-ras was inhibited by the addition of SecinH3, a cytohesin inhibitor. These observations were further supported by western blot analysis of Arf6 activation in the mutant expressing cells.  A decrease in R-ras activity reduced Arf6 activation in the presence of HGF. The constant activation of R-ras also caused a decrease in Arf6 activation in the presence of HGF. Together, this data shows that R-Ras is downstream of the HGF-c-Met signal transduction pathway and has the ability to alter cell shape and migration.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2237], "author_name_tesi": "Pursel, Heather ", "last_name_ssi": "Pursel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lorraine C Santy", "Lorraine C Santy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lorraine C Santy, Thesis Advisor", "Lorraine C Santy, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cell migration", "GTPase"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Dye Sensitized solar cells based on nanowire sculptured thin film titanium dioxide photoanodes\n", "id": "12038", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5700", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Energy harvested from the sun using photovoltaics (PVs) is a renewable resource in high demand.

PVs currently produce 0.15% of the energy consumed in the US. Production needs to grow as the worldwide demand for energy is projected to almost double by 2050.  \n\tFundamental and device based PV research have made steady efficiency gains in silicon based devices and thin film devices have started to become commercially viable. However, less expensive devices with suitable efficiency have not been fully developed. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one such device which has been optimized using standard components. However, device efficiency has not increased significantly since DSSCs were first conceived in 1991. Interestingly, none of the standard components are optimized, but act in a synergistic way in the most efficient devices.  This research, along with other parallel research, attempts to optimize a single component of DSSCs with the goal of combining efforts to produce a device with increased efficiency.\n\tThis research attempts to optimize the TiO2 photoanode used in DSSCs in terms of electron collection, dye coverage, light harvesting, and novel electrolyte infiltration by replacing the standard colloidal structure with nanowires deposited using physical vapor deposition at an oblique angle to form sculptured thin films. The results are quantified through standard photovoltaic testing, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, and general materials characterization techniques. The nanowire photoanodes are engineered during deposition using reactive evaporation, substrate heating, substrate positioning/movement, and co-deposition.

Device performance using standard dye and electrolyte is shown to be closely matched to that of colloidal based devices constructed as control samples. Along with optimized dye and electrolytes these nanowire based photoanodes should be considered for the research and development of a fully optimized DSSC which would operate more efficiently than the current state of the art.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5695], "author_name_tesi": "Pursel, Sean M.", "last_name_ssi": "Pursel", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Sean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark William Horn", "Mark William Horn", "Jian Xu", "Barbara Shaw", "Joan Marie Redwing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark William Horn, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark William Horn, Committee Chair", "Jian Xu, Committee Member", "Barbara Shaw, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sculptured thin film", "dye sensitized solar cell", "nanowire", "photoanode"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EXPERIMENTAL INSIGHT INTO CHEMICALLY TUNED WATERFLOODING IN OIL-WET CARBONATE RESERVOIRS", "id": "14789pxp5185", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14789", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Brine composition is known to affect the effectiveness of waterflooding during enhanced oil recovery from oil\u2013wet carbonate reservoirs. Salinity, pH and ion composition of the injecting brine have been identified as important factors toward altering the wettability of the carbonate rocks to a more water\u2013wet system. In particular, the importance of Mg2+, Ca2+, and SO42- ions have been identified as critical for incremental oil recovery via wettability alteration. To further explore the chemical mechanism of wettability alteration and to evaluate the individual contribution of these ions toward improving oil recovery, a series of waterflood experiments with different ionic composition was performed at 90oC. Characterization techniques like Zeta potential, contact angle, and trace element analysis were performed to evaluate the surface interactions taking place among the rock, the brine solution, and the crude oil. Zeta potential measurements highlight the affinity of Mg2+, Ca2+, and SO42- ions toward the rock surface in chemically tuned brines, where, an increase in the magnitude of Zeta potential was observed corresponding to the increase in the concentration of each of these ions in the suspension. Oil recovery measurements show an increase for all chemically tuned brines, when compared to recoveries obtained from plain seawater injection. Relative permeability estimations and contact angle measurements show corresponding trends of increasing water\u2013wetness. Maximum recovery of ~76% original oil in place (OOIP) was observed for the brine with increased Mg2+ ion concentration due to higher activity of Mg2+ ions and their ability to replace Ca2+ ions from the rock surface. A lower recovery of ~64% OOIP was seen for the brine with increased Ca2+ ion concentration due to lower activity of Ca2+ ions as opposed to Mg2+ ions. Further lower recovery of ~59% OOIP was seen for the brine with increased SO42- ion concentration due to the precipitation of these ions on the rock surface. These surface reactions including salt precipitation, crude oil desorption, and rock dissolution were confirmed through the ionic analysis of the effluent brine during each waterflooding experiment. These results help clarify the importance of chemical tuning of brines toward improving oil recovery and provide experimental insight into the chemical mechanism of wettability alteration.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15681], "author_name_tesi": "Purswani, Prakash ", "last_name_ssi": "Purswani", "first_name_ssi": "Prakash", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zuleima T.

Under such circumstances, artificial lift mechanisms must be employed. Amongst various artificial lift mechanisms, a significant proportion of wells utilize the gas-lift mechanism, which is an extension of the natural flow. In gas-lift implementation, high pressure gas is injected into the wellbore through a valve, where injected gas supports production by altering the composition and reducing the density, and increasing the velocity of the produced fluids. \nIn order to design a gas-lift system, a study of the inflow performance of the fluid from the reservoir into the wellbore, combined with the outflow performance of the fluids from the bottom of the wellbore to the surface is necessary. For this purpose, existing technologies for optimization of gas-lift systems predominantly use empirical correlations in order to reduce the computational overhead. These systems use a single-equation based inflow performance relations and black-oil outflow performance correlations that have restricted applicability in systems where the fluid composition varies spatially and temporally. The contemporary protocols consider the oil flow rate, water cut and formation gas-liquid ratio and well productivity index at a given instant of time to calculate the optimal quantity of gas lift injection. Due to this methodology, the effects of pressure decline and subsequent variations in well performance are not adequately captured. This results in a solution which determines the maximum liquid flow rate expected for a given gas lift injection rate only for the instantaneous period at which the study has been performed. This optimal gas lift injection rate may or may not provide the maximum total output of oil over the producing life of the well. \n\nAs a first step, a compositional coupled numerical reservoir and wellbore hydraulics models has been developed as a part of this work. These hard-computing tools simulate the variations in composition, pressure and production profiles of a gas lift well and its associated reservoir from inception to abandonment. One more advantage of this method is that it can predict the future performance of a well with or without the details of well production history. This capability can be useful when gas lift is introduced in a well immediately after its completion post a drilling or a work-over job. \nSoft computing tools have gained popularity in the petroleum industry due to their speed, simplicity, wide range of applicability, capacity to identify patterns and ability to provide inverse solutions. The fully numerical coupled reservoir-wellbore simulator developed is computationally expensive. In order to develop a faster system, firstly, an ANN based wellbore hydraulics tool is developed and coupled with the numerical reservoir simulator. The data utilized for training the ANN tool was generated using the numerical wellbore hydraulics tool. \nBoth the numerical and ANN wellbore hydraulics models were validated against cases from the field and another compositional numerical model from the literature. The average relative deviation with respect to field data was observed to be 2.2% and 2.4% respectively for the ANN and numerical wellbore hydraulics model, respectively. When compared against another compositional numerical model, the average relative deviation for the ANN based model was observed to be between 3.3% and 7.1%, while it was between 2.3% and 8.1% for the numerical model developed in this work. While the ANN based wellbore hydraulics model maintained the accuracy of the numerical model, it outperformed its counterpart the numerical model, by four orders of magnitude in terms of speed-up. \nThe ANN based wellbore model was also coupled with the numerical reservoir simulator. This resultant model which involves a coupled numerical-ANN system is faster than the fully numerical coupled system by about 160 times. This coupled tool was used to generate a gas lift database of cumulative oil production of a well with various reservoir and wellbore operating conditions under a range of operating gas lift injection depths and flow rates. This database was used to develop an ANN based gas lift model that is capable of generating performance curves plotting total oil produced during the producing life of a well as a function of gas lift injection rate. Blind testing of the ANN gas lift model showed an average absolute error of 16.6 % with respect to the predictions of the coupled numerical-ANN reservoir wellbore model. This fully ANN based gas lift model provided a speed-up by four orders of magnitude with respect to the coupled numerical-ANN based model. Hence, a fast, robust and versatile model has been developed for maximizing total primary oil recovery using gas lift optimization through integration of numerical and neuro-simulation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15642], "author_name_tesi": "Putcha, Venkataramana B", "last_name_ssi": "Putcha", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Venkataramana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Turgay Ertekin ", "Eugene C Morgan", "Kamesh Madduri", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin , Committee Chair", "Eugene C Morgan, Committee Member", "Kamesh Madduri, Committee Member", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["numerical simulation", "machine learning", "gas lift", "neural networks", "petroleum", "production", "optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Ultrasonic Guided Wave Propagation across Waveguide\nTransitions Applied to Bonded Joint Inspection\n\n\n\n", "id": "11152", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4973", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Adhesively bonded joints are increasingly used in safety critical applications such as load bearing elements in aerospace structures. The quality of surface preparation is crucial to the strength of an adhesive joint and also the adhesives are susceptible to environmental conditions and undergo degradation. The possibility of the presence of defects and interfacial weakness make nondestructive inspection techniques a valuable tool to evaluate the structural reliability of the adhesive joints. \nTwo problems related to the inspection of aircraft adhesive joints \u2013 the adhesive repair patches and adhesive skin-stringer joints are nondestructively evaluated using ultrasonic guided waves in this thesis. The former is a life extending patch bonded at defect locations on aircraft while the latter is a structural stiffener found in skin and wings in aircraft. Ultrasonic guided waves are thickness resonances that propagate under stress-free boundary conditions in plate-like structures called as waveguides. The guided waves display frequency dispersion or velocity variation with frequencies that are depicted using dispersion curves. Based on the nature of the cross-sectional displacement distribution at each point on the dispersion curves, the guided waves are categorized into modes. Selection of modes for sensitivity to interfacial weakness in a waveguide, and understanding the mode conversion at geometric discontinuities or transitions in waveguides is a major challenge to the inspection using guided waves.\nThe objective of this thesis is to enhance the understanding of guided wave interaction with waveguide transitions and interfacial defects in bonded assemblies in order to develop a field implementable solution for nondestructive inspection.\nAt the beginning, the problem of inspecting aircraft adhesive repair patches applied to epoxy bonded aluminum \u2013 titanium joint is presented. Weakness at the aluminum-epoxy interface and bulk defects in epoxy, simulated on repair patch samples prepared in the lab, were successfully detected and sized by selecting modes with large in-plane displacement at the interface of interest. \nThe problem of inspecting adhesive skin-stringer joints requires an understanding of the guided wave mode conversion and scattering at a waveguide transition in addition to the need to detect interfacial weakness in the stringer joint region. The existence and unique displacement characteristics for modes in a bonded joint that envelope or appear near to modes in one of the adherends, observed in the study of skin-stringer joints, is reported in the thesis. These modes are coined here as \u2018mode pairs\u2019 and show a matching trend in the phase velocity vs. frequency curve with the adherend. A quantitative model combining the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) and Normal Mode Expansion (NME) was developed to handle guided wave scattering at a waveguide transition. Further, a qualitative model using wavestructure matching coefficient was also developed to determine the mode conversion for a single mode incidence at the waveguide transition. \nThe models showed equal excitation of the mode pairs and up to 100% energy transmission for matching group velocity vs. frequency curve. Using a commercial Finite Element package numerical experiments were conducted that agreed with the hybrid model and the wavestructure matching model. Fourier transform based signal processing algorithms for orthogonal decomposition of guided wave data into constituent normal modes, directional and mode matching filters, computationally efficient element-less receiver and wavestructure data processing were developed. The processing of numerical data revealed the instantaneous mode formation at a source and also at a transition thus enabling guided wave inspection of the edge of a bonded joint. \nThe mode conversion and scattering study were coupled with the interfacial in-plane displacement parameter to form a combination parameter called Effectiveness index. Higher effectiveness index modes (>0.3) successfully detected simulated interfacial weakness in the skin-stringer joints prepared in the lab.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4950], "author_name_tesi": "Puthillath, Padmakumar ", "last_name_ssi": "Puthillath", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Padmakumar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Edward C Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Edward C Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["skin-stringer joint", "repair patch", "Ultrasonic guided waves", "adhesively bonded joints", "waveguide transition"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "3D NUCA CACHE ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS\n", "id": "9035", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6784", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It\u2019s a well known fact that memory performance is not keeping up with processor performance. Where Processor performance is increasing at roughly 60% every year, memory performance is less than 10% [3]. Shrinking feature sizes further worsen the effect of interconnect delay making it a critical obstacle in improving the memory access time. The widening gap between processor performance and memory has forced today\u2019s researchers to look new avenues to counter the problem. The first and most successful step to alleviate this gap is three-dimensional designs. Memory can be stacked directly on top of a microprocessor through 3D integration resulting in significant reduction in wire delay between the processor and the memory. Studies have shown significant performance, power and area benefits of such an approach compared to the conventional two-dimensional designs. Another approach to attack memory access time is to adopt on-chip network-based communication, the concept of Non-Uniform Cache Architectures (NUCA). NUCA architecture divides memory space into multiple banks which have different access latencies depending on their location relative to the processor. NUCA employs a packet-switched network between banks thus the access times are a function of where the data blocks are found. \nThe first contribution of this work is we implement two major extensions to the CACTI 6.0 cache modeling tool. First, we add the ability to model three-dimensional cache. Second, we add the ability to model MRAM and PRAM memory technologies. The second contribution is a detailed comparison of the four different mainstream memory technologies, SRAM, DRAM, MRAM and PRAM in terms of performance, power and area in an architecture that combines the benefits of 3D and NUCA. The work also highlights that the 3D NUCA L2 architecture generates much better results than the conventional two-dimensional (2D) designs. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6782], "author_name_tesi": "Puttasiddaiah, Yogitha ", "last_name_ssi": "Puttasiddaiah", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yogitha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Yuan Xie", "Yuan Xie"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Yuan Xie, Thesis Advisor", "Yuan Xie, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["3D", "NUCA"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Case Study of Overall Historic Character and Preservation Initiatives:  Oley Township Historic District, Berks County, Pa\n", "id": "15320", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7723", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As one of the first historic districts to cover an entire township, Oley Township Historic District in Berks County, Pennsylvania was nominated for inclusion in the National Register in 1982.

Data were collected from November 2009 to March 2010.  Multiple data sources were employed, including formal and informal interviews, field observations, and document analysis in order to gain an in-depth portrayal of the lives of kindergarten teachers as they worked in the same contexts and negotiated the pressures to lean toward a more academic achievement model of education.   \nWith the focus on the education in kindergarten classrooms and the teachers who work with young children, several research questions guided the study: (1) What are the stories that are told by kindergarten teachers, working in an era when accountability and academic achievement are the focus? ; (2) How do teachers deliver developmentally appropriate instruction and make learning meaningful and engaging in kindergarten classrooms today?; and (3) How do teachers consider play in the educational processes of kindergarten children under the standards based design?\nThe stories of the participants were varied and comprehensive in personal ways as each one\u2019s life history contributed to the teacher that they had become.  It appeared that family background, life events, teaching experiences, personality traits, as well as pre-service and in-service education contributed to the development of these teachers. In general, each teacher shared different stories of life events and personal goals that brought them to the point in their careers at which this study occurred.\nA significant story was told by the teachers in this current study.  The burden of accountability weighed heavily on their work every day and occupied much of their time with children.  This focus of assessment did not allow teachers to work with young children in ways that teachers felt more appropriate and meaningful.  They each discussed the significant amount of time allotted to testing and the preparation for that aspect of their day. \n\tEach teacher reflected on the trust and freedom that their principal showed them as professionals.  He told them collectively that they were to teach the way they wanted to teach, but they just needed to \u201cget the job done.\u201d  The teachers showed great respect for their building leader and felt that they had autonomy in their work; however, they were tied to scripted curriculum and the heavy weight of assessments.  This present study showed that although feeling autonomous, teachers were controlled in their practice through mandates of curriculum and accountability.\nIn these three cases, instruction was found to be mainly teacher centered.  There was limited time for social interaction.  Other than answering questions in group settings and infrequent play time, children were focused on the teacher and the activities that were planned.  During observations, Vygotsky\u2019s ideas of scaffolding and social construction were absent.  Instead, children were focused on academic instruction based in teacher directed practices.  This was due in part to the looming assessment component that weighed on the teachers schedule and planning processes.\nThe stories revealed the complexity that is involved in teaching young children in kindergarten under an academic model with the accountability factor. Teaching in these kindergarten classrooms was a multifaceted process.  Through observational data, it was evident that as teachers worked with young children in the daily routine of kindergarten, there was a complexity to the interactions, practices, and events that was not always obvious to those outside the educational environment.  Teachers developed and maintained relationships with young children that were built in trust and nurtured through mutual respect.   The teachers successfully managed data collection and reporting with current technology.  Planning for instruction was a complex process.  Teachers utilized the essential curriculum and standards developed by the county to plan for instruction in their classrooms.  They also managed to incorporate the necessary assessment tools within that instructional plan and adjust the schedule according to needs of the children.  Teachers were attentive to the needs of children.  They were aware of joys and tears of some children as they attended to the worries and concerns of others.  \nAssessment was a major theme of the teacher\u2019s stories.  In today\u2019s climate of accountability and academic achievement, assessment dominated everyone\u2019s attention in the school setting.  These teachers commented regularly on the pressures they felt to conduct, complete, record and send data from standardized assessments. Teachers accommodated to the testing ethos without surrendering their teaching ideals and love of their practice; however, the teachers faced the assessment cage in which they worked and highly prioritized that aspect of their work.  While they shared their frustrations with the process of accountability, they did not seem to manifest interest in or show the ability to push back or effect change in the school, district, state, and national educational policies responsible for the creation of such an assessment burden. \nAs evidenced through the stories, the influence of teacher preparation programs has lessened during the course of these teacher\u2019s careers as they developed a working model of teaching based on experience and administrative pressures with less consideration of child developmental theories and applications.  Observations of classroom practices and interviews with the teachers revealed a disconnect in their practices and theoretical base.  During interviews, the teachers did not state any association of their practices and philosophy with DAP or child developmental theories.  When I attempted to probe further into the grounding of their philosophy, each teacher replied with a working theory of teaching in which the use of developmentally appropriate practices has largely been replaced by skill based academic models of instruction that are highly didactic and teacher directed with play materials present in their classrooms but utilized on a limited basis if at all.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2770], "author_name_tesi": "Pyles , Jennifer Le-Ann Chestnut", "last_name_ssi": "Pyles ", "middle_name_ssi": "Le-Ann Chestnut", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson", "James Ewald Johnson", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Kimberly Anne Powell", "Richard Fiene"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "James Ewald Johnson, Committee Chair", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Kimberly Anne Powell, Committee Member", "Richard Fiene, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["teacher stories", "accountability", "assessment", "kindergarten", "teacher autonomy"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Development of Predictive Tools and the Role of Electrode Area For Self-clearing Behavior in Coated-glass Systems", "id": "25000", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11337", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In metallized capacitor systems, self-clearing behavior refers to the process in which an electrical arc is extinguished via electrode vaporization. Upon dielectric breakdown, a defect location within the sample rapidly increases in conductivity, forming a short between the two electrodes. This can result in catastrophic failure of the device as a result of positive feedback between localized joule heating and material degradation. However, graceful failure can be observed when sufficient thermal energy is directed to the electrode, which vaporizes and severs the connection between the current source and the conductive filament.\n\tThe role of a fixed electrode area on the resulting clearing regions was examined using both experimental and computational approaches. By constructing a mulit-area breakdown fixture, self-clearing in Al-coated polypropylene films was examined for five distinct electrode diameters (5-mm, 8-mm, 10-mm, 12-mm, and 15-mm). Though these areas are proportional to the amount of energy stored within the capacitor,  it was theorized that they may play a restrictive role in controlling the amount of charge that can migrate into the conductive filament before the arc  is extinguished. The results show that for small diameters (5-mm), the clearing behavior is highly predictable, which indicates that this electrode size does limit the amount of vaporization that can occur. However, for larger fixed areas, the clearing regions tend to increase accordingly, but their sizes become much less consistent between trials. Finally, by increasing the fixed electrode size, the energy released from the capacitor begins to dominate the self-clearing process, while the energy contribution from the source and cables is reduced.\n\tTwo separate approaches were taken to simulate self-clearing behavior in coated-glass systems. First, an energy summation model considered the amount of energy stored within the capacitor of a given area, and assumed that all this energy is converted into heat at the epicenter of the breakdown event. This model concluded that capacitive energy discharge must be directed towards the coating, instead of the glass dielectric material for sufficient temperatures to be reached. Therefore, an electrode heating model was developed to simulate the pattern of joule heating in the coating. This model predicts that the electrode area has a direct impact on the size of the clearing region, but tends to overestimate the importance of this trend when compared to the experimental findings.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10873], "author_name_tesi": "Pyrz, Matthew Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Pyrz", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Self-clearing", "Capacitor", "Dielectric", "Breakdown"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DIALOGIC ENCOUNTERS: THE SCHOOL OF PANAMERICAN UNREST\n", "id": "11830", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "588", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is a theoretical investigation of the nexus between Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin\u2019s theory of dialogism and Pablo Helguera\u2019s The School of Panamerican Unrest (2006). The School of Panamerican Unrest (SPU) was an extensive public art project that involved an intercontinental road trip throughout the Americas. At each stop, which included traditional and non-traditional art venues, Helguera conducted artist workshops, round-table discussions, and performances. I use Bakhtin\u2019s theory of dialogism as a lens to analyze the discourses that developed in-situ at the SPU performances. In this study, I bring Bakhtin\u2019s philosophy of language (dialogism) into a new context, that is, a contemporary art practice, as (re)read and (re)written through feminist perspectives.\n\tI use a qualitative case study research design to analyze and interpret the data. The dialogue-interactions of SPU participants provide the case study in this dissertation. The case study research design guides my effort to particularize, i.e., retell, cite, analyze, understand, and interpret, what is significant about the case\u2019s or the SPU\u2019s dialogue-interactions own issues in the time, place, and context in which the case took place. \n\tFrom the interpretive frame of Bakhtin\u2019s theory of dialogism, I examine the kinds of dialogues and dialogic exchanges participants performed when they engaged with The School of Panamerican Unrest. In my analysis of the SPU, I use Bakhtinian theory to underscore that separateness and difference (autonomous-communion) are essential to the dialogues of the SPU. Throughout the dissertation, I analyze Bakhtin\u2019s theories of dialogism in relationship to reciprocity, difference, and situated knowledge. Though these ideas align with feminist theory, this study is not a feminist analysis of the SPU.\nDialogue in the work of Bakhtin and Helguera means much more than language or communication. Dialogue is not simply about verbal exchange between people but about philosophy of communication. Bakhtin\u2019s theories and Helguera\u2019s artistic praxis advance the notion that dialogue is a way to understand and create the self in relation to another person, and a practice of active listening and responsive understanding and action. Bakhtin\u2019s and Helguera\u2019s approach to dialogue and voice encourage complex and multifaceted theoretical engagements with language. Accordingly, their theories can assist educators and students in challenging superficial, under-theorized, and uncritical notions of dialogue. \nBakhtin\u2019s and Helguera\u2019s inquiry can be used as a methodology through which artists, educators, and students, can critically examine and challenge practices that regulate and restrict dialogue in public spaces, including art exhibitions, classrooms, and other learning environments. The research findings of this study suggests that a dialogic approach to communication and pedagogy creates spaces for open-endedness, difference of opinions, ambiguity, critical reflection, and the possibility for learners to develop their own voice in relationship to social others across difference. Bakhtin\u2019s theory of dialogism and Helguera\u2019s artistic praxis facilitate insights that can be used to envision dialogue or dialogism in pedagogical spaces that embody relational, participatory, and responsible acts. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [585], "author_name_tesi": "P\u00e9rez de Miles, Adetty R.", "last_name_ssi": "P\u00e9rez de Miles", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Adetty", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Karen Keifer Boyd", "Karen Treat Keifer Boyd", "Patricia Marie Amburgy", "Simone Osthoff", "Mrinalini Sinha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Karen Keifer Boyd, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Treat Keifer Boyd, Committee Chair", "Patricia Marie Amburgy, Committee Member", "Simone Osthoff, Committee Member", "Mrinalini Sinha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bakhtin", "The School of Panamerican Unrest", "Pablo Helguera", "public art", "responsive understanding", "dialogism", "answerability", "dialogic", "art", "art education", "pedagogy", "dialogue", "feminist theory", "reciprocity", "difference", "situated knowledge"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF POLYMER DERIVED POROUS CARBONS FOR GAS ADSORPTION, STORAGE AND SEPARATION ", "id": "20101", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9547", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The space trapped between the carbon micro structures shapes irregular pores and microchannels with average pore width below 2 nm. This native porosity acts as molecular sieve being able to separate small molecules of different sizes and shapes. Because of their inherent porosity, relatively high surface area and small pore size, nanoporous carbons (NPCs) are extensively used in gas adsorption, gas membrane separations, shape selective catalysis and synthesis of battery and double layer capacitors. \nThis thesis resides in the area of development of novel carbon based adsorbents with enhanced adsorption properties. Briefly, novel approaches were implemented to characterize adsorption properties of the carbons at low and high pressures. \nOne major task in characterizing porous materials is to determine their textural properties including pore size, surface area and pore volume. This becomes a more complicated issue when the pores are of irregular shapes and spectroscopic methods like X-ray diffraction (XRD) cannot be effective. Gas adsorption is the simplest and yet the most general approach to evaluate porosity. Adsorption of a small probe molecule at different gas concentrations is analyzed to elucidate the pore size distribution, surface area and accessible pore volume of a porous material. Herein, we used methyl chloride as the probe molecule and proposed a novel pressure control algorithm to accelerate gas adsorption dynamics. Fast adsorption of methyl chloride combined with the pressure control method resulted in an accelerated gas porosimetry method that could characterize micro and mesopores of a porous sample near room temperature, under sub-atmospheric pressure and in a single run. \nWe continued studying gas adsorption properties of porous materials, by developing a high pressure gas adsorption instrument. Many industrial and commercial applications of gas adsorption, catalysis and separation operate at elevated pressures and temperatures. This chapter explains design and implementation of a custom-made automated high pressure gas adsorption instrument. The accuracy of the instrument is analyzed using error analysis.\n  The fifth chapter concerns about the energetics of adsorption of light gases in microporous carbons. Adsorption properties of light gases, including H2, N2, O2, Ar, CO, CH4, CO2 SF6, NH3, and SO2 were studied on microporous carbon materials near room temperature. Ono-Kondo model and coordinates were used to decouple surface interactions, the forces between adsorbed molecules and adsorbent surface, and lateral interactions, the forces between the adsorbed molecules in the adsorbed phase. The effect of adsorption uptake on the energy loss of the adsorbed molecules was also investigated for H2 adsorption at 4 K on PFA-derived carbons using Inelastic Neutron Scaterring.  \nChapter six studies the effect of textural properties of the porous carbon materials on CO2 adsorption uptake. Different polymers including, polyfurfuryl alcohol, polyaniline, polypyrrole and poly (N-methyl aniline \u2013 para-phenylene diamine) were synthesized and characterized. Accurately tuning the pore size and lowering the pore volume enhanced CO2 adsorption both on gravimetric and volumetric basis. KOH activated PFA-derived carbon with only pore volume of 0.6 cc/g exhibited gravimetric uptakes as high as the preeminent adsorbents at 1 bar and room temperature. In addition, they exhibited 20% improvement in the volumetric adsorption capacity.\nChapter seven studies adsorption of NH3 on functionalized microporous and mesoporous carbon materials. We synthesized acid functionalized carbon materials with different pore sizes. The materials were carefully studies using XPS and DRIFTs analysis before and after functionalization. Effect of surface functionalization on NH3 adsorption was invoked using high pressure gas adsorption. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9319], "author_name_tesi": "Qajar, Ali ", "last_name_ssi": "Qajar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry C Foley", "Andrew Zydney", "Darrell Velegol", "Chunshan Song"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry C Foley, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Chunshan Song, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanoporous carbon", "Gas adsorption", "Polymer derived carbon", "Porosimetry"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Connecting the miRNA network to the lung transcriptional program", "id": "15124", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7502", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA regulators of gene expression. Owing to their ability to target multiple genes and pathways simultaneously, miRNAs, which are about 22-nt in length, could regulate a web of biological processes including tissue development and cancer. The influence of miRNAs in lung cancer pathogenesis was demonstrated by expression alterations of miRNAs and genetic mutations affecting miRNA host genes in tissues of lung cancer patients. However, little is known about miRNA regulation of the lung transcriptional program. Chromosomal region 14q13.3 is frequently mutated in lung cancers in the form of DNA amplification or deletion, and three genes were identified in the core mutated region: TTF-1, NKX2-8, and PAX9. Since both TTF-1 and NKX2-8 are transcription factors known to control lung development, we decided to select these two genes as an entry point to study the interactions of miRNAs and the lung transcriptional program. MiRNA regulation of target genes is mainly through interactions with the target mRNA 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR). It is reported that miRNA-target genes have significantly longer 3\u2019 UTR than non-target genes. The 3\u2019 UTRs of TTF-1 and NKX2-8 are 879nt and 891nt in length, respectively, longer than the average length of human gene 3\u2019 UTRs (755nt). Besides, the computational miRNA target prediction algorithm TargetScan predicts multiple miRNA binding sites for both genes. Furthermore, our preliminary data showed that TTF-1 construct containing the 3\u2019 UTR sequence expressed TTF-1 protein at a significantly lower level than the construct without the 3\u2019 UTR sequence. Taken together, the evidence led to our hypothesis for the work reported in this thesis that TTF-1 and NKX2-8 are under miRNA regulation and that the miRNAs affect lung development and lung cancer accordingly. To address this hypothesis, the specific questions we sought to answer are: 1) Are TTF-1 and NKX2-8 under miRNA regulation? 2) If they are, what are the regulatory miRNAs? 3) How do these miRNAs affect lung biology through TTF-1, NKX2-8 and other targets?\nGuided by these questions, in Chapter 2, we describe use of a luciferase reporter assay to identify a miRNA that regulates TTF-1 by direct interaction with the 3\u2019untranslated region (UTR) of TTF-1. This miRNA, miR-365, regulates endogenous TTF-1 expression as determined by immunoblotting. In lung cancer patient samples, TTF-1 expression was negatively correlated with the level of miR-365. The DNA copy number amplification of TTF-1 is significantly correlated with the DNA copy number loss at the mir-365-1 precursor gene locus and the overall loss of miR-365 host genes (either mir-365-1 or mir-365-2 or both). Consistent with the reported observation that transforming growth factor beta (TGF\uf062) suppresses TTF-1, miR-365 is induced by TGF\uf062 in a variety of cellular backgrounds through a SMAD4-independent pathway(s).  Moreover, miR-365 feeds back to the TGF\uf062 network by inducing TGF\uf0622, thus forming a signaling loop with TGF\uf062. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an activity that enhances invasiveness and motility of primary cancer cells. Since TTF-1 was reported to counteract TGF\uf062\uf02dinduced EMT, we hypothesized that enforced miR-365 expression would render cells a pro-EMT phenotype (via repressing the anti-EMT TTF-1 gene). However, we did not detect phenotypic changes with lung cells overexpressing miR-365 and very few EMT related genes were expressed differentially in cells with and without miR-365. The lack of a pronounced cellular EMT phenotype upon enforced overexpression of miR-365 may be explained by the presence of miR-365 binding sites in the 3\u2019 UTR of a pro-EMT gene, HMGA2. The miRNA/target connection between miR-365 and HMGA2 was validated and future work will be needed to resolve how miR-365 modulates EMT. \nThe fact that the expression of miR-365 was detected in most human tissues suggests the existence of other target genes for this miRNA. Using mRNA expression profiling, we showed that the expression of multiple genes was perturbed in response to the expression of miR-365. A few of the identified genes were proposed as putative target genes of miR-365 because of the presence of miR-365 binding sites in their 3\u2019 UTRs. Among the candidate target genes of miR-365, we took a special interest in hsa-mir-21 in light of the reported critical role of miR-21 in lung tumorigenesis. Chapter 3 describes studies done to dissect the unexpected posttranscriptional mechanism of miR-21 regulation by miR-365.\nFor NKX2-8, a strategy similar to the one used to analyze the miRNA/TTF-1 connection was exploited, resulting in the identification of three miRNA regulators of NKX2-8.  These miRNAs exhibited cooperation in repressing NKX2-8 (Chapter 4). Future directions will include comprehensive characterization of the NKX2-8 and miRNA connections and elucidation of developmental/tumorigenesis significance of these miRNAs. \nCollectively, the research presented here connects miRNAs to the lung transcriptional program, extends our understanding of how several important lung cancer genes are regulated, and provides potential targets for future work to improve lung cancer management. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7441], "author_name_tesi": "Qi, Ji ", "last_name_ssi": "Qi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Mu", "David Mu", "Cara Lynne Schengrund", "Ralph Lauren Keil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Mu, Dissertation Advisor", "David Mu, Committee Chair", "Cara Lynne Schengrund, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microRNA", "lung cancer", "TTF-1", "NKX2-8", "miR-365"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ROLE OF ITK IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNATE T CELLS\n", "id": "9522", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5081", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Tec family of tyrosine kinases transduces signals from antigen and other receptors in cells of the hematopoietic system. Tec kinases are composed of five domains- PH, TH, SH2, SH3 and kinase domain, which distinguish them from other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. The unique domain composition of Tec kinases indicates a distinct structure and mode of regulation. In particular, Itk plays an important role in modulating T cell development and activation.  Itk is activated by receptors via a PI3 kinase mediated pathway, which results in recruitment of Itk to the plasma membrane via its PH domain.  We show here that membrane localization of Itk results in the formation of clusters of at least 2 molecules within 80 angstroms of each other, which is dependent on the integrity of its PH domain. More importantly, these clusters of Itk molecules form in distinct regions of the plasma membrane as only receptors that recruit PI3K reside in the same membrane vicinity as the recruited Itk. Our results indicate that Itk forms membrane dimers and that receptors that recruit Itk do so to specific membrane regions.  \nAlthough the structures of each domain of Itk have been determined, the full structure of Itk and other Tec kinases remain elusive.  Models of Itk suggest either a head to tail dimer, with the SH2 domain interacting with the SH3 domain, or a folded monomer with the SH3 domain interacting with the proline rich region exists.  We show here that in vivo Itk exists as a monomer, with the PH domain less than 80 \u00c5 from the C-terminus.  Zn2+ coordinating residues in the TH domain, not the proline rich region control this intramolecular interaction. These data have implications for our understanding of Tec family kinase structure.\nInvariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a unique subset of innate T lymphocytes that are selected by CD1d. They have diverse immune regulatory functions via the rapid production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). In the absence of ITK and Txk, Tec family non-receptor tyrosine kinases, mice exhibit a significant defect in iNKT cell development. We now show here that although Itk is required for iNKT cell maturation, mice carrying an Itk mutant lacking its kinase domain, Tg(Lck-Itk&#916;Kin)/Itk-/- , exhibit significant rescue of mature iNKT cells in the thymus compared with ITK null mice. Furthermore, this rescue correlates with the increased expression of CD122, and altered balance of two T-box transcription factor, T-bet and eomesodermin. These data indicate that ITK uses a scaffolding function in the signaling pathway leading to the maturation of iNKT cells, and indicate that the kinase activity of ITK is only partially required for maturation of iNKT cells. \nItk is critical for the development of alphabeta T cells as well as differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th2 cells. Itk null mice have defect to produce Th2 cytokines, however they paradoxically have significant elevations in serum IgE. Here we show that Itk null mice have increased numbers of gammadelta T cells in the thymus and spleen. This includes elevated numbers of CD4+ gammadelta T cell, the majority of which carry the Vgamma 1.1 and Vdelta 6.2/3 &#61543;T cell receptor and exhibit distinct phenotype. The development of these CD4+ gammadelta T cells is T cell intrinsic, independent of either MHC class I or class II, and is favored during development in the absence of Itk.  Itk null CD4+ gammadelta T cells secrete significant amounts of Th2 cytokines and can induce the secretion of IgE by WT B cells. Altogether, Itk plays important role in regulating gammadelta T cell development and function. The elevated IgE observed in Itk deficient mice is due to the enhanced development of CD4+ gammadelta T cells in the absence of Itk. CD4+ gammadelta T cells may therefore play critical roles in B cell IgE class switch.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5056], "author_name_tesi": "Qi, Qian ", "last_name_ssi": "Qi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Avery August", "Avery August", "Biao He", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Robert Paulson", "Zhi Chun Lai"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Avery August, Dissertation Advisor", "Avery August, Committee Chair", "Biao He, Committee Member", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gammadelta T cell", "Itk structure", "innate T cell", "Itk", "BiFC assay"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "An Application Of Independent Component Analysis On The Claims Processing Project\n", "id": "19644", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9312", "abstract_tesi": "The blind source separation method was first introduced in 1980s.

Development of the guided wave technique requires an understanding of wave propagation and scattering principles. The purpose of this research is to advance transducer design and signal processing by investigating ultrasonic guided wave interaction with defects. Both isotropic metallic materials and anisotropic fiber-reinforced composite materials are included. \n\nTwo approaches are introduced for damage characterization in composite laminates. The first technique is to qualitatively predict guided wave scattering at defects by analyzing wave propagation characteristics. As a sample application, waves in the trailing edge of a helicopter rotor blade, which is a composite skin/honeycomb half-space structure, are analyzed. A global matrix method (GMM) is used to determine complex solutions of both propagating and evanescent waves. The skin/substrate disbond is measured by leaky guided waves. In another example, ultrasonic guided waves are applied to detect and characterize delamination defects inside a 23-layer Alcoa Advanced Hybrid Structural plate. A semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method is used to generate dispersion curves and wave structures for the purpose of selecting appropriate wave modes that are sensitive to the target defect. One guided wave mode and frequency is chosen as an example to achieve large in-plane particle displacements at regions of interest. The high sensitivity of the selected guided wave mode and frequency is first verified in a finite element model. Theoretically driven experiments are then conducted and compared with bulk wave measurements. It is shown that guided waves can detect and characterize deeply embedded damages inside thick multilayer fiber-metal laminates with suitable mode and frequency selection quite well.\n\nThe second technique is based on quantitative calculations of guided wave scattering in composite plates. A global-local (GL) method is developed to calculate transmission and reflection coefficients of guided waves scattered by defects.  The GL method is verified on both metallic and composite plates by comparing with FEM simulation and experimental results. A parametric study is performed on a unidirectional carbon/epoxy composite plate with a rectangular notch/embedded void. The influence of defect location, width, height, and composite ply orientation to guided waves is discussed. To further verify the GL method, an experiment is carried out on a quasi-isotropic composite plate with delaminations between different plies. The attenuation of through transmission waves at each defect is calculated in the 500kHz-1MHz range. The experimental data matches very well with the simulated results. \n\nIn summary, this research proves the feasibility of damage characterization in plate and plate-like composite laminates with guided waves. Mode selection criteria are presented and applied to different types of defects. An analytical-numerical hybrid method is developed to simulate guided wave scattering in composites, which is more efficient than the traditional FE method in terms of calculation and post processing. A novel simulation based damage characterization algorithm is derived and verified. All of these techniques provide guidelines for ultrasonic tests on composite structures\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6683], "author_name_tesi": "Qi, Xue ", "last_name_ssi": "Qi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xue", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Edward C Smith", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Edward C Smith, Committee Member", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Graphite epoxy laminate", "Structural health monitoring", "Finite element method", "Guided waves", "Composite", "Ultrasonic NDE"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Essays on Equity Issuance", "id": "7225", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2294", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis explores two issues regarding corporate equity issuance. The first chapter studies the timing of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) at the firm level. Descriptive statistics formulated using US data from 1975 to 2004 show that when firms return to the equity market, they tend to do so shortly after their preceding public offerings. Moreover, first SEOs following IPOs are more likely to be issued sooner after the IPO than subsequent SEOs. Duration analysis shows that both first SEOs and follow-on SEOs can be attributed to extraordinary capital demands to satisfy growth, and the probability of issuing increases when the equity market and the firm idiosyncratic returns have been rising in the preceding year. Moreover, the economic effect of the aggregate factors is larger than that of the firm-specific factors. First SEOs and follow-on SEOs differ in two aspects. First, there is strong evidence that the probability of issuing first SEOs increases when the idiosyncratic return is expected to decrease in the coming year, while the evidence for follow-on SEOs is weak. Second, first SEOs seem to be driven more by aggregate timing and aggregate growth reasons (except for the pure primary offerings), while the decision of follow-on SEOs can be better explained by firm-specific growth demand. Taken together, the results are consistent with the notion that first SEOs suffer greater information asymmetry and therefore have stronger motive to follow market-wide trends and take advantage of windows of opportunity. The second chapter investigates whether firms that issue equity, in public offerings or private placements, have increased secondary market liquidity. Quote, trade, liquidity ratio, and price impact measures are examined. Results indicate that there is a considerable increase in liquidity for firms that conduct public offerings, yet virtually no change for private placement stocks. Regression analysis suggests that the underwriting effort makes the greatest contribution to the improvement of liquidity after public offerings. In addition, analysts also play an active role in reducing the relative effective spread and the price impacts of Nasdaq issuing stocks.

Satellite drag data and the MSIS00 empirical model were utilized to compare to the TIEGCM simulations.\nThe TIEGCM simulations indicated that eddy diffusion and its annual/semiannual variation is a mechanism for annual/semiannual density variation in the thermosphere. It was found that eddy diffusion near the turbopause can effectively influence thermospheric neutral density. Eddy diffusion, together with annual insolation variation and large-scale circulation, generated global annual/semiannual density variation observed by satellite drag.  \nUsing measured solar irradiance as solar input for the TIEGCM improved the solar-cycle dependency of the density calculation shown in F10.7-based thermospheric empirical models. It has been found that the empirical models overestimate density at low solar activity. The TIEGCM simulations did not show such solar-cycle dependency.\nUsing historic measurements of CO2 and F10.7, simulations of the global-mean TIMEGCM showed that thermospheric neutral density at 400 km had an average long-term decrease of 1.7% per decade from 1970 to 2000. A forecast of density decrease for solar cycle 24 suggested that thermospheric density will decrease at 400 km from present to the end of solar cycle 24 at a rate of 2.7% per decade.

Recent discovery of giant ECE provides an opportunity to realize highly efficient cooling devices for a broad range of applications ranging from household appliances to industrial applications, from large-scale building thermal management to micro-scale cooling devices. The advances of electrocaloric (EC) based cooling device prototypes suggest that highly efficient cooling devices with compact size are achievable, which could lead to revolution in next generation refrigeration technology. This dissertation focuses on both EC based materials and cooling devices with their recent advances that address practical issues. Based on better understandings in designing an EC device, several EC material systems are studied and improved to promote the performances of EC based cooling devices.\nIn principle, applying an electric field to a dielectric would cause change of dipolar ordering states and thus a change of dipolar entropy. Giant ECE observed in ferroelectrics near ferroelectric-paraelectric (FE-PE) transition temperature is owing to the large dipolar orientation change, between random-oriented dipolar states in paraelectric phase and spontaneous-ordered dipolar states in ferroelectric phases, which is induced by external electric fields. Besides pursuing large ECE, studies on EC cooling devices indicated that EC materials are required to possess wide operational temperature window, in which large ECE can be maintained for efficient operations. Although giant ECE was first predicted in ferroelectric polymers, where the large effect exhibits near FE-PE phase transition, the narrow operation temperature window poses obstacles for these normal ferroelectrics to be conveniently perform in wide range of applications. In this dissertation, we demonstrated that the normal ferroelectric polymers can be converted to relaxor ferroelectric polymers which possess both giant ECE (27 Kelvin temperature drop) and much wider operating temperature window (over 50 kelvin covering RT) by proper defect modification which delicately tailors ferroelectrics in meso-, micro- and molecular scales. In addition, in order to be practical, EC device requires EC material can be driven at low electric fields upon achieve the large ECE. It is demonstrated in this dissertation that by facially modifying materials structure in meso-, micro- and molecular scale, low-field ECE can be greatly improved. Large ECE, induced by low electric fields and existing in wide temperature window, is a major improvement in EC materials for practical applications.\nBesides EC polymers, this thesis also investigated EC ceramics. Due to several unique opportunities offered by the EC ceramics, Ba(ZrxTi1-x)O3 (BZT), that is studied.  (i) This class of EC ceramics offers a possibility to explore the invariant critical point (ICP), which maximizes the number of coexistent phase and provides a nearly vanishing energy barrier for switching among different phases. As demonstrated in this thesis, the BZT bulk ceramics at x~ 0.2 exhibits a large adiabatic temperature drop \uf044Tc=4.5 K, a large isothermal entropy change \uf044S = 8 Jkg-1K-1, a large EC coefficient (|\uf044Tc/\uf044E| = 0.52\u00d710-6 KmV-1 and \uf044S/\uf044E=0.93\u00d710-6 Jmkg-1K-1V-1) over a wide operating temperature range Tspan>30K. (ii) The thermal conductivity of EC ceramics is in general, much higher than that of EC polymers, and consequently they will allow EC cooling configurations which are not accessible by the EC polymers. Moreover, in the same device configuration, the high thermal conductivity of EC ceramics (\uf06b> 5 W/mK, compared with EC polymer, ~ 0.25 W/mK) allows higher operation frequency and therefore a higher cooling power. (iii) Well-established fabrication processes of multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) provide a foundation for the EC ceramic toward mass production. In this thesis, BZT thick film double layers have been fabricated and large ECE has been directly measured. EC induced temperature drop (\uf044T) around 6.3 \u00b0C and entropy change (\uf044S) of 11.0 Jkg\u22121K\u22121 are observed under an electric field of \uf044E=14.6 MV/m at 40 \u00b0C was observed in BZT thick film double layers. The result encourages further investigations on ECE in MLCC for practical applications. \nThis thesis also explores ECE in dielectric fluids and asks the question of whether a high ECE is possible in dielectric fluids. Compared with solid state EC materials, dielectric fluids that possess large ECE would provide unique routes to design a cooling device. Fluids are widely used in industrial communities for passive cooling and thermal management, for which it is also known as coolants or heat exchange fluids. If there is a dielectric fluid that can provide active cooling by responding to external electric field, such fluid can thus provide functionalities of both active refrigerant and heat exchange media, opening grand opportunities to design much simpler cooling devices. In this dissertation, we demonstrated that ECE indeed exists in a class of fluid, liquid crystals, which possess large dielectric anisotropy and several first-ordered phase transitions near RT, i.e. smectic, nematic and isotropic phases. Large ECE is demonstrated in a widely studied liquid crystal, 5CB, near its nematic-isotropic (N-I) transition temperature that is near RT. An isothermal entropy change of more than 24 Jkg-1K-1 and an adiabatic temperature change of 5.2 K was observed near 39 \u00baC, which is slightly above the N-I transition temperature. The studies suggest that great potential of refrigeration designing lies in small molecules with functional group of large dipole moment and liquid or liquid crystal phases. \nPrevious reported ECE generates cooling and heating cyclically in response to an electric pulse (normal or negative ECE). This thesis asked the question that whether the cooling and heating signals can be unbalanced and even generate only cooling under and electric pulse. Since ECE is dipolar entropy in responses to electric field induced polarization change, there is no fundamental reason for ECE to always generate balanced cooling and heating signals. In the last chapter, an anomalous ECE (A-ECE) that exhibit only cooling but without subsequent heating, under an small electric pulse, is demonstrated, which may provide instant cooling with high reliability for applications such as the thermal management for on-chip hot-spots. The A-ECE is observed in internal-biased normal ferroelectric/relaxor ferroelectric composites. When such composites are de-poled, the dipolar-ordering in the internal-biased composites becomes random, and stay random when electric field is removed owing to the existence of randomness induced by relaxor ferroelectric participant. The observation of A-ECE is consistent with detailed polarization study. Upon de-poling such a polymer blend, the remnant polarization reduced to zero and stayed at zero-state. Therefore, the instant cooling (\uf044S=10 J/kgK) without subsequent heating is realized. The observation paves a way to produce anomalous, large EC effect through engineering inhomogeneous dipolar interactions, and thus could lead to many device applications. These devices would absorb heat from the surrounding area without subsequent heat releasing to the surrounding area.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11060], "author_name_tesi": "Qian, Xiaoshi ", "last_name_ssi": "Qian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaoshi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Iam Choon Khoo", "Zhiwen Liu", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Md Amanul Haque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Iam Choon Khoo, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Md Amanul Haque, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electrocaloric effect", "Cooling devices", "Dielectrics", "Ferroelectrics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The benefits of being a volunteer campus tour guide\n", "id": "9421", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6708", "abstract_tesi": "In this study, we investigated benefits received by college students who volunteer as campus tour guides in their leisure time.

To sustain well-being, researchers have been studying resources that can suppress the onset and perceived severity of daily stressors or can help individuals cope with daily stress. One resource that has been identified is leisure. Past leisure studies tried to explain the role of leisure in the stress process by testing multiple theoretical models, including moderation/buffer, mediation, and suppressing. So far, mixed findings exist for these models. It is also notable that most previous leisure studies mainly conducted between-person comparison. While contributing to our understanding of leisure in the stress process, between-person comparison alone does not tell the complete story. Stress coping is inherently a within-person process, and further research is needed to understand how the effect of leisure in the stress process unfolds within-person over time. More research is also needed on between-person differences in the within-person process. Additionally, previous research either studied leisure as particular pursuit(s) or examined the underlying psychosocial functions of leisure in the stress process. Few studies tested whether the time aspect of leisure matters in the stress process, despite significant psychological effect of leisure time that previous research has shown. \n\nThe purpose of this dissertation is threefold: 1) to examine whether having more leisure time than usual on a day suppresses or increases perceived severity of daily stressors the next day; 2) to examine whether leisure time moderates or mediates the effect of daily stress frequency on positive affect; and 3) to examine whether leisure time mediates the effect of daily stress severity on positive and negative affect of different arousal levels. The three within-person examinations are complemented by assessing whether there is between-person difference in the within-person effect. \n\nI used data from the National Study of Daily Experiences (NSDE), the daily diary portion of the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) Survey. NSDE has a national sample of the non-institutionalized, English-speaking population in the United States (N=2022, age 33 to 84, 57.2% female). Participants completed a telephone interview at the end of each day for eight consecutive days, answering questions about their daily stressful experiences, time use behaviors, positive and negative affect, and physical symptoms. In all analyses, the effects of age and gender were controlled for. \nThis dissertation is comprised of three manuscripts. In the first manuscript, I tested the applicability of the stress suppressing and exposure models. I found a curvilinear lagging effect of person-centered leisure time on perceived severity of daily stressors, and the effect is particularly strong among individuals with little leisure time on average. The findings demonstrated an accelerated suppressing effect that differed between-person. A small increase in leisure time on a day led to a small decrease in severity appraisal the next day. However, a larger increase in leisure time was followed by a much more dramatic decrease in severity appraisal. Meanwhile, the within-person suppressing effect is minimal among leisure-rich individuals, i.e., those with high average amount of leisure time in daily living. Besides the curvilinear suppressing effect of leisure time, another contribution of the study is examining the lagging effect which affords stronger implication for causality than correlational analysis. \n\nIn the second manuscript, I tested the applicability of the moderation and mediation models, focusing on daily stress frequency as the predictor and positive affect (PA) as the outcome. The moderation model was not supported, regardless whether a participant was \u201cleisure-rich\u201d or had little leisure time on average. The finding challenges some past studies that supported the moderation model. In previous research, the mediation model was mainly supported when stress severity, rather than frequency, was the predictor. However, I found a partial counteractive mediation effect, which is significantly stronger among busy individuals than among \u201cleisure-rich\u201d individuals. Encountering relatively frequent daily stressors resulted in experiencing PA less frequently. At the same time, higher daily stress frequency prompted the person to allocate more time to leisure than usual, which then increased PA.\n\nIn the third manuscript, I examined whether having more leisure time than usual mediates the effect of daily stress severity on affect of different valence-arousal dimensions. I found that relatively severe daily stressors had direct effect on all four types of affect: low-arousal PA, high-arousal PA, low-arousal negative affect (NA), and high-arousal NA. However, the partial mediation effect that I found only applied to two types of affect: low-arousal PA and high-arousal NA. Again, this within-person effect is significantly stronger among individuals with little leisure time on average than among \u201cleisure-rich\u201d individuals.\n\nOverall, the findings from this dissertation suggested that the stress-affect relationship did not differ significantly by the amount of time allocated to leisure. The value of leisure as a coping resource is manifested by its ability to partially counteract the detrimental effect of daily stress by increasing PA (especially low-arousal PA) and reducing high-arousal NA. Additionally, the significant between-person difference in the within-person mediation effect implies that those at the greatest risk of lacking leisure time are those who benefit the most from an increase in leisure time. Leisure can also be a factor that reduces or increases stressful experience. My finding indicates that allocating more time to leisure than usual allows a busy person to take a break and relax well, which in turn enables the person to perceive next day\u2019s stressors as less severe. Taken together, this dissertation contributed to the literature by testing the applicability of multiple theoretical models, using a within-person approach to study the topic, examining the time aspect of leisure, bringing more attention to daily stress, and focusing on affect as the outcome. At the same time, further research is needed to link the psychological process to physiological mechanism, which will provide further evidence for the value of leisure as a coping resource.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7376], "author_name_tesi": "Qian, Xinyi ", "last_name_ssi": "Qian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xinyi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Careen M Yarnal", "David Manuel Almeida", "Garry Chick", "Harry Zinn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Careen M Yarnal, Committee Chair", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member", "Garry Chick, Committee Member", "Harry Zinn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["leisure time", "daily stress frequency", "stress severity", "affect", "well-being", "between-person difference in within-person change"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Microbes Breathe Iron: Characterization of Dissimilatory Iron Reduction by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1", "id": "12448", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6862", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation concerns the biological process of dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) by a model iron-reducing microorganism: Shewanella oneidensis MR-1.  Biochemical studies were performed to probe the iron binding site on a small tetraheme cytochrome and to elucidate the electron transfer network in the periplasm.  An outer membrane (OM)-localized TonB-dependent receptor was identified as a putative iron transport protein involved in DIR.\nA periplasm-localized small tetraheme cytochrome (STC) was heterologously expressed and purified from Escherichia coli.  Kinetic studies have been performed to probe the electron flow on STC.  Chemical modifications followed by site-directed mutagenesis along with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and stopped flow measurements were performed to identify the iron binding site on STC.   Chemical modification of STC revealed that carboxyl groups are involved in iron binding.   Scanning mutagenesis on Asp and Glu was carried out to probe the putative iron binding site on STC.  Two STC mutants (D21N; D80N) showed approximately 70% decrease in observed electron transfer rate constant with EDTA-Fe3+ from transient-state kinetic measurements.  The impaired reactivity of STC (D80N/D21N) with EDTA-Fe3+ was further confirmed by a significant decrease (>10 fold) in iron binding affinity. \nMetal-catalyzed protein oxidation was used to identify membrane proteins which bind iron, acting either as an iron transporter or as a terminal iron reductase.  This oxidation system catalyzed the modification of amino acids in close proximity to the iron binding site.  The carbonyl groups formed from this oxidation can then be labeled with fluoresceinamine (FLNH2).  The peptide containing the FLNH2 can then be proteolytically digested, purified by HPLC and then identified by MALDI-TOF tandem MS.  A predominant peptide was identified to be part of SO2907 that encodes a putative TonB dependent receptor.  Compared to wild type (wt), the so2097 gene deletion (&#8710;SO2907) mutant has impaired ability to reduce soluble Fe(III).   In vitro iron binding assay demonstrated that a truncated form of heterologous-expressed SO2907 that contains the Fe(III) binding site, is capable of binding soluble Fe(III) forms with a Kd of approximate 50 &#956;M.  \n\tBiochemical studies were carried out to investigate the electron transfer network in the periplasm.  In vitro protein-protein interactions were conducted between three important electron transfer components: cytoplamic-membrane-localized CymA, soluble periplamsic-localized STC and OM associated MtrA in S. oneidensis MR-1.  The specific interaction was found between CymA and MtrA while no apparent interaction was observed between CymA and STC.  Through the in vitro membrane-catalyzed (formate-dehydrogenase-dependent) MtrA reduction, the direct electron transfer was demonstrated between CymA with MtrA.  A proposed electron transfer route in the periplasm is presented.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6859], "author_name_tesi": "Qian, Yufeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Qian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yufeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ming Tien", "Ming Tien", "Carsten Krebs", "Squire J Booker", "James David Kubicki", "B Tracy Nixon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ming Tien, Dissertation Advisor", "Ming Tien, Committee Chair", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "James David Kubicki, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Shewanella", "Iron reduction"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "GENERAL PURPOSE COMPOSITIONAL SIMULATION FOR MULTIPHASE\nREACTIVE FLOW WITH A FAST LINEAR SOLVER", "id": "26797", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11670", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reservoir simulation is an important tool for petroleum engineers to predict oil production and\noptimize the management of oil fields.
