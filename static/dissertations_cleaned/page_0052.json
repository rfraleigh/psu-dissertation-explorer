Fault slip behavior may range from aseismic creep, to intermediate behavior such as slow slip events, to large and destructive earthquakes.  Laboratory experiments are an essential component of fault studies, because they allow detailed investigation of processes operating at otherwise inaccessible timescales and locations in the earth.  In order to examine the roles of a variety of factors that are likely important in regulating the occurrence or lack of seismic slip, I evaluate the results of numerous laboratory studies of fault behavior, focusing on the effects of fault mineralogy, mechanical effects, and interactions between fluids and faulting processes.   More specifically, these experiments are designed to investigate the underlying mechanisms controlling the transition from aseismic slip at shallow levels in the crust to seismic slip at depth,  known as the updip limit of the seismogenic zone.\nResults of laboratory experiments indicate that mineralogy of fault gouge is a major control on fault behavior.  The clay mineral montmorillonite (smectite) has been noted for its potential effect on seismogenesis in subduction zones (as well as all faults in general) due to its ability to take up water in its crystal structure.  Dehydration of montmorillonite tends to increase its frictional strength as well as increase its propensity for seismic slip, as documented by a decrease in the frictional velocity dependence parameter a-b.  However, the observed decrease in a-b is assisted by both increasing relative quartz percentage and increasing normal stress, implying that the onset of seismic behavior with increasing depth should not be attributed solely to smectite dehydration.  Furthermore, clay-rich gouges in general, including those consisting of montmorillonite, illite, and chlorite, are both frictionally weak (&#956; < 0.35) and velocity-strengthening (frictionally stable, a-b > 0) at fluid-saturated conditions and effective normal stresses up to ~60 MPa.  Sheared gouges may also exhibit low fault-perpendicular permeability (k < 1x10-18), making them candidates to host high pore pressure.  This indicates that faults containing granular, clay-rich gouges are unlikely to show seismic behavior, due their velocity-strengthening nature and stabilizing hydro-mechanical effects resulting from low permeability.  Natural, clay-rich fault gouge from the Nankai subduction zone is consistent with these assessments, also showing low friction, low permeability, and velocity-strengthening slip behavior.  This behavior is consistent over a variety of faulting systems, including the megasplay fault zone, the frontal thrust system, and the d\u00e9collement zone.  The velocity-dependence of the Nankai samples reveals a frictional stability minima in the range of slip rates that correspond to rates during slow slip events, indicating that these events may be prevalent in the shallow faulting environment.\nFriction experiments conducted to high shear strains and using a wide variety of mineralogic compositions as gouge show that weak, phyllosilicate gouges such as most clays and micas tend to be uniformly velocity-strengthening even at high shear strains.  By contrast, minerals such as quartz and feldspar tend to become velocity-weakening after a critical amount of shear strain.  An intriguing observation is that fault stability may be linked with overall fault strength, in that weak (&#956; < 0.5) gouges are velocity-strengthening, while strong gouges (&#956; > 0.5), even those composed of phyllosilicates, may be both velocity-strengthening and velocity-weakening.  \n\tIn comparing the frictional behavior of granular gouge and lithified fault rock as an analogue for cataclastic fault rocks at seismogenic depths, the lithification of fault rock is found to have a significant strengthening effect, however in phyllosilicate-rich rocks pre-existing foliation provides a weakening mechanism that offsets the strengthening due to lithification.  This weakening depends on the intensity of foliation such that strongly foliated rocks, such as books of mica sheets, are significantly weaker than granular mica gouges.  Very thick fault zones can exhibit a reduction in measured apparent friction, the magnitude of which may be related to the orientation of through-going R1 shears and internal structural complexity.  Consistent velocity-strengthening behavior is observed for both lithified and granular phyllosilicate-rich samples despite the observation of slip localization features in microstructural analysis, suggesting that as an isolated parameter advanced lithification state of fault rock is also inadequate for allowing seismic slip nucleation.\nCollectively, the results of the experiments in this study have several important implications for fault slip behavior.  Granular, unconsolidated phyllosilicate-rich gouges, such as those that are common at shallow depths in both subduction zones and strike-slip faults, will tend to be aseismic, a condition that may be related to their overall weakness.   The transition from aseismic to seismic slip at the updip limit of the seismogenic zone should be driven by changes in pressure and temperature, due to the overall ambient conditions as well as inducing changes in the character of the fault material itself.  These may include compositional changes and mechanical effects of the lithification process, such as consolidation and cementation.  However, when tested as isolated variables, the dehydration of smectite, conversion of smectite to illite, and lithification of fault gouge were found to be insufficient in allowing unstable slip behavior.  It is possible that these processes may still play a role but must be combined with other conditions such as high shear strain, localized deformation, and an increased proportion of intrinsically strong minerals in order to drive seismogenic behavior.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4150], "author_name_tesi": "Ikari, Matt ", "last_name_ssi": "Ikari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Matt", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Demian Saffer", "Chris Marone", "Demian Saffer", "Eliza Richardson", "Derek Elsworth", "Andre Niemeijer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Demian Saffer, Dissertation Advisor", "Chris Marone, Committee Chair", "Demian Saffer, Committee Chair", "Eliza Richardson, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Andre Niemeijer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["faults", "friction", "earthquakes", "clay minerals", "permeability", "subduction zones"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Individual Excellence versus Collaborative Culture: A Cross-national Analysis of Professional Capital in the U.S., Finland, Japan, and Singapore", "id": "28017", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12311", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current study utilized the theoretical framework of professional capital developed by Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) and examined school-level professional capital components in the U.S., Finland, Japan, and Singapore using the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) 2013.

We consider an experimental asset market where all investors receive the same dividend from a known probability distribution.  In particular we examine the impact of transaction costs, short selling restrictions, and divisibility of assets on market efficiency.  We find that short selling restrictions prevent traders from reducing prices, contribute to prolonged bubbles, and hence lead to inefficient markets.  Relaxing the short selling constraint increases the trading volume, reduces prices, increases the occurrence of \u201cbust cycles\u201d, but does not result in prices tracking fundamentals. Transaction costs do not exacerbate the inefficiency of the market.  Conversely, they reduce the occurrence and magnitude of bubbles and cause prices to track fundamentals more closely.  Imposing transaction costs also lowers trading volume.  Introducing a more divisible asset reduces the magnitude of bust cycles and improves the overall efficiency of the market. We also design an experimental market where we combine these three attributes of real assets. We find the transaction prices in this experimental market to be higher, the boom and bust cycles to be longer and trading volume to be smaller compared to the experimental market where there are no transaction costs, short selling is allowed and the asset is divisible.\n\n\nThe second essay examines the impact of the volatility of cash flows/dividends on the volatility of prices.  We consider a simple experimental environment where subjects trade in an asset which provides dividends from a known probability distribution.  The expected value of the dividends is identical in all experimental treatments.  The treatments vary with respect to the volatility of dividends.  We find that when dividends are more volatile, transaction prices are lower.  We also find that the volatility of prices is lower in the treatment with highly volatile dividends. In addition, as expected, trading volume is lower when cash flows are less volatile.\n\n\nIn the third essay, we use theoretical models of land prices and house price volatility in urban areas previously developed in the literature and investigate the differences in appreciation of house prices and their volatility across different geographic regions of the United States.  The variables that are shown in the models to be important in affecting the variance of housing returns are identified.  The empirical investigation of these variables shows that, as expected by the model, the variance of housing return is found to be positively and significantly related to the variance of household income, land leverage, and transportation costs.  The variance of housing returns is found to be negatively and significantly related to the growth of household income and the real estate transfer tax rate.\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4593], "author_name_tesi": "Ikromov, Nuriddin ", "last_name_ssi": "Ikromov", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nuriddin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Abdullah Yavas", "Abdullah Yavas", "Kenneth Michael Lusht", "Brent William Ambrose", "N Edward Coulson", "Austin Jay Jaffe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Abdullah Yavas, Dissertation Advisor", "Abdullah Yavas, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Michael Lusht, Committee Member", "Brent William Ambrose, Committee Member", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member", "Austin Jay Jaffe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["market efficiency", "bubbles", "experimental economics", "house price indexes"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Detailed Characterization and Hazard Level Analysis of the Ambient Fine and Ultrafine Particulate Mixture at a Construction Site", "id": "27280", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12089", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Exposure to airborne particulates is an important health concern for workers. Since the biological activity of nanoparticles has been shown to depend on physicochemical properties, it is important to characterize particle size and size distribution, particle number concentration, mass concentration, shape, chemical composition, and surface area to clarify the toxic potential. These parameters that are necessary to comprehend the particles effects on human body need to be analyzed and measured anytime exposure is assessed. \nAs studies on the toxicity of engineered nanomaterials have shown, both size distributions and chemical characteristics are important predictors of the hazard level posed by particulate exposures. Typically these parameters are not all measured simultaneously in the assessment of ambient particulate exposures. Knowing the size, number and mass distributions can better aid to identify cation of the sources of the particles. \nThis study aims to characterize the complex mixture of fine and ultrafine particles present in the workplace by measuring the aerodynamic and physical diameters of particles, characterizing their chemical makeup, and evaluating the concentrations of the ambient aerosol mixture at the construction site. Particles were collected by using a cascade impactor, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were utilized to analyze the particles and establish size distributions separated by particle type (e.g. silica vs. soot). The diameters of particles found in the construction site atmosphere ranged from 0.99 nm to 10500 nm. 89.3% of the particles collected were ultrafine particles (<100nm) or aggregates of ultrafine particles that disaggregated during the collection process. Number and mass particle concentrations detected during sampling ranged from 2.1\u00d7 103 to 1.6\u00d7 104 particles/cm3, and 33.4 to 270 \u00b5g/m3, respectively, which is generally in agreement with previous studies of PM2.5 and PM0.1. Significantly higher numbers of ultrafine particles were observed through direct imaging than were expected. This occurred due to these particles being distributed throughout all stages of the impactor rather than being preferentially collected at the expected location. Particles are consisted of Carbon (41 %), Oxygen (26 %), Silicon (7.66 %), Sulfur (5.1 %), Calcium (4.7 %), along with other trace elements. Also some oxide and carbonate compounds derived from these elements such as calcium carbonate, silicon dioxide (silica), sulfates were identified, and size distributions for each of these particulate chemical species have been resolved. Additionally, shape analysis shows that 72.2 % nanoparticles have almost circular shape with circularity between 0.9 and 1.0. 50.34 % of particles have between 1:1 and 3:1 aspect ratio. \nThese results enable for the first time a comparison of the exposure environment to the hazard level determined through single-particle-type exposure studies. Finally, these results suggest more comprehensive exposure studies should be performed to better understand the hazards of aerosol emissions from a wider array of workplaces.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11506], "author_name_tesi": "Ilci, Firdevs ", "last_name_ssi": "Ilci", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Firdevs", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeremy Michael Gernand"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeremy Michael Gernand, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["particulate matter", "ultrafine particles", "fine particles", "exposure to particulate mixture", "characterization of particles"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Micro-Scale Sulfur and Carbon Isotope and Trace Metal Analysis of a Neoarchean Stromatolite: Evidence for a Redox Transition in Epeiric Platform Carbonates Prior to the Great Oxidation Event", "id": "13393pdi102", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13393", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Neoarchean (2.8-2.5 Ga) platform carbonate environments such as the Campbellrand-Malmani platform are believed to have been sites of substantial O2 accumulation and nutrient cycling prior to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). Stromatolites in particular serve as biogeochemical \u201chotspots\u201d where evidence of various metabolic pathways and bacterial lineages can be traced through geochemical fingerprints. We identified morphologically-distinct, organic-rimmed pyrite grains (~2-10 \u03bcm) embedded in the dolomitic lamina of a Campbellrand Subgroup stromatolite (2.52-2.55 Ga) from the Lime Acres Member of the Kogelbeen Formation at Lime Acres limestone mine, South Africa. Carbon and sulfur isotopes measured in situ on different layers of the finely-laminated, LL-C columnar stromatolite revealed a multi-layered microbial community employing photoautotrophic carbon fixation, organic matter respiration, sulfate reduction, and potentially methane assimilation. In particular, unusually high kerogen \u03b413Corg and pyrite \u03b434S compositions are consistent with an aerobic ecosystem recycling photosynthetic biomass and sulfate reduction in sulfate-limited porewaters, respectively.

The hypothesized predominance of sulfate rather than elemental sulfur agrees with prior arguments for increased subaerial volcanism and intense plume activity coinciding with oxidation of the upper mantle. We suggest explosive subaerial eruptions sustained a stratospheric SO2 reservoir that was photo-oxidized by long-wavelength (250-330 nm) UV radiation to produce positive MIF-carrying sulfate in the Neoarchean. This contrasts with Paleoarchean sulfur chemistry dominated by SO2 photolysis in the 190-220 nm excitation band and points to an evolving Archean atmosphere, culminating in a coupled biogeochemical-tectonic redox transformation that fundamentally changed the atmospheric sulfur cycle and ultimately prompted the GOE.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13102], "author_name_tesi": "Ilhardt, Peter Donald", "last_name_ssi": "Ilhardt", "middle_name_ssi": "Donald", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Howard House", "Peter J Heaney", "Michael Allan Arthur"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Howard House, Thesis Advisor", "Peter J Heaney, Committee Member", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Neoarchean", "Stromatolite", "Geochemistry", "Sulfur Isotopes", "Carbon Isotopes", "Trace Metals", "Great Oxidation Event", "Pyrite", "Microanalysis", "Mass-Independent Fractionation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Geodetic Imaging of Production and thermal Depletion in Geothermal Reservoirs", "id": "26628", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11216", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Surface deformation is a commonly observed phenomenon in various geothermal fields. This reflects subsurface volume change due to shrinkage and dilation or faulting and fault reactivation induced by fluid injection. Here we assess surface deformations (vertical displacement, surface tilt and horizontal strain) as signatures in two different modalities: (i) isotropic volume change (Mogi model) and (ii) injection induced shear offset (Okada slip model) and compare the results with the resolution of current geodetic tools. To obtain precise volumetric deformation in a constrained reservoir, we assume a spherical fractured reservoir within an infinite medium. In this we allow tensional decoupling to estimate the magnitude of the maximum detectable deformation recorded when thermal contraction ensues. Comparison of predicted deformations with instrumental resolutions confirms that geodetic signals, especially tilt and strain, are indeed sufficiently large to describe reservoir evolution. Volume changes of 103m3 (induced by thermal contraction of a few tens of days of geothermal operation) or, 1mm slip on a reactivated fault patch of 1000m\u00d7500m at a depth of 2500m induces tilts of ~10 nano-radians and strains of ~10 nano-strains which are ~10 times larger than the resolution of current surface geodetic tools.

Complications related to diabetes cause financial burden, as well as loss of quality of life.  More than 25% of patients with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes will experience one or more episodes of delayed cutaneous wound closure, a serious complication that if untreated, can lead to ulceration, systemic infection, and possible amputation.  Understanding the pathophysiology associated with diabetes and wound closure, as well as design of new, non-toxic therapies, is needed. The hypothesis of this thesis project is that naltrexone (NTX), an opioid receptor antagonist, blocks opioid receptor binding to accelerates DNA synthesis, cell proliferation and wound healing.  The opioid growth factor (OGF)- OGF receptor (OGFr) axis is involved in cell replication.  OGF, chemically termed [Met5]-enkephalin, interacts with the OGFr to depress DNA synthesis by upregulating p16 and p21 to halt the cell cycle at the G1/S interface.  To address how the OGF-OGFr pathway modulates wound healing, the first aim investigated angiogenesis, an integral phase of wound repair.  Using a rat model of Type 1 diabetes, along with age-matched normal rats as controls, full-thickness cutaneous wounds were created on the dorsum and treated with topical applications of 10-5 M NTX dissolved in moisturizing cream.  Wound closure was monitored photographically and tissue samples were collected for histopathology.  Blood vessel formation, measured by VEGF, FGF-2, and \u03b1-SMA staining, was enhanced in rats treated with topical NTX relative to those receiving only vehicle.  Specific aim 2 evaluated the long-term effects of NTX on skin and the remodeling phase of wound healing.  Full-thickness wounds generated in diabetic rats treated with NTX revealed normal collagen deposition and normal remodeling compared to controls.  Tensile strength of the wounds was restored, and no adverse histopathology was noted following 3 weeks of NTX treatment.  The mechanism of action associated with NTX treatment was investigated in Specific aim 3.  The initial studies determined the specific and selective opioid receptor modulated by the nonspecific antagonist NTX.  Using molecular technology and the NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line, OGFr protein expression was depressed by siRNAs.  Application of NTX to the fibroblast cultures revealed that suppression of OGFr with siRNA blocked the response to NTX.   Studies with specific ligand agonists demonstrated that only OGF, and not DAMGO, DPDPE, or EKC, altered growth of cultured fibroblasts.  Further studies with NIH 3T3 cells, and primary auricular fibroblasts, confirmed the presence of OGF and OGFr in fibroblasts.  These data confirm that the OGF-OGFr axis mediates cell replication in fibroblasts, a primary cell involved in cutaneous wound healing, and that the OGF-OGFr axis is the specific biological pathway blocked by NTX.  In Specific Aim 4, studies examined the efficacy of NTX in a mouse model of Type 2 diabetes.  The genetic mouse model, using db/db mice, was established and full-thickness cutaneous wounds were generated.  Wound closure in diabetic mice was significantly delayed relative to normal C57Bl/6 mice, and topical application of NTX significantly accelerated wound closure relative to db/db mice receiving only vehicle. In conclusion, delays in cutaneous wound closure are related to cellular proliferation and may be modulated by the OGF-OGFr pathway.  Blockade of this regulatory pathway by the opioid antagonist NTX enhances all stages of wound repair, and may serve as a safe and efficacious treatment for wound closure complications found in individuals with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9557], "author_name_tesi": "Immonen, Jessica Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Immonen", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin", "Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang", "Alistair J Barber", "Joseph W Sassani", "Timothy Cooper"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin, Committee Chair", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang, Committee Member", "Alistair J Barber, Committee Member", "Joseph W Sassani, Committee Member", "Timothy Cooper, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["diabetes", "wound healing", "opioids", "naltrexone"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Comparative Analysis of Three Equations of State in the prediction of Liquid Properties and the introduction of a new approach to Phase Behavior Modelling", "id": "13522goi5004", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13522", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydrocarbon Phase Behavior modelling is extremely important in the characterization of fluids because this helps in obtaining fluid properties that are important in the design and optimization of various production processes and facilities.

A major drawback of cubic equations of state is measurement of liquid densities. This is extremely important when dealing with reservoir fluids such as gas condensates which exhibit a retrograde behavior of splitting into gas and liquid phases during isothermal expansion. The goal of this study is to develop a tool that will be able to detect when a hydrocarbon mixture undergoes a phase split and also be able to provide a more accurate prediction of condensate properties than the presently used Equations of state.

This was done through the use of computer modeling and experimental tests in both the Hammond and Academic Projects Building wind tunnels located at Penn State. The Hammond tunnel was fitted with 11 pressure taps to measure 9 static pressures and 2 total pressures. The APB tunnel was fitted with three pitot static probes to measure the static and total pressures upstream, downstream and at the turbine blades. Two wind turbines were used in this thesis; the CWC turbine, which had an 18 inch blade diameter, and the All Power turbine, which had a 46 inch blade diameter, and two different blade configurations. The CWC turbine was tested in both the Hammond tunnel and APB tunnel while the All Power turbine was tested only at the APB tunnel. In both the Hammond tunnel and the computer model, different disk sizes were tested to see how different blockages affect the wind tunnel parameters. It was found in both the model and the experimental tests that the different size disks and the turbines had both a local and global effect on the tunnel flow characteristics. Most importantly they affected the venturi calibration used to predict wind speed in the test section. This leads to the need to correct the wind speed during wind turbine tests. In this thesis three methods were used; the Wind Turbine Pressure Drop (WTPD) method, the modified WTPD method and, the total pressure drop method. It was found that the CWC turbine in the Hammond tunnel acted as a ducted turbine producing a power coefficient of 0.5, significantly higher than the power coefficient of 0.3 produced when the same turbine was tested in a larger section of the APB tunnel. The dynamic pressure profiles between the two tunnels when the turbine was tested also showed this ducted turbine influence. In the Hammond tunnel the dynamic pressure increased going around the turbine when it should have decreased due to expansion. In the APB tunnel the flow was allowed to expand and the dynamic pressure decreased as air passed through the turbine. The All Power turbine also seemed to act as a ducted turbine as the power coefficient calculated from the APB wind tunnel data showed a value higher than the Betz limit even after standard blockage corrections were made. The dynamic pressure profile for this turbine also showed that the flow was not allowed to fully expand through the turbine. The data taken during the experiments in both the Hammond and APB wind tunnels show that the blockage created by the wind turbines has a significant impact on turbine performance and tunnel characteristics.

Although destructive, studies have shown that approximately 50% of the human population will transition from controlled heroin use to addiction. Given the variability, there is a need to determine why certain individuals respond differently to heroin. Therefore the goal of this dissertation is to determine at the behavioral and molecular levels why individual differences in addiction-like behavior occur with heroin. In Chapter 2, I developed an animal model that used avoidance of a heroin-paired saccharin cue to stratify rats on their addiction-like behaviors. Greater avoidance of the reward cue was linked with greater drug taking, drug loading, drug escalation, and increased relapse-like behaviors. Using next generation sequencing in Chapter 3, avoidance of the drug-paired taste cue was linked to individual differences in gene expression in the nucleus accumbens. In Chapter 4, I used taste reactivity to assess the perceived hedonic value of the natural reward cue as it came to predict the opportunity to self-administer heroin. Previous cocaine studies have shown that intraoral administration of a drug-paired taste cue elicits negative taste reactivity (gaping) and greater gaping is correlated with greater drug taking behaviors. The results show that, unlike cocaine, intraoral delivery of a heroin-paired taste cue does not support either robust or sustained aversive taste reactivity behavior. Lastly, given the profound effect the environment has on the development of addiction, environmental enrichment was employed to determine if persistent enrichment status can attenuate the development of addiction-like behavior (Chapter 5). Enrichment was shown to attenuate the motivation to work for heroin and prevent drug-seeking behaviors following a period of drug abstinence. Enrichment also buffered the effects of heroin exposure on mRNA expression in the brain. Furthermore, changes in neural DNA methylation were found due to heroin exposure and enrichment status. Taken together, the data presented in this thesis demonstrate the dynamic interplay between an individual\u2019s genetic background and the environment on the development and expression of opiate addiction and associated epigenetic mediators.

Doug F. Busch, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Intel once said, \"If we behave as a cost center, we won\u2019t get the most benefit from IT, and we certainly won\u2019t earn credibility\" (Overby, 2004, p. 50). An increasing number of organizations have started to shift their focus on IT, seeking now to \u201crun like a business\u201d or \u201cact like a business\u201d. IT leaders consider the transformation of IT not as a choice, but as an obligation and a matter of survival. This transformation has compelled IT leaders to measure and evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the services they provide and support. Without metrics of IT processes supporting services, the quality and effectiveness of the services cannot be measured or managed.\n\nAlthough organizations spend millions of dollars every year on IT infrastructures, system implementation, and support and maintenance, many do not establish clear and well-understood performance measures for these IT initiatives. Metrics in IT have traditionally been measured in functionality-oriented silos like the help desk, but IT departments have shifted towards process- and service-oriented metrics to determine success. To address this shift and be able to measure performance and effectiveness of processes and services, a new and improved approach for identifying and implementing metrics is needed. This study examined the request fulfillment process for an IT service provider group, identified that group\u2019s perceptions of the most important metrics of the process, and subsequently created executive dashboards for displaying those metrics. \n\t\nThe two primary research questions were: (1) What do the group members perceive as being the most important metrics of the request fulfillment process? (2) How to create executive dashboards with the metrics perceived as most important by the group members? To answer these questions, this research utilized components of the qualitative research approach, descriptive research strategy, and case study research tradition (strategy of inquiry). Study results indicated that the following 12 metrics were perceived by the group as most important: Total number of tickets created and closed per month, Number of Priority-1 tickets created and closed per month, Number of tickets by issue type, Number of tickets by priority, Number of tickets by issue status, Number of tickets by department/area, Number of tickets per assignee, Number of tickets per reviewer, Number of tickets per assignee and issue type, Number of tickets per assignee and priority, Number of tickets per assignee and issue status, and Number of tickets per department/area and issue type. Three dashboard pages (Trend analysis, Monthly operational summary, and Monthly workload distribution summary) were created that contained bar charts, pie charts, and tables using the iDashboards self-service software application to present these metrics. \n\t\nIn reviewing recent IT-related scholarly works, there is a paucity of research on metrics, measurements, and evaluation of IT processes\u2014especially on how to identify and develop metrics.

We show that it is optimal for the monopolist to offer the upgrades more frequently to more hyperbolic consumers under certain circumstances.\n\nIn the second chapter, we show that naive hyperbolic consumers might be unresponsive to interest rates and credit limits of credit card offers by companies because the offers have a grace period. Consequently, we demonstrate that there might be no competition on the interest rate and credit limit, even if more than one\nfirm is in the market and even if the consumer accepts only one card.

This thesis describes computational and experimental studies on the\ninitial steps of photoinduced CO2 activation on TiO2 surfaces necessary to develop a\nmechanistic understanding of CO2 photoreduction. Initially, the state of the art in the field\nis reviewed, and the performance of CO2 photoreduction catalysts is compared to that of\nsolar hydrogen production catalysts.\nTo design efficient CO2 photoreduction catalysts, we need to understand the intermediates and energetics of various reactions involved in the photoreduction of CO2 in greater detail. As a first step in this process, the ground states of CO2 chemisorbed on small clusters from various anatase surface planes were modeled. We find favorable agreement for the existence of three different CO2-surface complexes on small\nTiO2 clusters (Ti2O9H10) extracted from the (010), (001) and (101) anatase surface planes.\n\nSecondly, identifying the mechanism and the active sites involved in the formation of negatively charged CO2 species on TiO2 surfaces represents a significant advance in our understanding of CO2 photoreduction. Both post-Hartree-Fock calculations on small model surface clusters as well as density-functional theory (DFT) calculations on larger clusters indicate that conduction band electrons in irradiated, stoichiometric TiO2 surfaces may not be transferred to CO2. On the other hand, oxygen\nvacancies may act as the active sites for CO2 photoreduction.\n\nThe role of oxygen vacancies in promoting the light-induced conversion of CO2 (CO2 photoreduction) on TiO2 surfaces is discussed Chapter 4 of this thesis. Two different side-on bonded bent-CO2 (bridging Ti-CO2&#948;\u2022--Ti species) were formed on the reduced rutile (110) and anatase (010), (001) surfaces. Consistent with CO2 adsorption on other n-type metal oxides such as ZrO2, the bent-CO2 species do not gain further charge from the TiO2 surface under illumination and are likely photodesorbed as neutral species.\nAdditionally, although the formation of species such as CO and HCHO is thermodynamically possible, we find that the energy needed to regenerate the oxygen vacancy on TiO2 surfaces is greater than that available through band-gap illumination. Therefore, CO2 reactions with water on irradiated anatase TiO2 surfaces are likely to be stoichiometric.\n\nThe role of lanthanide doping of TiO2 in influencing electron-hole recombination was investigated using EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy. In situ pulsed-EPR experiments on calcined TiO2 samples provide evidence for surface electron and hole-centers on TiO2. However, contrary to expectations, no additional paramagnetic centers created due to lanthanide doping of TiO2 could be detected in the EPR experiments. Additionally, irradiating TiO2 in the presence of CO2 did not create paramagnetic signals corresponding to the CO2\u2022&#948;- radical anion.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6456], "author_name_tesi": "Indrakanti, Venkata Pradeep  ", "last_name_ssi": "Indrakanti", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Venkata Pradeep ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert", "Harold Harris Schobert", "James David Kubicki", "Chunshan Song", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare", "Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert, Dissertation Advisor", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Chair", "James David Kubicki, Committee Chair", "Chunshan Song, Committee Member", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["quantum calculations", "DFT", "CO2 activation", "photocatalytic reduction of CO2", "anatase", "TiO2", "CO2 utilization"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "MEDIATED DEVELOPMENT:  PROMOTING L2 CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH INTERPSYCHOLOGICAL ACTIVITY", "id": "13346pui102", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13346", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the evolution of the foreign/second language (L2) acquisition field, frequent appeals have been made to change the composition of L2 grammar curriculum and instruction (Lally, 1998; Larsen & Freeman, 2015).

Accounts of L2 features of English grammar have been predominantly informed by explanations rooted in structural linguistics (Mitchell et al., 2013). Lantolf (2011) notes that absent from explanations of L2 features are meaning-focused visuals and graphic representations. Together with these concerns over L2 English grammar materials has been calls for revisiting the forms of dialogic support offered to English learners (ELs) when engaged in tasks like L2 English writing (Bunch, 2013; Larsen-Freeman, 2015). \nIn order to address the interrelated curricular and instructional needs that exist within L2 education, more broadly, and, in ESL education, more specifically, this dissertation will approach the gap in L2 pedagogy with a Vygotskian praxis-orientation that combines both theory and practice into a dialectical partnership (Lantolf & Poehner, 2014). The dissertation integrates both symbolic and dialogic forms of mediation (Vygotsky, 1987) to promote L2 participant development of the English tense-aspect system. The symbolic mediation, or pedagogical instrument, implemented in this study consists of visual and physical materials that are informed by research in Cognitive Linguistics (CL). The pedagogical materials were embedded in a curriculum that encompasses accompanying practice activities that were organized and structured according to the principles of Systemic Theoretical Instruction (STI). Using an interactional framework referred to by Poehner & Infante (2015, 2016) as Mediated Development (MD), attention and analysis is primarily devoted to studying mediator-participant joint functioning (i.e. interpsychological activity) that rendered the symbolic tool, a tool-for-thinking. Analysis attempts to show how MD worked in the service of an L2 STI program to promote specific cognitive functions that introduced participants to new ways of thinking about the focal L2 concept. Analysis of mediator-participant interaction strongly suggests that interpsychological activity supported participant contingent cognitive and emotive needs and transformed the pedagogical materials into a tool-for-thinking that participants successfully employed in their L2 English writing.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13040], "author_name_tesi": "Infante, Paolo ", "last_name_ssi": "Infante", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Paolo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Edward Poehner", "Matthew Edward Poehner", "James Lantolf", "Ning Yu", "Jamie Myers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Edward Poehner, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Edward Poehner, Committee Chair", "James Lantolf, Committee Member", "Ning Yu, Committee Member", "Jamie Myers, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vygotskian Sociocultural Theory", "ESL Writing", "Curriculum and Instruction"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Investigation of Human Muscle Variability and its Effects on Musculoskeletal Models\n\n", "id": "10940", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "835", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Variability in the musculoskeletal system is apparent at the human body level in terms of body height and shape. However, daily activities such as walking demonstrate stereotypical movement patterns across individuals. The literature suggests that although muscles produce stereotypical movements, at various levels of muscle variability exists. For example, whole muscles demonstrate differences in the portion of the force-length curve on which they act on. This has been demonstrated between different muscles as well as between the same muscles in different individuals. Evidence has also shown that sarcomere lengths differ along the length of muscle fibers. The First Dorsal Interosseous (FDI) muscle is the only muscle to abduct the second metacarpophalangeal joint and is therefore of interest to study its variability in light of its singular action. The purpose of the four studies in this dissertation was to investigate variability in the musculoskeletal system at various levels for the FDI muscle. Specifically, the purpose of the first study was to investigate how the output of a FDI musculoskeletal model changes with changes in model parameters. The purpose of the second study was to investigate how individual sarcomere lengths varied along single FDI muscle fibers. The purpose of the third study was to measure subject-specific FDI muscle model parameters in vivo. The purpose of the final study was to investigate, using magnetic resonance imaging, the arrangement of muscle fascicles within the FDI muscle. The studies showed that: 1. that accurate model output requires specimen-specific model parameters; 2. individual sarcomere lengths along muscle fibers exhibit long-range correlations, which has implications for determining the properties of the whole muscle from a sample of its fibers; 3. full characterization of a model of the FDI in vivo is feasible, using ultrasound imaging and a custom-made dynamometer; and 4. muscle fascicles demonstrate a complex architecture with some fascicles arranged in series. In study 1 model predicted joint moments were sensitive to the FDI model parameter set used; joint moments differed between parameter sets by up to 884.3%. In study 3 muscle model parameters were determined for three subjects, these parameters showed variability between the subjects for example the maximum velocity of fiber shortening ranged from 4.7 to 9.7 optimum fiber lengths per second. These findings demonstrate variability at multiple levels of muscle in the FDI muscle, which suggests that other muscles may also exhibit this variability which could be investigated using the methods presented in this dissertation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [828], "author_name_tesi": "Infantolino, Benjamin William", "last_name_ssi": "Infantolino", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Henry Challis", "John Henry Challis", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Robert Barry Eckhardt", "Andris Freivalds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Henry Challis, Dissertation Advisor", "John Henry Challis, Committee Chair", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Member", "Robert Barry Eckhardt, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["First Dorsal Interosseous", "muscle", "sarcomere length", "subject-specific model parameters", "muscle variability", "musculoskeletal model"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Examining Cross-Domain Linkages Between Social Support, Control Beliefs, and Health\n\n\n", "id": "9599", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1960", "abstract_tesi": "Lifespan developmental psychology has long been interested in examining changes\nwithin and structural relations between domains of functioning.

Perceived control does not operate in isolation but is embedded within multiple systems of influence operating as both an antecedent of aging-related outcomes, as well as being a consequence of resources in the social, well-being, and health domains. For example, interactions with network members may inspire and enlarge one\u2019s feelings of control to perform health-promoting behaviors, leading to more positive health profiles; in turn, individuals reporting stronger perceptions of control are more likely to draw from and utilize social resources in times of strain. \n\nMy dissertation consists of three papers that utilize the multi-directional integrative framework detailed above to examine antecedents and outcomes of perceived control. Paper one focuses on mastery within caregiving processes and targets how caregivers\u2019 mastery changes in relation to the placement of a care recipient in a nursing home or similar institution. I also explore the role of primary stressors in mediating reaction to placement and whether caregiver and care recipient characteristics moderate reaction to placement. Results indicate that caregivers typically experienced declines in mastery preceding placement, followed by a significant increase within one year of placement and further increases thereafter. Corresponding changes in role overload mediated the significant increase in mastery within one year of placement. Caregivers who reported more depressive symptoms and ADL/IADL dependencies of the care recipient were more likely to experience larger increases in mastery with placement.\n\nIn papers two and three, I target how control potentially influences health outcomes. Empirical evidence suggests that control is linked to disability, disease incidence, and mortality in adulthood and old age; the next steps are to determine the psychosocial, health, and biological processes that underlie control-health associations. My goal is to target well-being, physical activity, social support, health, and physiological indicators that may underlie the reported control-health associations. In paper two I examine whether perceived control is associated with physiological indicators of functional health and cardio-metabolic risk and the role of physical activity in mediating such associations. Findings indicated that perceiving more control related to better grip strength and lower cardio-metabolic risk. I also found that the link between control and each physiological indicator was in part due to physical activity levels. \n\nPaper 3 focuses on conjointly examining psychosocial and health factors that may underlie control-health associations and the unique predictive ability of time-related change in perceived control in predicting 19-year mortality. Using data from the adult lifespan sample of the Americans\u2019 Changing Lives Study, I first examine whether levels of perceived control predict mortality over a 19-year follow-up period and target the role of well-being, physical activity, social support, and health factors in accounting for this association. Second, I examine whether time-related change in control uniquely predicts mortality, over and above levels of control and known correlates of mortality. Results show that higher levels of control predicted 19-year survival, independent of socio-demographics and this association was primarily driven by well-being and health factors. More positive time-related changes in control uniquely predicted survival over and above levels of control and known correlates of mortality.  \n\nIn sum, this dissertation aims to extend our knowledge of how perceived control operates both as an antecedent of aging-related outcomes and as a consequence of resources in various domains of functioning. To do so, the collective dissertation papers target perceived control within caregiving processes, as a facilitator of better physiological functioning, and the unique predictive ability of time-related control change for mortality. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7029], "author_name_tesi": "Infurna, Frank John", "last_name_ssi": "Infurna", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Frank", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Denis Gerstorf", "Steven Howard Zarit", "Nilam Ram", "Martin John Sliwinski", "Laura Klein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Denis Gerstorf, Dissertation Advisor", "Steven Howard Zarit, Dissertation Advisor", "Nilam Ram, Committee Member", "Martin John Sliwinski, Committee Member", "Laura Klein, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Perceived Control", "Adulthood and Old Age", "Health Outcomes", "Social Context"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "OXYGEN DYNAMICS IN THE EPILEPTIC BRAIN:\nFROM THE LARGER SCALE HIPPOCAMPAL FORMATION TO INDIVIDUAL NEURONS\n\n\n", "id": "11851", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3066", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Oxygen (O2) is an essential requirement for the mammalian brain.  An adequate and continuous supply is necessary to produce the cell\u2019s primary source of energy.  With minimal O2 storage ability, a tightly regulated balance between supply and demand is required to maintain proper brain functioning and if this balance becomes altered, so does physiological activity.  Although all mammalian cells perish during prolonged states of O2 deprivation, the initial cellular response will inevitably cause membrane depolarization.  This hypoxic depolarization becomes increasingly important during pathological brain states such as epilepsy, where excessive metabolic demands temporally deplete local O2 availability.  We hypothesize that these metabolic changes in [O\u00ac2] are important for influencing network excitability and may be more than just a consequence of an epileptic attack, but also a potential cause.   \n   To date, understanding the relationship between neuronal activity and O\u00ac2 dynamics has been restricted by technical limitations of current sensing techniques.  The lack of resolution, both spatially and temporally, as well as specificity, has hindered our understanding of brain metabolism.  These dynamics are critical for understanding the basic cellular responses to metabolic changes as well as decoding the complex signals generated by neuroimaging techniques (e.g. intrinsic optical signaling, functional magnetic resonance imaging) that localize brain activity based off such changes \n  In order to improve the spatiotemporal limitations of O2 sensing, we have designed a ratiometric fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) excited optical sensor that allows interstitial [O\u00ac2] to be monitored from an entire hippocampal slice to microdomains around single cells with high spatial and temporal resolution.   In comparison with other direct O\u00ac2 sensing techniques (polarography, probes encapsulated by biologically localized embedding, etc.), our sensors are easily calibrated to allow quantitative measurements, do not require stirring, and most importantly do not consume O\u00ac2.  Each ratiometric sensing device is fabricated from an optode matrix consisting of the oxygen sensitive dye platinum (II) octaethylporphine ketone (PtOEPK), coupled with O2 insensitive nano-quantum dots (NQDs) entrapped within a highly permeable and biologically inert polymer matrix.    \n  Using such sensors we probed entire hippocampal slices to microdomains around individual cells, focusing on the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the CA1 to understand how metabolic induced hypoxia is influenced by the initiation, propagation, and termination of spontaneously induced 4-AP seizure events. With simultaneous optical and electrical recordings we found the majority of O2 metabolism to be localized within the pyramidal cell body layer of the CA1, and not necessarily dependent on neuronal firing activity as hypoxic changes occur up to several seconds before seizure onset can be determined electrically.  This preseizure hypoxic change was also artificially induced by changing the bath [O2] perfusing our slices. With our FRET sensors we have quantified a narrow range of [O2,], similar to those found prior to epileptiform activity induced by 4-AP, which can destabilize a seemingly unexcitable network into increased burst firing and even into a seizure-like state.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3055], "author_name_tesi": "Ingram, Justin ", "last_name_ssi": "Ingram", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Schiff", "Steven Schiff", "Bruce Gluckman", "Jian Xu", "Bernhard Luscher", "James Robert Connor", "Ping Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Schiff, Dissertation Advisor", "Steven Schiff, Committee Chair", "Bruce Gluckman, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Ping Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FRET", "Epilepsy", "seizure", "hypoxia", "hippocampus", "liposomes"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Qualitative Inquiry into the Educational Processes of Migrants\u2019 Children in Paraguay", "id": "19308", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9141", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "International labor migration is a powerful social process that not only affects countries but individuals, families, and communities.

This study focuses on distinctions between first and second-generation Mexicans and non-Hispanic whites and blacks. In addition, these analyses contrast first and second-generation Mexicans to third-generation Mexicans. This investigation also includes generational measures for Hispanics of \u201cother\u201d origin.\nThis study analyzes these outcomes while applying tests for a number of theories of assimilation. I consider straight-line assimilation theory, neo-assimilation theory, segmented assimilation theory, and second-generation immigrant optimism theory as potential theoretical frameworks that explain postsecondary success and disruptive life course events. This analysis employs the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, a nationally representative panel study that follows children aged 12-17 in 1997 throughout life documenting life course events and their experiences in school and the labor market. In addition to ethno-generational designations, I include measures for individual and family characteristics as well as time-varying life course measures. \nChapter 3 examines two- and four-year college entrance to assess how Mexican enrollment rates compare to those of non-Hispanic white and black students. Although second-generation Mexicans have an edge in enrolling in two-year colleges, both first and second-generation Mexicans lag behind non-Hispanic whites in four-year college enrollment. This provides support for segmented assimilation, as Mexicans display a disadvantage in enrollment even after controlling for personal and family characteristics. Chapter 4 explores ethno-generational differences in the likelihood and timing of graduation from both two-and four-year colleges. This study finds that initial ethno-generational variation is explained by individual and family-level attributes, which supports neo-assimilation theory. Finally, chapter 5 investigates ethno-generational differences in experiencing disruptive events such as high school dropout, adolescent childbirth, arrest, and incarceration. This analysis suggests that gaps in high school dropout and early childbirth are explained primarily by varying levels of family capital and individual characteristics, supporting neo-assimilation theory. However, first-generation Mexicans are substantially less likely than non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and third-generation Mexicans to be arrested, while second-generation Mexicans show few significant differences in arrest rate. This presents evidence of downward assimilation for Mexicans and supports segmented assimilation theory. In sum, these analyses indicate that there is considerable variation by ethno-generation in the transition from high school to college enrollment and graduation. Furthermore, this dissertation finds that both segmented and neo-assimilation theories explain important ethno-generational inequality in the steps of this transition.

Although Merapi behavior is scarcely predictable, its current eruptive episode lasting since the end of the nineteenth century is dominated by dome growth and collapse. Besides the current activity, deposits from historical and prehistoric Merapi illustrate the occurrence of explosive eruptions of VEI 3-5 in the past, remarking on Merapi\u2019s high destructive potential. Throughout its history, Merapi exhibited effusive activity producing lava flows and viscous lava domes and several explosive events. Over time, Merapi\u2019s geochemistry displayed repeated shifts between medium- and high-K affinity, a characteristic that is also displayed by other volcanoes in Java (e.g. Lamongan and Lasem). This thesis explores Merapi\u2019s dynamic system, and in particular, the changes inherent to lava types (flows versus dome lavas), geochemical affinity (medium- to high-K affinity) and eruptive style (effusive to explosive). Data from textural quantitative analyses, mainly obtained through crystal size distribution techniques, were employed side by side to more traditional geochemical analyses to understand the evolution of Merapi volcano, including magma chamber processes and ascent to the surface. This thesis covers aspects of magma generation at Merapi, demonstrating that medium- to high-K affinity changes are related to events occurring at the subduction zone scale, and are linked to geodynamics and mass transfer. Further, this thesis links the realm of rock physical descriptions to that of geochemistry by exploring the relations between magma chamber processes and resulting textures. Finally, as the shifts in eruptive behavior are fundamental for the development of a hazard mitigation program at Merapi, this thesis compares textures of Merapi pyroclastic falls, bombs and lavas to explore the changes between explosive and effusive eruptions. The results show evidence in support of multiple distinct plumbing systems consistent with the current geophysical models of magma reservoirs. It is also concluded that varying proportions of subducted sediment and subducted crustal fluids can explain shifts between medium- and high-K affinity and that these changes may have been occurring repeatedly over Merapi\u2019s history. Lastly, the examination of textures in tephras and lavas suggests the formation of a viscous plug as the mechanism responsible for the shift between effusive and explosive eruptions.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5822], "author_name_tesi": "Innocenti, Sabrina ", "last_name_ssi": "Innocenti", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sabrina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tanya Furman", "Derek Elsworth", "Peter J Heaney", "Maureen Feineman", "Barry Voight"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tanya Furman, Committee Chair", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Peter J Heaney, Committee Member", "Maureen Feineman, Committee Member", "Barry Voight, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Merapi Volcano", "Crystal Size Distributions", "K-affinity", "Sunda arc", "eruptive styles"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A Speedy Algorithm For Determining Personalized Discounts For Products Approaching Their End-of-Life Stage\n", "id": "9125", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3632", "abstract_tesi": "Revenue maximizing entities in a supply chains such as suppliers, distributors, and retailers are often concerned with how they would quickly move products out of their inventory while still making pro&#64257;t.

Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) is one such technique, in which monochromatic photons are used to photodetach electrons whose kinetic energy is then measured. Through energy conservation, the difference between the energy of the incoming photons and outgoing electrons is then equal to the difference in energy between the initial and final state of the molecule from which the electron was ejected. This difference is defined as the binding energy of the electron, a spectrum of the number of electrons versus their binding energy can be plotted.  With sufficient resolution, PES can be used to determine both the electronic and vibrational structure of clusters, however the price of this versatility is that it is difficult to interpret PES without complementary theoretical investigation. In this thesis we first present background information on PES theory and our ab initio calculations, and then delve into our use of theoretical techniques to interpret the PES spectra of three different types of transition metal clusters.\nWe first examine the case of the NbCn (n=2-7) clusters. DFT calculations show that these clusters are stable in both a linear and cyclic configuration, although the cycle is the ground state for all but NbC6. We use the DFT density of states to obtain theoretical PES spectra that can be compared to the experimental results. We find that to explain the full experimental PES spectrum of this cluster series, it is necessary to combine the spectra of both linear and cyclic structural isomers, even in cases where the higher energy isomer is up to 0.8eV above the ground state. This result is confirmed through calculating the excited states of the neutral clusters using the SAC-CI method. The conclusion is that since the clusters are produced in a high energy environment far from equilibrium, they can remain trapped in metastable states during the PES measurement.\nIn Chapter 4, we examine the curious case of the ZnO and ZnOH clusters. The spectrum of the ZnO cluster consists of a single narrow peak with a well-defined vibrational progression. It is easily explained through a DFT calculation of its detachment energy and vibrational state, coupled with a Franck-Condon calculation. The experimental spectrum of ZnOH consists of a single broad peak without a resolved vibrational progression. DFT calculations of the detachment energy match well with the experimental value of the position of the peak.  The source of the width of the peak remains unclear, despite our investigation of all the common sources of unusual large peak width in PES \u2013 electronic excited states, rotational transitions and vibrational transitions. \nIn the last chapter, we consider two series of valence isoelectronic clusters, TiO2, ZrO2, HfO2 and CoO2, RhO2, and IrO2. DFT calculations show that the Ti-Hf series has a cyclic ground state structure with bending angles on the order of 110\u02da. The ground state structure of the Co-Ir series is more unusual \u2013 CoO2 and RhO2 are nearly linear with a bending angle of 165\u02da, while IrO2 is linear. More importantly the Co-Ir clusters have a very flat potential with respect to changes in angle \u2013 the difference in energy between the linear and 165\u02daconfiguration for CoO2 is a mere 0.003eV. The flat potential is also reflected in their vibrational bending mode frequencies which are on the order of 100 cm-1, compared to ~400 cm-1 for the Ti-Hf series. An examination of the molecular orbitals of the two series suggests that the reason for this difference is in the five extra electrons of the Co-Ir series, four of which occupy two d orbitals that are unbonded in the linear configuration and become anti-bonding as the molecule is bent. In order to confirm that the electronic occupation is the primary factor behind the properties of the two series, we implement a simple Hubbard model to model the clusters, using parameters acquired by matching against the DFT orbitals of the linear CoO2. This simple model is then applied to the whole series of transition metal dioxide clusters along the same row as Ti and Co \u2013 FeO2, MnO2, CrO2, VO2. We find that even if we keep the parameters matched against CoO2, the model correctly predicts the angle of the ground state structure determined in DFT for all the clusters examined (except for FeO2). Unfortunately, the method only matches the rough order of magnitude of the curvature of the potential energy surface found in DFT, in particular it does not match the abnormally low curvature of the CoO2 cluster. In future work, we plan to refine this simple model to allow us to understand the unusually flat potential of CoO2. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8184], "author_name_tesi": "Iordanov, Ivan Olegov", "last_name_ssi": "Iordanov", "middle_name_ssi": "Olegov", "first_name_ssi": "Ivan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Gerald Dennis Mahan", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Dissertation Advisor", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Chair", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Gerald Dennis Mahan, Committee Member", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Photo-electron Spectroscopy", "Density Functional Theory", "Molecular Clusters", "Franck-Condon Factors", "Vibrational States"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "AN INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY-PEOPLE INVESTIGATION OF\nINFORMATION PRIVACY- THE CASE OF CHILDREN\u2019S ONLINE PRIVACY\n", "id": "8591", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4697", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current literature on privacy addresses the need for privacy, user's perceptions of privacy, privacy-enhancing solutions and other related aspects.

Smart Environments represent the next generation of pervasive computing enabled by the proliferation of low cost, high performance, embedded devices. The enabling technology behind this new paradigm of pervasive computing is the Smart Sensor. A Smart Sensor is a device that combines physical sensing apparatus with a computational entity that allows localized interpretation of sensor data. In time critical applications the interpretation of the data can result in an immediate process decision such as alerting mine occupants of the rapidly decreasing quantity of oxygen in a corridor. In less time sensitive applications, such as shopper behavior analysis, a Smart Camera can analyze the behavior of retail store patrons captured by an onboard CMOS camera and send statistics to the store manager periodically or by request. \nAdvances in semiconductor manufacturing technologies have resulted in extremely small transistor feature sizes, low operating voltages, and increased operating frequencies. Overall, embedded semiconductor devices have experienced increasing computational power in decreasing package sizes. In addition, sensor technology has seen advancements that yield more reliable, accurate, and smaller sensors that are easier to interface. Advanced research in polymer nanowires has resulted in the development of gas sensors, consisting of nanowire arrays assembled on CMOS wafers that can detect the presence of volatile compounds at extremely low concentrations. Moreover, CCD imaging sensors are rapidly being replaced by cheaper, lower power consuming, faster, and higher resolution CMOS alternatives. \nConsequently, the case for Smart Sensor utility has been proven by numerous and diverse application scenarios. What's left is the development of novel computational architectures that implement the intelligence for a wide range of Smart Sensing applications while adhering to tight footprint constraints, strict performance requirements, and green power profiles. Issues in hardware acceleration, algorithm mapping, low power design, networking, and hardware/software co-design are all prevalent in this new embedded system paradigm. Of particular interest, and consequently the focus of this dissertation, are reconfigurable architectures that can be tuned to leverage the appropriate amount of computational resources to meet the performance requirements and power budget of a particular application. Specifically, this dissertation contributes novel hardware architectures for gas sensing, face detection, and gender recognition algorithms that are suitable for deployment on FPGAs.

The binding of TBP to DNA nucleates the formation of the\npre-initiation complex of transcription factors at a gene. Numerous transcription factors\nregulate TBP both positively and negatively. TBP directs transcription from two multisubunit\ncomplexes, SAGA and TFIID, that operate on separate classes of genes. The\nstudies described here dissect the contributions that distinct domains of two transcription\nfactors, TAF1 and MOT1, make on a genome-wide scale. TAF1 is an essential subunit\nof TFIID with several known activities, including binding TBP. MOT1 has been linked\nto the SAGA co-activator complex through genetic, biochemical, and genome-wide\nstudies, and is known to remove TBP from DNA via ATP hydrolysis.\nWe find that all activities of TAF1 tested are required for proper expression of\nTFIID-dominated genes (~90% of the genome), and a domain of TAF1 plays a role in\npreventing TAF1 from associating with SAGA dominated genes. Deletion of functional\ndomains of TAF1 contribute to protein instability, dominant toxicity, and can not support\nviability as the sole source of TAF1.\nIn contrast to the results from TAF1, several distinct patterns of MOT1-mediated\nregulation emerge. MOT1 appears to be a major regulator of transcription at a small\nsubset of yeast genes. A genome-wide assessment indicates MOT1 acts primarily to\nactivate TFIID-dominated (housekeeping) genes and repress SAGA-dominated (stress\nresponse) genes. The N-terminus of MOT1, which interacts with TBP is necessary for\nrepression of stress response genes. A subset of genes depends on most or all of the\nregions of MOT1 that were mutated for proper expression. Interestingly, the TBPassociated\ncomplex NC2, which makes positive and negative contributions to gene\nexpression, appears to work in concert with MOT1 to regulate TBP. At genes where\nMOT1 is acting positively, NC2 also plays an activating role. Where MOT1 exerts\nrepressive effects, NC2 also works to down-regulate expression.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2615], "author_name_tesi": "Irvin, Jordan Davis", "last_name_ssi": "Irvin", "middle_name_ssi": "Davis", "first_name_ssi": "Jordan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Song Tan", "Richard John Frisque", "Jerry L Workman", "Blake Peterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Committee Chair", "Song Tan, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "Jerry L Workman, Committee Member", "Blake Peterson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["TBP", "TAF1", "MOT1", "Transcription", "Microarray"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Child Poverty, Program Participation, and Educational and Health Outcomes: The Role of Race, Ethnicity, and Nativity", "id": "18876", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8945", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Race/ethnicity and nativity are the focus of three essays in this dissertation related to the poverty experience, program participation, and educational and health outcomes of children.  The first essay looks for race/ethnic and nativity differences in the likelihood of entering poverty by age 17, of exiting poverty, and of reentering poverty.  The likelihood of experiencing two or more consecutive months in poverty is high for all children.  However, most children exit poverty within a matter of months, but they are also likely to return to poverty.  Racial and nativity differences in the likelihood of ever experiencing poverty are pronounced.  Those least likely to experience poverty are white children with native-born and foreign-born citizen parents, in addition to black children with foreign-born noncitizen parents.  Hispanic children with foreign-born noncitizen parents, black children with native-born parents, and Hispanic children with native-born parents are the most likely to experience poverty.    \n\tThe second essay determines whether there are racial/ethnic and nativity differences in the likelihood that low-income children participate in TANF, SNAP, and Medicaid.  Compared to low-income white children, low-income black and Hispanic children are generally more likely to participate in assistance programs; however, these effects are partially mediated by income-to-poverty ratio, parental characteristics, and household characteristics.  Low-income children with foreign-born citizen and noncitizen parents are less likely to participate in TANF, SNAP, and Medicaid, and there is little evidence of mediation of these effects.  \n\tThe third essay determines whether there are racial/ethnic and nativity differences in the educational and health outcomes of low-income children.  Results suggest that racial and nativity differences are present, even among low-income children.  Low-income black and Hispanic children generally fare worse than white children.  However, white children are less likely than black, Asian, and Hispanic children to have positive attitudes towards school.

OpenFOAM's \"sonicFoam\" solver and second-order numerical schemes were tested to determine the accuracy of their predictions with respect to theoretically- and experimentally-determined results.  The acoustic behavior of an open-ended cylindrical resonator and an axisymmetric expansion chamber (muffler) were simulated, and the predicted results from each of the two cases were analyzed following their arrival at states of periodic acoustic excitation.  The results from the resonator case were compared against theoretically-determined time- and frequency-domain predictions, and the results from the expansion chamber case were used to compare simulated transmission loss curves against those previously determined in an experimental study on a muffler of identical internal geometry.  In both cases, the effects of the time step and computational grid resolution on the accuracy of the numerically-predicted solutions were studied in detail.\n\nIt was found that the resonator simulations produced results that compared favorably to theory, and which converged toward analytical predictions as both the computational grid resolution and the time step were continually refined.  In a grid refinement study, four uniform \"wedge\" grids of the axisymmetric resonator were examined: a coarsened grid (3.400mm by 4.205mm cells), an original grid (1.133mm by 1.402mm cells), a refined grid (0.378mm by 0.467mm cells), and a further refined grid (0.126mm by 0.156mm cells).  Frequencies between 20Hz and 5000Hz were simulated (corresponding to approximately 20, 61, 184, and 551 cells per acoustic wavelength at the highest simulated frequency), and the acoustic Courant number was kept constant at 0.68 (resulting in approximately 30, 90, 270, and 810 time steps per acoustic period at the highest simulated frequency).  It was found that the coarsened grid was insufficient for predicting pressure amplitudes, acoustic impedances, or the reflection coefficient at the open end of the resonator; while the remaining three cases predicted these quantities with varying degrees of accuracy.  The original case predicted all values fairly accurately, the first refined case noticeably improved upon the original, and the second refined case showed only very slight improvements over the first.  The spatial and temporal resolution of the second refined case was found to be unnecessary, and the optimal resolution in this study was found to be the that of the first refined case.\n\nThe first refined resonator grid was then run under a total of three different time steps; with acoustic Courant numbers of 0.68, 0.34, and 0.17 (resulting in approximately 270, 540, and 1080 time steps per acoustic period at the highest simulated frequency of 5000Hz).  While improvements in accuracy were found with each time step refinement, they were extremely small, and thus the standard time step (with acoustic Courant number of 0.68) was found to be sufficient.\n\nSimilarly accurate results were observed in the expansion chamber simulations, where computed transmission loss curves were found to converge toward experimental results with continual refinement of the computational grid and time step.  Three uniform \"wedge\" grids were created for the axisymmetric expansion chamber: a coarsened grid (3.333mm by 3.571mm cells), an original grid (1.111mm by 1.190mm cells), and a refined grid (0.370mm by 0.397mm cells).  Frequencies between 20Hz and 2000Hz were simulated (resulting in approximately 52, 156, and 469 cells per acoustic wavelength at the highest simulated frequency), and the acoustic Courant number was held constant at 0.70 (resulting in approximately 75, 225, and 675 time steps per acoustic period at the highest simulated frequency).  The coarsened grid was found to be insufficient, and the refined grid was found to best recreate the experimental transmission loss curve of the muffler (both in magnitude and overall contour).  However, its accuracy was still lacking at certain critical frequencies, due to an incompletely-resolved acoustic boundary layer that resulted in insufficient acoustical damping within the computational model.\n\nThe results of the expansion chamber case reinforced the importance of the acoustic boundary layer in determining grid resolution requirements.  Boundary layer requirements are distinct from those in the direction of propagation (which are driven simply by the need to accurately preserve a traveling wave), though resolution of the boundary layer is absolutely necessary to properly simulate acoustical damping within in a computational domain.  In this study, only uniform grids were used, and it was found that the acoustic boundary layer was not adequately resolved, even in the finest grids.  It was therefore concluded that graded meshes (possessing finer grid resolutions along solid boundaries) will be necessary in future work, if acoustical damping effects are to be accurately modeled.\n\nUltimately, it was determined that OpenFOAM is capable of accurately computing solutions to problems involving time-domain acoustical propagation and resonance.  However, it was also discovered that small time steps and fine computational grids are required in order to attain sufficient accuracy.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10972], "author_name_tesi": "Irwin, Jeffrey Clark", "last_name_ssi": "Irwin", "middle_name_ssi": "Clark", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael H Krane", "Brent A Craven", "Amanda D Hanford"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael H Krane, Thesis Advisor", "Brent A Craven, Thesis Advisor", "Amanda D Hanford, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["acoustics", "resonance", "wave propagation", "time domain", "computational fluid dynamics", "computational acoustics", "OpenFOAM", "phonation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Climate change and the biophysical landscape: the influence of top-down and bottom-up controls on spatiotemporal patterns of forest expansion and tree growth in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska", "id": "13348ryi5016", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13348", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Increasingly rapid climate change at higher latitudes and altitudes are altering the spatial pattern and distribution of terrestrial vegetation leading to an ecosystem shift at the boreal-forest ecotone. Since 1900, in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska (Denali), average temperatures have increased approximately 3\u00b0 C and total precipitation decreased approximately 150 mm. This change in climate has resulted in a steady encroachment and replacement of tundra vegetation by woody species. White spruce (Picea glauca) trees, an important species within the park, are particularly successful invaders into tundra.  However, biological and physical site factors can influence the magnitude of the response of tree establishment and growth to climate change. Influential site factors may include elevation, soil temperature, total incoming solar radiation, aspect, permafrost presence, and adjacency to existing mature trees. The broad focus of this research explored variations in tree establishment and growth at the local and regional levels as a function of climate change and biophysical site factors using dendroecological, statistical, GIS, and remote sensing techniques. With this research, I wanted to determine: 1) Where is an increase in tree establishment and growth occurring and where is it not? 2) If there is an increase in tree establishment and growth, when is this change occurring? 3) In locations where increases in tree establishment and growth occur, why are they occurring in those locations? A total of 619 tree cores were collected at three sites along transects placed on north- and south-facing aspects within the closed canopy forest and treeline zone. Dendroecological analyses show, that though initial increases in temperature increased tree establishment in Denali around 1915, a pulse in establishment beginning in the 1950s corresponded with a negative shift in total precipitation with this relationship primarily evident on south-facing aspects. The relationship between tree growth and climate also strengthened after the 1950s with the strongest relationships occurring on south-facings aspects. Remotely sensed imagery shows a 10% parkwide average increase of tree invasion into tundra dominated locations and 11% increase in infilling within pre-existing 1950s forested locations since the 1950s with the exception of the easternmost site which experienced an approximately 30% increase in infilling. Elevation, topographic position, and proximity to existing trees, which provide a seed source and protection from extreme climatic conditions, were the most important biophysical variables promoting new seedling establishment, growth, and survival since the mid-1950s.

Each week, classroom-based learners met with their instructors and classmates for four, fifty-minute sessions. These sessions included group study of text and audio, speaking activities, and dyadic and small group discussions. Web-based learners never met with their instructors or classmates face-to-face. Instead, they recorded weekly speaking assignments and completed two sixty-minute, text-based chats each week. All other aspects of the courses (e.g., automated grammar exercises and mobile immersion activities) were the same across the two conditions. Learner development was measured by a variety of pre- and posttests, ranging from standardized assessment measures, such as the WebCAPE and the SOPI (rated according to a 50-point scale), to more experimental tasks typical of laboratory-based studies in cognitive processing (speeded translation recognition and speeded grammaticality judgment). Correlations between individual learner variables (age, SAT scores, semester standing, previous course grades, and phonological working memory) and development were also considered. On all measures, it was found that web-based and classroom-based instruction supported statistically significant and comparable development. Some correlations between development and learner characteristics were found, but no correlations were found in both conditions at the same time, and the lack of repeated correlations between particular individual variables and all developmental outcomes suggests that no characteristic single-handedly determines the level of learner success in either environment. This dissertation provides quantitative evidence that web-based courses can constitute a viable and comprehensive alternative to classroom-based language instruction.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4578], "author_name_tesi": "Isenberg, Noelle Ariane", "last_name_ssi": "Isenberg", "middle_name_ssi": "Ariane", "first_name_ssi": "Noelle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "J Scott Payne", "Steve L Thorne", "Carrie Neal Jackson", "Adrian Johannes Wanner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barry Richard Page Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Chair", "J Scott Payne, Committee Chair", "Steve L Thorne, Committee Member", "Carrie Neal Jackson, Committee Member", "Adrian Johannes Wanner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["age", "phonological working memory", "individual differences", "grammaticality judgment", "translation recognition", "WebCAPE", "SOPI", "text-based chat", "mobile language learning", "German language", "oral proficiency", "distance language learning", "online language learning", "language learning", "distance learning", "online learning", "semester standing", "SAT scores", "grades", "development", "developmental outcomes", "The Pennsylvania State University", "German Online at PSU"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "\u201cBREAKING OVER THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PARTY:\u201d THE ROLE OF PARTY NEWSPAPERS IN DEMOCRATIC FACTIONALISM IN THE ANTEBELLUM NORTH, 1845-1852", "id": "11042", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4331", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\tIn the first half of the nineteenth century partisan newspapers performed a crucial function in the creation and maintenance of the Democratic Party. Partisan newspapers sprang up rapidly throughout the country in large cities and small towns, coastal ports and western settlements. For many of their readers, these newspapers embodied the party itself. The papers introduced readers to the leaders of their parties, disseminated party principles and creeds, and informed them of the seemingly nefarious machinations of their foes in other parties. They provided a common set of political ideals and a common political language that linked like-minded residents of distant communities, otherwise unknown to each other, in a cohesive organization. In the North, the focus of this dissertation, these newspapers interpreted regional economic development and local political issues within the context of their partisan ideals, providing guidance to readers as they confronted the parochial issues of their community.\n\tIronically, these same partisan newspapers also undermined their party\u2019s message and even sowed the seeds of dissent. Because partisan newspapers were independent businesses affiliated with a party, not operated by it, they retained a large degree of autonomy. Democratic leaders thus exerted imperfect and incomplete control of their most important tool for spreading the party message and communicating with voters. These papers often embodied the individual thoughts and opinions of their owner-editors as much as they represented the expressions of the party. These editors were inveterate boosters for their community, and they often bucked party principle when promoting the peculiar parochial needs of their community and customers. Though the party helped supply newspapers with much-needed customers, editors viewed their position as a public trust beholden to the needs and wants of their community, not party leaders. Editors altered the party creed and willfully inspired rebellious factions within the party in pursuit of growth and economic development for their communities, as well as increased social standing for themselves. These and similar actions weakened some voters\u2019 ideological attachment to the Democracy and contributed to the rise of new organizations, culminating with the Republican Party, that would supersede the Democratic Party in the North by the late 1850s.\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4303], "author_name_tesi": "Isham, Matthew Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Isham", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark E Neely Jr.", "Mark E Neely Jr.", "Anthony Edward Kaye", "Matthew Bennett Restall", "James Ford Risley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark E Neely Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Mark E Neely Jr., Committee Chair", "Anthony Edward Kaye, Committee Member", "Matthew Bennett Restall, Committee Member", "James Ford Risley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Democrats", "Whigs", "Antebellum North", "partisan newspapers"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Philosophical Commentary on C.

Meprins are zinc metalloproteases of the astacin family and metzincin superfamily that are obligate oligomers, targeted to the cell surface of brush border epithelial cells in the kidney and intestine, as well as to the surface of certain leukocytes and cancer cell lines.  Meprins are composed of two related subunits, alpha and beta.  Depending on the subunit composition, the meprin oligomers range in size from a membrane-bound, disulfide-bonded dimer (homooligomeric meprin B), to tetramers of heterooligomeric meprin A, to large, secreted alpha oligomers of ten or more subunits (homooligomeric meprin A).  The work herein investigated the contributions of N-linked glycosylation and the MAM (meprin, A5 protein, protein tyrosine phosphatase &#956;) domain to the formation and activity of the meprin A homooligomer.  \nMeprins are highly glycosylated, with carbohydrate accounting for approximately 20% of the subunit molecular mass.  Using chemical deglycosylation and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI/MS), it was shown that at least seven of the ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites of mouse meprin A are glycosylated.  The glycans are mainly composed of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), mannose, galactose, and a small amount of fucose.  Three glycosylation sites, N234 and N270 in the protease domain and N452 in the TRAF (tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor) domain, were found to be removed by PNGaseF under native conditions.  Removing these glycans did not markedly affect the protein conformation or oligomeric state, but decreased the stability of the oligomer as assessed by urea and heat denaturation.\nA series of single and double glycosylation site mutants were used to determine the contribution of glycosylation to the formation of the meprin oligomer.  No one individual glycosylation site affected formation of the oligomer, although one glycosylation site (N41) influenced the amount of secreted protein in the cell culture system.  Interestingly, two protease domain glycosylation sites (N152 and N270) were implicated in oligomerization.  The N152Q/N270Q and N152Q/N234Q/N270Q mutants were greatly impaired in their ability to form not only the high molecular mass oligomers, but also the disulfide-bonded dimers.  These mutations, unlike the other single and double mutants examined, did not retain proteolytic activity, demonstrating that glycosylation of the protease domain is involved in correct tertiary and quaternary structure formation.\nThe noncatalytic domains of meprin, MAM and TRAF, have previously been shown to contribute to oligomerization of meprin A.  Here, a series of single point mutants at charged residues in the putative MAM noncovalent interface (K352G, K361Y, R369Q, R376E, D377Y, D378T, R384G, K388L) were created.  All mutants were shown to affect formation of the noncovalent interface, with the exception of K361Y.  These mutants did not affect disulfide bond formation or proteolytic activity.  However, as several variants at position R384 demonstrate, the effect of these residues is not based solely on the presence or absence of charge, but may reflect a strict sequence requirement in the MAM domain of the alpha subunit.\nAs these studies demonstrate, charged residues of the MAM domain as well as posttranslational modifications influence the oligomeric structure of meprin A.  However, as these and previous studies have shown, it is unlikely that one particular feature of the alpha subunit can be introduced into the beta subunit to promote oligomerization of meprin B to higher order oligomers.  This highlights the highly complex folding process that must occur for each meprin subunit.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5578], "author_name_tesi": "Ishmael, Susan Senchak", "last_name_ssi": "Ishmael", "middle_name_ssi": "Senchak", "first_name_ssi": "Susan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith S Bond", "A Daniel Jones", "Channe D Gowda", "Ira Joseph Ropson", "Juliette T Lecomte"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith S Bond, Committee Chair", "A Daniel Jones, Committee Chair", "Channe D Gowda, Committee Member", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member", "Juliette T Lecomte, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["posttranslational modifications", "glycosylation", "oligomerization", "meprins", "proteases", "MAM domains"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Lithium Secondary Batteries - Interfaces and Electrodes", "id": "13213mmi122", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13213", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the last two decades, lithium-based batteries have revolutionized the energy storage technologies. Li-ion batteries have found widespread use in portable electronics and electric vehicle applications. However, a detailed understanding of the battery chemistry, especially the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)\u2014a thin passivation layer which is generated during the first charge cycle due to the reduction of electrolytes\u2014is still elusive. The mass scale commercialization of electric vehicles requires the storage capacity beyond the conventional Li-ion batteries, which spurred research interests towards Li-S technologies. Li-S batteries are attractive for their very high capacity and energy density, but their commercial application has been thwarted due to several critical limitations stemming from electrolyte dissociation chemistry and electrode material properties. To investigate the current issues associated with the Li-ion and Li-S batteries and to find possible countermeasures, we used both a newly developed computational tool eReaxFF and the standard ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics simulations in the following research areas:\n1) We developed a computational method, eReaxFF, for simulating explicit electrons within the framework of the standard ReaxFF reactive force field method. We treat electrons explicitly in a pseudoclassical manner that enables simulation several orders of magnitude faster than quantum chemistry (QC) methods, while retaining the ReaxFF transferability.  We describe in this thesis the fundamental concepts of the eReaxFF method, and the integration of the Atom-condensed Kohn-Sham DFT approximated to second order (ACKS2) charge calculation scheme into the eReaxFF. We trained our force field to capture electron affinities (EA) of various species. As a proof-of-principle, we performed a set of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an explicit electron model for representative hydrocarbon radicals. We establish a good qualitative agreement of EAs of various species with experimental data, and MD simulations with eReaxFF agree well with the corresponding Ehrenfest dynamics simulations. The standard ReaxFF parameters available in literature are transferrable to the eReaxFF method. The computationally economic eReaxFF method will be a useful tool for studying large-scale chemical and physical systems with explicit electrons as an alternative to computationally demanding QC methods.   \n2) A detailed understanding of the mechanism of the formation of SEI is crucial for designing high capacity and longer lifecycle lithium-ion batteries. The anode side SEI is primarily comprised of the reductive dissociation products of the electrolyte molecules. Any accurate computational method to study the reductive decomposition mechanism of electrolyte molecules is required to possess an explicit electronic degree of freedom. In this study, we employed our newly developed eReaxFF method to investigate the major reduction reaction pathways of SEI formation with ethylene carbonate (EC) based electrolytes. In the eReaxFF method, a pseudo-classical treatment of electrons provides the capability to simulate explicit electrons in a complex reactive environment. Our eReaxFF predicted simulation results of the EC decomposition reactions are in good agreement with the quantum chemistry data available in literature. Our MD simulations capture the mechanism of the reduction of the EC molecule due to the electron transfer from lithium, ring opening of the EC to generate EC-/Li+ radicals, and subsequent radical termination reactions.  Our results indicate that the eReaxFF method is a useful tool for large-scale simulations to describe redox reactions occurring at electrode-electrolyte interfaces where quantum chemistry based methods are not viable due to their high computational requirement.\n3) Li-S batteries still suffer several formidable performance degradation issues that impede their commercial applications. The lithium negative electrode yields high anodic capacity, but it causes dendrite formation and raises safety concerns. Furthermore, the high reactivity of lithium is accountable for electrolyte decomposition. To investigate these issues and possible countermeasures, we used ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate anode-electrolyte interfacial chemistry and utilized an ex-situ anode surface treatment with Teflon coating. In this study, we employed Li/SWCNT (single-wall carbon nanotube) composite anode instead of lithium metal and tetra (ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (TEGDME) as electrolyte. We find that at a lithium rich environment of the anode-electrolyte interface, electrolyte dissociates and generates ethylene gas as a major reaction product, while utilization of Teflon layer suppresses the lithium reactivity and reduces electrolyte decomposition. Lithium discharge from the negative electrode is an exothermic event that creates local hot spots at the interfacial region and expedites electrolyte dissociation reaction kinetics. Usage of Teflon dampens initial heat flow and effectively reduces lithium reactivity with the electrolyte.  \n4) Sulfur cathodes of Li-S batteries undergo a noticeable volume variation upon cycling, which induces stress. In spite of intensive investigation of the electrochemical behavior of the lithiated sulfur compounds, their mechanical properties are not very well understood. In order to fill this gap, we developed a ReaxFF interatomic potential to describe Li-S interactions and performed MD simulations to study the structural, mechanical, and kinetic behavior of the amorphous lithiated sulfur (a-LixS) compounds. We examined the effect of lithiation on material properties such as ultimate strength, yield strength, and Young\u2019s modulus. Our results suggest that with increasing lithium content, the strength of lithiated sulfur compounds improves, although this increment is not linear with the lithiation. The dependence of the mechanical properties and failure behavior on the loading rate of the amorphous lithiated sulfur compositions was also studied. The diffusion coefficients of both lithium and sulfur were computed for the a-LixS system at various stages of Li-loading. A Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) scheme was used to calculate the open circuit voltage (OCV) profile during cell discharge. The calculated OCV is consistent with prior experimental results. Our ReaxFF potentials also reproduced experimentally observed volume expansion of a-LixS phases upon lithiation. The Li-S binary phase diagram was constructed using genetic algorithm based tools. These simulation results provide insight into the behavior of sulfur-based cathode materials that are needed for developing high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13070], "author_name_tesi": "Islam, Md Mahbubul ", "last_name_ssi": "Islam", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Md Mahbubul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Donghai Wang", "Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Lasse Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin, Dissertation Advisor", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Chair", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member", "Hosam Kadry Fathy, Committee Member", "Lasse Jensen, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["eReaxFF", "ReaxFF", "Reactive molecular dynamics", "Solid eletrolyte interphase", "Lithium-sulfur battery", "Lithium-ion battery"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Metabolic modeling of microbial communities ", "id": "20510", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9664", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Most microbial communities change with time in response to changes and/or perturbations in environmental conditions.

It enables capturing the temporal dynamics of biomass concentration of the community members and extracellular concentration of the shared metabolites, while integrating species- and community-level fitness functions. The applicability of d-OptCom was demonstrated by modeling the dynamic co-growth of a number of auxotrophic mutant pairs of E. coli and by computationally assessing the dynamics and composition of a uranium-reducing community comprised of Geobacter sulfurreducens, Rhodoferax ferireducens and Shewanella oneidensis. d-OptCom was also employed to examine the impact of lactate vs. acetate addition on the relative abundance of uranium reducing species.

OrtT is not inactivated by neighboring YdcY (which is demonstrated to be a protein) nor is it inactivated by antitoxin GhoS. Also, OrtT is not inactivated by small RNA upstream or downstream of ortT. Moreover, screening a genomic library did not identify an antitoxin partner for OrtT. OrtT is a protein and its toxicity stems from membrane damage as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and cell lysis. Furthermore, OrtT reduces cell growth and metabolism in the presence of both antimicrobials trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole; these antimicrobials induce the stringent response by inhibiting tetrahydrofolate synthesis.

While the traditional theory using equilibrium concept shows that such strategy profile is self-enforcing, under a modification of the model, such strategy profile fails to be consistent with players' rationality.\n\nIn the first chapter I provide the simplest setting under which this non-rationalizability result of deterrence can be shown. The game is a two-player three-stage game: in the first stage, the players choose whether to enter the strategic interaction by paying some cost; in the second stage, the players play a prisoners' dilemma game; and in the third stage, the players play a coordination game. Each move is simultaneous and the players' past actions are perfectly monitored. While there exists a subgame-perfect equilibrium in which players can cooperate with the threat of punishment provided the punishment is strong enough, I show that the strategy profile does not consists of rationalizable strategies under a certain parameter values. This occurs because choosing to enter, unilaterally defect, and then punish the opponent is strictly dominated by a mixture of the two strategies ``do not enter'' and ``enter, defect, but do not punish.'' This result shows that a simple modification of the game and forward-induction consideration encoded in rationalizability might cast doubt on the idea of deterring defection by the threat of mutual punishment.\n\nThe other two chapters study to what extent the result in the fist chapter does or does not apply in different settings. The second chapter considers the infinite-horizon extension of the model in the first chapter. In the first period (denoted as period 0), the players choose whether to enter the game. After the players choose to enter, the continuation game is the infinite repetition of the stage game which consists of two phases: in the first phase players play prisoners' dilemma game, after which players simultaneously choose to continue the game, exit from the game without punishing the opponent, or punish the opponent and exit from the game. I show that with a similar condition as in the result in the first chapter, strategy which entails defection and punishment in the first stage is not rationalizable. Moreover, since the exit-without-punishment option works as an outside option in later stages of the game, we also obtain a result which provides conditions under which punishment after defection is excluded by rationalizability.\n\nThe third chapter extends the model in the first chapter toward an incomplete-information model in that it considers a model of random number of players, who are sequentially matched and play the game as in the first chapter. I assume that while the past actions in the stage games are not observable, occurrences of punishment is publicly observable to all the players (the typical example is the formation of cartels and the occurrence of leniency applications). I explore how this observable punishment works as a signaling device and how this model gives rise to a rationalizable use of punishment. I first show that a simple repetition of games does not give rise to a rationalizable punishment because of the assumption that the players cannot distinguish the non-occurrence of deviation and failure to punishment. I then discuss possible modifications to recover the punishment being an equilibrium action; i.e., that a small perturbation in payoffs can recover the possibility of punishment.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14607], "author_name_tesi": "Isogai, Shigeki ", "last_name_ssi": "Isogai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shigeki", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Green", "Edward Green", "Robert Clifford Marshall", "Vijay Krishna", "Lisa Lipowski Posey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Green, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward Green, Committee Chair", "Robert Clifford Marshall, Committee Member", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Member", "Lisa Lipowski Posey, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["game theory", "collusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Geographies of Learning: Place, Space, and Embodied Experience in Higher Education Field Courses", "id": "9877", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "224", "abstract_tesi": "Geographers argue that geographic context matters to all kinds of social processes, but geographers have rarely addressed the role of that context in the spatial dynamics of the circulation of knowledge.

Results are then compared to the nominal strength of cross-sections for all load cases.\nThe study shows that in high moment-low shear and high moment-high shear cases girder\ncurvature increases web stability, and there is no need for longitudinal stiffener to reach the\nnominal cross-section strength. However in high shear-low moment conditions, longitudinal\nstiffeners can be used to increase girder strength to resist shear.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2034], "author_name_tesi": "Issa-El-Khoury, Gaby Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Issa-El-Khoury", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Gaby", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Louis F Geschwindner Jr.", "Louis F Geschwindner Jr.", "Daniel G Linzell", "M Kevin Parfitt", "Ali M Memari", "Maria Lopez De Murphy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Louis F Geschwindner Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Louis F Geschwindner Jr., Committee Chair", "Daniel G Linzell, Committee Chair", "M Kevin Parfitt, Committee Member", "Ali M Memari, Committee Member", "Maria Lopez De Murphy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plate girder", "horizontally curved girder", "longitudinal stiffener", "web buckling"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Surface micro texturing using modulation assisted machining", "id": "19063", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8597", "abstract_tesi": "It has long been recognized that functional performance of engineering components is strongly determined by surface texture. While a number of methods exist for producing these textures, a key challenge in their adoption has been a general lack of scalable, cost-effective processes for their creation over large areas and in various geometric configurations.

In these novel methods, surface textures are controlled by the machining and modulation parameters. The following study seeks to develop an understanding of the mapping of these controllable parameters to the resulting surface textures through geometric simulation and physical experiment. A numerical simulation model was developed to enable visualization of how controllable parameters affect surface topography. This is complemented by an experimental study to determine the deviations between the simulation model and the real surface texture, as well as how the controllable input parameters affect this deviation. The results of these studies showed the effects of each of these processing parameters on surface texture in two material systems, brass and an aluminum alloy.

We show that the established result of Dessein (2002) that delegating decisions to a perfectly informed expert is generally better than communication is reversed if the principal can restrict the precision of the expert's information (without learning its content). We demonstrate that these organizational forms&#8213;informational control and delegation&#8213;can be either complements or substitutes, depending on the principal's ability to affect the expert's discretion about the set of allowed policies.\n   \nCHAPTER 2: Dynamic Information Revelation in Cheap Talk\nThis essay investigates a multi-stage version of Crawford and Sobel's (1982) communication game in which the principal can affect the quality of the expert's private information at each stage (without learning its content). We construct a mechanism of dynamic updating of expert's information, which refines the expert's information step-by-step, preserving truth-telling communication at every stage. This allows the principal to reveal approximately full information in a large sub-interval of the state space. As a result, the payoff efficiency in multi-stage communication relative to one-stage communication and other organizational forms rises without a bound as the bias in preferences falls.\n   \nCHAPTER 3: Information Revelation in Competitive Markets\nThis essay analyzes a market with multiple sellers and differentiated products. We investigate the sellers' incentives to reveal product relevant information that affects the buyer's private valuations. The main finding is that when the number of sellers reaches some critical (but finite) number, this results in the unique symmetric equilibrium with full disclosure of information by all sellers. Thus, unlike the results by Lewis and Sappington (1994) and Johnson and Myatt (2006) for monopoly, which state that the monopolist reveals either full information or no information, competition refines the seller's dichotomic decisions to a single extreme only. Also, we show that the market efficiency is always bounded away from full efficiency, but the magnitude of inefficiency converges to zero at a high rate as competition intensifies.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4110], "author_name_tesi": "Ivanov, Maxim ", "last_name_ssi": "Ivanov", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Maxim", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Vijay Krishna", "Edward James Green", "Paul David Fischer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Chair", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "Paul David Fischer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cheap talk", "communication", "information"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "The influence of kindergarten teachers' and principals' supervisory association on curriculum and teaching", "id": "6305", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "477", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the influence of different supervisory associations on curriculum and teaching in four public school kindergartens with a multiple case study method.  Three types of sampling procedures used to identify and study elementary school principals and kindergarten teachers were stratified, purposeful, and a subdivision of the purposefully chosen sample.  The stratified random sample based on type of region (East, West, North, or South PA); the purposefully chosen sample was chosen from the schools located near State College, PA.  The subdivision selected included four principals and four teachers for the multiple case studies, which comprised this dissertation\u2019s main focus.\nData generation sources for the multiple case studies encompassed interview transcripts, classroom observations with field notes, and observational checklists.  Results were organized in terms of four cases, and comparisons across the cases were made.      \nThe primary themes that emerged from the study and that were used to characterize the dyads were: (1) active and inactive-collegial supervisory associations, teachers of collegial supervisory associations with consistent curriculum beliefs and actual classroom practices: (2) inactive-hierarchical supervisory associations: and (3) teachers of inactive-hierarchical supervisory associations with inconsistent curriculum beliefs and actual classroom practices.  The collegial supervisory associations were primarily influenced by professional and moral authorities and supported by personal authority that established a circle of trust, respect, and shared understandings.  They nurtured the teachers\u201a and fostered commitment to their beliefs rather than oppressing them. This seemed linked to developmentally appropriate practices.  \nConversely, superior-subordinate supervisory associations were governed by bureaucratic and technical-rational authorities.  Such associations\u2019 dependence on external control of teachers explained the inactive nature of their associations that became evident through several interrelated indicators: ignorance of communication about teaching and learning; inability to share control; existence of hierarchical control; and silencing teachers.  An outcome of this type of supervisory association was to foster inconsistencies between the teachers\u2019 own thoughts and actions. It marginalized the teachers\u2019 impeded professionalism, and failed to recognize the complexity of their role responsibilities with respect to children. The resulting learning experiences for children were uni-dimensional, primarily revolving around formal instruction of academic skills.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [474], "author_name_tesi": "Ivrendi, Asiye ", "last_name_ssi": "Ivrendi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Asiye", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson", "John Daniel Marshall", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson, Committee Chair", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["kindergarten teacher-principal supervisory associa", "early childhood curriculum", "supervision of kindergarten teachers", "Developmentally appropriate practices"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EXAMINING CHILD MALARIA DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT PRACTICES AT AN OUTPATIENT CLINIC IN SOUTHWEST NIGERIA\n\n\n", "id": "11704", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2715", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-01-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Funded by the Eunice Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, this dissertation examined factors that influence the diagnosis and treatment of child malaria in a clinical setting in southwest Nigeria. If Millennium Development Goal 6-\u2013to halt and reverse malaria incidence by 2015 particularly among children\u2013\u2013is to be achieved, all factors that affect malaria reduction among children living in endemic countries must be identified. These factors are individual (maternal or physician characteristics), sociocultural (perceptions and beliefs) and contextual(availability of antimalaria drugs and malaria rapid diagnostic tests). Moreover, a firm understanding of the impact of these factors on diagnosis and treatment practices will substantially contribute to the success of malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa. A mixed method of qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in this study. They included: observations, semi-structured interviews, informal discussions, field notes, and the collection of finger prick blood samples for malaria rapid diagnostic tests. \nPaper 1 describes a study involving the use of the PEN-3 cultural model to identify mothers\u2019 positive health beliefs and practices associated with treatment-seeking for child febrile illness, to examine existential (unique) practices indigenous to mothers that have no harmful health consequences, and to explore negative beliefs and practices that limit recommended responses to febrile illness in children. The study presented in Paper 2 examined the concordance among physician\u2019s diagnosis of malaria, mother\u2019s perception of child malaria, and the results of malaria rapid diagnostic tests. In Paper 3, the Health Access Livelihood Framework was used to explore how services provided at an outpatient clinic in southwest Nigeria enabled and/or discouraged effective diagnosis and treatment of child malaria.\nDespite more than 100 years of control and eradication efforts, malaria remains one of the primary health problems encountered by children in sub-Saharan Africa. While there is increasing optimism about new opportunities for improved malaria control and possibly elimination, the success of such strategies is based on an understanding of the individual, socio-cultural, and contextual factors that influence effective case-management of malaria among children. Simply put, promising advances in malaria rapid diagnostic tests, or new drugs and vaccines to combat parasite resistance as well as other interventions, may have no effect if the same vigor is not applied to understanding the contexts in which human behaviors occur. Study findings illustrate the importance of understanding the multiple factors that influence diagnosis and treatment of malaria in children at an outpatient clinic. Incorporating knowledge of these factors into efforts aimed at controlling malaria is fundamental to effective case management of child malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2710], "author_name_tesi": "Iwelunmor, Juliet ", "last_name_ssi": "Iwelunmor", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Juliet", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Collins O Airhihenbuwa", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa", "Rhonda Belue", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "Gary King", "Edward A Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Collins O Airhihenbuwa, Dissertation Advisor", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa, Committee Chair", "Rhonda Belue, Committee Member", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Member", "Gary King, Committee Member", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Malaria", "diagnosis", "treatment", "outpatient clincs"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Investigation into the Mechanism of the Reaction Catalyzed by Escherichia coli Cyclopropane Fatty Acid Synthase", "id": "7175", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1393", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cyclopropane fatty acid (CFA) synthases catalyze the formation of cyclopropane rings from unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) that are natural components of membrane phospholipids.  The bridging methylene carbon of the cyclopropane ring derives from the activated methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), affording S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcys) and a proton as the remaining products.  This reaction is unique among AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases in that the reaction involves a formal methylene transfer rather than methyl transfer.  Additionally, the double bond of the UFA substrate is isolated and unactivated towards nucleophilic or electrophilic addition, raising the question as to the timing and mechanism of proton loss from the activated methyl group of AdoMet.  Through use of elemental effects and isotope effects, we demonstrated that the mechanism proceeds though initial methyl transfer from AdoMet to the \u00f0-electrons of the olefin substrate yielding a secondary carbocation intermediate.\nThe crystal structures of three cyclopropane mycolic acid (CMA) synthases, which are homologues of CFA synthase, revealed the existence of a bicarbonate ion in the active site.  We demonstrated that CFA synthase activity increases 25-30 fold in the presence of saturating bicarbonate, and we observed a KM of 49.3 \u00b1 5.9 \u00b5M for bicarbonate.  We demonstrated that other trigonal planar molecules have effects on CFA synthase activity: borate inhibits CFA synthase activity, while nitrate and formate promote activity.  \u00e1-Secondary kinetic isotope effects (kH/kD) in the presence (0.85 \u00b1 0.027) and absence (1.07 \u00b1 0.16) of bicarbonate and intramolecular primary kinetic isotope effects (kH/kD) in the presence (3.36 \u00b1 0.03 and 4.84 \u00b1 0.09 for [methyl-d1]-AdoMet and [methyl-d2]-AdoMet, respectively) and absence (3.07 \u00b1 0.21 and 4.88 \u00b1 0.10 for [methyl-d1]-AdoMet and [methyl-d2]-AdoMet, respectively) of bicarbonate allowed the role of bicarbonate to be determined.  Bicarbonate acts to alter the transition state by compressing the active site during methyl transfer.  Additionally, the bicarbonate ion acts to stabilize the carbocation that forms subsequent to methyl transfer.  Finally, the bicarbonate ion does not act as the general base in the CFA synthase reaction mechanism, as has been previously proposed.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1382], "author_name_tesi": "Iwig, David Frederick", "last_name_ssi": "Iwig", "middle_name_ssi": "Frederick", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Squire J Booker", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Blake R Peterson", "Robert Allen Schlegel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Squire J Booker, Committee Chair", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Member", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Member", "Blake R Peterson, Committee Member", "Robert Allen Schlegel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cyclopropane fatty acid synthase", "adenosyl-L-methionine"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Socioeconomic Status Does Not Explain Ethnic/racial Disparities in Cervical Cancer Screenings", "id": "14141", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7343", "abstract_tesi": "Background: In recent years, successful screening strategies have lowered rates of cervical cancer in the United States. Researchers often attribute ethnic/racial differences in screenings among minorities to access to care. Prior literature shows mixed evidence for ethnic/racial disparities in cervical cancer screening usage. This study examined ethnic/racial differences in screenings and whether socioeconomic status (SES) explained the differences in cervical cancer screening among ethnic/racial groups.\n\nMethods: Using data from the 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, this study measured whether minority women (Black, Asian, and Hispanic) age 21-70, received fewer Pap tests within the past three years compared to non-Hispanic White women (N= 8622). This study used logistic regression to determine whether SES (income, education, employment) explained ethnic/racial differences in cervical cancer screenings (Pap test in past 3 years). \n\nResults: In the study sample, the authors found that 91% of Black women (p<.001) and 77% of Asian women (p<.001) received a Pap test within the past three years, compared to 86.73% of non-Hispanic White women. Controlling for insurance status and age, the odds that Black women received screening were 1.91 times the odds of non-Hispanic women getting a Pap test (OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.48-2.45).  Puerto Ricans had odds nearly twice as high as non-Hispanic Whites (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.10-3.67) and other Latina women had odds that were 1.78 times the odds of non-Hispanic Whites receiving a Pap test (OR: 1.78,95% CI: 1.25-2.52). The odds for Asians receiving screening were 0.46 lower compared to the odds of non-Hispanic Whites. (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.35-0.61). Privately and publicly insured women had odds that were 4.54 and 1.71 times those of uninsured women respectively (OR: 4.54, 95% CI: 3.70-5.56; and OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.33-2.19). Further, controlling for SES, ethnic/racial differences remained in the odds of screening for Blacks and Hispanic women (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Other Latinas) (OR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.63-2.77; OR: 1.61, 95% 1.23-2.12; OR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.08-3.66; OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.42-3.07) compared to non-Hispanic White women.  After controlling for SES, private and public insurance was associated with more screening compared to no insurance (OR: 3.69, 95% CI 2.89-4.69; OR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.47-2.54). However, the odds ratio for screenings for privately insured women did drop from 4.54 to 3.69, after controlling for SES. Middle-income women [125-199% or 200-399% federal poverty line (FPL)] had odds of screening that were 35% and 32% lower than the poorest women (\u2264100 FPL) respectively. Finally, women with a college education or more had odds that were 2.45 higher of  receiving pap tests and the odds for women with a high school education or equivalent were 1.28 higher than women with less than a high school education. Including SES factors yielded no significant effects for women who were employed versus those who were not.\n\nConclusion: Ethnic/racial differences exist in cervical cancer screenings use. Although a significant predicator, SES did not explain the observed ethnic/racial differences. Results indicate that Asian women receive fewer screenings compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Furthermore, although the results indicate Mexican women have higher rates of screenings compared to non-Hispanic Whites, their rates are the lower compared to other races/ethnicities except for Asians. Future studies should consider exploring why these populations receive fewer screenings. This study can assist public health practitioners and policy makers develop targeted interventions to increase screenings among the racial/ethnic and low SES women. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7312], "author_name_tesi": "Iyer, Apeksha Raju", "last_name_ssi": "Iyer", "middle_name_ssi": "Raju", "first_name_ssi": "Apeksha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Y Miranda", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Y Miranda, Thesis Advisor", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cancer Prevention", "Cervical Cancer Screenings", "Minority Women", "Epidemiological Paradox"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Role of Tec family kinases Itk and Btk in FceRI mediated Mast cell signaling", "id": "8866", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "371", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fc epsilon Receptor I (Fc&#949;RI) signaling in Mast Cells (MCs) play an important role in IgE mediated allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and allergic asthma. Antigen cross-linking of IgE bound to the Fc&#949;RI releases proinflammatory mediators that can cause vasodilation, mucous secretion, activation and recruitment of other inflammatory cells. Itk and Btk are critical signal amplifiers downstream of TCR and BCR,\nrespectively. Although both are expressed in MCs, their relative importance in Fc&#949;RI signaling is not clear.\nMice lacking Itk exhibit impaired Th2 cytokine secretion and reduced immunological symptoms during allergic airway responses. However, they have increased levels of circulating serum IgE. We have examined the role of Itk in MC function and Fc&#949;RI signaling. We report here that Itk null mice have reduced allergen/IgE induced histamine release as well as early airway hyperresponsiveness in vivo. This is due to the increased levels of IgE in the serum of these mice, which precludes the binding of antigen specific IgE on MCs. The transfer of Itk-/- BMMCs into MC deficient W/Wv animals is able to completely rescue histamine release in these mice.\nFurther analysis of Itk-/- BMMC in vitro revealed that while they have normal degranulation responses, they secrete elevated levels of cytokines, including IL-13 and TNF-&#945;. Analysis of biochemical events downstream of the Fc&#949;RI revealed little difference in overall tyrosine phosphorylation of specific substrates or calcium responses,however, these cells express elevated levels of NFAT. Microarray analysis suggests that\nItk can regulate Fc&#949;RI mediated gene expression.To evaluate the potential specific and redundant functions of Itk and Btk in Fc&#949;RI\nmediated signaling, we generated the Itk/Btk DKO mice. These mice have reduced MC granularity and impaired responses to systemic anaphylaxis in vivo. We characterized the biochemical responses to Fc&#949;RI using Itk/BTK DKO BMMCs. In vitro analysis suggests that the downstream signaling responses in Itk/Btk DKO BMMCs are very similar to\nthose observed in Btk-/- BMMCs. Specifically calcium responses, PLC&#947;2 phosphorylation and degranulation were found to be impaired. However, phosphorylation of Erk was not affected in the Itk/Btk DKO BMMCs, suggesting that Erk/MAPK\nactivation in Fc&#949;RI signaling is independent of Itk and Btk.\nIn addition to the impairment of MC responses, the Itk/Btk DKO mice have multiple defects in lymphoid development. They have reduced CD4+ T cells due to absence of Itk and reduced B cells due to the loss of Btk. These mice have extremely high levels of serum IgE, suggesting that both, Itk and Btk are required for mediating B cell\nclass switch to IgE. Overall our results suggest that Tec kinases have cell type specific function. Thus while Itk plays a more critical role in T cell function, it may play a more\nspecialized role in MCs. Our data also supports the idea that Itk and Btk have unique roles in Fc&#949;RI signaling cells and both kinases are required for optimal MC function in vivo. Btk is more important for early response such as phosphorylation of PLC&#947;2 and Ca2+ mobilization.

The elucidation of in vivo molecular mechanisms involved in synaptic transmission has been a major research objective in neuroscience.  One important approach to achieve this goal is genetic analysis in Drosophila melanogaster. The synaptic mechanisms of Drosophila are similar to those in vertebrates and, with the advantage of performing in vivo functional analysis of native synapses using genetic, molecular, biochemical, electrophysiological and ultrastructural approaches, Drosophila is a powerful model system. Analysis of temperature sensitive (TS) paralytic mutants of Drosophila has played an important role in elucidating the in vivo molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission.  TS paralytic mutants may allow normal development and function at permissive temperatures and reveal the physiological role of a specific gene product following its acute perturbation at restrictive temperatures. Forward genetic screens for TS paralytic mutants and screens for modifiers of existing TS mutants have revealed novel mechanisms in synaptic transmission. The present work discusses the functional and molecular characterization of two proteins participating in synaptic transmission, DISABLED and COMPLEXIN, in the Drosophila model system.\nMembers of the DISABLED (DAB) family of proteins are known to play a conserved role in endocytic trafficking of cell surface receptors by functioning as monomeric CLATHRIN Associated Sorting Proteins (CLASPs) which recruit cargo proteins into endocytic vesicles. The present study reports analysis of a Drosophila disabled mutant, dabEC1 (enhancer of cac1) (Lisa Posey, Masters Thesis, Penn State University, 2008), which was recovered as an enhancer of the presynaptic TS calcium channel mutant cacTS2. Genetic and functional characterization of dabEC1 has revealed a novel role for DAB proteins in chemical synaptic transmission. dabEC1 exhibits impaired synaptic function including a rapid, activity-dependent reduction in neurotransmitter release and disruption of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. In presynaptic boutons, Drosophila DAB (dDAB) and CLATHRIN were highly co-localized within two distinct classes of puncta, including relatively dim puncta which were located at active zones (AZs) which may reflect endocytic mechanisms operating at neurotransmitter release sites. Finally, broader analysis of endocytic proteins including DYNAMIN supported a novel role for CLATHRIN-mediated endocytic mechanisms in rapid clearance of neurotransmitter release sites for subsequent vesicle priming and refilling of the release-ready vesicle pool. \nThe current study of neurotransmitter release mechanisms also provides new insights into the role of COMPLEXIN (CPX) proteins in synaptic transmission. CPX proteins are known to interact with the Soluble NSF Attachment Protein REceptors (SNARE) proteins at the core of the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery and regulate neurotransmitter release. Several studies, including cpx knockout and knockdown studies in mouse, genetic deletion of cpx in Drosophila and in vitro fusion assays, have demonstrated a role for CPX in supporting evoked neurotransmitter release and an inhibitory or clamping role in suppressing spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion. However, the in vivo mechanisms of CPX function in neurotransmitter release remain controversial. To further investigate these mechanisms, we have conducted a genetic screen to obtain new mutants within the Drosophila cpx gene. Here we report recovery and analysis of a new cpx mutant in Drosophila, cpx1257, revealing spatially defined and separable pools of CPX which make distinct contributions to its activation and clamping functions.  \nThe mutation in cpx1257 deletes only the last C-terminal amino acid of CPX within the well conserved CAAX motif for prenylation, a post-translational lipid modification implicated in membrane targeting of CPX and other cytosolic proteins. Our immunocytochemical studies have revealed that CPX is highly enriched at active zone (AZ) regions of the presynaptic plasma membrane containing neurotransmitter release sites and is also detected in presynaptic plasma membrane compartments outside of the AZ, including synaptic vesicles. Biochemical studies confirmed membrane association of CPX and robust interactions of CPX with all the three SNARE proteins. In contrast, at cpx1257 mutant synapses, AZ localization of CPX persists but there is selective loss of broader presynaptic membrane localization of CPX and, surprisingly, the bulk of the CPX-SNARE protein interactions are also abolished in this mutant.\nFunctional analysis of cpx1257 began with electrophysiological studies at adult neuromuscular synapses in a previously reported cpx null mutant as a basis for comparison. These experiments demonstrated severe reduction in the activation of evoked neurotransmitter release, as indicated by a marked reduction in the amplitude of the Excitatory PostSynaptic Current (EPSC). This phenotype is accompanied by a marked increase in the frequency of spontaneous fusion events, reflecting a loss of the CPX clamping function. Further, the null mutant exhibited an altered EPSC waveform, observed as a slowing of the EPSC rise and decay times with respect to wild-type. Interestingly, this is a presynaptic phenotype and thus indicates a role for CPX in determining the kinetics of neurotransmitter release. In contrast to the cpx null, the cpx1257 mutant exhibited a wild-type EPSC amplitude and waveform, demonstrating that cpx1257 retains the CPX activation function in evoked neurotransmitter release. However, cpx1257 exhibited a selective loss of clamping function as indicated by a marked increase in the frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release. Together with the preceding immunocytochemical and biochemical analysis, these findings indicate that spatially distinct and separable interactions of CPX with presynaptic membranes and SNARE proteins appear to mediate separable activation and clamping functions of CPX in neurotransmitter release.\nWe have used Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to investigate the in vivo mechanisms of synaptic transmission. Our analysis of DISABLED and COMPLEXIN function in neurotransmitter release advances our understanding of synaptic function and illustrates the power of forward genetic analysis in defining the molecular basis of physiological processes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7739, 7740, 7741, 7742, 7743], "author_name_tesi": "Iyer, Janani ", "last_name_ssi": "Iyer", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Janani", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fumiko Kawasaki", "Richard W Ordway", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Melissa Rolls", "Wendy Hanna Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fumiko Kawasaki, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard W Ordway, Dissertation Advisor", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Chair", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Genetic Analysis", "Synaptic Transmission", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Neurotransmission"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Computational complexity of data mining algorithms used in fraud detection", "id": "26437", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11604", "abstract_tesi": "According to estimates by certain government agencies, 10% of the total medical expenditure is lost to healthcare fraud.

It is not possible for a human to sift through these massive datasets and find the fraudulent transactions. Hence credit card companies and insurance companies use data mining algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions. These data mining algorithms need to identify the fraudulent transactions efficiently and at the same time they need to process the dataset as quickly as possible. The time taken by the algorithm to execute is a function of the computational complexity of the algorithm. In this thesis, the theoretical running time complexities of the various data mining algorithms used in fraud detection are compared, i.e. the complexity is expressed as a function of the number of instances in the database.

It has been estimated that up to 40% of the United States' underground infrastructure will have failed or will be on the brink of failure within 20 years, unless efforts are initiated to renew it. But system renewal requires adequate funding. According to an April 2000 report by the Water Infrastructure Network (WIN) Agency, \"America's water and wastewater systems face an estimated funding gap of $23 billion a year between current investments in infrastructure and the investments that will be needed annually over the next 20 years to replace aging and failing pipes and meet mandates of the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act\". This necessitates the need to monitor, detect and prevent any unforeseen failures in the working of underground pipelines that are complex in nature. A reliable pipeline assessment system is necessary so that pipeline operators can develop cost-effective maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation programs. This research proposes an automated ultrasound-immersion-based inspection system that can add complementary pipe information (depth perception) to existing surface image assessments done on concrete pipes commonly used as gravity stormwater and sewer pipes. Most municipal pipeline systems in North America are inspected visually by mobile Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) systems to access the in-situ condition of buried pipes. The video images are examined visually and classified into grades according to extent of damage against documented criteria by human operators prone to fatigue,\nsubjectivity and ambiguity. Additionally, current imaging systems like Sewer Scanning & Evaluation Technology (SSET) and CCTV are able to provide information from within the pipe regarding surface\ncracks in 2-D only and do not have the capability to provide depth perception.\n\nThis thesis provides a proof-of-concept of an automated ultrasound-immersion-based inspection system to detect defects in buried concrete pipes. The inspection system is proposed as a two step approach. The first step is called a reconnaissance mission that uses the ultrasound transducer to scan a region of interest. A signal interpretation and classification scheme coupled with a post processing algorithm is proposed that classifies the region of interest into a clean or defect region. If the scanned region of interest belongs to a defect, the second step characterizes the region of interest with a C-scan imaging process that provides depth perception. Results have shown that the feature extraction, classification and post processing schemes proposed in this thesis provide a sound proof-of-concept for developing this inspection system into a field applicable tool.

In order for the surrogate fuel to match the combustion properties of JP-8, the composition of the surrogate fuel was selected so that its H/C ratio, molecular weight, derived cetane number, and the threshold soot index (TSI) match the corresponding values for the JP-8. The first part of this study focuses on establishing the utility of TSI as the parameter to match the sooting tendency of the surrogate fuels and JP-8.  Measurements were conducted to compare the soot volume fractions for JP-8 and its TSI-matched surrogates in laboratory flames and in a model gas turbine combustor. Because the sooting tendency of the aromatic component has a critical influence on the TSI of the surrogate fuel, it is necessary to understand the relationship of TSI and soot formation for aromatic compounds in order to pick the most suitable aromatic component for the surrogate fuel. The second part of the thesis focuses on understanding the relationship between TSI and soot characteristics for aromatic-fueled laboratory flames. \nA laminar co-flow wick burner was developed for use with liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The burner was calibrated to correlate the sooting tendencies of all the fuels studied using TSI. Peak soot volume fractions for binary mixtures of iso-octane and toluene were correlated with the smoke heights using Kent\u2019s model which showed that the wick burner was consistent with the burners of Kent and Olson et al. In order to establish the extent to which the soot fields of surrogate fuels match that of JP-8, laser extinction measurements were used to obtain soot fields for JP-8 and surrogate fuels on the wick burner. In addition, net soot production for JP-8 and solvent-based surrogate fuels were measured on a model gas turbine combustor for JP-8 and its TSI-matched surrogate fuels. The soot fields in the flames and the soot concentrations in the combustor showed excellent agreement within \u00b1 15% which confirmed that TSI works well as an indicator of sooting tendency of surrogate fuels matched to the TSI of JP-8.\nThe study of the relationship of TSI and the soot characteristics of aromatic compounds involved four fuels. 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and n-propylbenzene were studied because they were potential aromatic components for the surrogate fuels in the MURI program. iso-propylbenzene and m-xylene were selected because they had similar TSI to 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and n-propylbenzene respectively, but substantially different soot volume fractions (20-30%). Axial soot measurements and radial soot profiles for the aromatic fuels were used to characterize the formation and oxidation dominated regions in the flames. 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and m-xylene showed about 20% higher soot volume fractions than the propylbenzenes. Differences were also observed in the overall soot formation and oxidation rates among the fuels. Estimates of formation and oxidation based on temperature measurements from the literature showed that differences in temperatures cannot fully account for differences in sooting. Consequently, studies were done to determine whether morphology of soot could account for the differences. Morphology was investigated using multi-angle scattering (MAS) and thermophoretic sampling/TEM analysis. MAS showed that primary particle sizes were the same within the experimental uncertainty of \u00b1 15% for all the fuels. 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and m-xylene had 2.5 times and 2 times higher particle number densities, respectively, than n-propylbenzene. TEM data for n-propylbenzene and m-xylene also showed that the fuels had similar particle sizes.  Thermogravimetric measurements of oxidation rates of soot from all four aromatics showed that the mass specific rates of oxidation were identical for all four fuels. Analysis of these results provided additional confirmation that primary particle sizes were the same. These results pointed towards different particle number densities for the fuels as the reason that they form different amounts of soot. Since number densities are related to nucleation, modeling analysis were performed to examine nucleation rates for m-xylene and n-propylbenzene using state-of-the-art chemical kinetic mechanisms. Higher concentrations of PAH and acetylene from the simulations were consistent with the hypothesis that m-xylene had a greater number of primary particles than n-propylbenzene.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7950], "author_name_tesi": "Iyer, Venkatesh Ramasubramanian", "last_name_ssi": "Iyer", "middle_name_ssi": "Ramasubramanian", "first_name_ssi": "Venkatesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Litzinger", "Robert John Santoro", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Litzinger, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Soot", "diffusion flames", "surrogate fuels", "Threshold Soot Index", "smoke point", "aromatic compounds."]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Biochemical characterization of the proteins involved in Gluconacetobacter hansenii cellulose synthesis", "id": "15305", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7590", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\tGluconacetobacter hansenii is a Gram-negative bacterium, considered as the model organism for studying the process of cellulose biogenesis.

The porosity-permeability correlation in geologic media can be complex and depends on several factors such as fracture size distribution, fracture orientations, fracture network connectivity and in situ stresses, among others. \nWithin fractured reservoirs under geothermal conditions, coupling between fluid transport, mechanical response, heat transfer and chemical reactions may change the permeability and influence the induced seismicity both during short-term reservoir stimulation and long-term production. During short-term stimulation, rapid enhancement of fracture permeability occurs as a result of circulating fluid through these fracture networks. During long-term production, hydraulic and thermal effects both contribute to the reactivation of the natural fracture networks and that also enhances the reservoir permeability. During the reactivation of pre-existing fractures due to hydraulic transport and mechanical deformation, seismic events occur when fluid circulates between the injection and production wells with a large number of high magnitude events associated with the initiation of the reservoir stimulation. \nDetermining dominant behaviors that control the enhancement of permeability and the triggering of induced seismicity is the main focus of this work. This dissertation examines the role of coupled thermal, hydraulic, mechanical and chemical effects on various fracture networks in promoting the failure of pre-existing fractures and their influence on the evolution of seismicity and of permeability. \nPart I of this thesis (Chapters 1 and 2) explores the behavior of engineered geothermal systems under the response of complex interactions that change the permeability and induce seismicity. First a model is introduced to evaluate the rate of propagation of seismicity within a fractured reservoir that represents the Cooper Basin geothermal field. This model is used in Chapter 1 to explore the spatial and temporal distribution of seismic activity within reservoir and to replicate observed patterns. We then apply this understanding (Chapter 2) to more complex fracture networks utilized to explore the reservoir behaviors during reservoir stimulation to production and in understanding the effects that can promote induced seismicity. This model is applied for both the Cooper Basin and Coso geothermal field, for which data are available. The models developed and validated in Chapters 1 and 2 are then applied to project the response of the Newberry EGS demonstration project to both stimulation (Chapter 3) and long-term production (Chapter 4). Part II (Appendix) explores the role of strains developed in unconstrained sorbing and swelling fractured media (coal) and their role in evolving permeability and in understanding the behavior  when CO2 is injected into ECBM or into sequestration sites.\nIn chapter 1, we use a continuum model of reservoir evolution to explore the interaction of coupled thermal, hydraulic and chemical processes that influence the seismicity evolution from stimulation through production. Events occur from energy released of seeded fractures enabling moment magnitude, frequency and spatial distribution to be determined with time. We evaluated the magnitude of events which varies in a range of -2 to +2. The largest event size (~2) corresponds to the largest fracture size (~500m) and a prescribed stress drop of 9MPa. Modeled b-values (~0.6 to 0.7) correspond to observations (~0.7 to 0.8) and this approach is successfully calibrated against observations in the Cooper Basin (Australia). Then we tracked the hydrodynamic and thermal fronts to define causality in the triggering of seismicity. The hydrodynamic front moves twice as fast as the thermal front and envelops the triggered seismicity at early time (days to month) \u2013 with higher flow rates correlating with larger magnitude events. For later time (month to years) thermal drawdown and potentially chemical influences principally trigger the seismicity but result in a reduction in both the number of events and their magnitudes. \n\nIn chapter 2, we explore the role of thermal, hydraulic and chemical effects on the evolution of seismicity in reservoirs from stimulation through production. We use a continuum model capable of accommodating changes in stress that result from change in fluid pressure as well as thermal stress. Discrete penny-shaped fractures are seeded within the reservoir volume and failure of fractures is calculated from the finite difference model FLAC3D. Energy release magnitude is utilized to obtain the magnitude-moment relation for induced seismicity both by location and with time. We calibrate fracture spacing and length of fractures in the model and replicate observed b-values during reservoir production (10years). We observe that the larger the energy release the larger the number of events induced at a given location and the greater the probability of large-magnitude events. As the seeded fracture size is increased the moment-magnitude also increases. Maximum magnitudes for identical fracture distributions are Ms ~2 for the Cooper Basin and ~1.2 for Coso corresponds to the largest fracture size (~500m) and a prescribed stress drop of 9MPa and 3MPa. We applied low and high (0.1m-1 vs. 0.2m-1) fracture densities in the model for Cooper Basin reservoir to explore the behavior of moment magnitude distribution. For the widely spaced fracture networks (0.1m-1), the increase in rate of propagation of events reaches a smaller radius from the injection point and induces seismicity evolution is slower with time compared to the behavior of the closely spaced fracture network (0.2m-1). We observed that the modeled b-values (~0.6 to 0.7) also correspond to observations (~0.7 to 0.8). Then we tracked the hydrodynamic and thermal fronts and to define causality in the triggering of seismicity. The hydrodynamic front moves twice as fast as the thermal front and envelops the triggered seismicity at early time (days to month) \u2013 with higher flow rates correlating with larger magnitude events. For later time (month to years) thermal drawdown and potentially chemical influences principally trigger the seismicity but result in a reduction in both the number of events and their magnitude. \nIn chapter 3, we utilize a continuum model of reservoir behavior subject to coupled THMC (thermal, hydraulic, mechanical and chemical) processes to explore the evolution of stimulation-induced seismicity and of permeability in EGS reservoirs. Our continuum model is capable of accommodating changes in effective stresses that result due to the evolving spatial variations in fluid pressure as well as thermal stress and chemical effects. Discrete penny-shaped fractures (~10-1200m) are seeded within the reservoir volume at prescribed (faults) and random (fractures) orientations and with a Gaussian distribution of lengths and location. Failure is calculated from a continuum model using a Coulomb criterion for friction. Energy release magnitude is utilized to obtain the magnitude-moment relation for induced seismicity by location and with time. This model is applied to a single injector (stimulation) to the proposed Newberry EGS field (USA). We stimulate the reservoir in four zones of differing fracture network properties B, C, D and E (shallow to deep) and at four different depths of 2000, 2500, 2750 and 3000 m. The same network of large fractures (density of 0.003 m-1 and spacing 300 m) is applied in all zones and supplemented by more closely spaced fractures with densities of 0.5 m-1 in the shallow zone B, 0.9 m-1 in the intermediate zones C and D and 0.26 m-1 in the deepest zone E. We show that permeability enhancement is modulated by hydraulic, thermal, and chemical (THMC) processes and that permeability increases by an order of magnitude during stimulation at each depth. For the widely spaced fracture networks, the increase in permeability reaches a smaller radius from the injection point and permeability evolution is slower with time compared to the behavior of the closely spaced fracture network. For seismic events that develop with the stimulation, event magnitude (MS) varies from -2 to +1.9 and the largest event size (~1.9) corresponds to the largest fractures (~1200m) within the reservoir. We illustrate that the model with the highest fracture density generates both the most and the largest seismic events (MS =1.9) within the 21 day stimulation. Rate of hydraulic and thermal transport has a considerable influence on the frequency, location and time of failure and ultimately event rate. Thus the event rate is highest when the fracture network has the largest density (0.9m-1) and is located at depth where the initial stresses are highest (zone D). Apparent from these data is that the closely spaced fracture network with the higher stress regime (at the deeper level) has the largest b-value ~0.74.\nIn chapter 4, we utilize a numerical model to examine thermal-hydrologic-mechanical-chemical processes leading to the evolution of induced seismicity in naturally fractured dual-porosity media. We use a continuum model to examine the thermo-hydro-mechanical behaviors due to variation in fluid pressure and thermal stress on different fracture networks within a prototypical enhanced geothermal system (EGS). Discrete penny-shaped fractures are seeded within the reservoir volume with random orientations and a Gaussian distribution of lengths. Failure is calculated from Coulomb strengths. Energy release magnitude is utilized to obtain the magnitude-moment relation for induced seismicity by location and with time. This model is applied to the potential Newberry EGS field (USA) by assuming fracture sizes of 10 to 1200 m. Models are classified by their conceptualization of the fractured reservoir geometry as both networks of discrete fractures and with equivalent fractured media as fill-in. This model is applied to a doublet injector-producer to explore the spatial and temporal triggering of seismicity for varied fracture network geometries at shallow (2000m) and deep (2750) depths. First we consider the identical network of large fractures (300 m fracture spacing) in both shallow and deep zones and infilled with smaller (10-200m) more closely spaced fractures with densities of 0.5 m-1 in the shallow zone (B) and of 0.9 m-1 in the deeper zone D. Then we apply a different network where the spacing of the large fractures are halved (~150m) in both zones but with the small closely spaced fractures retained with densities of 0.5m-1 in the shallow zone (B) and 0.9m-1 in the deeper zone (D). We evaluate the magnitude of seismic events that vary from -2 to +1.9 with the largest event size (~1.9) corresponding to the largest fracture size (~1200m) within the reservoir. We illustrate that the model with the higher fracture density generates both the most and the largest seismic events (MS =1.9), thus the evolution of seismicity is quickest and migration of seismic events is fastest with radius from the injector compared with the case for more widely-spaced fractures. Rate of hydraulic and thermal transport has a considerable influence on the amount, location and time of failure and ultimately event rate. Thus, the event rate is higher when the fracture network has the larger density (0.9m-1) with closely-spaced fractures (150m) and is located at depth where the initial stresses are highest (zone D). In addition, the modeled b-value shows that there is a relation between fracture networks, fracture spacing, and the evolution of seismicity. In all cases, the a-value is decreased and the b-value is increased with time and this indicates small-magnitude events with a small number of events induced during long term production. Apparent from these data is that the closely spaced fracture network with the higher fracture density and stress regime (at the deeper level) has the largest b-value ~1.34. Finally, we evaluate the thermal energy recovered during the production and the results show that the highest thermal energy is recovered from the deeper zone (D) with the more closely-spaced fractures (150m). \n\tIn appendix, we explore the conundrum of how permeability of coal decreases with swelling-induced sorption of a sorbing gas, such as CO2. We show that for free swelling of an unconstrained homogeneous medium where free swelling scales with gas pressure then porosity must increase as pressure increases. The volume change is in the same sense as volume changes driven by effective stresses and hence permeability must increase with swelling. An alternative model is one where voids within a linear solid are surrounded by a damage zone. In the damage zone the Langmuir swelling coefficient decreases outwards from the wall and the modulus increases outwards from the wall. In each case this is presumed to result from micro-fracturing-induced damage occurring during formation of the cleats.  We use this model to explore anticipated changes in porosity and permeability that accompany gas sorption under conditions of constant applied stress and for increments of applied gas pressure. This model replicates all important aspects of the observed evolution of permeability with pressure. As gas pressure is increased, permeability initially reduces as the material in the wall swells and this swelling is constrained by the far-field modulus. As the peak Langmuir strain is approached, the decrease in permeability halts and permeability increases linearly with pressure. This behavior is apparent even as the constraint on damage around is relaxed and ultimately removed to represent a homogeneous linear solid containing multiple interacting flaws.  In either case the rate of permeability loss is controlled by crack geometry, the Langmuir swelling coefficient and the void \u201cstiffness\u201d and the rate of permeability increase is controlled by crack geometry and void \u201cstiffness\u201d alone. Permeability evolution may be approximated by a single non-dimensional variable incorporating fracture spacing, flaw-length, Langmuir strain and initial permeability. This model represents the principal features of permeability evolution in swelling media and is a mechanistically consistent and plausible model for behavior.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8057], "author_name_tesi": "Izadi, Ghazal ", "last_name_ssi": "Izadi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ghazal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Derek Elsworth", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Li Li", "Chris Marone", "Yilin Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth, Dissertation Advisor", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Chair", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Member", "Li Li, Committee Member", "Chris Marone, Committee Member", "Yilin Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["permeability Evolution", "Induced Seismicity"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Essays on Auctions and Efficiency", "id": "5975", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5519", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Auctions are among the oldest economic institutions in place---they have been used since antiquity to sell a wide variety of goods, and their basic form has remained unchanged. In this dissertation, I explore the efficiency of common auctions when values are interdependent---the value to a particular bidder may depend on \ninformation available only to others---and asymmetric. In this setting, it is well known that sealed-bid auctions do not achieve efficient allocations in general since they do not allow the information held by different bidders to be shared. Open auctions, however, do allow such sharing of information and form the subject \nof this thesis.\n\nIn the first essay, I present a model of the English auction. Typically, in an English auction, say of the kind used to sell art, \nthe auctioneer sets a relatively low initial price. This price is then increased until only \none bidder is willing to buy the object, and the exact manner in which this is done varies. In my model a bidder who drops out at some price can ``reenter' at a higher price.  This feature is realistic, but previous analyses ruled out the \npossibility of reentry for analytical convenience. The main result is that the English auction with reentry has an efficient equilibrium \nunder weak conditions, a feature not shared by the standard model without reentry. The required conditions are the pairwise single-crossing property---known to be necessary for efficiency---and a new signal intensity condition. These conditions are much weaker than the conditions under which the standard English auction is efficient. Thus the modification is not only a more realistic model of the real-world auction but has superior theoretical properties. \n\nThe second essay, written jointly with my colleague, Oleksii Birulin, examines the \nquestion of when the standard English auction without reentry has an efficient equilibrium.  Maskin (1992) shows that the pairwise single-crossing condition is necessary and sufficient when there are only two bidders. It is known, however, that this condition is not sufficient once there are three or more bidders. We identify a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for efficiency with a general number of bidders. This new condition, called generalized single \ncrossing, is a multilateral version of pairwise single-crossing.\n\nIn the third essay, I examine some extensions to situations in which multiple identical objects are to be sold. I present an efficient multi-unit auction that consists of a number of sequential English auctions with reentry and show that this allocates efficiently under quite general circumstances. In each of the individual auctions \nall bidders compete simultaneously in the open ascending price format. The distinctive feature of the mechanism is that winners are determined first, and then additional auctions are conducted to determine prices.

Various raw materials have been used as carbon sources for ethanol production. In this study, waste potato mash was chosen as a carbon source; however, a pretreatment process is needed to convert starch of potato to fermentable carbon sources through liquefaction and saccharification processes. In order to obtain maximum fermentable sugar conversion, optimum parameters for the liquefaction and saccharification processes were determined by Box-Behnken Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The optimum combination of temperature, dose of enzyme (\u00e1-amylase), and amount of potato mash was determined as 95\u00b0C, 1 ml of \u00e1-amylase enzyme solution (944 Units/mg protein), and 4.04 g dry-weight potato mash /100 ml DI water, respectively with a 68.86% loss in dry weight during the liquefaction process.  For the saccharification process, dose of enzyme, temperature, and saccharification time were also determined by using Box-Behnken RSM. The optimal of amyloglucosidase combination was 60\u00b0C-72 h-0.8 ml (300 Unit/ml) with 34.9 g/L glucose production after scaling up to increase the glucose level to about 100 g/L. The effect of pH, inoculum size, and various nitrogen sources to obtain maximum ethanol from waste potato mash was studied in batch fermentation after. The maximum ethanol concentration and production rates were 27.7 g/L and 5.47 g/L/h, respectively, at controlled pH 5.5, whereas 22.75 g/L and 2.22 g/L/h were obtained at uncontrolled pH. Optimum inoculum size was determined to be 3% for maximum ethanol yield and production rate.  Furthermore, five different nitrogen sources (yeast extract, poultry meal, hull and fines mix, feather meal, and meat and bone meal) were evaluated to determine an economical alternative of nitrogen source than yeast extract.

In order to make ethanol production cost-competitive, inexpensive, and easily available feedstocks are needed as well as novel processing technologies with higher productivities. Industrial wastes are of great interest as a substrate in production of value-added products to reduce the cost, while managing the waste economically and environmentally. Therefore, bio-ethanol production from industrial wastes has gained attention because of its abundance, availability, and rich carbon and nitrogen content. Part of the production cost also includes cost of the enzymes needed for the saccharification step during the starch hydrolyzation, which can be a significant cost depending on the enzymes\u2019 performances. On the other hand, to achieve high productivity, medium optimization, culture conditions, integrated fermentation methods, and reactor design should be considered. Thus, novel approaches for bioethanol production from starchy industrial wastes have gained attention not only to reduce the production cost, but also to maximize the ethanol productivity. \n\nThis dissertation aimed to reduce the cost of ethanol production with utilization of starchy waste of potato industry, and evaluate the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process with a fungal co-culture to eliminate purchased enzyme costs, and, finally, to increase the productivity of ethanol fermentation, in particular by cell immobilization in biofilm reactors. Therefore, medium optimization for co-culture was considered to improve production of ethanol in this study, which was neglected for co-culture so far in the literature. Furthermore, first time simultaneous saccharification and fermentation by co-culture in biofilm reactors was employed to achieve the goal.\n\nGlucoamylase is one of the most common enzymes used in the starch industry to break down the starch into its monomers. Glucoamylase production and its activity are highly dependent on medium composition. Therefore, in this study, medium optimization for glucoamylase production was considered to improve the glucoamylase activity. Four fungi were screened for amylase production, and Aspergillus niger van Tieghem was found to be the best glucoamylase-producing fungus. Then, a statistical design, Plackett-Burman design, was used to screen various medium ingredients for glucoamylase production by A. niger, and malt extract, FeSO4\u00b77H2O, and CaCl2\uf09e2H2O were found to have significant effects on the glucoamylase production. Finally, malt extract, FeSO4\u00b77H2O, and CaCl2\uf09e2H2O were optimized by using another statistical design, response surface methodology. The results showed that the optimal medium composition for A. niger van Tieghem was 50 g/L of industrial waste potato mash  supplemented with 51.82 g/L of malt extract, 9.27 g/L of CaCl2\uf09e2H2O,  and 0.50 g/L of FeSO4 \uf09e7H2O . At the end of the optimization, glucoamylase activity and glucose production were improved 126 and 98% compared to only industrial waste potato mash basal medium and 274.4 U/ml glucoamylase activity and 41.7 g/L glucose levels were achieved, respectively. \nAdditionally, the effect of various medium components on ethanol production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae was evaluated. Yeast extract, malt extract, and MgSO4\u00b77H2O showed significantly positive effects among the screened medium components, whereas KH2PO4 and CaCl2\u00b72H2O had a significantly negative effect (p-value < 0.05). Using response surface methodology, a medium consisting of 40.4 g/L (dry basis) industrial waste potato, 50 g/L malt extract, and 4.84 g/L MgSO4\u00b77H2O was found optimal and yielded 24.6 g/L ethanol at 30 \u00b0C, 150 rpm, and 48 h of fermentation.\n\nLater, a fermentation medium for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) by co-culture of Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using potato wastes was developed. The medium consisted of waste potato mash, malt extract and FeSO4\uf09e7H2O were found to be a promising medium for co-culture of A. niger and S. cerevisiae SSF. Statistical optimization of the developed medium was conducted using central composite design. Optimization results suggested that optimum concentrations of industrial waste potato mash, malt extract, and FeSO4\uf09e7H2O  were 92.37 g/L, 59.42 g/L and 0.159 g/L, respectively. Under the optimal medium, 35.19 g/L ethanol production and 31.36 U/ml enzyme activity were equivalent to a yield of 0.38 g ethanol/g starch and 0.34 U/ g starch respectively, achieved at 30\u00b0C and 120 h of fermentation .\n\nBiofilm reactor was used as a novel approach for production of bioethanol from potato waste hydrolysate by optimizing the growth parameters for Saccharomyces cerevisiae in biofilm reactor. To start with, plastic composite supports (PCS) were evaluated in order to accomplish successful biofilm formation and the PCS composed of polypropylene, soybean hull, soybean flour, yeast extract, and salts was selected for ethanol fermentation with S. cerevisiae. Then, Box-Behnken design of response surface method (RSM) was employed to optimize the growth parameters, pH, temperature, and agitation. Optimum conditions for ethanol fermentation were found to be pH 4.2, temperature 34 \u00baC, and 100 rpm resulting 37.05 g/L ethanol with a 2.31 g/L/h productivity and 92.08% theoretical yield. The results indicated that biofilm reactors with PCS can enhance the ethanol fermentation from industrial potato wastes.\n\nFinally, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of ethanol by co-cultures of Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied in a potato waste based medium by using biofilm reactors. The plastic composite supports (PCS) were studied for biofilm formation. Effects of temperature, pH, and aeration rates in biofilm reactors were evaluated by response surface methodology and the optimal conditions were found to be 35 \u00baC, pH 5.8, and no aeration. The maximum ethanol concentration of 37.93 g/L was achieved at the end of 72h fermentation, with a 0.41 g ethanol /g starch yield. To finish, biofilm formation of co-culture on PCS was also evaluated by scanning electron microscope.\n\nIn conclusion, glucoamylase and ethanol productions were improved by medium optimization, with significant increases observed in glucoamylase and ethanol production. Similarly, the medium developed for SSF co-culture improved ethanol production. The biofilm reactors constructed with PCS enhanced ethanol production not only for a single culture of S. cerevisiae but also for the co-culture after growth optimization. These results indicated that PCS can be utilized for SSF processes for ethanol production in biofilm reactors with co-cultures by using starchy industrial wastes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13339], "author_name_tesi": "Izmirlioglu, Gulten ", "last_name_ssi": "Izmirlioglu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gulten", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali Demirci", "Ali Demirci", "Virendra Puri", "Thomas Lehman Richard", "Chitrita Debroy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali Demirci, Dissertation Advisor", "Ali Demirci, Committee Chair", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Thomas Lehman Richard, Committee Member", "Chitrita Debroy, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bio-ethanol", "Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation", "Co-culture", "Biofilm", "Industrial potato waste"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Adaptable Debility: Becoming Human Under Biocapitalism", "id": "14159mxi134", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14159", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project explores the performance of a mental debility at the hands of middle and upper-class individuals of recent Anglo and Hispanic biocapitalist contexts.

A prevailing modality for treating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is catheter ablation using radiofrequency radiation. However, measurable morbidity and significant costs and time are associated with this modality of treatment. To overcome these issues, a transesophageal ultrasound applicator for noninvasive cardiac ablation was designed, developed and evaluated.  Since the esophageal wall is less than 5 mm from the left atrium endocardium in a human subject, it is possible to aim at a selected area of the heart from this position.  Therefore, this goal can be achieved by bringing the applicator close to the heart in order to deliver the ultrasound energy to create isolated lesions in myocardial tissue.   \nFor this research, single element and two-dimensional random sparse phased arrays were designed and fabricated.  Various factors such as simulation results of the transducer and throat anatomy were considered while designing the transesophageal ultrasound transducer.  For the spherical single element probe, the element was encased in a 19 mm diameter probe head with an aperture of 20.86 x 10.26 mm2 and had an operating frequency of 1.69 MHz.  In this study, the two-dimensional random sparse phased array was also designed to have 48 (8 &#61620; 6) rectangular elements.  From this array, 30 active elements were randomly chosen through simulation to operate at the resonance frequency of 1.6 MHz.  For the verification of the designs, the prototype probe was tested in ex vivo experiments.  Experimental results indicated that the probe was capable of creating a lesion in a porcine heart within ten minutes of exposure duration without damaging the esophagus.  The probe was further tested in in vivo experiments on 280 lbs pigs.  It was concluded from the histology results that the transducer was able to function adequately without inflicting any heat damage to the esophagus.  The transducer delivered sufficient power at the focal region, though the focal length was not sufficient to create a lesion on the heart.  It was also concluded that a better animal model is needed to demonstrate the anticipated results.  Since there was no heat damage found on the esophagus where the probe was placed, it was concluded that the designed transesophageal probe had a potential application in atrial fibrillation treatment.  \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1581], "author_name_tesi": "JAISWAL, DEVINA ", "last_name_ssi": "JAISWAL", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "DEVINA", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Nadine B Smith", "Dr Nadine Barrie Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Nadine B Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Nadine Barrie Smith, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["single element", "atrial fibrillation", "phased array", "Transesophageal ultrasound transducer", "in vivo", "histology", "cardiac lesion", "ex vivo"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CHANGES IN MATH ACHIEVMENT GAPS UNDER THE ERA OF NCLB:BETWEEN DIFFERENT IMMIGRANT STUDENT GROUPS AND NATIVE-BORNWHITEAMERICANS\n\n", "id": "11585", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5828", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous comparisons of the gaps in educational achievement between various minority groups (non-White, non-English-speaking, low income) and their counterparts (White, English-speaking, middle income) have tended to disregard the immigrant status of the minority students. In this study, I investigated these gaps within and between immigrant student groups in terms of generation status i.e. whether the students were first, second, or third generation immigrants. As the number of immigrant students in U.S. schools continues to increase, it is necessary to pay more attention to such gaps. Furthermore, immigrant students often fall into at least one minority category as a result of race, socioeconomic status, or lack of English proficiency. Their academic attainment should, therefore, be examined in combination with these factors. \n     The research goal of this study is to examine whether gaps in educational achievement among different groups of immigrant students have changed since the implementation of the NCLB Act. Based on the key premise that the act would raise all students\u2019 academic achievement and narrow any achievement gaps, I developed the following hypothesis: if the NCLB Act has been effective, it would by now have helped close the gaps in educational achievement among different generations of immigrant students and different races. To investigate this hypothesis, I posed the following research questions. 1) Are there gaps in the educational achievement of immigrant students from different racial groups compared with their native-born, White counterparts? 2) Are there gaps in educational achievement among different generations of immigrant students within the same racial group? 3) If such gaps exist, were these closed over time from 2003 to 2007?\n     I used TIMSS 2003 and 2007 data to examine math achievement gaps among students of different immigrant generation groups. In addition, I investigate racial effect of immigrant students on their math achievement. Two-level Hierarchical Linear Modeling was used to analyze the effect nested within schools. The main findings of my study are as follows. Firstly, immigrants are generally likely to underperform compared to their native-born white counterparts. Secondly, achievement gaps among different immigrant generation groups of a same race are likely to be diverse. Thirdly, the pattern of the academic disparities between black or Hispanic immigrants and their native-born white counterparts tend to remain fairly stable over time.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5825], "author_name_tesi": "JEON, SUE BIN  ", "last_name_ssi": "JEON", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "SUE BIN ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger C Shouse", "Roger C Shouse", "Suet Ling Pong", "Susan C Fiarcloth", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger C Shouse, Dissertation Advisor", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Chair", "Suet Ling Pong, Committee Member", "Susan C Fiarcloth, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["immigrant generation", "race and education", "achievement gaps", "immigrant education", "hierarchical linear modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Algorithms for classification and prediction of protein structure and function", "id": "8094", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2951", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The subject of this thesis is predicting the function of a protein.\n\nMany aspects of protein function are determined by its shape, or the structure.\nThis thesis discusses methods for converting sets of local predictions\nconcerning the structure of a protein chain to an overall prediction of the\nstructure.\n\nOne approach was to define a similarity function for chains\nof ``local predictions' and to use this function to rank the\nprepositions that the input protein belongs to a particular fold from the most\nlikely to the least likely.

The chemistry involves a designed boron containing precursor, i.e. poly(diethynylphenylborane chloride) containing in situ formed inorganic salts that serve as the templates for forming the porous morphology. The MAS solid state 11B NMR were conducted to reveal the boron content and electron delocalization in the fused hexagonal ring structures. Morphologies including pore size and distribution were examined by high resolution TEM, FE-SEM, XRD, and surface area and pore size distribution were examined by nitrogen and carbon dioxide sorption method. One BC12 with 780 m2/g of surface area showed an extended fused hexagonal ring structure with boron puckered curvature. This off-planar boron moiety maintains its high acidity (electron deficiency), due to limited &#960; electron delocalization, and serves as an internal p-type dopant for activating BCx surfaces that exhibit super-activated interactive properties. Such activation can enhance both hydrogen binding energy (up to 13 kJ/mole) and adsorption capacity. Additionally, the nanoporous BCx played a unique role in metal particles dispersion in the BCx support. The disposed metal compounds are stabilized by the substitutional boron moiety of BCx support and therefore maintained highly monodisperse and small particles without additional surface stabilizers. This stabilization is due to the interaction between the d orbital of transition metal atom and the p orbital of boron atom on the BCx surface, which enable a 0.7 wt.% Pt/BC12 to show the catalytic activity in the hydrogen physisorption system even with extremely low levels of metal content.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6764], "author_name_tesi": "JEONG, YOUMI ", "last_name_ssi": "JEONG", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "YOUMI", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["T C Mike Chung", "T C Mike Chung", "Paul C Painter", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Harold Harris Schobert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["T C Mike Chung, Dissertation Advisor", "T C Mike Chung, Committee Chair", "Paul C Painter, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogen storage", "boron substitution"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Instrumentality, Reactivity and Psychopathy in Sexual Offenses against Children: An Exploratory Analysis\n", "id": "7672", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "578", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Even though past investigations have examined psychopathy in various types of sex offenders and examined some of the motivational components of sexual offenses, there remained a gap in the literature in measuring and understanding complex motives of child molestation.

However, conventional farmers need to know the consequences of their management practices on the likelihood of successful conversion to organic production.  Here, we explored management effects on epigeal and soil-dwelling arthropods and entomopathogens in feed-grain rotations during the transition to organic agriculture in central Pennsylvania.  \n\tWe examined the interaction between soil disturbance (full vs. reduce tillage) and initial cover crop management (timothy/clover vs. rye/vetch) on naturally occurring entomopathogenic fungi and epigeal arthropods during the three-year transition to organic production in a feed grain rotation in central Pennsylvania.  Detection of Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschn.) Sorokin was variable between sampling dates and years.  We detected M. anisopliae more frequently in the systems initiated with timothy/clover cover crops and utilizing full tillage; however, we only observed a tillage effect in the first temporal replicate.  M. anisopliae detection was negatively associated with soil moisture and Zn, S, and Cu concentrations in the soil.  Epigeal arthropod community composition was defined by initial cover crop in the first year in the transition sequence, by the interaction between cover crop and tillage intensity in the second year, and by tillage intensity in the final year.  \n\tSpatial habitat complexity may conserve beneficial organisms in the soil.  We compared the effect of simple (maize) and complex (maize plus mixed annual plant refuge) habitats on the dispersal of the entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) (Sc).  We showed that complex habitats can enhance dispersal, conditional on complex habitats conserving soil moisture in comparison to simple habitats.  The maximum movement rate was 33.3 cm/day, which exceeds previously reported rates of 7.5 cm/day.  We sampled soil microarthropod communities in simple and complex habitats in response to nematode application.  Soil surrounding Sc-killed and freezer-killed insects contained more dipteran larvae, acarid mites, staphylinid beetle larvae, onychiurid and entomobryid collembolans, and immature and male mesostigmatid mites than soil at sham burial and no disturbance sites.  Microarthropod communities were similar between simple and complex habitats.  \n\tTillage intensity, cover cropping, and increased habitat complexity do have implications for the occurrence and activity of natural enemies during the transition to organic.

The work applies current microeconomic and econometric methods to structure practical management questions within a formal analytic framework.  The results provide insight into the complexities of modern day management decision making, and provide guidance to corporate and government policy makers.  The first chapter examines the decision of upstream oil companies to vertically integrate into the drilling function within the framework of transaction cost economics.  Econometric models are employed to model organizational choice and to estimate the underlying organizational cost functions.  Estimation of the underlying cost functions permits isolation of the effects of transaction attributes to each form of organization, shedding light on the relative impact of internal costs versus market hazards on organizational choice.  The second chapter investigates health, safety, and environmental performance (HS&E) in offshore drilling.  Models of incidence employ standard qualitative response models with binary and ordered dependent variable specifications, and a Poisson specification.  Unlike previous studies, additional models are estimated by specifying a reporting function and employing detection control to account for the possibility of incomplete reporting.  The third chapter examines the decision made by oil companies to evacuate offshore drilling rigs in the event of a hurricane.  The primary goals are to value existing forecast accuracy, to estimate the cost of false evacuations for the industry, to develop a behavioral model of the decision to evacuate, and to introduce the role of risk preferences in the decision to evacuate.  The problem is examined from three unique perspectives.  The first approach develops a prescriptive, decision analytic model.  A second approach begins with a descriptive examination of actual drilling rig evacuation decisions for a sample of fifteen hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.  A discrete choice model of the evacuation decision is then specified and estimated, identifying variables that influence the propensity to evacuate.  The third approach examines the role of risk preferences in the decision to evacuate via specification of a utility function and a structural econometric model of the propensity to evacuate.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [997], "author_name_tesi": "Jablonowski, Christopher J.", "last_name_ssi": "Jablonowski", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mineral Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Gordon", "Turgay Ertekin", "Timothy Considine", "Andrew Nathan Kleit"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Gordon, Committee Member", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Timothy Considine, Committee Member", "Andrew Nathan Kleit, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["value of information", "detection controlled estimation", "industrial organization"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Let the Corporation Say Amen?: Role Definition and Negotiation of Chaplains in Corporate America\n\n", "id": "8388", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "227", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study sought to define the role of chaplains in the workplace and explore the process through which they have been integrated into corporate life.

Thus, individuals under threat may be motivated to increasingly value the knowledge of information that can be used to avoid being judged as discriminatory \u2013 information regarding racist intent.  Further, research on anxiety and memory has argued that anxiety about a negative outcome can draw ones attention to that which can help you avoid that negative outcome (Higgins, 1997; Seibt & F\u00f6rster, 2004).  Therefore, the attention of individuals under threat may be drawn to racist intent, as evidenced by more accurate memory of intent-related stimuli.\n  \nTwo studies tested the hypothesis that the threat of being seen as racist may lead to both the increased value of racist intent, as measured by self reports, and an increased attention to racist intent, as measured by a memory task.

In addition, data indicates that, as the importance of intent increases, the importance of racial harms is diminished.

MKs represent less than one percentage of total bone marrow cells under normal conditions, but can increase several fold under stress. We had noted an increase in the number of MKs  in the femurs of athymic mice with bone metastatic cancer four weeks following intracardiac inoculation of MDA-MB-231 human metastatic breast cancer cells. The increase in MKs was three to six fold higher than found in femurs of non-cancer bearing mice. In autopsy samples of bone from human metastatic breast cancer patients, we also saw an increase in MKs when age and gender matched patients without cancer were compared. Moreover, it has been reported that the largest cause of death among cancer patients is thromboembolism due to platelet aggregation. Thus, evidence suggested a relationship between MKs and metastatic cancer in the bone. \nMKs display an intimate relationship with many bone marrow cells especially osteoblasts (OB) and osteoclasts (OC). MKs differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that develop adjacent to OBs in the bone compartment known as the endosteal niche. The OBs serve as source for thrombopoietin (TPO), which is necessary for megakaryopoiesis. Once the MKs are mature, stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) guides them from the endosteal to the vascular niche to release platelets into the sinusoids. MKs also play a role in bone metabolism by inhibiting OC production and promoting OB proliferation. The interaction of metastatic breast cancer cells with OBs and OCs is key to the expansion of metastatic breast cancer cells in the bone and to bone degradation described in a series of events named the \u2018vicious cycle\u2019. Due to the lack of reports on MKs and bone metastasis, we asked if MKs played a role in the vicious cycle as well. \nThis information taken together led us to propose that MKs are important contributors to the colonization of bone with metastatic breast cancer cells. We hypothesized that either the megakaryocytes precede the cancer cells and prepare a niche for them in the bone marrow, or that the metastatic cells in the bone marrow lead to an increase in cytokines in the microenvironment that bring about an increase in MKs. These two outcomes are not mutually exclusive. \n\tThe objectives of this study were to determine if the increase in MKs precedes the growth of cancer cells in the bone; and determine the role that cancer cell-bone marrow cell interactions play in the up-regulation in production of MKs. Because MKs express von Willebrand factor (VWF), a primary antibody to VWF  and an indirect immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocol were used to visualize the MKs. MK numbers in the femurs of athymic mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231-luc cells intracardiacally (metastastic model) were compared at several times following inoculation of the cancer cell. In addition mice with metastatic tumors were compared to those with the same cancer cells inoculated orthotopically (only primary tumor growth) to determine if the primary tumor systemically affected MKs in the absence of metastasis.  Serum levels of TPO and SDF-1 and complete white blood counts were determined. There was a significant increase in MKs in the femurs of mice with metastatic disease, but not those with primary tumor growth only. The increase in MKs was not significant until about 30 to 40 days post cancer cell inoculation. No increase in platelet count, SDF-1, or TPO concentrations were detected at any time. The major conclusion was that the cancer cells preceded the increase of MKs in the bone marrow, and that primary tumor growth did not affect MK numbers. \n\tWe next asked if this observation of increased megakaryopoiesis occurred in an immunocompetent mouse model. Immunocompetent BALB/c mice were injected in the mammary gland with mouse mammary carcinoma 4T1.2 (bone metastatic) or 67 NR (non-metastatic) cancer cells. There was no increase in MK numbers in the femurs of either group; however, a significant increase in number of MKs was seen in the spleens of the 4T1.2 injected mice indicative of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Again the data suggested that the cancer cells metastasized prior to the increase in MKs. \nFor the third aim, we wanted to determine if metastasis decreased in mice with decreased numbers of MKs. We hypothesized that if MKs helped the tumor cells to colonize the bone, then bone metastases would be minimal. TPO KO mice had about a 90% reduction in MKs and platelets. Residual MKs were likely due to other cytokines involved in megakaryopoiesis. We inoculated TPO knock-out (KO) mice with 4T1.2 cancer cells. Contrary to our hypothesis, the TPO KO mice developed metastasis more quickly and at a higher rate than the wild-type and heterozygous geneotypes.\nIn conclusion, it is likely that MKs are affected by an increase in cytokines and growth factors necessary for megakaryopoiesis. Those cytokines include: TPO, Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-3 (IL-3), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-11 (IL-11), Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and Stem cell factor (SCF). Many of these have been reported to increase in the bone microenvironment in the presence of cancer cells. The combination of IL-6, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and TPO are enough to manipulate an increase in MK numbers. We did not observe an increase in MKs in the TPO KO mice when injected with the 4T1.2, which suggests that TPO Is a major factor in megakaryopoiesis. Overall it appears that the presence of metastatic cancer cells in the bone marrow provokes megakaryopoiesis. The increase in MKs does not prevent metatastic colonization but a deficiency in MKs correlates with more aggressive metastatic colonization.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11090], "author_name_tesi": "Jackson, Walter ", "last_name_ssi": "Jackson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Walter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrea Marie Mastro", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Mary J Kennett", "Robert Paulson", "Henry Joseph Donahue", "Melissa Rolls"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrea Marie Mastro, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Mary J Kennett, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Henry Joseph Donahue, Special Member", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Breast Cancer", "Megakaryocytes", "Bone metastasis", "Thrombopoietin", "Stromal derived factor-1", "Platelets", "Extramedullary Hematopoiesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SCENARIOS: THE INFLUENCE OF EXPERIENCE, INFORMATION OBTAINED, PERSONAL BIAS, AND EMOTIONAL CONTAGION\n", "id": "11400", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1009", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study builds on previous research examining the factors that influence clinician decision-making, specifically in response to domestic violence issues.

To do this we used a Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene episomal reporter system for microsatellite mutations.  In E. coli we found that loss of dinB did not have an effect on microsatellite mutagenesis, but did cause a 4-fold reduction in the mutation rate within the coding region of the HSV-tk gene.  Using an in vitro assay, we determined the mutational specificity of Pol &#946; on mononucleotide G/C tracts.  We found that Pol &#946; makes greater than 80% of mutational events at the mononucleotide allele on both templates, which is in stark contrast to dinucleotide repeats.  In human cells, we were unsuccessful at creating a knockdown of Pol &#946; levels, however we did determine that there is an effect of lentiviral infection and selection on mutagenesis.  In lentiviral infected and selected cells we observed a 3-fold reduction in overall mutation rate which was statistically significant.  We also saw a shift in mutational specificity, from a bias toward coding region mutations in uninfected cells, toward mutations at the microsatellite repeat in those that were infected and selected.

There is general agreement in the field that the bilingual lexicon is nonselective in nature, meaning that a bilingual individual is incapable of \u201cturning off\u201d his/her other language currently not in use within any given language context; therefore, the lexical counterpart that is not in use at any moment remains active in the mind of the bilingual.\n\nResearch focusing on the acquisition of L2 phonology, on the other hand, has provided a great deal of evidence toward the notion of sound similarity being a detriment to ultimate attainment of authentic L2 phonetic production. In other words, if there is a phonemic counterpart between a learner\u2019s two languages, the phonemic boundaries, or the categorical phonetic properties of a particular sound will be governed more strongly by the L1 phonetic category established for that sound. Therefore, for cross-language sounds bearing close phonetic similarity, the learner will experience greater difficulty in producing them in a perfectly accurate manner, or as a native speaker of that language would produce them. \n\nIn light of the findings in these traditionally distinct fields of research, the present study seeks to bring them together by means of examining cognates, one class of lexical items bearing a high degree of cross-language similarity. Generally defined, cognates are words that bear a high degree of cross-language similarity on the semantic, orthographic and phonological dimensions. Since past psycholinguistic research, using reaction time (RT) as its principal indicator of cross-language activation, has shown that bilingual word recognition is a function of the degree to which words are similar across languages and past research on the acquisition of L2 phonology has shown that cross-language sound similarity is a detriment to ultimate accurate attainment of the L2 sound system, the present study exploits the presence of cognates in English and Spanish to examine the relation between these phenomena. The specific aim of the study is to examine how L2 learners at different stages of acquisition process cognates. The goal is to determine whether speech planning stage and phonetic realization, or speech execution, are related and whether the context of L2 learning and the level of L2 proficiency modulates this relationship. To address these issues, the present study examines RT, a traditional psycholinguistic measure of lexical processing and performance, voice onset time (VOT), a traditional measure of phonetic performance at the segmental level of production, and overall word duration from onset to offset of articulation. In addition to considering the role of level of proficiency in determining how English learners of Spanish speak Spanish words, the study also examines the learning context (language immersion versus non immersion). \n\nA major result of the study is that learners who are, by other assessments, of equal L2 proficiency perform dramatically differently in a simple task from learners who are immersed. All groups exhibit cognate facilitation in the naming task in reaction time, but the learner group differs from the other groups in both production measures: Only the learner group shows a significant cognate effect on VOT and only the learner group shows a significant cognate effect on word duration. The immersion context facilitates the inhibition of L1 phonology (as seen by the lack of a cognate effect in production). In this sense, the immersion group patterns with advanced speakers, rather than with their proficiency equivalent counterparts. Finally, the learner group VOT and duration data support the hypothesis that cognitive processes underlying utterance planning may extend into production when planning is resource limited. L2 learners thus provide a rich testing ground for issues pertaining to modularity in language processing.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [223], "author_name_tesi": "Jacobs, April Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Jacobs", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "April", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith Fran Kroll", "Henry J Gerfen", "John Lipski", "Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Barbara E Bullock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith Fran Kroll, Committee Chair", "Henry J Gerfen, Committee Chair", "John Lipski, Committee Member", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Committee Member", "Barbara E Bullock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spanish", "bilingualism", "psycholinguistics", "Language acquisition", "Spanish phonetics", "Spanish phonology", "lexical processing"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Governing Romance in Seventeenth-Century England\n", "id": "10296", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "4613", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Governing Romance in Seventeenth-Century England provides a genealogy of a seventeenth-century English literary form, tracing the relationship between the evolution of romance and the contingencies of contemporary politics.

Prior research examining the effectiveness of suspension in correcting or deterring delinquent behavior finds it associated with increased delinquency and criminal justice involvement, rather than improved behavior. Much of this work relies on labeling theory to explain these effects. Labeling theory suggests an official sanction such as suspension may increase rather than decrease subsequent delinquency if it leads to social exclusion, label internalization, and greater involvement with delinquent peers. These mechanisms are central to labeling theory, but with few exceptions, have rarely been measured in prior research. In this dissertation, I test labeling theory in a sample of sixth to ninth grade students and their same-grade peers. I use a longitudinal peer network approach to measure the mechanisms implied in labeling theory. Results suggest suspension is associated with a loss of friends in school. It is also associated with greater involvement with peers who use substances. Withdrawal from conforming peers and changes in attitudes toward substance use partially explain this association. Finally, I find that students who get suspended are at increased risk of using substances but are at no greater risk of engaging in other delinquent behaviors. Increased involvement with substance-using peers following suspension partially explains this association. Given that racial minority and other disadvantaged youth are more likely to experience suspension, my findings suggest that school policies relying heavily on this form of punishment may be fostering inequality and the perpetuation of adolescent substance use.

In addition to challenging the adequacy of certain canonical as well as many \u00ebcommonsense\u00ed conceptions of the nature of space and the perception of space, I provide original analyses and extensions of the phenomenological studies of space offered by both Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty. Furthermore, I present an original contribution to the conception of human spatial perception by arguing that our spatial experience is phenomenologically related to our experience of home. Specifically, like the experience of home, being spatial involves two complementary and inseparable aspects:  It involves both the ability to stay safely within what is our own and also the need to venture out into what is other.  These are not isolated moments; they are essential features of the same experience--the experience of our articulation into a world, or, said more basically, the very experience of human spatiality.  I support this claim in part through an innovative analysis of agoraphobia\u00f3a common, but frequently inadequately \ntreated spatial 'disorder'.  My analysis of agoraphobia allows me not only to offer new insights into the nature of a problematic spatial experience, but also to illuminate ways in which the experience of being at home is incomplete without the accompanying experience of being able and willing to leave the home.  Ultimately, I draw together my phenomenological studies of space, agoraphobia, and the home to argue that being-at- \nhome is the fundamental experience of space.  I maintain that at the core of this character of our spatiality is the existential structure of our being as always both self and other, always both here and there.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3380], "author_name_tesi": "Jacobson, Kirsten Elisabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Jacobson", "middle_name_ssi": "Elisabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Kirsten", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Russon", "John Philip Christman", "Veronique Marion Foti", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Alan M Sica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Russon, Committee Chair", "John Philip Christman, Committee Chair", "Veronique Marion Foti, Committee Member", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Committee Member", "Alan M Sica, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Merleau-Ponty", "Heidegger", "spatiality", "space", "phenomenology", "agoraphobia"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Anxious Moods as a Risk Factor for Depressed Moods: \nan Ecological Momentary Assessment of Those with Clinical Anxiety and Depression", "id": "26189", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11587", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Anxious and depressed moods are highly concurrently related.

Participants (N = 159) completed momentary measures of anxious and depressed moods, arousal, heart rate, and fatigue every hour while they were awake for seven days. The results were analyzed using differential time-varying effect models and state space models to investigate when constructs were associated with one another.

Further, low perceived arousal and high fatigue jointly mediated the relationship between anxious and later depressed moods for all groups. High heart rate mediated the relationship between anxious and depressed moods for those with both pure clinical anxiety and pure clinical depression. For those with pure clinical depression, high heart rate variability and high fatigue mediated a positive relationship between anxious and later depressed moods, and, for those with pure clinical anxiety, low heart rate variability and low fatigue mediated a negative relationship between anxious and depressed moods.

There is potential for tackling complexity of these projects by leveraging a successful technology and process that is being widely adopted in other sectors of construction industry, and that is Building Information Modeling (BIM). Structural analytical modeling is one of the areas that can benefit from BIM to enhance the design quality; reduce time and cost of the design; and mitigate the complex design activities. Because of lack of interoperability between tools, BIM users cannot take advantage of this BIM use properly, especially in modular building projects that their special needs are not addressed in the currently available information exchange standards. \n\nThe primary goal of the proposed research is to develop an information framework and its supporting infrastructure to encourage design and construction of mid- and high-rise buildings using factory-built modular units. Achieving this would provide the industry with an option for economical, energy efficient, sustainable, and more affordable construction. In this research, product-related information that may be generated or used at different stages of projects is studied. In addition, process-related information flow throughout project phases is investigated. Moreover, interpretation of structural design/analysis model of these buildings from their architectural building information model is researched.\n\nThis research has been carried out through accomplishing several objectives. First the Product Architecture Model (PAM) for multi-story modular buildings was developed. The PAM is a structured breakdown of building elements and their related attributes and properties. The next objective was information exchange standardization in these projects focusing mainly on structural aspects. To achieve this, an Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and Model View Definitions (MVDs) were developed based on the characteristic and workflow of modular building projects. To achieve the first two objectives, a comprehensive literature review was carried out, and a series of site visits and interviews with industry experts were conducted. The final objective was to facilitate the structural design of complicated structures of modular buildings by developing a mechanism and a supporting platform to interpret structural design/analysis model of modular buildings directly from the architectural BIM.\n\nAlthough the developed PAM, IDM and MVD are focused on structural and general architectural aspects of modular buildings, they could be expanded and/or modified to supports other BIM application areas in these projects. The methodology proposed in this research for development of information exchange standards could be used for representation of current information exchange standards to come up with an integrated set of standards for building industry. This would be achieved as a result of using the same PAM for development of the information exchange standards. In addition, the interpretation methodology presented for generation of modular buildings could be implemented in other engineering design/analysis areas in both modular and site-built construction. Implementation of the Interpreted Information Exchange (IIE) concept can significantly facilitate engineering analysis BIM uses by decreasing implementation cost of MVDs in BIM authoring tools and automating the model modifications that are required to make an imported model ready for analysis. Moreover, the platform developed for testing the structural model interpretation process is a general purpose platform, which could be utilized for all-purpose BIM information extractions and implementation of different automated interpreted information exchanges.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11685], "author_name_tesi": "Jafar Ramaji, Issa ", "last_name_ssi": "Jafar Ramaji", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Issa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali M Memari", "Ali M Memari", "John Messner", "M Kevin Parfitt", "Robert Michael Leicht", "Dinghao Wu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali M Memari, Dissertation Advisor", "Ali M Memari, Committee Chair", "John Messner, Committee Member", "M Kevin Parfitt, Committee Member", "Robert Michael Leicht, Committee Member", "Dinghao Wu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Building Information Modeling", "Modular Building", "Information Exchange", "Process Map", "Prefabrication", "IDM", "MVD", "IFC", "BIM"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "DYNAMIC LEAP AND BALANCE TEST (DLBT): ABILITY TO DISCRIMINATE BALANCE DEFICITS IN INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC ANKLE INSTABILITY", "id": "hx11xf24j", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12974", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Clinicians commonly explore functional testing methods that can help them identify individuals with conditions of interest and measure the progress of rehabilitation programs. The Modified Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT) is a measure of dynamic balance commonly used in the assessment of lower extremity injuries. It has previously been used to identify dynamic balance deficits in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI). The mSEBT measures the dynamic control of body movements over an unchanging base of support (BOS). Most running sports require serial changes in BOS alternating from limb to limb requiring reestablishment of dynamic stability with each change. We created a new dynamic balance test, the Dynamic Leap and Balance Test (DLBT) that requires changes in BOS and recovery of dynamic stability. It is purported to more closely mimic the balance requirements of running sports which can provide clinicians with a more robust measure of dynamic balance for identifying injured populations and physical rehabilitative progression. The secondary purpose of this study was to compare dynamic balance performance between the DLBT and the mSEBT in participants with unilateral CAI. It was hypothesized that the DLBT will show significant differences between the involved and uninvolved limbs between either of the two CAI and control groups. Thirty-six college-aged students were recruited and divided in two groups. Eighteen participants with a unilateral history of CAI were designated as the injured group and eighteen participants without a history of CAI were designated as healthy controls. CAI subjects were identified using the Identification of Functional Ankle Instability (IdFAI) questionnaire. In this case-control study participants were randomly assigned to complete the mSEBT or DLBT on either their CAI (or healthy matched) or uninvolved limb on Day 1 and the same tasks on Day 2 with the other limb. There were no statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) seen between any of the four conditions for composite or individual reach (anterior, posteromedial, posterolateral) distance measures (% leg lengths) of the mSEBT. Statistically significant differences (P<0.001) in DLBT time were found between limbs. The DLBT time (seconds) for the CAI involved limb (51.85 \u00b1 4.04, 95% CI = 51.18, 53.52) was significantly greater than for the CAI uninvolved limb (44.12 \u00b1 3.60, 95 % CI = 42.52, 45.78) and the control matched limb (41.88 \u00b1 3.36, 95% CI = 40.21, 43.55). There were no significant differences in the DLBT time between the limbs in the control participants. These results suggest that the DLBT may be a more robust measure for detecting dynamic balance deficits as compared to the mSEBT in individuals with unilateral CAI. The DLBT is more challenging than the mSEBT as participants have to change the BOS and reestablish dynamic balance. Moreover, the leaping task involved in the DLBT appears to require greater production and attenuation of acceleration and deceleration forces and is more functionally similar to walking, running, cutting and jumping activities. The DLBT is a cost-effective tool that can be used to assess dynamic balance that may be more robust in identifying individuals with CAI than previously proposed measures of dynamic balance such as the modified SEBT.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12374], "author_name_tesi": "Jaffri, Abbis Haider", "last_name_ssi": "Jaffri", "middle_name_ssi": "Haider", "first_name_ssi": "Abbis", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sayers John Miller III", "Giampietro Luciano Vairo", "William E Buckley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sayers John Miller III, Thesis Advisor", "Giampietro Luciano Vairo, Committee Member", "William E Buckley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Balance", "Chronic Ankle Instability", "SEBT", "Postural Control", "lower extremity"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Structure-Function Studies on Iron-Sulfur Cluster Proteins in Photosynthetic Reaction Centers\n", "id": "10092", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "805", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The work described in this thesis explores evolutionary aspects of photosynthesis from the perspective of the acceptor side of Type I photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs). The interactions between the membrane-intrinsic core proteins and the membrane-extrinsic iron-sulfur cluster subunit in homodimeric and heterodimeric Type I RCs were studied using biochemical and biophysical techniques. It was found that the PscB subunit in the homodimeric green sulfur bacterial RC is loosely bound, similar to the previously characterized PshB subunit from the heliobacterial RC. This is in contrast to the PsaC subunit in Photosystem I, which is tightly bound to the heterodimeric PsaA/PsaB core via an extensive network of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. To better understand the design of the binding interface, variants of PsaC were generated, each lacking a key binding contact with the PsaA/PsaB heterodimer. The variant PsaC proteins were found to bind to the Photosystem I core in non-native orientations, which do not provide the level of shielding at the PsaC-PsaA/PsaB binding interface required to protect the terminal [4Fe-4S] clusters from damage by dioxygen. It is interesting that a homodimeric Type I RC containing a loosely-bound iron-sulfur cluster subunit is employed by strictly anoxygenic phototrophs, whereas a heterodimeric Photosystem I containing a tightly-bound iron-sulfur cluster subunit participates in oxygenic photosynthesis. The oxygen sensitivity of the [4Fe-4S] clusters in PshB and PscB is largely moot, given that heliobacteria and green sulfur bacteria exist in an anaerobic environment. However, at the onset of oxygenic photosynthesis, it became necessary to devise a mechanism to protect the [4Fe-4S] clusters in PsaC. We propose that nature responded to the onset of oxygenic photosynthesis by tightening the binding interface between the membrane intrinsic RC core proteins and the membrane extrinsic iron-sulfur cluster subunit to better protect the terminal [4Fe-4S] clusters from photosynthetically generated dioxygen. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [798], "author_name_tesi": "Jagannathan, Bharadwaj ", "last_name_ssi": "Jagannathan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bharadwaj", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John H Golbeck", "John H Golbeck", "Donald Ashley Bryant", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Carsten Krebs", "Patrick Cirino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John H Golbeck, Dissertation Advisor", "John H Golbeck, Committee Chair", "Donald Ashley Bryant, Committee Member", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Member", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "Patrick Cirino, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PsaC", "Photosystem I", "iron-sulfur clusters", "photosynthesis", "reaction centers"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Distributed Control of a Smart Grid Network Using IEC 61499", "id": "25858", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10767", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Smart grid automation, in its preliminary and evolving state is achieved through centralized control, where a central control system monitors the entire grid automation and communications. These systems are more commonly known as SCADA systems which are essentially centralized in nature. SCADA systems are implemented using large software programs that are custom developed based on the application and are difficult to reuse for other applications. Modern control systems require flexibility for the purpose of advanced automation. To achieve this high level of flexibility in these systems a new software technology is required that is based on the interaction of distributed objects and that aims at decentralizing control.\nThe IEC 61499 is a novel method of software development that enables modeling control applications in a distributed manner. The standard presents guidelines for automation protocol in various applications ranging from industrial to smart grid. The IEC 61499 standard defines a distributed model for splitting different parts of an automation process and complex control into functional modules called function blocks (FB). These function blocks can be distributed and controlled across multiple controllers. The function block is a software unit that encapsulates some behavior and is hardware independent. The advantage of using function blocks is that it provides a method of graphical design of the system and also an easy way of distribution of functions in automation processes. Use of FBs makes the device control open and can be reconfigured more easily. End-users can modify the firmware of their devices based on changing technology and still able to use the same software to program the FBs. This enables the devices to adapt to changes in the grid.\nThe objective of this research is to highlight and demonstrate the benefits of microgrid generation through an innovative economic dispatch application implemented in IEC 61499. The contribution of this research is the use of function block concept to implement an economic dispatch application considering Levelized Cost of Energy, the availability of Distributed Generators and the load forecast to balance loads. The Levelized Cost of Energy has been calculated based on studies conducted by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Previous work in this field has been to perform load balancing using Function Blocks with a focus only on the availability, not the economic aspect. The economic modeling of renewable energy systems is implemented in the economic dispatch application in combination with a load forecasting model for each load. A saving in cost of energy production is expected to be achieved through the implementation of different test behaviors. Hence the effectiveness of each behavior is depicted by comparing the power supplied by the utility under the different applications and by comparing the cost of energy production of each of the generating sources for a single day. This cost value can help policy makers in deciding laws for interoperation of different utilities.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10387], "author_name_tesi": "Jagannathan, Srikrishnan ", "last_name_ssi": "Jagannathan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Srikrishnan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Idowu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Idowu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Smart Grid", "Economic Dispatch", "IEC 61499", "Power System Automation"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "An Empirical Analysis of Insider Trade within Rule 10b5-1", "id": "6418", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "70", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis examines the association between insider trade behavior and participation within Rule 10b5-1 trade plans to provide evidence about how insiders respond to regulation that reduces litigation risk and how the Rule affects insiders\u2019 informed trade profits.

Evidence suggests the safe harbor allows insiders a better opportunity to profit from trade, which is not consistent with the traditional concept of regulatory intent.  Specifically, evidence suggests participation is associated with: (1) insiders with greater personal litigation risk who likely have access to and control over disclosure of material nonpublic information; (2)   a large volume increase not fully explained by proxies for insiders\u2019 diversification needs; (3) an increase in abnormal trade profits; and (4) more sales volume immediately before disclosure of negative management earnings forecasts than immediately after disclosure.  \nThis thesis also examines firms\u2019 voluntary decision to disclose insiders\u2019 participation within Rule 10b5-1 to provide evidence of the costs and benefits associated with this disclosure choice.  Evidence suggests firms disclose this information to reduce litigation costs and to reduce stock price volatility related to disclosure of insider trade activity.  Specifically, disclosure is positively associated with firm size, a proxy for a firm\u2019s litigation risk, and with a measure of the firm\u2019s price sensitivity to disclosure of insiders\u2019 trades.  Evidence also suggests that insiders prefer that disclosure not occur, perhaps because disclosure reduces potential trade profits.

With the development of epitaxial growth techniques, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and the discovery that the band-gap energy of InN is smaller (~0.7 eV) than the previously established value (~1.9 eV), there has been renewed interest in growth and development of InN thin films for potential applications in solar cells and light emitting diodes. \nThe majority of InN growth studies thus far have utilized MBE, due to its abilities to produce active nitrogen species via plasma-enhanced methods, which is essential for low temperature (~500 \u00b0C) growth, and to precisely control In/N ratio.  These studies provided valuable information on the electrical and optical properties of InN and insight into the effect of crystalline polarity on film growth.  MOCVD growth of InN has proven more challenging due to the thermal stability of NH3 which is used as the nitrogen source in this process and difficulties controlling both the polarity and local In/N ratio during growth.  However, there is significant interest in developing an MOCVD process for InN growth since it is the epitaxial growth technology currently in use for commercial fabrication of group III-nitride thin films.  \nThis thesis is therefore focused on a study of MOCVD growth of InN with the goal of providing new information on the effects of growth conditions and buffer/substrate materials on InN film properties.  Initial studies, using both (111) Si and (0001) sapphire substrates, identified an optimum growth temperature window of 540-560 \u00b0C for the formation of stable InN films.  Thin AlN buffer layers, grown at low temperature (~500 \u00b0C) were used to improve the structural properties of InN grown on sapphire.  An AlN buffer layer thickness of 30 \u00c5 was determined to be optimum for growth of continuous InN films with reduced surface roughness. InN film was also observed to be well-oriented with the c-plane sapphire substrate, for optimum LT-AlN buffer thickness of 30 \u00c5, with rocking curve FWHM value of 0.5\u00b0 for (0002) InN peak.\nWhen attempting to grow InN films on sapphire with thicknesses greater than approximately 150 nanometers using an AlN buffer layer, the InN films were observed to delaminate from the buffer/substrate at growth temperature. In-situ wafer curvature measurements were then carried out to study the evolution of film stress during MOCVD growth to better understand the origin of the film delamination problem. The InN films were observed to grow under a ~0.2 GPa tensile stress which is believed to originate from island coalescence and the three-dimensional growth mode of the film. The combined effect of compressive stress due to high lattice mismatch between InN and AlN (~14%) and tensile stress due to grain coalescence along with the relatively weak bond strength of InN compared to GaN and AlN, is believed to cause the InN film to crack along the interface and delaminate. \nTo further investigate the effect of the buffer layer on InN growth, studies were carried out using GaN films grown on sapphire as the growth template.  Recent MBE results had indicated a significant difference in the thermal stability and growth mode of In-polar and N-polar InN, with improved properties reported for N-polar material grown on N-polar GaN.   MOCVD growth of N-polar GaN is very difficult; consequently, all of the results reported in the literature for InN growth on GaN were likely carried out on Ga-polar material resulting in films with a high surface roughness.  In order to study the effect of film polarity in MOCVD growth, N-polar GaN films on sapphire, produced by MBE, were obtained and used as templates for InN growth for comparison to growth on Ga-polar GaN grown by MOCVD and HVPE.  By utilizing N-polar and Ga-polar GaN films, it was possible to produce N-polar and In-polar InN films by MOCVD, as determined by convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) analysis.  Furthermore, the polarity was found to dramatically alter the surface roughness and growth mode of the InN films with enhanced lateral growth and reduced surface roughness obtained for N-polar InN. A qualitative model was proposed to explain the different growth mechanisms observed for In-polar and N-polar InN.\nIn spite of the improvements in surface morphology obtained with growth of N-polar InN, delamination at the InN/GaN interface was still observed in these films, and was also present in In-polar InN samples.  Attempts were made to further reduce the lattice mismatch and improve the adhesion between InN and GaN by using a compositionally graded InGaN buffer layer.  The fabrication of InGaN over its entire composition range is challenging since the optimal growth parameters window for InGaN varies with composition and film quality is strongly dependent on temperature and precursor flow rates. Initial graded InGaN buffer layers were produced by using optimum growth conditions for low-In fraction InGaN (800 \u00b0C) and InN (~540 \u00b0C) as the initial and final growth set points of the buffer layer and continuously varying growth conditions between these two extremes. Cross-section samples were prepared for transmission electron microscopy and chemical analysis of the graded layers was carried out using x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) in the scanning TEM mode.  The In fraction was observed to vary over the entire composition range in the buffer layer, however, a ~40 nm thick region of approximately constant composition (~In0.5Ga0.5N) was observed at the center of the graded layer.  The region of constant composition also had a much higher defect density than the rest of the graded layer possibly due to phase segregation which is predicted to occur in InGaN.  Consequently, the structural properties of the InN films grown on the graded InGaN layers were comparable to films grown directly on GaN, however, the film adhesion was significantly improved with no evidence of interfacial cracks between the InN and GaN.  These preliminary results indicate that graded InGaN layers can be used to improve the adhesion of InN on both Ga-polar and N-polar GaN, however, further work is needed to develop graded InGaN buffer layers or constant composition InGaN interlayers with improved structural properties for InN growth.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [408], "author_name_tesi": "Jain, Abhishek ", "last_name_ssi": "Jain", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abhishek", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Darrell G Schlom", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Joseph R Flemish"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Chair", "Darrell G Schlom, Committee Member", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member", "Joseph R Flemish, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MOCVD", "InN", "polarity", "graded buffer", "in-situ stress analysis", "growth mechanism"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Trailing Edge Noise Prediction Using the Non-Linear Disturbance Equations", "id": "26605", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10766", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "AIRFOIL self-noise consists of five major sources. One of these identified sources is turbulent boundary layer \u2013 trailing edge (TBL-TE) noise, which is an important source of rotor and wind turbine broadband noise, and the focus of this thesis. Trailing edge noise is the result of unsteady flow interacting with the trailing edge of an airfoil or other sharp edged flow surface. The presence of the sharp trailing edge scatters the sound generated by the turbulent eddies very efficiently, especially for sources in the immediate vicinity of the edge. There is a need for accurate and computationally efficient methods to calculate the turbulent boundary layer trailing-edge (TBL-TE) noise that are not reliant on empirical data. The majority of the current semi-empirical techniques are based on measurements from symmetric NACA airfoil sections (i.e. NACA 0012). These techniques are generally not coupled with CFD solvers to obtain turbulent boundary layer data that provides pertinent parameters used in the acoustic calculations. Some methods exist that incorporate CFD solutions like Large Eddy simulations (LES) into their noise prediction algorithms. But these are prohibitively expensive and impractical for routine use. The method described in this paper is a first principles approach that aims to predict the TBL-TE noise using computational aeroacoustic (CAA) techniques without resorting to empiricism.\n\n\tThe prediction of trailing edge noise requires an accurate calculation of the boundary layer fluctuations in the vicinity of the trailing edge. Scales in the computational domain ranging from the small turbulent boundary layer scales to those of the long-range noise propagation need to be resolved. These data can be obtained using simulation techniques like Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) or Large Eddy Simulation (LES). However such simulations for complete helicopters or wind turbine rotors are impractical given today\u2019s computational resources. Also, DNS becomes unrealistic for the propagation of the acoustic signal to distant observers. The method described here overcomes these limitations by using a hybrid CAA approach coupled with a flow solver based on the non-linear disturbance equations (NLDE). The overall problem is separated into component problems with the NLDE equations applied over a relatively small noise generating region i.e. approximately the last 10% of the chord or less. This makes the solution more computationally efficient than LES for the full airfoil or rotor and enables the use of the most computationally efficient methods in the required regions. \n\n\tThe proposed method is advantageous to helicopter and wind turbine manufacturers as it provides a tool for the prediction of rotor broadband noise at the design stage. This can also be used as a tool to reduce noise through the analysis of appropriate noise reduction devices. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10386], "author_name_tesi": "Jain, Abhishek ", "last_name_ssi": "Jain", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abhishek", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Philip John Morris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Steven Brentner, Thesis Advisor", "Philip John Morris, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CAA", "CFD", "Trailing Edge", "Turbulence", "Synthetic Eddy Method", "Inflow Boundary Conditions"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Low Cost Instrumentation and Interface for Neural Recordings", "id": "13321", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "506", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than one billion people around the globe are affected by neurological disorders. Neurological disorders include epilepsy, migraine, and autism, and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, and neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and personality disorders. Neurological disorders affect people irrespective of their country of origin, country of residence, age, and sex. As the average life expectancy around the globe increases, and the population increases neurological disorders are estimated to grow multiple times their current number.\nThe adult human brain weighs about 3 pounds and contains some 100 billion neurons. Any dysfunctioning of these neurons could create problems and create a neurological disorder. Scientists and engineers are trying to understand the brain using various medical imaging techniques and better understand how the brain works and how any dysfunctioning can be prevented or overcome. Over the years different forms of medical imaging have been developed to understand the complex human brain. The Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of imaging techniques for spontaneous recording of the electrical activity from the brain. The EEG has been used widely for clinical purposes for diagnosing brain death, coma, monitoring the depth of anesthesia, localizing the regions of abnormalities in the brain. EEG is also widely used in research for cognitive and brain-state studies in psychology, neuroprosthetics, human factors, transportation safety and neuroeconomics.\nCurrent EEG acquisition systems are bulky and expensive. This thesis fits within an effort to produce a very high performance EEG recording amplifier that will serve three overlapping efforts at the Penn State Center for Neural Engineering: to produce a low cost video-EEG system for use in the third world, to produce a low-enough cost EEG recording platform for distribution in classroom brain computer interface or another EEG related courses, and to develop flexible high performance instrumentation for ongoing neural recordings in animal studies. \nA new low cost 8 channel EEG acquisition hardware has been developed which can record EEG data with high fidelity and whose component costs run less than a $100(USD) with of order 10 components. This system can be easily extended to a 16 channel or a 24 channel with just a few changes in the hardware and firmware design. My work has involved the development of the firmware code for the hardware. Different varieties of tests have been conducted to compare the performance of the prototype system with the standard clinical grade system and demonstrated its applicability using the well-known P300 paradigm for a Brain Computer Interface application. The above results prove that the prototype amplifier can serve as a low cost teaching tool and research tool.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [503], "author_name_tesi": "Jain, Ankit ", "last_name_ssi": "Jain", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ankit", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Gluckman", "Kenneth Jenkins", "Julio Urbina", "Kultegin Aydin", "Insoo Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Gluckman, Thesis Advisor", "Kenneth Jenkins, Thesis Advisor", "Julio Urbina, Thesis Advisor", "Kultegin Aydin, Thesis Advisor", "Insoo Kim, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["low cost", "EEG", "instrumentation", "brain computer interface", "biomedical", "medical device", "ADS1298", "MSP430."]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A SYSTEMATIC PROCESS FOR PRODUCT FAMILY DISSECTION AND BENCHMARKING\n", "id": "11151", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "273", "abstract_tesi": "As global markets saturate and competition intensifies, many manufacturers are focusing on benchmarking families of products alongside individual products to gain valuable insight and strategic advantage over their competitors.  Benchmarking a single product is a human-intensive and time-consuming process; benchmarking product families greatly multiplies the complexity of this process.  Product dissection (or teardown) is a widely used technique to benchmark (and sometimes reverse engineer) competitors\u2019 products.  While methods have been proposed for product family dissection and benchmarking, a major problem is the way in which data is collected.  Additionally, published literature on product family dissection and benchmarking is rather sparse.  This work introduces a novel systematic process for dissecting and benchmarking product families that helps gather product family data in its entirety.  The process combines several popular tools to streamline and standardize the process of product family dissection and benchmarking.  The tools integrated in the proposed process include: Bill of Materials (BOM), Design Structure Matrix (DSM), Clustering, Product Line Commonality Index (PCI), Generational Variety Index (GVI), and Market Segmentation Grid.  The process focuses on obtaining a holistic view of benchmarked families with regards to product family architecture including modules and interfaces, commonality (and indirectly cost) and variety, flexibility to adapt to future market requirements, and market segmentation evaluation.  The process is demonstrated using a family of the Durabuilt cordless power tools.  Furthermore, a case study is presented where the proposed process is applied to benchmark a set of power tools in order to develop an enhanced product family.  The results and conclusions from the case study are discussed in detail along with limitations of the proposed process.  This research will help companies keep pace with the latest technologies and survive global competition by the means of systematic benchmarking. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [270], "author_name_tesi": "Jain, Avanti ", "last_name_ssi": "Jain", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Avanti", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson", "Timothy William Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Product Line Commonality Index (PCI)", "Design Structure Matrix (DSM)", "Bill of Materials (BOM)", "Benchmarking", "Dissection", "Product Family", "Generational Variety Index (GVI)", "Market Segmentation Grid"]}]
