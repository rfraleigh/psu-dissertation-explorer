The research illuminated similarities and differences in perceptions about the challenges of implementation, which elements of SWAS were successful, which were not, and why. Data were collected from teachers, administrators and\nother informants as needed. An instrument was developed to break down the large teacher group into smaller, more clearly defined subgroups. The iterative process of data collection included a series of interviews and some follow up conversations with a broad sampling of key\nstakeholders. An extensive document review was conducted, yielding critical information and grounds for further questioning of stakeholders.\n\nThe findings from the research were sorted into five broad themes or lessons learned. The first of these themes concerned establishing and maintaining a strong research base for the reform. Reformers need to first be researchers of their own systems. They must know what is working, what is not, and why before considering a possible reform measure. Secondly, reformer leaders must identify, and then communicate and collaborate with important stakeholders, and rely on these informed sources to help guide the reform and support its implementation. The findings also\nindicated the importance of communication and making sure those responsible for implementing the reform are well informed. A fourth theme concerned the importance of maintaining flexibility in response to problems and difficulties that arise during implementation. Lastly, leadership needs to know and act on what matters most-- which elements of the reform need to be preserved, which can be revised, and which can be discarded.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3112], "author_name_tesi": "Butterfield, Jay Vance", "last_name_ssi": "Butterfield", "middle_name_ssi": "Vance", "first_name_ssi": "Jay", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nona Ann Prestine", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Iris M Striedieck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nona Ann Prestine, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Iris M Striedieck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["SCHOOL SIZE REFORM", "STAKEHOLDER PERCEPTIONS", "CHANGE", "REFORM", "COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL REFORM", "SMALLER LEARNING COMMUNITIES", "SWAS", "SWS", "LEADERSHIP"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF POROUS SEA BOTTOMS ON THE PROPAGATION OF UNDERWATER SHOCK WAVES USING THE P-&#945; EQUATION OF STATE", "id": "9501", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5145", "abstract_tesi": "Much is known about the linear acoustic properties of sea bottoms as well as the interaction of blast waves with porous media in air.  However, little is known about how shock wave interaction with a sea bottom affects the pressure waves in the water environment.  Non-contact explosions in underwater environments pose a significant threat to Navy vessels.  The detonation of an explosive charge underwater generates a shock wave that can directly load a vessel but can also reflect from a sea bottom before loading.  This necessitates a better understanding of shock reflections from a porous sea bottom.  In this thesis, the Navy\u2019s DYSMAS finite difference code is used for modeling of the propagation and reflection of underwater explosions.  Within DYSMAS, the P-&#945; equation of state is implemented to model porous materials.  The equation of state uses the parameter &#945;, the ratio of porous material specific volume to the specific volume of the solid, to create an irreversible compressibility simulating the crush of air pockets in porous sand.  This thesis uses the P-&#945; equation of state to model two dramatically different porosities of sand subjected to loading conditions corresponding to key values for P-&#945; behavior.  Measurement points are selected in the water field of an axi-symmetric model to record pressure and impulse intensity (the cumulative integral of pressure and a good indicator of potential for structural damage).  It is observed that variation in porosities does not affect the peak pressures at any point in the water.  Rather, porosity itself (as opposed to a rigid bottom) reduces peak pressures in a limited area near the water-sediment interface.  This area increases in height with distance from the charge.  Porosity variations do affect impulse intensity.  Higher porosities create a greater reduction in maximum impulse intensity.  Like the peak pressure, these reductions are limited to an area near the water-sediment interface.  Unlike the peak pressures, the reduction area increases in height with proximity to the charge.  Higher porosities lead to slower propagation in the sediment. Higher porosities and lower sand-loading pressures both lead to more defined tensile, low pressure reflections.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5118], "author_name_tesi": "Buxton, Rebecca ", "last_name_ssi": "Buxton", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Hugo Koopmann", "Gary Hugo Koopmann", "Stephen A Hambric"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Hugo Koopmann, Thesis Advisor", "Gary Hugo Koopmann, Thesis Advisor", "Stephen A Hambric, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["P-&#945; equation of state", "underwater explosion", "shock reflection", "porous media"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Application of Canonical Effective Methods to Background-Independent Theories", "id": "14364uxb101", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14364", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Effective formalisms play an important role in analyzing phenomena above some given length scale when complete theories are not accessible.

A producer\u2019s management of the operation is the most important item on the road to profitability.  Since dairy farms are so complex, producers must master managing all of the areas of the business in order to achieve maximum profitability and productivity.  Feed is the largest expense in producing milk. This makes proper management of feeding and nutrition pivotal to both profitability and productivity.  Management of profit margins is necessary in order to make the best decisions for the dairy business.  The effective use of different management tools, such as income over feed cost and dairy advisory teams, can lead to better profitability and productivity by helping dairy producers make the best management decisions.  This thesis will discuss three studies that investigated 1) milk income and feed cost profit margins 2) current feed management on dairy farms, with an interest in by-product feed management 3) and the use of dairy advisory teams to improve overall farm success. \nWith volatility in feed and milk markets, income over feed cost (IOFC) is a more advantageous measure of profit than simply feed cost per cow. The Pennsylvania State Extension Dairy Team IOFC tool was used to collect data from 95 Pennsylvania lactating dairy cow herds from 2009-2012 and to determine IOFC per cow per day. The data collected included average milk yield, milk income, purchased feed cost, ration ingredients, ingredient cost per ton, and amount of each ingredient fed.  Feed costs for home-raised feeds for each ration were based on market values rather than on actual on-farm cost.  Actual costs were used for purchased feed for each ration.  Mean lactating herd size was 170 \u00b110.5 cows, and daily milk yield per cow was 31.7 kg \u00b1 0.19kg. Mean IOFC was $7.71 \u00b1$1.01 cost per cow ranging from -$0.33 in March, 2009 to $16.60 in September, 2011.  Data was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA in SPSS.  Values were grouped by quartiles and analyzed with all years combined as well as by individual year.  Purchased feed cost per cow per day averaged $3.16 \u00b1 $1.07 for 2009-2012.  For 2009-2012 combined, milk yield and IOFC did not differ with purchased feed cost.  Intermediate levels (quartiles 2 and 3) of forage cost per cow per day between $1.45 and $1.97 per cow per day resulted in the greatest average IOFC of $8.19 and the greatest average milk yield of 32.3kg.  Total feed costs in the fourth quartile ($6.27 or more per cow per day) resulted in the highest IOFC.  Thus, minimizing feed cost per cow per day did not maximize IOFC.  In 2010, the IOFC was highest at $8.09 for dairies that fed one or more commodity by-product feeds.\nDue to tight profit margins and volatility in feed costs, many producers incorporate by-product feeds into their rations.  This study used an electronic survey to gather information about feeding management and the use of by-product feeds in rations for Pennsylvania dairy farms in 2013.  The survey was sent to 200 dairy farms via email, and 41 surveys were completed.  The survey was first sent out in November 2013 and the last response was received in April 2014.  All data were collected for the month of September 2013.  Survey responses showed that most (97.6%) of the responding Pennsylvania (PA) dairy producers fed a total mixed ration (TMR).  Over half (58.5%) of the producers fed a 60:40 forage to concentrate ratio for the ration.  Distillers grains and brewer\u2019s grains and yeasts were the most commonly used by-product feeds.  Producers analyzed dry matter weekly or biweekly (60.9 %) or when switching feeds (34.1 %).  Most TMR and forage nutrient testing was done when switching feeds, except for by-product commodity feeds, which most producers never nutrient tested.  Most dairy producers used PC Dart as a management tool.\n\nDairy producers continuously seek ways to improve their farm, and many choose to form a dairy advisory team (DAT) to improve management.  The objectives were: (1) to compare key measures before and after the team in order to determine if the use of a DAT was effective and (2) to compare a group of 24 herds with a DAT to Pennsylvania (PA) averages for key measures. Teams were formed between May 2008 through January 2013.  The range for herd size was 32-608 with a standard deviation of \u00b1 13.96 cows.  Herd size, milk yield, somatic cell score (SCS), peak milk yield, age at first calving (AFC), days in milk (DIM), pregnancy rate and cull and mortality rates were key measures analyzed.  The changes in key measures, after using DAT for at least one year, were analyzed using a general liner model and contrasts.  After DAT use for one year, herds had significantly (P<0.05) higher percent of herd with SCS 1-3 of 76.92 vs. 73.79 and higher peak milk in the third plus lactation with 45.60 vs. 43.30 kg.  After DAT use for more than one year, these herds had significantly (P<0.05) higher milk yields of 33.56 vs. 31.13 kg. The DAT also had a lower (P<0.05) AFC of 24.45 vs. 25.50 months and higher percent of herd with SCS 1-3 of 79.33 vs. 73.79 % after the team was in place for longer than a year. Herds using a DAT for more than one year had lower days in milk (DIM) of 173 vs. 187 and higher peak milk in the third plus lactation of 47.4 vs.  43.3 kg. The DAT herds\u2019 January Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA) test data were compared  to Dairy Metric\u2019s PA average for January 2014 using a one-sample t-test. Farms with a DAT had significantly (P<0.05) higher milk yield of 33.9 vs. 31.9kg and peak milk yield for lactation 1 with 36.1 vs. 33.9kg .  Herds with DAT had significantly (P<0.001) lower AFC of 24.4 vs. 25.6 months and higher percentage of herd with SCS 1-3 79.85 vs. 73.4%.\nIn summary, the management of a dairy farm is complex business. Profit margins, feeding management and continuously making improvements on the farm are all part of dairy farm management.  Results of these studies indicated that intermediate levels of forage cost and higher levels of total feed cost per cow per day resulted in both higher milk yield and higher IOFC.  Dairy producers were successful at feed management, but increasing the amount of nutrient testing on by-product feeds and use of dairy data analysis tools may increase their success. These studies also showed that the use of DAT led to greater milk yield, lower AFC and better SCS.  Herds with DAT had higher milk yield, lower AFC and better SCS compared to PA averages.  Use of a DAT was beneficial to dairy farms.  Many management practices exist that can be applied to dairy farms to increase both production and profitability. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10047], "author_name_tesi": "Buza, Marianne Helen", "last_name_ssi": "Buza", "middle_name_ssi": "Helen", "first_name_ssi": "Marianne", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa Holden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa Holden, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Income over feed cost", "feed management", "dairy advisory team", "dairy cattle"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "PULLOUT RESISTANCE OF SOIL ANCHORS IN COHESIONLESS SOIL UNDER VARYING VELOCITIES BY EXPERIMENTAL METHODS", "id": "q811kj606", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13074", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An examination of the literature in respect to buried soil anchors shows an existing gap in parameters studied.

Results demonstrate that it is possible to introduce a significant amount of damping in the lag mode with a relatively small absorber mass, and the corresponding amplitudes of 1/rev periodic motions are not excessively large.  The lag mode damping and 1/rev motions are also compared with the results achieved for an embedded chordwise inertial damper.  A classical six-degree-of-freedom aeromechanical stability analysis is augmented with two absorber cyclic degrees of freedom in the nonrotating frame to examine the effect of the radial absorber on aeromechanical stability characteristics.  These results indicate that ground resonance instability is eliminated for the range of absorber parameters considered, and in most cases, the stability margins are significant.  A rotor blade with a discrete radial vibration absorber is also analyzed to examine the effect of the absorber on rotor blade and hub loads.  The rotor blade is modeled as an elastic beam undergoing flap and lag bending, with the absorber modeled as a discrete mass restrained by a damped spring, moving in the spanwise direction within the rotor blade.

For this thesis, three approaches were used to investigate the effects of urban habitat management on ecological variables: 1) an observational study of soil microarthropods in high- and low-maintenance lawns and unmanaged fields; 2) a manipulative study in which soil properties, microclimates, carbon and nitrogen cycles, and invertebrates were measured in plots of lawn, old field, bark mulch and gravel mulch habitat types; 3) a microlandscape study in which the effects of landscape context patterns on arthropods in lawns were tested. In study 1, soil mites were more numerous in high-maintenance lawns while collembolans were more abundant in low-maintenance lawns. In study 2, all measured variables differed significantly among the habitat types. Mulch plots were warmer during daytime hours and had wetter soils as compared to vegetated plots. Gravel plots had the lowest soil organic matter, soil aggregate stability, and earthworm densities. Bark mulch plots had the largest earthworm populations and lowest soil bulk density. Earthworm numbers were intermediate in unmowed and lawn plots, except when they decreased in lawns during drought conditions. Fluxes of carbon dioxide were higher from soils in lawn and bark mulch plots. Decomposition rates of oak leaves in litterbags were greater in mulched plots as compared to vegetated plots. Mowing and mulching promoted higher levels of inorganic soil nitrogen at certain times relative to those in old field plots. In field measurements, nitrous oxide fluxes were highest from gravel-covered soils. Arthropod communities differed significantly among the habitat types although no consistent patterns were seen in relationships between activity-abundance levels and the habitat types. In study 3, arthropod communities differed among patches of lawn surrounded by different levels of landscape heterogeneity, and activity-abundance levels tended to be higher in microlandscapes containing non-lawn habitat patches as compared to those with only lawn. Habitat composition may have influenced the results of this study more than landscape heterogeneity.

Given the highly oxygenated nature of cellulosic biomass, reductive methods that transform this abundant renewable resource into valuable carbon-containing compounds with high efficiency and selectivity are required. This thesis describes progress toward the development of a catalytic method to reduce biomass-derived vicinal diols through a deoxydehydration approach. Specifically, we have attempted to reduce these diols to the corresponding olefins using transition metal complexes of the Group VI metals Mo and W. Both stoichiometric and catalytic chemistry related to the desired transformation is described. In a stoichiometric sense, the synthesis and characterization of seven target Tp\u2019Mo(V) diolates was achieved, and attempts to convert these to Tp\u2019Mo(IV) diolates capable of cycloreversion by one-electron reduction are detailed. In catalytic studies, an effect of catalyst on product distributions for the conversion of (R,R)-hydrobenzoin was observed. Utilizing a bis-oxomolybdenum(VI) catalyst, an unanticipated oxidative cleavage of the 1,2-diol substrate to two equivalents of benzaldehyde was observed. Conversely, the use of low valent Group VI catalysts, specifically molybdenum hexacarbonyl, reductively transforms hydrobenzoin derivatives into olefins in moderate yields in the presence of 4\u00c5 molecular sieves.

Oxidation with nitric acid at different treatment temperatures resulted in surface oxygen atomic percentages of 5-25%, per XPS analysis. Ammonia treatment introduced 2-6% N. In addition, the conversion of pyridine to pyridinium was confirmed by peak fitting analysis of the XPS N1s signals and surface charge titration. Redox functionality of the alklyated groups was explored using cyclic voltammetry. Perchlorate adsorption and desorption by altering the redox state of the GAC was observed by XPS detection of perchlorate presence/absence on the GAC surface. Some capacity was also restored by bulk reduction regeneration after RSSCT and rerun in adsorption RSSCT. Composite of polypyrrole and bituminous and hardwood GAC were also produced by both chemical and electrochemical polymerization for electrically regenerable adsorption of sulfate. The composite significantly increased sulfate removal from solution in both RSSCT and istotherm vs. the pristine GAC. Removal increased with increasing pyrrole concentration during polymerization. Reduction regeneration was achieved with approximately 2/3 adsorbed sulfate released, according to quantification of adsorbed sulfate in the XPS S2p peak.  The implications of redox regeneration with a relatively inexpensive media could be highly transformative to the adsorption industry.

While these sensations can act a deterrent to consuming spicy foods for some individuals, for others, these compounds are immensely enjoyable and a key driver in their liking of certain foods. This dissertation explored the variables that influence perception of these compounds as well as the variables that influence liking and ultimately intake of spicy foods. First, we developed a free sorting technique with appropriate methodological considerations so that we could use this method to explore perception of chemesthetic compounds. Utilizing this method, we showed that training, whether through a formal culinary program (Culinary Institute of America, Hyde Park, NY) or through informal experiential learning, significantly influences the perception of chemesthetic compounds. While the sorting of these stimuli follows a biological basis for the most part, experiential learning and formal training altered the way that participants use language to describe these stimuli. Experts and na\u00efve assessors with high scores on the Food Involvement Scale (FIS) showed more lexical richness surrounding these sensations, using significantly more descriptors to describe the sensations that they perceived. However, individuals in these cohorts tended to use these words more idiosyncratically than the na\u00efve assessors that had low FIS scores. Only formal training however significantly influenced the way that study participants conducted to the sorting task. The expert assessors generated perceptual map configurations that were significantly different from both the cohort of na\u00efve assessors with high Food Involvement scores and the cohort of na\u00efve assessors with low Food Involvement scores, reflecting a possible shift in the perception of these sensations or a shift in the way the assessors with formal training attended to the sorting task.\n\nThe second portion of this dissertation focuses on the variables that influence liking and intake of spicy foods. Chapter four shows strong empirical evidence for the relationships between personality and liking of spicy foods that were previously hypothesized by Rozin and colleagues. While there was no measurable effect of desensitization in this study, individuals with high scores on Arnett\u2019s Inventory of Sensation Seeking and the Sensitivity to Reward subscale of the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire showed higher liking of spicy foods than individuals with low scores on either of these personality measures. Extending on these findings, chapter five explores the nature of these relationships in a superset of individuals using moderation models. We observed limited moderation by personality on both the relationship between perceived burning/stinging intensity of a sampled capsaicin stimulus and the liking of spicy foods and the relationship between liking and intake of spicy foods. However, we did observe differences between men and women that suggest that there may be divergent mechanisms driving the intake of spicy foods in men and women. In women, the personality trait Sensation Seeking showed stronger effects on liking and intake of spicy foods, possibly reflecting a stronger biological reward and motivation for women. In men, Sensitivity to Reward showed stronger effects on liking and intake of spicy foods, suggesting that the social rewards may be more salient to drive the consumption of spicy foods in men. In chapter six we utilized a range of different personality measures to explore the possible divergent mechanism between Sensation Seeking and Sensitivity to Reward. A number of related personality constructs, including sensation seeking, impulsivity, and reward sensitivity, associate with behaviors that have been hypothetically linked with the enjoyment of eating spicy foods such as gambling, risky sexual behavior, and risky driving practices. While these personality traits are related, they are each multidimensional traits that associate with these behaviors to different extents. We employed a range of personality measures, both self-report and behavioral measures, to explore the relationships between personality and liking of spicy foods in a larger context. We observed that Sensation Seeking and Sensitivity to Reward show significant associations with the intake of spicy foods but only Sensation Seeking shows significant associations with measures of liking of sampled and remembered spicy foods. We suggest that these two personality constructs, while related, tap different dimensions of spicy food intake. Based on these data, we propose that Sensation Seeking may act through liking of spicy foods in influence intake of spicy foods, possibly reflecting a biological or intrinsic motivation for consuming spicy foods while Sensitivity to Reward acts through different mechanisms, possibly reflecting more of an extrinsic motivation for the intake of spicy foods.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10439], "author_name_tesi": "Byrnes, Nadia K", "last_name_ssi": "Byrnes", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Nadia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John E Hayes", "John E Hayes", "Kathleen Loralee Keller", "Joshua D Lambert", "Stephen Jeffrey Wilson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John E Hayes, Dissertation Advisor", "John E Hayes, Committee Chair", "Kathleen Loralee Keller, Committee Member", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member", "Stephen Jeffrey Wilson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["experts", "chemesthesis", "sorting", "perceptual mapping", "individual differences", "sensation seeking", "sensitivity to punishment", "mBART"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Endobronchial Video Analysis and CT-Video Fusion", "id": "14547pdb5069", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14547", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bronchoscopy enables a number of minimally invasive chest procedures for diseases such as lung cancer and asthma. For example, using the bronchoscope's continuous video stream as a guide, a physician can navigate through the lung airways to examine general airway health, collect tissue samples, or administer a disease treatment. Aside from its intraoperative utility, the recorded video provides high-resolution detail of the airway mucosal surfaces and a record of the bronchoscopic procedure. Unfortunately, little use is made of the acquired video stream, a potentially invaluable source of information. One reason for this is that bronchoscopic examination of the lungs produces a considerable amount of endobronchial video. Due to a lack of robust automatic video-analysis methods to summarize this immense data source, it is essentially discarded after the procedure. In addition, little effort has been made to link the video to the detailed anatomical information given by a patient's preoperative 3D {CT} chest scan.\n\nIn this thesis, we present methods for constructing a multi-modal {CT}-video chest model that enables more efficient and practical {CT}-video fusion for use in post-operative analysis and additional follow-up procedures in the pulmonary-disease management workflow. In particular, we develop a method for parsing endobronchial video for the purpose of summarization, browsing, and retrieval. Additionally, we introduce a semi-automatic registration method that utilizes the parsed video sequence, along with interactive {CT}-video alignment of a small number video frames, to produce spatial-linkage data between the summarized video and an airway-tree model extracted from an associated {3D} {CT} chest scan. Given an appropriate number of manual registrations, this method is capable of registering an entire endobronchial video sequence, regardless of its duration. Taken together, the data sources generated from these methods constitute the CT-video chest model.\n\nThe resulting chest model serves as the foundation for a suite of video-analysis tools we incorporate into an existing image-guided intervention (IGI) system known as the Virtual Navigator System (VNS). The integrated tool suite, known as the VNS Video Analysis Subsystem, quickly conveys the summarized contents of a processed video sequence to a user. Moreover, the system enables advanced interactive 3D visualization of fused CT-video data and provides for a number of applications relevant to post-operative analysis of endobronchial video. To the best of our knowledge, the VNS Video Analysis Subsystem represents the first comprehensive video analysis system to synergistically combine {CT} and endobronchial video. \n\nWe test our system and methods using real video taken from lung-cancer patient studies. Our incorporated methods consistently select salient representative keyframes appropriately distributed throughout a processed video sequence, enabling quick and accurate post-operative review of the bronchoscopic examination. Additionally, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept multiple-bronchoscopy application using two case studies that have associated multi-modal data sets comprised of white light bronchoscopy (WLB) and narrow band imaging (NBI) bronchoscopic video modalities.

Normally, a human hematopoietic cell expresses both a full-length form of GATA1 (GATA1fl) and a short form (GATA1s) that lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain (NAD). Germline GATA1 mutations that result in exclusive production of GATA1s (\u201cGATA1s mutations\u201d) have been identified in patients with congenital hypoplastic anemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, as well as in individuals with Down syndrome (DS) who suffer from transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. \nI investigated the function of GATA1s by analyzing genomic data from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) obtained from somatic tissues of patients with DS-associated TMD and congenital anemia due to a germline GATA1s mutation. \nMicroarray transcriptome profiles of iPSC-derived progenitors revealed that GATA1s upregulated mostly megakaryocytic and myeloid genes, and downregulated predominantly erythroid genes. \nSingle cell expression profiling demonstrated that small changes in expression of many genes contributed to the GATA1s-mediated change in lineage bias from erythroid to myelo-megakaryocytic fate. \nTo provide a mechanistic explanation of the observed phenotype, I integrated genome-wide differential binding profiles of GATA1 isoforms obtained using ChIP-seq with differential transcriptome response to the presence or absence of GATA1fl or GATA1s in murine megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cells, G1MEs. \nI demonstrated that loss of the NAD impairs erythropoiesis and biases cells towards myelo-megakaryopoiesis due to: (i) failure to efficiently bind to a subset of GATA1 erythroid target sites, which prevents the induction of erythroid genes, and (ii) failure to repress a subset of myelo-megakaryocytic genes upon successful binding to DNA. I identified SMAD1 and LMO2 as candidate co-factors that might be involved in NAD-dependent selective chromatin occupancy of GATA1 at erythroid targets and repression of myelo-megakaryocytic genes, respectively. \nI propose a new model for GATA1 function in hematopoiesis, according to which an imbalance in the relative expression levels of GATA1 isoforms within an individual cell might lead to a bias in cell fate.

First, carbon nanomaterials such as C$_{60}$, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have extraordinary physical properties that can be exploited for a wide range of applications, and thus have been studied extensively by a variety of experimental and theoretical techniques. In this dissertation, we study doping, defect, and many-body effects on the structural and electronic properties of carbon nanomaterials using a first-principles (\\textit{ab initio}) approach (i.e. without using empirical parameters). Second, self-propelled microswimmers such as catalytically driven platinum microrods have a potential to be used as novel drug delivery vehicles. Many experiments on microswimmers have been done, but there has been no quantitative analysis on experimental data so far because different motions such as self-propelled and Brownian motions take place at the same time, leading to wrong interpretations of experimental results often. In this dissertation, we present novel data analysis methods for self-propelled microswimmers.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we study the doping effects of alkali and alkaline-earth atoms and C$_{8}$H$_{8}$ molecules on the structural, electronic, and superconducting properties of solid C$_{60}$ using density functional theory (DFT). We show that there is no charge transfer between C$_{8}$H$_{8}$ and C$_{60}$ molecules in a C$_{8}$H$_{8}$/C$_{60}$ co-crystal using band-structure calculations. Using total-energy calculations, we also show that alkali atoms can fill the tetrahedral voids in a C$_{8}$H$_{8}$/C$_{60}$ co-crystal, leading to the formation of A$_{2}$(C$_{8}$H$_{8}$)C$_{60}$ (A = K, Rb, Cs). Finally, we show that ABa(C$_{8}$H$_{8}$)C$_{60}$ and ALi$_{2}$(C$_{8}$H$_{8}$)C$_{60}$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) -- hypothetical three-electron-doped fcc (C$_{8}$H$_{8}$)C$_{60}$ co-crystals with the same crystal structure and doping level as superconducting A$_{3}$C$_{60}$ (A = K, Rb) -- might have superconducting transition temperatures ($T_{c}$) of up to $\\sim$50 K using McMillan formula.\n\nRecently synthesized fluorographene, fully fluorinated graphene in a chair configuration, is a wide band-gap ($E_{g}$) semiconductor with an optical band gap of $\\sim$3 eV. However, accurate first-principles calculations have shown that pristine fluorographene should have $E_{g}$ of 5.4--7.5 eV. To explain this discrepancy, in Chapter 4, we study the defect effects of F vacancies, a Stone-Wales (SW) defect, C single vacancies and C double vacancies on $E_{g}$ of fluorographene using density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory within the $GW$ approximation. We show that F vacancies and a SW defect are not likely to affect $E_{g}$ of fluorographene, whereas a C single vacancy with a doubly fluorinated C atom, a C double vacancy, and a C double vacancy with two doubly fluorinated C atoms, which are energetically more favorable than other C vacancies at a wide range of chemical potential of F ($\\mu_{F}$), lead to a \\textit{GW} band gap of 3.8--4.8 eV, which is in good agreement with the optically measured $E_{g}$ ($\\sim$3 eV). The remaining 0.8--1.8 eV difference is attributed to strongly bound excitons, which are neglected in the $GW$ approximation.\n\nWhereas photoemission and inverse photoemission spectra (PES and IPES) for C$_{60}$ highest-occupied-molecular-orbital (HOMO)- and lowest-unoccupied-molecular-orbital (LUMO)-derived bands of pristine and alkali-intercalated C$_{60}$ indicate that the mixing of C$_{60}$ and alkali electronic states takes place, DFT band-structure calculations show that alkali atoms simply act as electron donors into the mostly rigid C$_{60}$ LUMO-derived band. To resolve this discrepancy, in Chapter 5, we study the correlation effects in A$_{3}$C$_{60}$ and A$_{6}$C$_{60}$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) using the $GW$ approximation. Our $GW$ quasiparticle band structures show that C$_{60}$ HOMO- and LUMO-derived bands broaden by $\\sim$10\\% and $\\sim$30\\%, respectively, upon alkali intercalation in both fcc and A15 A$_{3}$C$_{60}$ as compared to fcc and sc C$_{60}$ with the same lattice constants, which is qualitatively consistent with the PES and IPES experiments. Our $GW$ calculations using experimental results show that a Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition takes place when the C$_{60}$ LUMO-derived band width is $\\sim$0.43 and $\\sim$0.75 eV for fcc and A15 A$_{3}$C$_{60}$, respectively, in good agreement with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations.\n%we calculate quasiparticle energies of face-centered-cubic (fcc), simple-cubic (sc), and body-centered-cubic (bcc) C$_{60}$, fcc and A15 A$_{3}$C$_{60}$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), and bcc A$_{6}$C$_{60}$ \n\nRecently, the first example of non-biological chemotaxis -- a directed movement towards or away from chemicals -- was reported: $\\sim$2-$\\mu$m-long catalytically-driven colloidal platinum/gold rods moved towards a hydrogen peroxide (H$_{2}$O$_{2}$)-soaked hydrogel, which was assumed to be a region of high H$_{2}$O$_{2}$ concentration. To find the mechanism for chemotaxis of Pt/Au microrods, in Chapter 6, we develop and implement new quantitative data analysis algorithms. Using our data analysis algorithms, we (i) decompose the Pt/Au microrod's motion into self-propelled, drift, and Brownian components successfully, (ii) obtain correct and accurate values for self-propulsion speed, drift speed, and diffusion coefficients, and (iii) find any possible correlation between self-propelled and drift motions. Our data analysis results show that the Pt/Au microrods' drift towards the H$_{2}$O$_{2}$-soaked hydrogel is not active chemotaxis but passive convection by a bulk flow towards the hydrogel, which is verified by new experiments. This proves that our data analysis algorithms are a reliable and accurate tool in the microswimmers research.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7713], "author_name_tesi": "Byun, Young-moo ", "last_name_ssi": "Byun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Young-moo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Milton Walter Cole", "Renee Denise Diehl", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Richard Wallace Robinett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi, Dissertation Advisor", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Chair", "Milton Walter Cole, Committee Member", "Renee Denise Diehl, Committee Member", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member", "Richard Wallace Robinett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fullerene", "Fluorographene", "Density Functional Theory", "GW Approximation", "Microswimmer", "Chemotaxis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": " Wastewater As A Water Resource\n\ndesign and Operation of an Integrated Biofilter\n\nwastewater Treatment and Reuse System\n", "id": "15600", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7955", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The modern method of managing wastewater requires removal from the source as quickly as possible to a centralized treatment system before discharging to a receiving body of water.  Although this method is in large part responsible for the near elimination of the major outbreaks of water borne diseases in developed nations, the approach is unsustainable due to infrastructure costs and its ineffectiveness to eliminate many organic compounds.   An alternative approach is to regard wastewaters as a resource.  \nAn effective and cost efficient decentralized management system was designed to convert wastewater into a water resource.  Constructed wetlands, living wall, and living columns were integrated into a single system with a footprint less than 15 square feet.  Designated an integrated biofilter (IBF); the system treated up to 50 gallons of gray water or black water in a batch process.  Analyses for 26 parameters demonstrated the IBF capable of decreasing levels of pollutants such as organics (BOD) and surfactants by 99% in 24 hours and meeting applicable discharge limits.  Existing decentralized management systems such as constructed wetlands require significantly longer detention times to attain similar rates of attenuation.  \nContinuous flow of wastewater through the IBF was compared to intermittent flow to compare rates of pollutant attenuation.   Cycling the wastewater through the IBF for four 1 hour intervals was as effective in removing pollutants as continuous flow.\nComponents of the IBF were also evaluated to determine contribution of each.  Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the entire system was superior to the attenuation achieved by the sum of the individual components.  Green roof biofilters were also evaluated for effectiveness in reducing pollutants in gray water.  Potential exists to integrate green roofs with IBFs.\nThe IBF was also evaluated to determine the potential to manage wastewater as a water resource.  Energy studies were conducted using replicate buildings at the Pennsylvania State University\u2019s Center for Green Roof Research. IBFs were positioned on the south wall of two buildings.  Impacts to the south wall temperature profile and the buildings\u2019 energy use for air conditioning were evaluated, while gray water was cycled through the IBFs.   Decreases of south wall exterior mean temperatures up to 68% and internal south wall temperatures up to 28% were observed. Energy usage for cooling decreased by 16%.   IBFs also affected the timing of peak temperatures.  Cycling of gray water through a green roof was also studied for the impact on building temperature and energy usage.  Although temperature reductions were observed, no significant reduction in energy use was found when compared to a green roof without gray water application. \nTreated gray water was applied to a traditional, asphalt shingle roof to evaluate potential to reduce building envelope temperatures and resulting energy use for cooling. Results demonstrated a 52% reduction to the temperature outside the ceiling insulation and reduction of energy use by 11% compared to a control building.  Temperature reductions were superior to those achieved with green roofs. \nThe potential to incorporate IBFs into residences as functional architecture was evaluated.  Applications included living showers and living window wells. \nFood crops such as herbs and tomatoes were cultivated in IBFs with gray water.  No adverse impacts on growth were observed.     \nThe IBF wastewater management system was demonstrated to be effective at attenuating pollutants and utilizing wastewater as a valuable resource.  Avoiding disposal costs associated with centralized waste water treatment plants, while obtaining savings from reduced energy expenses, make wastewater management with an IBF a viable alternative. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7908], "author_name_tesi": "CAMERON, Robert  D", "last_name_ssi": "CAMERON", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Robert ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Berghage Jr.", "Same", "Edmund Jay Holcomb", "Dan Thomas Stearns", "Allan Gunnar Sonsteby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Berghage Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Same, Committee Chair", "Edmund Jay Holcomb, Committee Member", "Dan Thomas Stearns, Committee Member", "Allan Gunnar Sonsteby, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["living walls", "green roofs", "energy conservation", "wastewater", "water resources", "living architecture", "green architecture"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Specifications and Performance of the Compton Suppression Spectrometer at the Pennsylvania State University\n", "id": "8409", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4699", "abstract_tesi": "A Compton Suppression Spectrometer (CSS) consists of a primary high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector and surrounding secondary detectors with appropriate data acquisition and processing electronics.

A detailed listing of the physical specifications of the Penn State Compton Suppression Spectrometer is presented.  Various performance measurements were performed; among them are peak height-to-Compton ratio (P/C) for suppressed and unsuppressed spectra, suppression factor (SF) and reduction factor (RF). Peak height-to-Compton ratio (P/C) is defined as the ratio of the peak count in a photopeak to the average count per channel in a relatively flat region in the corresponding Compton continuum that avoids the Compton edge. This ratio is calculated for both the suppressed and unsuppressed spectra.

The first issue is the large range of molecular conductance values reported by various research groups for identical molecules. This is addressed by studying the same molecule in dissimilar environments. The second issue is experimental uncertainty \u2013 whether the observed effects are inherent to the molecule or due to external causes. This is addressed by performing in-situ spectroscopy of the molecule as part of its electrical characterization. \nOligo(phenylene-ethynylene)s are a well studied class of molecules in the field of molecular electronics, and this work focuses on charge transport through nitro substituted oligo(phenylene-ethynylene) molecules. The electrical characterization of these molecules was performed utilizing two testbeds. An electromigrated break-junction testbed was used to probe individual molecules, while a nanowire molecular junction testbed was used to probe self-assembled monolayers of the molecule. \nExperiments performed on individual molecules revealed a temperature dependent transition in the dominant charge transport mechanism. Above 50K, hopping is the dominant charge transport mechanism, while below 50K direct tunneling is the dominant charge transport mechanism. Experiments performed on self-assembled monolayers did not reveal any temperature dependent transitions. The dominant charge transport mechanism appears to be direct tunneling throughout the temperature range investigated. \nThe results also indicate that molecules embedded in a self-assembled monolayer have significantly lower conductance than individual molecules. This is primarily due to a second charge transport mechanism (hopping) that opens up above 50K that is available only to individual molecules, and secondarily due to better potential screening properties of the self-assembled monolayers. Inelastic electron tunneling spectra obtained for the molecules in a self-assembled monolayer show a characteristic three-peak structure. Each of the peaks can be associated with a specific vibrational mode of an oligo(phenylene-ethynylene) molecule. \nThe results presented here directly address two issues in the field of molecular electronics. Firstly, the discrepancy in the reported molecular conductance values was addressed by establishing the important role played by the molecular environment in determining molecular conductance. Secondly, confidence in the results was established by obtaining an in-situ inelastic tunneling spectrum of the molecule under study. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3924], "author_name_tesi": "Cabassi, Marco Alberto", "last_name_ssi": "Cabassi", "middle_name_ssi": "Alberto", "first_name_ssi": "Marco", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Lawrence Allara", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Lawrence Allara, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy", "molecular electronics", "IETS"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Biomimetic Mineralization of Calcium Carbonate in Aqueous Biphasic Systems", "id": "20009", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9574", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many organisms form minerals with unique morphologies and specialized\nfunctions through the intercellular process of biomineralization. In particular, calcium\ncarbonate (CaCO3) biomineralization often begins within mineralization vesicles. It is\ntheorized that the binding and control over free Ca2+ concentrations both in the cytoplasm\nand mineralizing vesicles are in part responsible for the resulting CaCO3 products. The\ngoal of this dissertation is the generation of a biomimetic mineralization vesicle system\nthat controls Ca2+ binding in tandem with local CaCO3 precipitation towards understanding\nsimilar interdependencies in biological analogs.\nIn Chapter 1, I provide a detailed introduction to serve as a framework for the rest\nof the Chapters. Chapter 2 is focused on large scale (~20 mL) aqueous two-phase systems\n(ATPS) of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) / dextran (Dx), where small cations such as Ca2+\nare added to observe their partitioning behavior. The polyanion dextran sulfate (DxS) is\nalso added to this system to strongly affect Ca2+ partitioning and allow for localized CaCO3\nprecipitation, although this method was not used in Chapters 3-5. Chapter 3 also used the\nlarge scale PEG/Dx ATPS for the localized precipitation of CaCO3, which was the result\nof a compartmentalized enzyme. This enzyme, urease, was localized mainly in the Dx-rich\nphase, and released CO3\n2- when its substrate (urea) was introduced. The effect of PEG/Dx\nvolume ratios on the CaCO3 precipitation rate was investigated, as well as any\nmorphological or polymorphic changes that occured due to the presence of the high\nconcentration of macromolecules. In biological cells, compartmentalization is thought to\niv\nhave a direct impact on the local rate of various biological processes, especially concerning\ncompartmentalization of Ca2+ within mineralization vesicles. Chapters 4 and 5 detailed the\nformation of stabilized ATPS emulsion droplets using large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs),\nwhich resulted in Dx-rich droplets of ~5 \u03bcm diameter. Here the enzyme urease continued\nto compartmentalize into the Dx-rich droplets, however added Ca2+ caused the lipids to\naggregate. This was corrected for using a number of Ca2+ chelators with varying binding\nstrength. Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 investigated the use small and polymeric Ca2+ chelators,\nrespectively. In both Chapters, the LUVs were stabilized and CaCO3 precipitated when\nCa2+ was chelated properly. In Chapter 5, the chelator used introduced a new polymer-rich\nphase that precipitated entirely amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) when the enzymatic\nreaction proceeded. This is of biological relevance because biomineralizing organisms also\nselectively precipitate ACC within mineralizing vesicles prior to other polymorphic or\nmorphological changes. This dissertation presents results that mimic some of the\nconditions that occur in actual biomineralizing organisms. In the future, this system could\nbe used with chelators extracted from organisms or be redesigned to precipitate different\ntypes of biominerals to elucidate some of the underlying chemical principles that govern\nbiomineralization.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9344], "author_name_tesi": "Cacace, David Neal", "last_name_ssi": "Cacace", "middle_name_ssi": "Neal", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating", "Philip C.

This dissertation focuses on the differences in self-perceived interpersonal competence and communication competence across a sample population of Division 1A student-athlete and non-athlete participants. It also seeks to understand the barriers college athletes experience in romantic relationship initiation and maintenance.\n\tPrevious research suggests that college athletes spend less time socializing and communicating with individuals outside of their sport than non-athletes, perhaps affecting athletes\u2019 interpersonal and relational competence (Adler & Adler, 1991). The first phase of this research examined differences between athletes and non-athletes in communication and interpersonal competence.  Using a web-based survey, the Self-Perceived Communication Competence Scale (McCroskey & McCroskey, 1988) and the Interpersonal Competence Questionnaire (Buhrmester, Furman, Wittenberg & Reis 1988) were administered to both college athletes and non-athletes. Data collected from the web-based survey revealed no significant differences between athletes and non-athletes in self-reports of communication or interpersonal competence.  \nAs part of this initial phase, student-athletes, through open-ended, web-based survey responses and focus group discussions identified prominent barriers to the development of satisfying personal relationships\u2014lack of time, lack of understanding from others, uncertainty resulting from not understanding a person\u2019s intentions, and a partner\u2019s recognition of the athlete\u2019s athletic and academic commitments. Identifying these barriers is an important starting point to understanding the impact of personal relationships on athletic performance. When asked if an unhappy personal life affects their athletic performance, 86.4% of college athletes in this study answered that their athletic performance was negatively affected at least some of the time. The barriers identified in this research suggest a starting point for interventions that will assist athletes in managing their personal relationships.  \nBuilding on the findings from the first phase of this dissertation research, the second phase was devoted to developing a brief curriculum for college athletes to increase social competence and improve management of personal relationships. The proposed educational curriculum provides lessons on communication basics, fostering healthy relationships, and managing conflict and stress. \nFindings from this dissertation call attention to the unique relational issues college athletes\u2019 experience. In addition, future research should be directed toward a better understanding of how time constraints, partner\u2019s intention and partner\u2019s understanding affect the social development of student-athletes.  In light of the finding that distress in the personal lives of athletes negatively impacts athletic performance, athletic administrators, coaches, and support staff would be well served to address personal relationships in curricula with student athletes. Positive change in an athletes\u2019 communication, relationship and conflict management skills could, in turn, enhance the quality of their romantic, social and team relationships. Future research is needed to examine the relationships among these variables more completely and to test the efficacy of the proposed brief curriculum in enhancing student athletes\u2019 social competence and improving personal relationships.  \n \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5756], "author_name_tesi": "Cacciotti Sherburne, Susan Ruth", "last_name_ssi": "Cacciotti Sherburne", "middle_name_ssi": "Ruth", "first_name_ssi": "Susan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle E Day", "Denise Haunani Solomon", "Jon F Nussbaum", "Michelle E Day", "Dennis Edward Heitzmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle E Day, Dissertation Advisor", "Denise Haunani Solomon, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member", "Michelle E Day, Committee Chair", "Dennis Edward Heitzmann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["interpersonal competence", "relational development", "college athlete", "communication competence"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Comprehensive Examination of Factors Contributing to Employment Status in Multiple Sclerosis ", "id": "26341", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11699", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Objective: Unemployment is common among individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and is associated with significant socioeconomic burden. Several MS-related factors have been found to be associated with unemployment status including fatigue, depression, cognitive problems, and motor difficulties.

Patients and Methods: Fifty-three individuals with MS participating in a research study of cognitive, emotional, and social factors related to MS were examined. Construct scores were created using factor analysis that represented cognition, fatigue, depression, and motor function. These construct scores, along with age and measures of disease burden, were explored as predictors of unemployment status (not working, working) via logistic regression. Models of mediation were also investigated.  Results: A model including construct scores of motor function, cognition, depression, and fatigue significantly distinguished those who are unemployed from employed. However, only the cognitive, motor, and fatigue construct scores were found to be significantly associated with unemployment individually. Results of a mediation analysis indicated that the cognitive and fatigue construct scores significantly mediated the relationship of disability (EDSS) on work status. More specifically, processing speed and memory mediated the relationship of overall disability on work status. Conclusion: Cognitive function and fatigue mediate the effect of MS disability on employment status.

Twenty adults with ADHD and 20 age-matched adults without ADHD were recruited for this study. All participants provided a speech sample, completed bilateral lip and tongue somatosensory assessments, and completed the Adult/Adolescent Sensory Profile (AASP). Differences between groups were assessed using independent t-tests. Although individuals with ADHD demonstrated increased reading time, decreased reading accuracy, and decreased tactile detection and discrimination abilities; none reached the level of significance. Adults with ADHD reported significantly more sensory under- and over-responsivity behaviors. Correlational analyses were used to assess the relationship between reading time and accuracy, 2-pt discrimination, tactile detection and discrimination, and prevalence of sensory under- and over-responsivity behaviors in adults with ADHD. Decreased two-point discrimination abilities in left tongue and right lip were correlated with the speech measures: passage time (r (40) = 0.333, p = .036) and passage errors made (r (40) = -0.317, p = .046), respectively.

Of primary concern is the vast amount of soil carbon (C) in the region, which, if mineralized, is expected to provide a significant positive feedback to global climate in the form of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and accelerate climatic warming.  Alternatively, C uptake may be increasing in the region due to extended growing seasons and changes in plant community composition.  The expansion of woody shrubs, for example, has been widely noted throughout the region, and is expected to impact ecosystem C budgets and alter soil C pools.  However, the timing, magnitude and direction of changes in the C cycle in response to shrub expansion remain uncertain.  \nAddressing the C cycle impacts of shrub expansion requires an examination of CO2 exchange processes at multiple spatiotemporal scales.  At the broadest scale, Chapter 2 analyzes mid-summer CO2 exchange among herbaceous and woody tundra across 21 sites spanning 16\u00b0 of latitude across the Arctic and Boreal zone.  Variation in canopy temperature explained approximately half the variation in ecosystem respiration (ER), which, in turn, drives patterns of variation in net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) across ecosystems, at least during the peak of the growing season.  In addition, woody sites were slightly stronger sinks for atmospheric C; however, when soils were above 10\u00b0 C, these sites became a net source for CO2.  Meanwhile, herbaceous tundra remained a moderate C sink, regardless of soil temperature.  These results indicate that an increase in shrub abundance may result in a net loss of C in the middle of the growing season if soils temperatures also rise.  \nIdentifying the primary drivers of CO2 uptake is a vital component of ecosystem C cycling, and may elucidate key physiological differences between shrubs and graminoids that confer a competitive advantage to a particular species.  In Chapter 3, I combined leaf gas exchange with stable isotope analysis of two common arctic species, Betula nana and Poa pratensis, to reveal important difference in C uptake processes.  I found greater drought sensitivity in the graminoid species, P. pratensis, which displayed reductions in stomatal conductance and photosynthesis during periods of high atmospheric vapor pressure deficits and low soil water content.  Leaf \u039413C and \u039418O showed a negative relationship, indicating a strong stomatal influence on CO2 uptake.  In contrast, Betula displayed less sensitivity to drought, and leaf \u039413C and \u039418O were not correlated with one another for this species.  These key differences in C-H2O relations between co-existing species may confer an advantage to Betula if the climate becomes warmer and drier.\nPartitioning soil respiration (RS) into heterotrophic (RH) and autotrophic (RA) sources may provide valuable insight into the breakdown of soil organic matter (SOM) and short-term C flux from the rhizosphere.  Chapter 4 presents a multi-year analysis of soil respiration (RS) partitioning among four common vegetation types in West Greenland.  Although there were major differences in RS between vegetation types, the autotrophic proportion (RA / RS \u2248 47%) was remarkably similar among vegetation types and between seasons.  My comparative analysis suggests that RA / RS may be more conservative than what might be estimated based on global models, and that partitioning RS may be a useful diagnostic to identify ecosystems that are gaining or losing soil C.\nIn Chapter 5, I examine the effect on the seasonal C cycle at the ecosystem scale of increasing abundance of Betula nana in West Greenland.  Sites dominated by Betula were a stronger C sink than those dominated by graminoids due to higher gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) and lower ER; however, water stress may have played a role in reducing mid-season GEP for both vegetation types.  Vegetation along the transition between Betula and graminoid patches was commonly the strongest C sink, suggesting complementary in resource use.  I detected a strong early season phenological influence on net C uptake, which coincided with recent warming in the region.  A retrospective analysis revealed a net gain of 1.3 and 2.1 g C m-2 season-1 in Betula and graminoid tundra respectively, since 2002.  These results suggest GEP has responded more strongly to recent warming than ER, resulting in an extended growing season that has increased net C uptake in West Greenland and provided a negative feedback.\nMy research represents a comprehensive examination of C cycle processes across multiple scales in one of the most common types of Arctic tundra.  However, there are clear gaps in our knowledge that remain unfilled.  For instance, there may be important interactive effects between greater leaf area, litter input and changes in soil temperature associated with shrub expansion that will feedback to alter nutrient turnover and ultimately, plant productivity.  My research has identified the importance of species-specific responses to climate perturbations and the need to focus future work on expanding, contracting and stable patch edges to elucidate physiological controls on vegetation change.  The chapters presented herein represent a significant contribution to our understanding of how structural and physiological differences between woody and herbaceous species affect the magnitude of carbon-climate feedbacks in the Arctic.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11481], "author_name_tesi": "Cahoon, Sean Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Cahoon", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Sean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric S Post", "Eric S Post", "David Eissenstat", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian", "Matthew David Hurteau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric S Post, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric S Post, Committee Chair", "David Eissenstat, Committee Member", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian, Committee Member", "Matthew David Hurteau, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Arctic", "Betula nana", "climate change", "CO2 exchange", "Poa pratensis", "shrub expansion"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "SAMPLING PROPERTIES OF OPTIMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS OF SINGLE AND MULTIPLE RESPONSE SURFACE SYSTEMS", "id": "5913", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5936", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When optimizing a process using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), it is a common practice to treat the empirical models obtained through a series of designed experiments as if the models were deterministic. However, even assuming that there is no model bias, the parameter estimates of the models exhibit random variability due to sampling errors that occur throughout the course of the experimentations. Therefore, the resulting analysis based on these empirical models has to take into account the inherent sampling variability of the parameter and response estimates. This sampling variability can be assessed through confidence statements.\n\nOne of the most important confidence statements in RSM is the confidence region for the location of the optimal operating conditions of a process, since the most common objective in RSM is to find the values of the controllable factors that give rise to an optimal process performance. These confidence regions can help the analyst making more realistic assessments on the quality of the optimal point estimate and the resulting statistical inferences on the optimality conditions. Albeit the valuable information rendered by such confidence regions, RSM practitioners seldom use them. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of efficient methodologies for computing the confidence regions, particularly when the operating conditions are constrained to lie inside a given region of the controllable factor space and when multiple responses are of interest.\n\nThe objective of this dissertation is to investigate and develop efficient algorithms for computing confidence regions for the location of the optimal point in unconstrained, constrained, and multiresponse optimizations. Existing methodologies for computing the confidence regions and their limitations are reviewed. Solutions that avoid these limitations are then proposed.\n\nFor the unconstrained case, a MAPLE computer algebra program is presented that automates the construction and display of Box-Hunter confidence regions. It is shown by example that these regions can be composed of disjoint subsets, a possibility not reported previously in the literature. For the constrained case, a methodology that avoids the limitations of the Lagrange multiplier approach, an existing approach for computing the confidence regions, is proposed. The proposed approach is based on finding the set of points over a grid for which a particular hypothesis cannot be rejected. The accuracy of the method, however, is made independent of the resolution of the grid of points thanks to the several computational devices implemented in the final algorithm. Coverage rate simulations are conducted to assess the quality of the proposed and existing methodologies. A MATLAB program implements the proposed algorithm for the computation and display of constrained confidence regions. The computer implementation can find the confidence regions for any linear statistical model. Finally, the proposed methodology is extended to the multiple response case by investigating its application to the so-called desirability function approach, a popular method useful in multiple response optimization problems.

Previous studies in Drosophila, Xenopus and mammalian cell culture implicated Speckle-type POZ Protein (Spop), a E3 ubiquitin ligase component, as a potential regulator of Hh signaling by targeting Gli2 and Gli3 for ubiquitination; but the function of Spop remained largely unknown in mammals.\nIn this study, we present the genetics analysis of Spop loss-of-function mutants, and show that Spop plays an important role in bone development.  By ubiquitination of Gli3 and its repressor form (Gli3R), Spop downregulates Gli3R level and promotes Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) signaling, which stimulates both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis.  Since loss of Spop results in neonatal lethality, we conditionally deleted Spop with a limb-specific Cre, and found that these mutant mice exhibit lower bone mass, a symptom of osteoporosis and osteopenia.  Therefore, loss of Spop may be associated with genetic predisposition to osteoporosis.\nFurthermore, we showed that Spop inhibits Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling and specification of ventral-most cell fates in the spinal cord by degradation of Gli3 activator.  Since Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3 activators play redundant roles in activating Shh target genes, the negative role of Spop is only revealed in Gli2 mutant or Sufu mutant background.  Furthermore, Spop-induced degradation of Gli3 at least in part accounts for the destabilization of Gli proteins and decreased Hh target gene expression in ventral-most neural tube of Sufu mutant, suggesting a positive role of Sufu in Shh signaling by antagonizing Spop-mediated Gli3 degradation.  Therefore, our study indicates both positive and negative roles of Spop in Hh signaling by degradation of Gli3 but not Gli2, which depicts a multifaceted role of Spop that was not posited by previous in vitro studies.\nFinally, we present in vivo evidence that Spop-like (Spopl), a poorly-studied homolog of Spop, does not play a redundant role with Spop in bone development or spinal cord patterning.  The function and substrate of Spopl remains an interesting question to be addressed in the future.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14174], "author_name_tesi": "Cai, Hongchen ", "last_name_ssi": "Cai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hongchen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aimin Liu", "Aimin Liu", "Douglas Cavener", "Yingwei Mao", "Andrea Mastro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aimin Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Aimin Liu, Committee Chair", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Yingwei Mao, Committee Member", "Andrea Mastro, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ubiquitination", "Gli3", "Skeletal development", "osteoporosis", "spinal cord patterning"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE THERMOELECTRIC PROPERTIES OF STRONGLY\nCORRELATED SYSTEMS", "id": "8948", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3263", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Strongly correlated systems are among the most interesting and complicated sys-\ntems in physics.

We have found the relationship between minimum electric field required for streamer initiation and  the particle radius. The larger the radius, the lower electric field required. Furthermore, we consider the model of two particles with different radii for streamer initiation including the process of photoionization feedback, which could initially produce photons and then trigger a secondary electron avalanche to reduce the threshold electric field required for streamer initiation. The relationship between radii of particles for successful streamer initiation in the gap is investigated. We also demonstrate that for realistic particle dimensions, the avalanche to streamer transition is possible in a local electric field just slightly above the minimum field required for propagation of positive streamers in air.\n\nConsidering that the connection of two spheres would lead to increase of the electric field at the outer periphery, and outside space represents a larger volume available for the photoionization feedback in comparison with the relatively small gap between two spheres, the second model of two spherical particles connected with a discharge channel is investigated. We also investigate the relationship of the radii of these two particles for streamer initiation on the outside periphery. Furthermore, we estimated the frequency of streamer initiation using three realistic hydrometeor size model distributions available in the literature and found that the scenario of streamer initiation on the outside periphery is only possible for relatively high electric fields, which are close to half of the breakdown electric field, at typical thundercloud altitudes of 3 and 6 km.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16661], "author_name_tesi": "Cai, Qiheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Cai", "first_name_ssi": "Qiheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor P.

To mimic this process, we synthesized artificial cell surface receptors that comprise N-alkyl derivatives of 3beta-cholesterylamine linked to ligand binding\nmotifs. These synthetic receptors enable the uptake of proteins and other cellimpermeable\nmolecules, a strategy termed \u201csynthetic receptor targeting\u201d. To improve the efficiency of synthetic receptors and extend their utility as molecular probes, tools for drug delivery, and agents for cellular targeting, we report here\nstudies of structure-activity relationships (SAR). Receptors with different linkers between 3beta-cholesterylamine and a ligand binding motif were designed, synthesized, and evaluated. It was found that installation of glutamic acid\nsubunits in the linker region of synthetic receptors greatly enhances their cellular\nactivities. Receptors with glutamic acids associate with plasma membrane of living mammalian cells much faster and to a greater extent and can deliver more ligands compared to receptors lacking these subunits.\n    Although synthetic receptors can promote the internalization of many cell impermeable bioactive molecules, trapping of this cargo in endosomes is a major limitation for many applications. This limitation is also commonly observed with many other endocytic delivery systems. To circumvent this issue, we synthesized\ntwo different 3beta-cholesterylamine derivatives: one was linked to a pH-dependent membrane-lytic dodecapeptide, and the second comprised a disulfide-linked fluorophore coupled through glutamic acid subunits. When added to living cells, membranes of early / recycling endosomes were selectively disrupted, resulting in cleavage of the disulfide and release of the fluorophore into the cytosol and nucleus. The ability of this system to deliver cargo into and release disulfidelinked cargo from relatively nonhydrolytic early / recycling endosomes may be\nuseful for the delivery of a variety of sensitive molecules to diverse intracellular\ntargets.\n    We also studied the feasibility of using small artificial cell surface receptors as a generic drug delivery system. The studies showed that a synthetic receptor comprising 3beta-cholesterylamine linked to the antibiotic vancomycin and bearing two glutamic acid residues in the linker region significantly enhanced the uptake of a fluorophore linked to a L-Lys-D-Phe-D-Ala tripeptide.

In this dissertation, I present low-temperature magnetoresistance oscillation measurements on micron-sized, doubly connected cylinders of Sr2RuO4 to explore the free energy modulation of the half-flux quantum state, inspired by the Little-Parks experiment, following a similar path taken in the original experiments for the establishment of fluoxid quantization. \n\nWe fabricated transport devices of micron-sized superconducting cylinders of Sr2RuO4 on mechanically exfoliated single crystals. We carried out magnetoresistance oscillation measurements over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields for various samples. Magnetoresistance oscillations with an unexpected large amplitude were observed, suggesting a vortex-crossing origin of the magnetoresistance oscillations rather than a conventional Little-Parks effect. In thin-wall cylinders of Sr2RuO4, a large number of pronounced quantum oscillations with a conventional period of the full-flux-quantum were found. For cylinders with a thick wall, two distinct periods of oscillations were found in high- and low-field regimes, respectively, providing insight into the unconventional vortex physics in Sr2RuO4. No evidence for half-flux-quantum resistance oscillations were identified in any sample measured without the presence of an in-plane field. \n\nWe demonstrated the tunability of the free energy of the superconducting Sr2RuO4 cylinders using various parameters, including an in-plane magnetic field, the measurement current, and structural factors. Distinct dips on magnetoresistance peaks were found, which we argue to be related to the emergence of the half-flux-quantum state, but only in cylinders possessing structural constrictions, providing insights into the stability of this complex topological object.

The Cox proportional hazard model is commonly used in this context. To have a parsimonious model without losing consistency in\nestimation, several authors have extended the variable selection techniques of Fan and Li (2001) to survival settings. For example, the variable selection problem for the Cox model is studied in Fan and Li (2002). Recently, survival models like the Cox model are also extended to apply to dynamic network data (Vu et al., 2011b; Perry and Wolfe, 2013), where the observations are dependent. In this dissertation, we study the variable selection problem for a survival model other than the Cox model. In addition, we extend the variable selection work to the dynamic network model setting.\n\nWe \ufb01rst discuss the problem of variable selection for the proportional odds model, an alternative to Cox\u2019s model, and show how to maximize the penalized pro\ufb01le likelihood to estimate parameters and select variables simultaneously. Using a novel application of the semi-parametric theory developed by Murphy and Van der Vaart (2000), we derive asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators, including consistency results and the oracle property. In addition, we propose algorithms to maximize the penalized likelihood estimator based on a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm. Tests on simulated and real data sets demonstrate that the newly\nproposed algorithm performs well in practice.\n\nNext, we extend the penalization idea to the Cox model in an egocentric approach to dynamic networks, and select covariates by maximizing the penalized partial likelihood function. Asymptotic properties of both the unpenalized and penalized partial likelihood estimates are developed under certain regularity conditions. We also implement the estimation and test the prediction performance of these estimates in a citation network. Since the covariates are time-varying, the computation cost is high. After variable selection, the model is reduced, which simplifies the calculation for future predictions. Another method to reduce the computational complexity is to use the case-control approximation, in which instead of using all the at-risk nodes in the network, only a subset is sampled to evaluate the partial likelihood function. By using this approximation, the computation time is shortened dramatically, while the prediction performance is still satisfactory in the citation network.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10024], "author_name_tesi": "Cai, Xizhen ", "last_name_ssi": "Cai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xizhen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Russell Hunter", "Runze Li", "Debashis Ghosh", "Marcel Salathe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Russell Hunter, Dissertation Advisor", "Runze Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Member", "Marcel Salathe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["penalized likelihood", "proportional odds models", "profile likelihood", "partial likelihood", "case control."]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Contested Space, Conflicting Desires: \"Becoming\" \"Girls\" in Urbanizing Rural China\n\n", "id": "11036", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6738", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Drawing from the poststructuralist perspective of subjectivity and discourse, this ethnographic project traces the construction of \u201cgirlhood\u201d within various contested discourses in a changing Chinese rural locality.

Shale gas and tight gas provides over half of the natural gas production in the United States. Linear flow is the most common flow type in tight and shale gas reservoirs. A density-based analytical approach was proposed by Vardcharragosad and Ayala (2014) that could predict well production performance in the linear flow regime. However, this approach requires reservoir and fluid properties for the prediction. As matter of fact, most of these reservoir properties are unknown and undetermined. The thrust of this study is to predict the long-term (Boundary-dominated period) well production behavior with the reservoir properties as inputs through an updated density-based approach.\nThe BDF model proposed in this study is based on Vardcharragosad and Ayala\u2019s density-based approach (2015).  A novel and key task for the BDF production prediction is the utilization of historical production data, which is often termed as Production Data Analysis (PDA). A PDA technique is used to estimate the characterization ratio, which is applied to replace reservoir properties in the prediction model. In addition, transition time needs to be determined to estimate reservoir size because it determines the starting point of the boundary-dominated flow. By using the estimated characterization ratio and the transition time, the novel density-based approach could be re-constructed without inputting specific reservoir properties. The proposed model was initially validated with numerical simulation results.\nThis thesis presents a method to predict boundary-dominated flow behavior in tight and shale gas reservoirs without the knowledge of reservoir properties. The proposed transition time determination approach shows advantages over traditional end of half slope method. Thus, original gas in place can be directly calculated from results of transition time determination and early data analysis more accurately. Also, cost of techniques on determining reservoir properties such as well logging could be reduced. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14937], "author_name_tesi": "Cai, Yuzhe ", "last_name_ssi": "Cai", "first_name_ssi": "Yuzhe", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luis F.

Structuring scientific inquiry as investigation to develop explanations presents meaningful context for the enhancement of inquiry abilities and understanding of the science content. The context of the study was a teaching and learning course focused on inquiry and technology. Twelve prospective science teachers participated in this study. \nMultiple data sources included pre- and post-module questionnaires of participants\u2019 view of scientific inquiry, pre-posttests of understandings of Mendelian concepts, inquiry project reports, class presentations, process videotapes of participants interacting with the simulation, and semi-structured interviews. Seven selected prospective science teachers participated in in-depth interviews.\nFindings suggest that while studying important concepts in science, carefully designed inquiry experiences can help prospective science teachers to develop an understanding about the types of questions scientists in that field ask, the methodological and epistemological issues that constrain their pursuit of answers to those questions, and the ways in which they construct and share their explanations. Key findings included prospective teachers\u2019 initial limited abilities to create evidence-based arguments, their hesitancy to include inquiry in their future teaching, and the impact of collaboration on thinking. Prior to this experience the prospective teachers held uninformed views of scientific inquiry. After the module, participants demonstrated extended expertise in their understandings of following aspects of scientific inquiry: a) the iterative nature of scientific inquiry; b) the tentativeness of specific knowledge claims; c) the degree to which scientists rely on empirical data, as well as broader conceptual and metaphysical commitments, to assess models and to direct future inquiries; d) the need for conceptual consistency; e) multiple methods of investigations and multiple interpretations of data; and f) social and cultural aspects of scientific inquiry. This research provided evidence that hypothesis testing can support the integrated acquisition of conceptual and procedural knowledge in science. Participants\u2019 conceptual elaborations of Mendelian inheritance were enhanced. There were qualitative changes in the nature of the participants\u2019 explanations. Moreover, the average percentage of correct responses improved from 39% on the pretest to 67% on the posttest.

Seismic data used in this study were collected by theUnited States Geological Survey (USGS).  Nearby stations were paired to calculate soft-soil to rock (or stiff-soil) relative amplifications for various aftershocks.  Selected aftershocks were used to estimate the soil amplifications and to test a new application of slowness-frequency imaging for determining spectral amplifications over the entire signal to assess site effects on observed ground motions. Soft-soil ground motions are found to exceed those at nearby rock or stiff-soil sites by factors of three or more in some cases for frequencies below approximately 12 Hz, but are significantly less than rock sites for frequencies above about 15 Hz, likely due to low Q (high attenuation) in the soil column.\n\nWhen site-specific velocity structure information is available (e.g. from receiver-function estimates, geophysical surveys, borehole measurements) the site amplification effects can be modeled for comparison to the observed amplifications. Modeling results comparing non-linear behavior for nearby large earthquakes to linear behavior for small earthquakes shows that relative amplifications for small events gives an upper bound for large events.

Polymers have the advantage over volatile organic liquid electrolytes with respect to their superior mechanical properties and electrochemical stability. Before polymer electrolytes can take the place of their liquid counterparts, limitations involving ion transport must be addressed. The room temperature ionic conductivity of solid polymer electrolytes, 10-5 S/cm or lower, is below the industry set goal of 10-3 S/cm, despite decades of research. This dissertation provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ion transport in polymer electrolytes and their relations to the polymer host matrix. By taking advantage of these transport mechanisms, new polymer electrolytes can be designed to meet the growing demand for safe portable energy.\nIonomers are a particular class of polymer electrolytes, where one of the ionic species is bound to the polymer backbone. Binding the anion to the polymer backbone reduces the formation of anionic concentration gradients and increases the cationic transference number, both desired properties for electrolytes used in batteries. The ionomer in this work was selected because of the availability of experimental and simulation data, as well as previous research indicating its potential to decouple the mechanical properties of the polymer from ion transport. The decoupling of these properties enables the development of a dendrite suppressing electrolyte. By suppressing dendrites, alkali metal can be used as an anode, resulting in increased volumetric and gravimetric energy density. The underlying mechanism which enables this decoupling is not well understood in literature, but is postulated to involve ion aggregates.\nThis dissertation explores the relationships between ion aggregation, ion transport, and mechanical properties in ionomers. Ion aggregation is controlled by varying the concentration of ions using two approaches. The low ion content systems are studied by increasing the fraction of functionalized isophthalate groups along the ionomer chain. The high ion content systems are studied by reducing the number of poly(ethylene oxide) monomers between isophthalate groups. Temperature was varied as a third parameter to construct a more complete description of ion aggregation and transport.\nThis work shows that ion transport is accurately described by jump diffusion, which involves discreet jumps between coordination sites of oxygen atoms. This model is then further decomposed into three main categories; ion transport through poly(ethylene oxide), ion aggregates, or the interface between poly(ethylene oxide) and ion aggregates. At low ion content, the majority of ion transport is through the poly(ethylene oxide) backbone. As ion content is increased, the formation of ion aggregates provides channels through which ions jump without directly interacting with poly(ethylene oxide). The transition from a poly(ethylene oxide) dominate transport to ion aggregate dominate transport explains the observed experimental relationship of conductivity and ion content.\nPercolation theory is used as a foundation to describe ion aggregation below the aggregate percolation threshold. A model is developed which reproduces the distribution of ion aggregate sizes and is shown to be applicable across a wide range of ion content and temperature. This new framework for describing ion aggregation has the potential to be expanded to cover a larger range of electrolytes.\nFinally, a series of uniaxial stress-strain simulations demonstrate the impact of ion aggregation on mechanical properties. These results are then used to construct a time-temperature-ion content master curve which provides an estimate of the ion content necessary for dendrite suppression.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15360], "author_name_tesi": "Caldwell, David Wesley", "last_name_ssi": "Caldwell", "middle_name_ssi": "Wesley", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janna K.

That is, students who report that their parents deem it appropriate for them consume more drinks on a given night report consuming a greater number of drinks, engaging in binge drinking more frequently, and experiencing a greater number of negative consequences of alcohol use.  However, few studies have assessed permissibility as an outcome, measured permissibility on more than one occasion, or focused on the later college years.  Data from 687 college students in a large university in the Northeast United States were used to assess whether perceived parental permissibility of alcohol use changed across college and whether permissibility predicted binge drinking frequency, peak drinking, and negative consequences of alcohol use.  Results showed permissibility increased across college, and that the rate of change was faster for males than females.  Generalized linear mixed models showed that between-person differences in mean permissibility were linked with all three drinking outcomes across college, such that individuals who reported higher mean permissibility also reported more frequent binge drinking occasions, higher levels of peak drinking, and more negative consequences of alcohol use.  However, within-person differences in permissibility across years of college were only associated with peak drinking, such that in years when students reported higher permissibility they also reported higher peak drinking levels.  The greater prevalence of between-person findings suggested the need for an approach focused on different profiles or groups of permissibility change across college.  Four clusters of differential patterns of permissibility change were then identified using k-means cluster analysis: a low permissibility cluster, whose permissibility was consistently low; an age 21 permissibility cluster, whose permissibility rose sharply upon nearing the minimum legal drinking age of 21 years of age, a college permissibility cluster, whose permissibility rose sharply upon matriculating to college, and a high permissibility cluster, whose permissibility was consistently high. Membership in these clusters predicted binge drinking frequency and peak drinking, such that students in the low permissibility cluster reported fewer binge drinking occasions and fewer drinks consumed on their heaviest drinking occasions in comparison to each of the other three clusters.  The results suggest that aspects of the parent-child relationship are linked with the risk behaviors their late adolescent children engage in during college.

The maturity of apple fruit at harvest is a factor that significantly impacts quality and storage. An early or late picked apple is more sensitive to physiological disorders and has shorter storage life than fruit harvested at the proper maturity time. To determine the harvest time, many physical, biochemical, and physiological properties have been assessed by destructive and nondestructive methods. However, no study on the measurement of thermal properties, which are a set of physical properties to predict the apple harvest time has been reported in the literature. Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure thermal properties, i.e., thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and specific heat, of \u2018Gala\u2019 apple cultivar from the Fruit Research and Extension Center, Biglerville, PA during the 2017 growing season using the dual needle heated probe (DNHP), which is simple, rapid, and portable method. \nThe measured weekly average of thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and specific heat values of apple samples during the growing season in the laboratory (18-23\u00b0C) were between 0.441 \u00b1 0.015 and 0.445 \u00b1 0.014 W/m-K, 0.137 \u00b1 0.004 and 0.152 \u00b1 0.006 mm2/s, and 3.93 \u00b1 0.20 and 4.23 \u00b1 0.25 kJ/kg-K, respectively, with mean temperature of apple from 19.1 to 22.6\u00b0C. Average thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity values of apple decreased significantly as apple ripened (p < 0.05) while specific heat values did not change significantly (p > 0.05) during the growing season. Overall, the most noticeable changes in thermal conductivity occurred during the last two weeks of the growing season, which corresponds to the time when major biochemical changes are known to occur. \nSubsequently, the apple\u2019s thermal property changes during the growing season were examined for their prospective relationships with physical properties (size, density, and moisture content) and harvest fruit quality and maturity indices (firmness, soluble solid content, starch index, and Streif Index). Based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) among thermal properties and the physical properties and the harvest fruit quality and maturity indices, thermal conductivity had moderate correlation with thermal diffusivity (0.44), moisture content (0.45), firmness (0.44), soluble solid content (-0.62), starch index (-0.53), flesh stain % (0.44), and Streif Index (0.46) during the growing season. Hence, thermal conductivity can detect the quality changes during the growing season and determine the harvest time of apple but not as the sole predictor. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16511], "author_name_tesi": "Caliskan Aydogan, Oznur ", "last_name_ssi": "Caliskan Aydogan", "first_name_ssi": "Oznur", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Virendra M.

More precisely, the framework has two decision layers. At the top level a tactical processing plan is designed. This is accomplished by means of a nonlinear optimal control formulation, along with suitable solution algorithms, to compute on a rolling-horizon basis a tactical processing plan which yields the lowest cost expected-value inventory trajectory. In doing so, raw materials, inventory and demand mismatching costs are considered. As the main outcome, a target inventory trajectory is obtained for each inventory bu\u000ber in the network at all times within a rolling planning time window. The bottom layer in turn deals with\na distributed scheduling framework to best track the inventory targets generated by the tactical processing plan.

A growing body of research on consumer choice in healthcare has identified factors that influence plan choice including the impact of ever-increasing amounts of quality information. The literature has also raised serious questions about consumers\u2019 capacity to manage the amount and complexity of plan information available to them in the marketplace. Many of these questions have yet to be explored fully. There is a gap in the literature on how consumers move through the process of gathering, assimilating and using information to choose a health plan. Understanding this process is critical for crafting effective information presentation and dissemination approaches. \n\tThis dissertation is comprised of three studies each employing a different methodological approach to elucidate the consumer decision making process. The first study used a case-study approach to explore community level factors that support information gathering and decision making. Key informants in three rural communities were interviewed about information resources, dissemination approaches, and consumers\u2019 information awareness. The second study evaluated the scholarly literature from several research perspectives to suggest factors that might be used to measure the influence of community variables on health plan decisions. The third study modeled these factors to determine their influence on health plan choice. This is the first study to empirically test the relationship between community context variables and health plan choice.\n\tIn the community case studies key informants in three rural communities were interviewed about information resources, dissemination approaches, and consumers\u2019 information awareness. The result of these studies was a general consensus that consumers lack the knowledge necessary to make a fully informed choice. While a variety of approaches to meeting information needs have been adopted in the three communities, none of the interviewees felt that consumers\u2019 information needs were consistently and adequately met.  The case studies helped identify community level factors that support information gathering and comprehension for consumers. The conclusion from the first study was that community context does play a role in helping consumers gather, interpret and understand complex information in order to make a health plan choice. Policy implications include the need to undertake broad public information efforts if the expectation that consumers can make truly informed health decisions is to be met. \n\tThe second study examined the research on decision-making, information-seeking and social networks to synthesize the research and suggest a research agenda for examining the effect of community context on health plan choice. PubMed, Medline and PsychINFO databases were searched for articles on decision-making, information seeking and social network effects. The literature makes clear that there is a fundamental tension between the amount and type of information consumers say they want and what they can effectively comprehend. Several of the factors that consumers say would be helpful to them are complicated and difficult to present and interpret. Effectively communicating the information mandated by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) and the Medicare Improvement and Modernization Act (MMA) to Medicare beneficiaries without overwhelming them continues to be a significant challenge. In addition, the development of national, regional and disease-specific benchmarks has added complexity without improving comprehension.\n\tThe literature also makes clear that some consumers have more difficulty than others in managing the complexity of information in the decision making process. They may prefer to count on the assistance of their doctor or may rely on family members, friends, employers or others to make the plan choice for them. It is also important to note that many of these information agents face the same challenges as the consumers they are trying to assist. Policy implications from the second study include the need to further refine public reporting of health plan information to enable consumers at a variety of literacy levels to access and understand the information. Further, technology enables disease-specific reporting across providers and plans; however, consensus is necessary to develop consistent measures to foster consumer comparisons. Finally, public programs should evaluate the distribution channels currently used to disseminate health plan information and consider approaches that target both the consumer and those who serve as information resources for the consumer.\n\tThe third study examined the effect of adding community context variables to an established model of health plan choice. Data from a survey of 1,200 rural Pennsylvania residents were used to develop models of plan choice and the probability of changing plan type. Estimates were derived using binary logistic regression. Separate models were estimated for plan change using rare event logit techniques. Adding community context variables significantly improves the predictive power of both choice models and plan change. Individuals in poorer health have a strong preference for Fee For Service (FFS) models. Those who have a household member who requires frequent care have a strong preference for FFS plans. Consumers are sensitive to restrictions on provider choice, specifically restrictions on physicians and hospitals. These results suggest that adding community context variables to models of plan choice would improve our understanding of consumers\u2019 plan choices. \n\tThe increasing health care related burden on public budgets is unsustainable. States are experimenting with a number of models to lessen the financial impact of health care expenditures on their budgets while increasing access to basic health care. If public plans and employers are going to use managed care models to contain costs and improve the care of individuals with chronic health needs then a broad information campaign to educate consumers about the prevention and chronic care management benefits of managed care models will need to be undertaken.\nThis dissertation contributes to the literature by increasing our understanding of the decision making process used by consumers in increasingly complex healthcare environments. As policy and market changes increase demands on consumers to effectively negotiate the health plan decision making process, the supply of effective information sources and dissemination efforts must keep pace. Because the implications of failure for personal and community health and individual and collective wealth are so great, the onus of creating a truly informed consumer is shared by consumers, providers and policy makers. The challenge for health plans, consumer advocates and policy-makers is to develop and implement effective communication efforts and disseminate them through the distribution channels that consumers use as information resources for health care related decisions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1204], "author_name_tesi": "Calkins, Christopher Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Calkins", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph J Vasey", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "Michael R Meacham", "Mona M Counts"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph J Vasey, Committee Chair", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Member", "Michael R Meacham, Committee Member", "Mona M Counts, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["consumer choice", "decision making", "health plan choice", "social networking", "information seeking"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONALIZED BIOINSPIRED MICROSTRUCTURED OPTICAL FIBER PORES\nFOR APPLICATIONS IN CHEMICAL VAPOR SENSING\n", "id": "11669", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2497", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chemical vapor sensing for defense, homeland security, environmental, and agricultural\napplication is a challenge, which due combined requirements of ppt sensitivity, high\nselectivity, and rapid response, cannot be met using conventional analytical chemistry\ntechniques.

Using alkanethiol SAMs deposited on gold wires, light scattering was\ndemonstrated to be able to detect films as thin as 1.5 nm, and able to distinguish between a\ndecanethiol (1.5 nm) and an octadecanethiol SAM (2.7 mn). The high sensitivity of light\nscattering will allow it to characterize SAMs and thin films on the inner surfaces of MOF\npores.\nWGR and light scattering provide the analytical tools that will allow for the further\ndevelopment of organic SAMs and thin films within MOF pores for analyte selectivity and\nchromatographic separations.

However, substantial voltage losses in system performance have been attributed to the inclusion of a membrane. It is shown here that high hydrogen recoveries and production rates are possible without the presence of a membrane. Performance of an MEC lacking a membrane was investigated in batch operation at various applied voltages (0.2 V < Eap < 0.8 V) using a mixed culture and acetate as a substrate at two different solution conductivities (7.5 and 20 mS/cm).

Four-point bend tests of single-edge notched beam (SENB) and rectangular beam specimens generally conform to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards for fracture toughness and flexural (tensile) strength tests of ceramic materials. I obtained elastic modulus values from the stress-strain curves generated by the tensile strength experiments. I indented select rectangular beam specimens with a 2mm Tungsten carbide ball indenter and analyzed them with an optical profilometer to calculate the Brinell hardness number (BHN). In addition to the Marcellus shale, I tested other lithologies from the Middle Devonian section (i.e., sandstone and limestone) to determine the effect of rock type on geomechanical properties. Lastly, I used X-ray diffraction (XRD) and total organic carbon (TOC) analyses to examine the influence of mineralogy and organic content on the geomechanical properties. \nQuartz-rich sandstones of the Mahantango Formation have the highest fracture toughness while clay and organic-rich black shales of the Marcellus Fm. have the lowest fracture toughness.

I observed considerable variation in geomechanical properties on a parasequence scale throughout the Union Springs mbr. of the Marcellus Fm., as well as a second-order brittle-ductile couplet. Finally, the calculated BHN values for the Marcellus shale are much higher than those encountered in the literature, likely due to the size of the ball indenter and applied load used in this study. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7797], "author_name_tesi": "Call, Travis T", "last_name_ssi": "Call", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Travis", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Terry Engelder", "Dr Rudy Slingerland", "Chris J Marone"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Terry Engelder, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Rudy Slingerland, Thesis Advisor", "Chris J Marone, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["geomechanical properties", "fracture toughness", "tensile strength", "elastic modulus", "Brinell hardness", "Marcellus shale"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Culturally diverse cohorts: The exploration of learning in context and community", "id": "13802", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7222", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores the experiences of culturally diverse interactions and learning in adult cohorts.

The widespread implementation of electrolyzers and solar-driven water-splitting systems is underpinned by the development of the individual components that comprise these systems, which must be efficient, robust and scalable. Among these components, highly active electrocatalysts are required to carry out the water-splitting half-reactions, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Electrocatalysts based on noble metals such as Pt and Ir, are capable of carrying out the HER and OER at low overpotentials, however their high cost and scarcity has motivated the discovery and development of robust, efficient, and Earth-abundant alternatives. \nTransition metal phosphides have recently been identified as a promising family of Earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the HER, and are capable of operating with low overpotentials at operationally relevant current densities while exhibiting stability under strongly acidic conditions. In this dissertation, I highlight the progress that has been made in this field and provide insights into the synthesis, characterization and electrochemical behavior of transition metal phosphides as HER electrocatalysts. I describe that iron phosphide (FeP), synthesized as nanoparticles having a uniform, hollow morphology, exhibits among the highest HER activities reported to date in both acidic and neutral-pH aqueous solutions. Additionally, under UV illumination in both acidic and neutral-pH solutions, FeP nanoparticles supported on TiO2 are able to sustain photcatalytic H2 production over several hours. I also discuss the synthesis, characterization and electrochemical performance of cobalt phosphide (Co2P) nanoparticles having a hollow, multifaceted, crystalline morphology as another highly active Earth-abundant HER catalyst material. Importantly, the Co2P nanoparticles are morphologically equivalent to previously reported CoP nanoparticle HER catalysts, allowing a direct side-by-side evaluation of their HER activities. Such comparisons of different metal phosphide HER catalysts with the same constituent elements and morphologies are important for identifying the key materials characteristics that lead to high activity.\nUnlike the various metal phosphide catalysts available for the HER, OER electrocatalysts that facilitate sustained oxygen production at device-relevant current densities in strongly acidic electrolytes have been limited almost exclusively to precious metal oxides. I demonstrate that nanostructured films of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, function as active electrocatalysts for the OER in highly acidic conditions. The Co3O4/FTO electrodes evolve oxygen with near-quantitative Faradaic yields and maintain operationally relevant current densities for over 12 h at a moderate overpotentials, making it one of the few Earth-abundant electrocatalytic systems capable of sustained oxygen evolution in acidic conditions.

Their designs are inspired by nature: birds have evolved to fly and maneuver at varying speeds, from hovering to high speed flight, while remaining agile, precise, and efficient. Part of their abilities stem from asymmetric wing morphing throughout their flapping cycles. This asymmetry can manifest as flexibility of the wing structure in one direction during part of the flapping cycle, then inflexibility in the opposing direction during another part of the flapping cycle. In some avian gaits, such as the steady level Continuous Vortex Gait, the nonlinear stiffness is primarily located at discrete joints, similar to human elbows and wrists. It is hypothesized that the flight performance of an avian scale ornithopter can be improved by introducing compliant joints with nonlinear stiffness at specific spatial locations, emulating the wing gait found in nature. The overall goal of this research is to develop optimization methodologies for modifying a stiff structure, specifically a wing structure, by means of discrete compliant mechanisms to allow desired passive shape change, i.e., without the assistance of active components, such as motors and actuators, or a control system.\nContact-aided compliant mechanisms (CCMs) are mechanisms that allow large localized deformations, typically in thin and/or flexible members, and are designed to come in contact with themselves. Self-contact causes a strong nonlinearity in the stiffness of CCMs. Inserting CCMs in the wing structure of an ornithopter passively introduces asymmetry throughout the flapping cycle, therefore inducing passive shape change. In this work, a dual optimization approach is developed to determine the optimal configuration of flexible compliant joints in a dynamic ornithopter wing structure to increase free flight pitch agility, then to design and optimize a CCM that realizes the optimal configuration. First, a three degree-of-freedom CCM called the Bend-Twist-and-Sweep Compliant Mechanism (BTSCM) is presented, and its design parameters are optimized to maximize flexibility while minimizing peak stress and mass. A large set of optimal designs called the Aggregated Pareto-Optimal Front is solved for using an enhanced multi-objective genetic algorithm. This set of optimal designs can be used by a designer to select a configuration which allows desirable flexibility within chosen constraints. However, several assumptions are made about the boundary conditions in the finite element model, such as quasi-static loading to estimate resultant aerodynamic lift and drag loads. Furthermore, a designer may not know the desired flexibility or spatial distribution of CCMs in a dynamic structure.\nThe Dynamic Spar Numerical Model (DSNM) is a computationally efficient numerical rigid-body dynamics model that models CCMs in the wing structure as compliant joints: spherical joints with distributed mass and three-axis nonlinear torsional spring-dampers. First, the model is developed, then the model is validated using a bench top experiment with high speed motion tracking cameras. Model parameters are tuned using a genetic algorithm to minimize the error between the model and the experiment. Finally, the DSNM is used as an optimization tool to determine the optimal spatial location and stiffness to induce desirable wing morphing that increases free flight pitch agility. The results of the optimization provide the desired stiffness and coupling of the CCM, as well as the optimal spatial location.\nA new CCM called the Forward-Swept Compliant Mechanism (FSCM) is optimized to induce forward sweep at the wing tip during the ornithopter\u2019s downstroke, thereby increasing its pitch agility. An optimal design was chosen for fabrication and flown in free flight. Motion tracking cameras tracked the wing kinematics of the ornithopter with the FSCM inserted in the spar structure of the ornithopter with an equivalent mass inserted in the same location as the FSCM. The experimental kinematic data shows that the FSCM induces the desired forward sweep and therefore increases the pitch agility.\nFinally, a finite element model of CCMs in the dynamic flapping wing structure is developed and validated using the benchtop test data. The DSNM and dynamic finite element model with the FSCM inserted are used to determine the sensitivity of the wing morphing to changes in the design parameters. Then, they are compared to the optimization results to show which variables are the most important and which are the most sensitive to changes in the variables. The numerical dynamics and finite element models can be extended in the future to include aerodynamic loading and body motion incurred during free flight.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15670], "author_name_tesi": "Calogero, Joseph Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Calogero", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker", "Mary I Frecker", "Henry Joseph Sommer III", "Bo Cheng", "Reginald Felix Hamilton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Chair", "Henry Joseph Sommer III, Committee Member", "Bo Cheng, Committee Member", "Reginald Felix Hamilton, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["compliant mechanism", "numerical dynamics", "finite element analysis", "design optimization", "ornithopter", "motion tracking camera"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Phase Field Modeling and Verification of a Wetting Model for Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Surfaces", "id": "28788", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12451", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Wetting properties of surfaces are of interest due to their potential applications in many fields.

My main argument is that Richard Nixon\u2019s presidential rhetoric was metonymic of the changes mainstream (white) American masculinity was undergoing during this period of U.S. history. By studying Nixon\u2019s presidential discourse, we can see the rhetorical resources on which he\u2014and by extension, the average, white American man\u2014relied to maintain a status of dominance in a changing social landscape. The Apollo 13 crisis, tensions between Vietnam veterans and Black and student protestors, and the Watergate affair cracked the hard shell of hegemonic masculinity; Nixon\u2019s rhetoric shows how mainstream men attempted to repair those cracks. Studying the Nixon presidency and its crises illuminates a timely historical and rhetorical antecedent for the state of the U.S. presidency in 2017.

Numerous distinguished scholars have shaped their entire career around the study of the United States presidency.  Many other well-respected scholars of rhetoric focus their studies on the analysis of film.  Both these areas of study have enriched rhetorical scholarship over the decades.  Rarely, however, have studies of fictional film and studies of the historical U.S. president met.  This is the intervention of this thesis.  This thesis provides an in-depth examination of this phenomenon through an analysis of twelve feature-length fictional films.  The project seeks to uncover the ways these fictional films portray the historical U.S. presidency, aided by the interactions of narrative and phantasia.  \n     After laying the preliminary theoretical background and structure of the thesis in chapter one, chapter two investigates the historical and contemporary presence of the U.S. president in popular culture, as well as the ways the president often becomes popular culture through various media portrayals.  Chapter three of this thesis analyzes ten fictional films that feature historical U.S. presidents as characters, such as Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay.  The analysis follows two emergent criteria for analysis, exploring (1) phantasia-influenced portrayals of access to the president and (2) Walter Fisher\u2019s narrative rationality and the creation of \u201crealistic\u201d presidential interactions in the films.  I argue that these ten films bend or break either narrative fidelity or rationality in a way that disrupts what viewers believe makes sense or know to be true.  This gap created\u2014between reality and the images brought \u201cbefore the eyes\u201d onscreen\u2014creates space for viewers to use phantasia to \u201csee\u201d the U.S. president and presidency engaged in non-historically sound actions.  The fourth chapter in this thesis presents a detailed examination of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and FDR: American Badass!.  Here I argue that these two films represent the entelechy of the historical-president-as-character in fictional film.  These two films push the boundaries of how far the historical-president-as-character in fictional film can go and demonstrate the limits of phantasia in truly altering viewer understandings of the presidency and its interactions with popular culture.  \n     This project ultimately demonstrates three things:  First, although the phenomenon of including the historical president as a character in fictional film outwardly appears to be reaching exceptional new levels, representations of the historical president in fiction tend to be remarkably conservative, reifying audience preconceptions of presidents like Abraham Lincoln.  Second, considering the rhetorical concepts of narrative and phantasia as symbiotic facilitates an enriched understanding of each.  Third, traditional boundaries protecting the president from the low-taste elements of the entertainment industry have deteriorated, creating the presidency as an extra \u201chook\u201d for Hollywood films and ultimately opening the door for the president to become personally involved in fictional acting endeavors.  By appropriating the historical president as a character, fictional films collapse the metaphorical distance between the president and the people.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9514], "author_name_tesi": "Camacci, Lauren Rose", "last_name_ssi": "Camacci", "middle_name_ssi": "Rose", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kirtley Hasketh Wilson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kirtley Hasketh Wilson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["U.S. presidents", "film", "popular culture", "narrative", "phantasia", "rhetoric"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "MODELING ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FOR FARM SCALE PRODUCTION\n", "id": "9925", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2045", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The increasing demand for renewable sources of energy has triggered many researchers to search for new alternative fuels derived from agricultural systems.

After comparing light interception in various simulation models, a new simple light interception method was created, allowing for the simulation of canopies with more than two species of different height and leaf architecture.

Parents who accept children with disrupted attachment into their families need to know about evidence-based ways that they can learn to help those children feel part of their new family and to develop lasting bonds of attachment to one another.  Parent psychoeducation and its accompanying filial therapy skills for use by adoptive families were the focus of this qualitative study, which sought to understand the lived experiences of parents of adopted children who have turned to this method to help their child.  The study looked at how the parents came to their decision to adopt, how they realized that they needed help with their child, their experiences learning how to do special play time with their child, the meaning they attributed to being their child\u2019s therapist, and what types of learning they experienced.\n\tThe five families who participated in the study were varied in terms of family composition, adoption circumstances of the child, and racial/ethnic diversity.  Two of the families were married couples, one was a same sex couple, one a single parent, and one a grandmother.  Two of the children were adopted as infants from Guatemala, two of the children came from the United States foster care system, and the final child was at risk for going into the system were it not for her grandmother\u2019s willingness to provide kinship care.  All of the children had experienced disruption from a primary attachment relationship prior to being adopted. \n\tFive major themes in the findings were identified in the responses from the eight adults: 1) the desire to be a parent but not necessarily through childbirth; 2) the decision to seek help through learning new skills in parenting due to escalating concern they did not have the skills to help the child; 3) the ease in learning filial skills with the help of the skilled parent psychoeducation process; 4) a systematic positive change in behaviors and emotions of all members of the parent-child dyad or triad; and 5) the citing of different forms of learning throughout the process.\n\tImplications for future research include seeking a broader range of family demographics of adoptive parents who practice parent psychoeducation with their adopted children, focusing on long term adjustment of families, and comparing parent psychoeducation/filial therapy with other therapeutic models used with adoptive families.   Suggestions for practice include increasing the numbers of therapists trained in parent psychoeducation, attachment, and trauma; and expanding the parent psychoeducation process to include detailed information about the meaning of child responses in therapy, changes in child behavior due to increased feelings of safety and security, and the applicability of the filial skills outside of the special play time.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10485], "author_name_tesi": "Camberg, Sara Jean", "last_name_ssi": "Camberg", "middle_name_ssi": "Jean", "first_name_ssi": "Sara", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melody M Thompson", "Melody M Thompson", "Esther Susana Prins", "Gary Kuhne", "Margaret Ann Lorah"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melody M Thompson, Dissertation Advisor", "Melody M Thompson, Committee Chair", "Esther Susana Prins, Committee Member", "Gary Kuhne, Committee Member", "Margaret Ann Lorah, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adoption", "disrupted attachment", "adopted children", "parent psychoeducation", "filial therapy"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "FOSTERING HISTORICAL THINKING AND INTEGRATION: THE EFFECTS OF INSTRUCTION ON STUDENT QUESTION GENERATION IN HISTORY", "id": "25047", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11111", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this research was to examine the development and use of historical thinking skills and integration through the MD-TRACE Model (Rouet & Britt, 2011).

Trace metal contents of investigated microorganisms revealed a distinct metallome pattern and possible biosignature for the methanogen M. jannaschii in which high cellular concentrations of Ni, Co and W were observed. Microorganisms can alter mineral substrates through scavenging of bioessential trace metals, which may produce biomarkers. To investigate whether hyperthermophiles produce ligands under metal-limited conditions, supernatant growth experiments were conducted with hyperthermophiles in the presence of powdered basalt. Tungsten (W) was targeted as the metal of interest as it has been shown to be an important bioessential nutrient required for the growth of many hyperthermophiles. Bulk results from all experiments suggest hyperthermophiles do not produce W ligands however, due to reproducibility issues, the role of W as a possible hyperthermophile biosignature remains unresolved.\nFinally, novel Ni stable isotopic investigations were performed for geological and biological materials. Mass spectrometry, column chemistry and microbiological protocols specific to Ni and hyperthermophiles, were developed and established. Terrestrial and extraterrestrial geological materials vary within a small range of Ni isotopic compositions: -0.04 to +0.36 per mil. Relative to the starting composition of the growth media, diverse metabolic groups of methanogens impart distinct and significant mass-dependent fractionations on Ni isotopes, preferentially sequestering the lighter isotopes which results in an isotopic fractionation on the order of ~ 0.8 - 1.0 per mil. Non-methanogenic cells also produced a small fractionation. Organisms in general may fractionate Ni isotopes but not as significantly as methanogens. Ni isotopes may be useful, not only as a general methanogenic biomarker but also as a marker for distinguishing between diverse metabolic groups. Ni stable isotopes may have important implications in the fields of transition metal isotopes, geomicrobiology and astrobiology.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6429], "author_name_tesi": "Cameron, Vyllinniskii ", "last_name_ssi": "Cameron", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vyllinniskii", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Howard House", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Lee Kump", "Caryl Ann Gronwall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Howard House, Committee Chair", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member", "Lee Kump, Committee Member", "Caryl Ann Gronwall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Trace metals", "Biosignatures", "Nickel Stable Isotopes", "Hyperthermophiles", "Methanogen", "Tungsten"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Examination of Critically Loaded Bearings in the Pericyclic Transmission", "id": "12546zac5060", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12546", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe rotorcraft industry has set rigorous goals for improvements in range, load capacity, and operational speed for the next generation of rotorcraft. In order to achieve these goals many facets critical to the operation of rotorcraft will need improvements. One such facet is the transmission system, which will need reductions in overall weight while maintaining the same level of efficiency and reliability. The Pericyclic Variable Transmission (PVT) provides a viable option for the future of rotorcraft transmission, offering both high reduction ratios and high power density. Previous work has examined transmission feasibility, variable speed power flow, and gear tooth loading and meshing conjugacy. A critical area that required development was the loading and power flow through the main Pericyclic Motion Converter (PMC) bearing set. This work examines impact of transmission geometry on operation, establishes a method for determining both static and dynamic bearing loads, and evaluating methods for limiting excessive loads. Calculated loads have been used to determine key stress and strain values of the bearing rollers and balls that determine approximate size, and weight of these critical bearings and provides an estimate of total transmission weight.

In the macroscopic portion of this work, our goal was to identify conditions under which the transport of bacteria in porous media was the greatest.  The effects of flow velocity, cell concentration, cell motility, and solution ionic strength were each examined.  The motile bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens P17 was found to transport furthest at very low fluid velocities, and this transport was greater than could be obtained using non-motile control cells.  Cell concentration affected the transport of Pseudomonas fluorescens P17, Burkholderia cepacia G4, and Pseudomonas putida KT2442 in different ways.  G4 and KT2442, as well as carboxylated latex microspheres, all exhibit blocking, in which attached particles prevent the further deposition of particles due to repulsive forces.  P17 exhibited filter ripening, in which multi-layer films formed since particle-particle interactions appeared to be favorable. \nThe addition of certain chemicals had been suggested as a means of enhancing bacterial transport in porous media.  Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to image bacterial cells that had been exposed to adhesion-modifying chemicals, to determine the feasibility of using these treatments.  Tapping-mode images in air of Pseudomonas stutzeri KC and Burkholderia cepacia G4 revealed that the surfactant Tween 20 and low ionic strength water did not damage cellular morphology, while disodium tetraborate and sodium pyrophosphate caused substantial damage to the cells, and therefore should not be used in bacterial transport studies.  \nAlthough enhancements in bacterial transport could be made through modification of macroscopic parameters, the conclusions made from these experiments were not sufficient to allow us to formulate a mechanism describing bacterial attachment to soil.  It was then concluded that a microscopic approach should be taken to directly measure the bacterial interaction forces that control the adhesion process.  AFM was used to measure the interaction forces between individual, negatively-charged bacteria and silicon nitride to determine the effects of pH, ionic strength, and the presence of bacterial surface polymers on interaction forces.  Bacterial surface polymers dominated interactions  between bacteria and AFM silicon nitride tips. The measured forces were represented well by an electrosteric repulsion model accounting for repulsion between the tip and bacterial polymers, but were much larger in magnitude and extended over longer distances (100's of nanometers) than predicted by DLVO theory.  The equilibrium length (Lo) of the polymers was allowed to vary with solution chemistry to account for intramolecular electrostatic interactions between individual polymer units. For Pseudomonas putida KT2442, Lo increased from 229 - 752 nm as pH increased from 4.75 to 8.67, and for G4, Lo increased from 348 nm at pH 2.2 to 1042 nm at pH 7.0. Ionic strength did not affect the equilibrium length of the polymers nearly as much as pH.  Partially removing polysaccharides from the bacterial surfaces resulted in lower repulsive forces that decayed much more rapidly.  The magnitude of the measured forces in these experiments and the equilibrium lengths predicted by the electrosteric model are comparable to other force measurements and size estimates on polymers and polysaccharides. The results of the AFM force measurements were discussed in terms of their implications regarding bacterial transport in porous media.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6102], "author_name_tesi": "Camesano, Terri Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Camesano", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Terri", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Brian Dempsey", "Richard Frederick Unz Sr.", "Susan Louise Brantley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Chair", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "Richard Frederick Unz Sr., Committee Member", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["AFM", "atomic force microscopy", "bacterial interaction forces", "bacterial adhesion"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "the utility of lateral branching of the primary root for tolerance to phosphorus stress and drought in the common bean (phaseolus vulgaris L.)", "id": "21903", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9346", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is essential to the food security of millions people in developing nations. Inadequate precipitation and low soil fertility, especially low phosphorus availability, are the primary constraints in most rain-fed bean production regions. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of lateral branching of the primary root for tolerance of phosphorus stress and drought in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Recombinant inbred lines contrasting in taproot lateral branching were evaluated in pots with stratified water and phosphorus availability in a greenhouse with four treatments: 1) adequate water and phosphorus; 2) limited phosphorus and adequate water; 3) limited water and adequate phosphorus; and 4) combined drought and phosphorus stress. Another greenhouse study focused on drought stress in pots with stratified water availability in a greenhouse. In addition field studies were conducted in which drought stress was imposed by automated rainout shelters at Rock Springs; field experiment at URBC, Republic of South Africa and Sussundenga research station, Republic of Mozambique. Overall, drought and phosphorus treatments significantly reduced growth parameters (shoot biomass, leaf area and number of leaves). In the field study at Rock Springs drought stress caused a reduction of 50% in shoot biomass, 64% in leaf area, and 48% in number of leaves at flowering. Total taproot length in the bottom horizon of the stratified water greenhouse system (2013 greenhouse study ) was correlated with shoot biomass, although in these results as well as those from the field experiments (Rock Springs, URBC and Sussundenga), phenotype groups did not have significant effects on shoot biomass and most of the parameters measured. Results suggest the need for more research testing whether the differences in root length, branching, as well as the size of lateral branches (and their anatomical traits such as metaxylem vessels) has an influence in water uptake. How much water is taken up after imposition of drought would be related to the root length density and its size, since in our experiments we have observed that strong drought stress led to more fine roots production and allocation in the deeper horizons.

Matched filtering broadband signals provides higher levels of range resolution and reverberation noise suppression than can be realized through narrowband processing.  Since theoretical processing gains are proportional to the signal bandwidth, it is typically desirable to utilize the widest band signals possible.  However, as signal bandwidth increases, so do environmental effects that tend to decrease correlation between the received echo and the transmitted waveform.  This is especially true for ultra wideband signals, where the bandwidth exceeds an octave or approximately 70\\% fractional bandwidth.  This loss of coherence often results in processing gains and range resolution much lower than theoretically predicted.  Wiener filtering, commonly used in image processing to improve distorted and noisy photos, is investigated in this dissertation as an approach to correct for these environmental effects.   This improved signal processing, Environmentally Corrected Matched Filter (ECMF), first uses a Wiener filter to estimate the environmental transfer function and then again to correct the received signal using this estimate.  This process can be viewed as a smarter inverse or whitening filter that adjusts behavior according to the signal to noise ratio across the spectrum.  Though the ECMF is independent of bandwidth, it is expected that ultra wideband signals will see the largest improvement, since they tend to be more impacted by environmental effects.\n\nThe development of the ECMF and demonstration of improved parameter estimation with its use are the primary emphases in this dissertation.  Additionally, several new contributions to the field of sonar signal processing made in conjunction with the development of the ECMF are described.  A new, nondimensional wideband ambiguity function is presented as a way to view the behavior of the matched filter with and without the decorrelating environmental effects; a new, integrated phase broadband angle estimation method is developed and compared to existing methods; and a new, asymptotic offset phase angle variance model is presented.  Several data sets are used to demonstrate these new contributions.  High fidelity Sonar Simulation Toolset (SST) synthetic data is used to characterize the theoretical performance.  Two in-water data sets were used to verify assumptions that were made during the development of the ECMF.  Finally, a newly collected in-air data set containing ultra wideband signals was used in lieu of a cost prohibitive underwater experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ECMF at improving parameter estimates.

The following study examined the descriptive nature of the SACSI in a predominantly African-American, male, inner-city, low socioeconomic (SES), high school student-athlete group in three geographic regions of the United States.  The predictive nature of the factors found in the instrument above and beyond demographics variables including age and highest number of years played in one sport was also investigated.

Play It Smart is a high school initiative of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame (NFF) that promotes positive youth development through sport. Social Cognitive Career Theory partially informed the study as constructs including career decision-making self-efficacy, locus of control, barriers, and other contextual factors were explored.  \n     Data for 178 participants were included in an exploratory factor analysis and a sequential regression analysis. The factor analysis yielded a model structure that included two factors: Career Development Challenges and Career Development Strengths. Thus, a new career development instrument for high school student-athletes was created and named the Career-PLanning for Athlete Needs (C-PLAN).  Items on the Challenges factor of the C-PLAN overlapped with items on the Career vs. Sport Identity, Locus of Control, and Barriers factors of the original SACSI.  Items on the Strengths factor of the C-PLAN overlapped with five of the six items on the Career Development Self-Efficacy subscale of the SACSI.  Others factors slightly tapped on the Strengths subscale of the C-PLAN were Career vs. Sport Identity and Sport to Work Relationship.\n     A sequential regression analysis was conducted to investigate the predictive nature of the two factors on the SACSI over and above demographic variables including age and highest number of years played in one sport.

Thus, N-acyl hemiaminals 77a-c were synthesized from the addition of alkyl Grignards to the carbonyl of &#947;-lactam 76.  Unfortunately, in situ formation of N-acyliminium ion 81 from N-acyl hemiaminals 77a-c, followed by addition of aryl Grignard 82 did not give the desired C9 addition product 80.\n\tAlternatively, an intramolecular cyclization approach towards diastereoselectively forming the C9,20 adjacent quaternary centers was examined.  Cyclization precursor 117 was synthesized from &#947;-lactam 84 in five steps via addition of a lithio acetylide to the C9 carbonyl group of sulfonamide 115 followed by a Meyer-Schuster rearrangement of the resulting hemiaminal 116.  However, attempts to cyclize arylbromide 117 using either radical or reductive Heck conditions resulted in ring opening of the &#946;-lactam to form undesired indole products 119 or 122, respectively.\n\tFinally, a novel method for the construction of the bromoenamide moiety of the chartellamides was developed based on an extension of the known copper catalyzed coupling of amides with vinylhalides.  In this study, haloenamides were constructed both inter- and intramolecularly via a halogen-selective N-vinylation reaction.\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\tIn work directed towards a total synthesis of the marine alkaloids chartelline A-C (1-3), a model system was explored to probe the formation of the 10-membered macrocycle via RCM.  After an initial model study demonstrated that ketone enolates add effectively to the carbonyl of activated N-acyl &#947;-lactams, the requisite ketoimidazole 292 was synthesized from known aldehyde imidazole 259 in 4 steps and 50% overall yield.  However, addition of the enolate of ketoimidazole 292 to the C12 carbonyl of N-acyl &#947;-lactam 293 resulted in formation of vinylogous amide 297 rather than the desired hemiaminal 295.\n\tAn alternative route was therefore examined in which the bond between C11 and C12 would be formed via the addition of a metallated (Z)-alkene to the activated carbonyl group.  Simple model reactions between the metallated alkene of vinyliodide 310 and &#947;-lactams 96 and 76 gave hemiaminals 311 and 312, respectively.  After this successful model study the requisite iodovinylimidazole 302 was synthesized from either alcohol imidazole 314 or alkynyl imidazole 262.  Unfortunately, formation of the metallated anion of 302 followed by addition of N-acyl &#947;-lactam 231 resulted in formation of alkyne hemiaminal 263 rather than the desired alkene hemiaminal 310.\n\tWe next turned to an alternative approach in which the chloroenamide moiety of the chartellines would first be constructed and then the macrocycle would be closed via either the intramolecular addition of a ketone enolate or a metallated (Z)-alkene to the activated C12 &#947;-lactam carbonyl moiety. Thus, ketoimidazole 317 and related imidazoles 324, 325, 330 were synthesized through functional group manipulations of aldehyde imidazole 259 or isobutenyl imidazole 281.  Unfortunately, coupling of these imidazoles, which contained the C9-C11 functionality found in the chartellines, with NH-&#946;-lactams 260, 316, or 334 did not give any of the desired haloenamide products.  Fortunately, imidazoles 247, 370, and 403, containing the C9,10 functionality of the chartellines, were found to couple with NH-&#946;-lactams to form the desired chloroenamide products.  Efforts are being made to utilize these chloroenamide products to construct the 10-membered macrocycle towards completion of a total synthesis of the chartellines.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2644], "author_name_tesi": "Camp, Jason Eliot", "last_name_ssi": "Camp", "middle_name_ssi": "Eliot", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven M Weinreb", "Raymond Lee Funk", "Ken S Feldman", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven M Weinreb, Committee Chair", "Raymond Lee Funk, Committee Member", "Ken S Feldman, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["total synthesis", "alkaloids", "marine natural products", "N-vinylation"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Marriage and Health: Questions of Selection and Causality", "id": "15019agc5120", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15019", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Marriage is one of the most ubiquitous institutions in the United States.

First, do Black women recognize their pregnancies later than White women? Second, is the standard measure of late pregnancy recognition an appropriate predictor of low birth weight risk? Third, does late pregnancy recognition partially mediate the established association between race and low birth weight? Finally, does late pregnancy recognition amplify Black women\u2019s risk of bearing a low birth weight infant?  To investigate these research questions, data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort are analyzed (N=4400) using weighted ordinary least square (OLS) and logistic regression models. Results indicate that Black women are significantly more likely than White women to recognize their pregnancies late. In addition, the standard measure of late pregnancy recognition that dichotomizes recognition into pregnancies recognized at six weeks and earlier or seven and later is not optimal in models predicting low birth weight risk. Instead these findings appear to be driven by women who recognize pregnancy much later\u2014after the 12th week of gestation.  In unadjusted models, recognition of pregnancy in the 12th week or later is significantly associated with an increase in low birth weight risk, and White women who recognize their pregnancies this late have a higher risk of low birth weight than Black women recognizing their pregnancies in the same time frame. When statistical models are adjusted for confounders, these associations were no longer significant. This suggests that timing of pregnancy recognition is not a significant predictor of low birth weight risk net of women\u2019s background characteristics and it does not partially explain why Black women have a higher risk of bearing a low birth weight infant, despite the fact that Black women do recognize their pregnancies later than White women.

Although the exact etiology of MS is not known, and there are limited disease-modifying therapies available that, unfortunately, carry a high cost, have limited efficacy, and produce undesirable side effects. Previous studies have shown that therapies known to modulate opioid systems attenuate disease in an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), when treatment is initiated prior to disease onset.\nThe goal of this research was to determine if modulation of endogenous opioid systems affect the progression of established chronic EAE. Two agents were evaluated with treatment initiated at the behavioral onset of EAE: the non-specific opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (NTX) in two doses (0.1 mg/kg NTX [low-dose, LDN] and 10 mg/kg NTX [high-dose, HDN]) and the opioid peptide opioid growth factor (10 mg/kg OGF). Further, astrocytes are known to have a role in MS pathogenesis. Additional studies using primary astrocyte cultures were conducted to investigate the role of opioid systems in astrocyte function. The central hypothesis of this thesis is that alterations to the OGF-OGFr axis affect the course of established EAE and astrocyte function.\n     The first study evaluated the impact of administering NTX to mice with established chronic EAE. Two regimens of naltrexone were evaluated \u2013 daily injections of LDN, which produces only intermittent opioid receptor blockade, or daily injections of HDN, which produces continuous opioid receptor blockade. Behavioral observations were recorded throughout the 40-treatment day study, and lumbar spinal cord tissue was collected after 20 and 40 treatment days for histopathological analyses. LDN treated EAE mice had slight improvements in behavior, such as significantly reduced cumulative scores and significant improvements in pain sensitivity. Histopathological analyses revealed significant changes in the lumbar spinal cords of LDN treated mice with EAE compared to vehicle-treated mice with EAE after 20 treatment days, such as a 37% reductions in microglia/macrophages, 54% reductions in activated astrocytes and 1.8 fold reductions in damaged neurons. However, areas of demyelination did not significantly change with LDN therapy and numbers of T lymphocytes significantly increased by 1.8-fold after 40 days of LDN treatment. HDN did not appear to significantly modulate the course of EAE. HDN- and Vehicle-treated mice appeared comparable in behavioral and histopathological analyses.\n     The second study evaluated the impact of administering OGF to mice with established chronic EAE. Daily treatment with 10 mg/kg OGF was initiated at the behavioral onset of disease. Behavioral observations were made throughout the 40 treatment day study, and lumbar spinal cord tissue was collected after 5, 10, 20 and 40 treatment days for histopathological analyses. OGF-treated mice with EAE displayed significant signs of attenuated disease, such as significantly lower daily behavioral scores, reduced cumulative scores, and significant improvements in pain sensitivity, as compared to vehicle treated controls. Histopathological analyses revealed significant changes with OGF administration after 20 days of treatment, such as 30% less microglia/macrophages, a 54% reduction in activated astrocytes, a 75% reduction in T lymphocytes, 73% less demyelination and 47% less neuronal damage. Since exogenous OGF administration has been demonstrated to inhibit proliferation by working through the OGF-OGFr axis, it was postulated that a possible mechanism could be an inhibition of proliferation of cell types known to participate in EAE and MS pathogenesis. This possibility was supported by evidence demonstrating 52.3% and 45.6% changes in proliferation index in the spinal cords of EAE mice treated with OGF compared to EAE mice treated with vehicle. A further analysis of serial sections revealed that vehicle treated EAE mice had approximately 13.8% of total astrocytes in the cell cycle, whereas OGF treated EAE mice had only 3% of total astrocytes in the cell cycle.\n     The third study investigated the presence and function of the OGF \u2013 OGFr axis in primary cultured astrocytes. Glial cultures derived from neonatal mouse cortices were purified to > 95% astrocytes and used for subsequent studies. The presence of endogenous OGF was documented with immunocytochemistry, and the presence of OGFr with immunocytochemistry and Western Blot. Next, the effects of modulating this axis were investigated. OGF inhibited astrocyte growth in a dose-dependant, receptor- mediated and reversible manner. Alternatively, 72 hour exposure to NTX resulted in significant increases in cell number by approximately 30%. Astrocytes were cultured with a panel of natural and synthetic agonists, many specific for the classic opioid receptors mu, kappa, and delta; however, OGF was the specific peptide that inhibited cell growth. Cultures exposed to an anti-OGF antibody had 63% increases in cell number compared to controls. Receptor knockdown with siRNA revealed that OGFr is required for OGF\u2019s inhibitory and NTX\u2019s acceleratory growth effects. OGF and NTX did not alter apoptosis or necrosis. However, BrdU labeling index was reduced by 29% in OGF treated cultures and increased by 27% in NTX treated cultures, suggesting that these treatments target DNA synthesis. OGF and NTX treatment did not alter astrocyte migration. Astrocytes activated with lipopolysaccharide and treated with OGF had reductions in tissue culture supernatant nitrite concentrations, reflecting the lower number of astrocytes present in OGF-treated wells compared to sterile water-treated controls.\n     In conclusion, data from these studies indicate a role for endogenous opioids in established EAE. This supports the use of OGF, in particular, for the treatment of established autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Results of these studies further indicate that endogenous opioids, specifically the OGF-OGFr axis, regulate astrocyte growth. The role of astrocytes in MS makes this finding potentially important for understanding the connection between endogenous opioids and autoimmune disease pathogenesis.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7401], "author_name_tesi": "Campbell, Anna Marjorie", "last_name_ssi": "Campbell", "middle_name_ssi": "Marjorie", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Mc Laughlin", "Ian Stuart Zagon", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang", "Ronald Paul Wilson", "Anthony Turel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Mc Laughlin, Dissertation Advisor", "Ian Stuart Zagon, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang, Committee Member", "Ronald Paul Wilson, Committee Member", "Anthony Turel, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multiple sclerosis", "experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis", "opioids", "opioid growth factor", "low dose naltrexone", "astrocytes"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Limitations on Regeneration Potential Following Even-aged Harvests in Mixed-oak Stands", "id": "17348", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8487", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Forest managers are interested in factors that inhibit oak (Quercus spp.) success, because of wide-spread regeneration failures in the forests of the eastern United States.

The data used were collected from 18 mixed-oak stands in central Pennsylvania. Stands were harvested between 1997 and 2001, and were followed through their tenth growing season. Parameter estimates were compared to determine if regeneration differed in its response to the three classes of interfering vegetation and non-modeled factors. Oak and total regeneration responded similarly to rhizomatous fern and tall shrub cover, and were inhibited least by mountain-laurel. No significant relationship was found between tall shrub cover and abundance of red maple regeneration, but this species was significantly inhibited by rhizomatous fern and mountain-laurel cover, the former having the most severe effect. Oak and red maple responded very similarly to rhizomatous fern and mountain-laurel cover, but red maple exhibited significantly more resiliency to non-modeled inhibitory factors regardless of cover type. Stochastic frontier analysis was also compared with boundary analysis to demonstrate the superiority of the former as a tool for estimating maximum values.

A network-based investigation of a complex system enables analysis of its structure, function, and dynamics, even in the face of noisy or otherwise incomplete data. This is particularly relevant to the biological sciences, as recent advances in data-collection techniques have made a systems-level study of biological systems feasible. Here, I present applications and advancements of network theory within the context of three biological systems that range in scale from cellular to ecological.\n \nFirst, the dynamic \u201ctug of war\u201d between the human immune system and cancer of the brain, bones, and pancreas is studied with a model of coupled ordinary differential equations, with the ultimate goal of directing researchers towards curative therapies. Known qualitative and quantitative time-course data are replicated, and several predictions of the model are experimentally validated. Second, a set of topological network measures are proposed and applied to a network representation of the immune response to attack by respiratory bacteria and allergen. The measures elucidate the functioning of the network, and along with analysis of the small-scale structure of the network, identify key regulators in the immune system response to the joint attack. Finally, a novel, dynamic model of the formation of ecological communities consisting of plants and their pollinators is proposed and shown to replicate expected ecological behavior. The model is used as the basis for a study of the stability of the communities in the face of species extinctions, and successfully identifies key properties in critical species and communities susceptible to significant damage from the loss of a single species.\n\nIn this dissertation, mathematical models are developed, networks are formed, network topologies are analyzed, and both discrete- and continuous-time dynamics are studied. Novel measures and models are proposed and discussed.

Following existing cognitive behavioral theories, it was proposed that fear of negative evaluation leads to maladaptive cognitive processes (anticipatory processing and rumination) which influence socially avoidant behaviors.  It was further hypothesized that a number of across time processes affect future social anxiety and social avoidance.  Accordingly, time series analyses were conducted in which both within time and across time relations were examined.  An aggregated model confirmed the within time hypotheses and indicated stability in social anxiety over time.  However, individual models, using person-specific analyses, indicated more complex and variable results.  The hypothesized within time relations generally held for individuals with variability in the models being most commonly centered on the influence of one of the two cognitive factors.  However, for a few individuals a separation between affective processes and behavioral processes was evident.  Across time, stability of social anxiety was found for half of the participants.  A number of other across time relations emerged, but with high variability between subjects.  This study demonstrates the important of utilizing person-specific methodology in order to assess the validity of the processes found in aggregated models (using groups or samples) for specific individuals.  Important differences in individual models have major implications for treatment and intervention.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1214], "author_name_tesi": "Campbell, Cynthia G", "last_name_ssi": "Campbell", "middle_name_ssi": "G", "first_name_ssi": "Cynthia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Linn Bierman", "Karen Linn Bierman", "Peter Cm Molenaar", "Kristin Buss", "Michael J Rovine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Linn Bierman, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Linn Bierman, Committee Chair", "Peter Cm Molenaar, Committee Chair", "Kristin Buss, Committee Member", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["social anxiety", "person-specific methodology", "p-technique"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "RELATIONSHIPS AMONG MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS\u2019 MUSICAL POSSIBLE SELF BELIEFS AND THEIR MUSIC PARTICIPATION\n", "id": "9401", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1464", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT:\nRelationships Among Middle School Students\u2019 Musical Possible Self Beliefs and Their Participation in School Musical Activities\n\tAdolescence is a time when many students elect to withdraw from musical organizations.

NBTI has become the most important reliability problem in modern complementary-metal-oxide-silicon technology. Despite 40 years of research, the defects involved in this instability were still undetermined prior to this work. We combine DC gate-controlled diode measurements of interface state density with two very sensitive electrically detected magnetic resonance measurements called spin-dependent recombination and spin-dependent tunneling. An analysis of these measurements provides an identification of the dominating atomic-scale defects involved in NBTI in pure SiO2- and plasma-nitrided oxide-based devices. (The fundamental mechanism behind NBTI\u2019s enhancement due to the addition of nitrogen had previously been a mystery.) \n\nOur results in pure SiO2 devices indicate an NBTI mechanism which is dominated by the generation of Pb0 and Pb1 interface state defects. (Pb0 and Pb1 are both silicon dangling bond defects in which the central silicon is back bonded to three other silicon atoms precisely at the Si/SiO2 interface.) This observation is consistent with what most NBTI researchers have assumed. However, our observations in plasma-nitrided oxide devices contradict what most NBTI researchers had previously assumed.\n \nWe demonstrate that the dominating NBTI-induced defect in the plasma-nitrided devices is fundamentally different than those observed in pure SiO2-based devices. Our measurements indicate that the new plasma-nitride NBTI-induced defect\u2019s physical location extends into the gate dielectric. The defect participates in both spin-dependent recombination and spin-dependent tunneling. Our spin-dependent recombination results strongly indicate that the plasma-nitrided defect has a density of states which is more narrowly peaked than that of Pb centers and is near the middle of the band gap. The high sensitivity of our spin-dependent tunneling measurements allow for an identification of the physical and chemical nature of this defect through observations of 29Si hyperfine interactions. The defects are silicon dangling bonds in which the central silicon is back bonded to nitrogen atoms. We call these NBTI-induced defects KN centers because of the similarities to the K centers observed in silicon nitride. (The silicon nitride K center is also a silicon dangling bond in which the silicon atom is back bonded to nitrogen atoms.) The defect identification in plasma-nitrided devices helps to explain (1) NBTI\u2019s enhancement in plasma-nitrided devices, (2) conflicting reports of NBTI induced interface states and/or bulk traps, and (3) fluorine\u2019s ineffectiveness to reduce NBTI in plasma-nitrided devices. Our measurements also allow for observations of the atomic-scale defects involved in NBTI recovery.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2917], "author_name_tesi": "Campbell, Jason P", "last_name_ssi": "Campbell", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick M Lenahan", "S Ashok", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Michael T Lanagan", "Tara Krishnan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick M Lenahan, Committee Chair", "S Ashok, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Tara Krishnan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Negative Bias Temperature Instability", "Spin-Dependent Recombination", "Spin-Dependent Tunneling", "Atomic-Scale Defects", "Reliability"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Indian Control of Education:Factors that Determine Success in Indian Education-A Case Study of Two Tribally Controlled Schools\n", "id": "11298", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3304", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this study was to identify successful tribally controlled schools and to determine the factors that contributed to their success.

I structured a critical placed-based pedagogical (CPBP) inquiry through a cultural-historical ethnographic snapshot (Janzen, 2005) to analyze how migrants used place between Trinidad and Tobago and Brooklyn to construct knowledge and reinvent place. I collected data as I lived as an insider-researcher in the Caribbean neighborhood of Lefferts Gardens in Brooklyn. Qualitative analysis included examining data through narrative methods (Riesmann, 1993) and conducting grounded thought-by-thought coding (Charmaz, 2008) of data to build phenomenological thematic data structures to unearth activities in participants\u2019 migrant experiences. From these, the outcomes of constructing knowledge using a cultural, historical activity theoretical framework (CHAT) are cast as experiences in place that occur as the subject works to achieve an evolving motive-object. \nIn this study, the main motive-object of participants was reinventing Trinbagonian culture in Brooklyn. Participants reported significant place dissonance once in Brooklyn, which signaled the first signs of tensions in constructing knowledge. Their experiences specified various motive-objects that participants deemed important to navigating their new lives in Brooklyn. From the analysis of these motive-objects, nine activities emerged across data: Reconciling Skin Color and Race, Being Trinbagonian in Brooklyn, Traveling Between Countries, Cooking Cultural Foods, Hosting Fetes, Maintaining Local Limes, Navigating Marital and Spousal Changes, Caribbean Business Ownership, and Carnival Participation.  \nThe main findings are that Trinbagonians use tools from Trinidad and Tobago in Brooklyn to first prove personhood and authenticate culture in the process of reinventing place in Brooklyn. Second, the vital life knowledge of \u201cmarginalized\u201d cultural groups can be unearthed using a critical place-based cultural, historical approach that is observable and understandable. Third, informal critical place-based adult learning approaches must centralize the perspective of subjects to appropriately to understand related activities. Accordingly, the significance of perspective was reinforced throughout the study to preserve subject perspective as central in adult learning and adult.\nThe study concludes that the work of transferring and transposing information through transnational and translocal places constitutes a fundamental place-based pedagogy. This place-based pedagogy can be consciously and geographically located from the perspective of participants in any place where knowledge people construct knowledge. Cultural historical activity as pedagogical practice is different from formal pedagogies that, while valuable, restrict knowing and knowledge to the structures of schooling and training. Formal learning structures in a society privilege the gaze and perspective of the dominant culture for affirmation and validation, consequently teaching subjects to do the same. Thus facilitators of informal, incidental knowledge construction in various settings must incorporate critical place-based informal adult learning and knowledge construction inquiries in quotidian practice. These inquiries honor the perspective of subjects as central to living successfully in translocational (Brown, 2007) and transnational places and provide the appropriate framework and tools to evaluate knowledge experiences.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9749], "author_name_tesi": "Campbell, Kimeka Georeen", "last_name_ssi": "Campbell", "middle_name_ssi": "Georeen", "first_name_ssi": "Kimeka", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Michael Schied", "Esther Susana Prins", "Kenneth Tamminga", "Davin Jules Carr Chellman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Michael Schied, Dissertation Advisor", "Esther Susana Prins, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Tamminga, Committee Member", "Davin Jules Carr Chellman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["place", "space", "adult education", "Trinidad", "Tobago", "informal learning", "Brooklyn", "cultural historical activity theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Theorizing Information and Communication Technologies for Parents of Children with Developmental Disabilities\n", "id": "9904", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3821", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Studying the challenges faced by families with children who have developmental disabilities has produced a considerable body of literature.

Much of the challenge lies in the fact that such descriptions must be multiscale.  For example, the fate of nitrogen added to agricultural soils depends on the atomic level interaction of the particular nitrogen species with soil components,the micron to kilometer scale dynamics of mineral and organic colloids in the subsurface,the local abundance and activity of particular microbial populations, the geological characteristics of the subsurface and weather.  My interest in this dissertation is the lower half of this continuum: describing how to move from the atomic to the micron scale in environmentally relevant chemistry.  In some instances this is straightforward, the specific heat of water can be rationalized from the properties of small clusters of water molecules, in other cases it is less so, the details of how atomic scale interactions combine to produce micron scale structures are nonlinear.\n\nThis nonlinearity in moving across spatial scales is often found in environmental chemistry in two areas: the solid/water interface and the chemistry of macromolecules.  Sugars of varying lengths are macromolecules of particular interest as they are ubiquitous and both have relatively long lifetimes and a defined chemical structure(to ease\nsubsequent analysis).  In this dissertation I develop tools to aid in the characterization\nof both the solid particle/water interface and the calculation of sugar properties: I apply second harmonic generation spectroscopy to characterize adsorption on chemically heterogeneous colloid particles and the surface potential of the mineral colloid/water interface and investigate the appropriate level of electronic structure theory for the calculation of sugar properties, test the application of several atomistic materials force fields to sugars and apply replica exchange molecular dynamics to investigate hydrogen bonding in disaccharides in vacuum.  Taken together this work lays the foundation for full experimental and computational characterization of the mineral/water,cell/water and cell/mineral interfaces: the groundwork for quantitative description of atomic through micron scale phenomena in the environment.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5203], "author_name_tesi": "Campen, Richard Kramer", "last_name_ssi": "Campen", "middle_name_ssi": "Kramer", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James David Kubicki", "Eric Borguet", "William Blaine White", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Christopher Howard House"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James David Kubicki, Committee Chair", "Eric Borguet, Committee Member", "William Blaine White, Committee Member", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["carbohydrate", "colloid chemistry", "second harmonic generation", "density functional theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Topics in black holes and quantum cosmology", "id": "15778", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8001", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Black holes and the big bang beginning of the universe are among the most spectacular predictions of general relativity, having a broad  impact that  ranges  from observational astronomy to quantum gravity. \n\nIn this thesis we will focus on classical and  quantum aspects of these subjects: In the first part we present a coordinate-free way of describing the  approach to equilibrium of black holes within the framework of dynamical and isolated horizons.

Whether bone has a unique chemotactic potential that attracts breast cancer cells is addressed in this study.  Osteonectin has been characterized as a possible bone-derived chemoattractant.  Through a series of protein analyses for molecular size, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and amino acid sequence, we determined that there was no detectable unique configuration of bone-derived osteonectin.  Although osteonectin did increase cell motility, it did not cause the cancer cells to migrate in a directed manner.  Osteonectin did not induce directed cell migration of breast cancer cells in transwell migration assays.  Although breast cancer cells were not attracted to osteonectin, they were attracted to and migrated toward the mineralized portion of bone matrix (bone extracts).  We first assayed the bone extracts for the presence of other bone matrix proteins and confirmed the presence of fibronectin, vitronectin, osteopontin and bone sialoprotein.  Through transwell migration assays, it was also confirmed that breast cancer cells migrated toward fibronectin, vitronectin and osteopontin; this migration was RGD-dependent.  We then determined that the breast cancer cell attraction and migration toward bone extracts was also RGD-dependent.  The next aim of the dissertation was to analyze the soluble portion of bone.  The soluble portion of bone was collected in the form of conditioned media from an osteoblast cell culture.  We demonstrated that breast cancer cells were also attracted to and migrated toward osteoblast-conditioned media.  This migration was not RGD-dependent and was correlated to the concentration of the chemokine, RANTES.  We concluded that osteonectin was not a chemoattractant that directed beast cancer cell migration but increased random cellular motility.  In contrast, RGD-containing proteins, namely fibronectin, vitronectin and osteopontin attracted breast cancer cells and may contribute to their preferential metastasis to bone.  In addition to the RGD-containing proteins, osteoblasts also secreted unidentified soluble factors that attracted breast cancer cells.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1297], "author_name_tesi": "Campo, Dianalee A.", "last_name_ssi": "Campo", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Dianalee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carol V Gay", "Ronald Scott Kensinger", "Roland M Leach", "Andrea Marie Mastro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carol V Gay, Committee Chair", "Ronald Scott Kensinger, Committee Member", "Roland M Leach, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chemoattraction", "Osteonectin", "RGD", "Breast Cancer", "Bone", "Metastasis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Vocal Fold Geometry on the Fluid Structure Acoustic Interactions in an Experimental Model of the Human Airway", "id": "16360", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7882", "abstract_tesi": "Currently, there is an incomplete understanding concerning the effects of changing the vocal fold (vocal cord) structure or material composition on voice production.

I address this question, which pertains to the philosophical debate over whether, in addition to a logic of justification of mathematical knowledge, there is a logic of inquiry and discovery at work in actual mathematical research. Based on the philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914), I propose that there is a logic of mathematical inquiry, and I expound its form. I argue that even though there are not rules or algorithms that will lead to breakthrough discoveries and successful inquiry with absolute certainty, Peirce\u2019s philosophy provides a way to describe (i) the conditions for the possibility of mathematical discovery; (ii) the actual method of inquiry in mathematics and its associated heuristic techniques; and (iii) the logical form of reasoning that warrants the application of mathematical theories to the study of actual scientific problems in nature. With regard to (i), I discuss the role of the problem-context of discovery and describe the epistemic conditions necessary for carrying out mathematical reasoning. With respect to (ii), I argue that experimental hypothesis-making in the course of analytical problem-solving, and not deduction from axioms, is the actual method of mathematical research. Regarding (iii), I argue that abduction and analogy warrant the application of mathematical theories to the study of actual scientific problems. The discovery and early development of mathematical probability, culminating with Jacob Bernoulli\u2019s \"Ars Conjectandi\" (1713), serves as the historical case study to examine critically the proposed logic of mathematical inquiry.

Mothers and their preschool-aged children were examined in a normative, low-SES sample and a low-SES sample with a history of substantiated maternal perpetration of child maltreatment.  The first hypothesis, that there would be a positive association between maternal and child social problem solving was not supported in the normative sample.  In the perpetrator sample, however, there were significant positive associations between mother and child skill, which were affected by maternal IQ.  The second and third hypotheses, that the number of siblings in the home would be positively associated with child skill even after the effect of maternal social problem solving is removed, received support in both samples.  Though the number of siblings was associated with increased overall social problem solving skill in both samples, findings varied depending on the type of problem the child faced in the perpetrator sample, specifically the number of siblings was associated with mother-focused, but not peer-focused dilemmas.  The fourth hypothesis, that the presence of siblings would decrease the direct association between mother and child skill was not supported.  However, there was a significant interaction between one indicator of maternal social problem solving and the number of siblings in the perpetrator sample wherein the association between mother and child skill increased as the number of siblings in the home increased.   Findings suggest that preschool-aged child problem solving is associated with family factors, including the number of siblings a child has.

Staff respondents (N = 40) were recruited from two sites: (1) a day program (n = 20) and (2) a residential program (n = 20).  Staff completed self-report surveys, tasks of working memory, and a survey regarding the caregiving style of a coworker.  Predictor variables included attributions of control, hostile attribution bias, staff burnout (emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment), and negative affect.  Dependent variables included coworker-rated hostile caregiving style and warm/responsive caregiving style.  Staff mindfulness was examined as self-rated mindful attention and executive attention.  \nResults: Controlling for other indices of intrapersonal risk, staff attributions of control and low personal accomplishment predicted a higher level of staff hostile caregiving style.  Hostile attribution bias explained a modest amount of variance in hostile caregiving style beyond variance explained by attributions of control.  Staff mindfulness did not moderate the association between attributions of control and hostile caregiving style.  However, staff mindful attention was associated with lower levels of staff hostile attribution bias, burnout, and negative affect.  \nConclusions:  Some staff intrapersonal risk factors widely believed to be associated with caregiving behavior, such as burnout and negative affect, were not generally predictive of caregiving style, but attributions of control and low personal accomplishment were predictive of hostile caregiving style.

Small to large chromosome rearrangements have been reorganizing the genome information, including genes and heterochromatic regions such as centromeres and telomeres. Transposable elements (TEs) are an essential component of the genomes of all life forms studied until now, not only because of their abundance but also because of their influence on reshaping the genome architecture. Multiple studies have provided evidence that TEs are located in particular regions of the genome (e.g. GC-rich regions for Alus, or AT-rich regions for L1s). Here, using abundant genomic data and statistical methods as diverse as pair-wise non-parametric tests, multiple linear regression, multiple negative binomial regression, multiple logistic regression, interval testing procedure (ITP), and functional logistic regression (FLR), we addressed two questions about TE biology:\n1. How do Alus\u2019, DNA transposons\u2019, and endogenous retroviruses\u2019 (ERVs\u2019) neighboring regions reflect integration site preferences and fixation processes for these TEs? What genomic features are associated with their presence genome-wide?\n2. Can we capture integration site preferences alone using data from young, polymorphic or ex vivo integrations?\nThe results from the TE analyses contributed to our understanding of fixation and integration site preferences genome-wide providing abundant information from diverse genomic features. This information is of great importance to direct studies of insertional mutagenesis and gene therapy. Additionally, we provided a set of statistical tools to analyze complex genomic datasets.\nMoreover, we explored the genes on the Y chromosome of gorilla. We performed this by first, generating Y-specific transcripts from testis RNAseq data; second, by evaluating their structure in the Y chromosome assembly; third, by using these transcripts to scaffold the Y chromosome assembly. Finally, we predicted novel genes from the assembly that could have been transposed from other chromosomes.

Four pivotal moments provide a broad historical view of this phenomenon: the definition of a Classical New World through foundational histories and treatises of the late 16th and early 17th centuries; the highly programmatic and conflicting embodiment of the Classical during the 19th-century Latin American Age of Revolution; the international mythologization of Brazil in 20th-century cinema through the figure of Orpheus; and the very recent attempt in 2001 to create an Iberian-Latin American Federation of Classical Studies.

Devonian shales from the Appalachian Basin are recognized for their significant natural gas potential. The Marcellus Shale Formation is the lowest unit of the Devonian age from Hamilton Group and consists primarily of black shales high in organic carbon. Subunits of The Marcellus Formation have been studied to assess the abundance of the organic matter and type in the shale. The Oatka Creek Member of the Marcellus Formation was chosen for this study because of  its high gamma ray log response, which corresponds to increased Uranium content, and the presence of organic carbon enrichment. Few data are available on this unit because much of the focus has been on the lower part of the Marcellus Formation (The Union Springs Member).  Additionally, the distinct Ka\u010d\u00e1k-Otomari bioevent is thought to have had a big influence on black shale deposition globally within the interval of Oatka Creek Member's deposition. For this study, The Bald Eagle and Bilger cores of the Oatka Creek Member were analyzed to assess the effect of The Ka\u010d\u00e1k-Otomari event on sedimentation in the Appalachian Basin, and to examine the organic carbon content and the sources that affected the organic carbon deposition in the cores.\n\nTotal organic carbon (TOC) content and carbon stable isotopic values of The Bald Eagle and Bilger cores from Pennsylvania were determined after crushing and decarbonation steps. Based on these analyses, TOC content in the Bald Eagle Oatka Creek Member (692 to 780 ft) varies between 1.19 and 4.65 %, whereas the TOC content of the Bilger Oatka Creek Member (160 to 250 ft)  varies between  0.21 and 2.8 %. The  \u03b413Corg  values in the Bald Eagle core have a narrow range of -29.1 to -29.9 \u2030 (PDB) whereas the \u03b413Corg  values for the Bilger core have a relatively wider range of  -25.6 to -29.9 \u2030 (PDB). The organic carbon content in the Bald Eagle core is much higher than that in the Bilger core, and the lithofacies of the Oatka Creek Member suggest less overall dilution and/or oxygenation at the location of the Bald Eagle core.  Ka\u010d\u00e1k-Otomari bioevent didn't have much influence in both of the cores because of the lack of significant isotopic trend excursions. Because the \u03b413Corg pattern of Bald Eagle core is uniform and depleted in BC, this study suggests the dominance of amorphous marine organic matter at that location whereas in Bilger core marine organic matter gives way upward to increasing terrestrial organic matter input indicated by the trend towards more enriched \u03b413Corg values. \n\nThis study establishes  a base line for the organic carbon content and stable isotopic trends of the Bald Eagle and the Bilger cores.

Whether the system of interest is a cell, an organ system, or a complete organism, creating a working model of any given biological process requires a comprehensive understanding of the functions of genes, interactions between gene products, and interactions between the system and its surrounding environment. \n\nThe emerging field of <i>phenomics</i> addresses the problem of systematically analyzing physiological, behavioral, and morphological phenotype data from genetic manipulation experiments on a genome-wide scale. For instance, the morphological analysis of zebrafish mutants provides clues to the function of the affected genes and represents a key aspect of the proposed Zebrafish Phenome Project.\n\nWhile gross phenotypic analysis, generally performed by stereomicroscopy, can be used to characterize morphological phenotypes at the organism or organ level, it is necessary to use higher-resolution imaging methods, such as histology, to detect phenotypes that are only evident at the cellular level. However, in spite of the higher sensitivity relative to gross analysis, histology has been undeservedly perceived as being too costly in terms of time and effort. Consequently, most of the phenotypic annotations in the current zebrafish literature are limited by the relatively low descriptive power and resolution of the cheaper and faster phenotyping by stereomicroscopic analysis. \n\nOvercoming the perception that histology adds little value beyond gross analysis requires a clear and significant demonstration of the power of histology to augment the zebrafish phenomic landscape and also that histological analysis has the potential to become a fully-automated, high-throughput phenotyping method. \n\nIn addressing these issues, this thesis makes three important contributions to the field of phenomics. First, we present the results of a pilot study that showcases the sensitivity of histology in detecting subtle multiple-organ morphological phenotypes in ten larval zebrafish mutants previously annotated with gross phenotypes that were only observed in one or two organs at the same developmental stage. While gross analysis by stereomicroscopic inspection detected an average of 1.6 affected organs per mutant, a histological characterization of these same mutants (based on 75 semi-quantitative phenotypic measurements) detected an average of 7.4 affected organs per mutant\u2014nearly a four-fold increase in sensitivity to detect phenotypes at the organ level. In addition, a deeper evaluation of the histology of lens and seven retinal cell layers of the eyes resulted in an average of 7.2 defective eye structures per mutant. These results suggest that histology's ability to detect subtle defects in morphology can contribute significantly to insights into vertebrate gene function. \n\nThe second contribution of this thesis expands upon the ten-mutant pilot study by providing a comprehensive, systematic analysis of multiple-organ histological phenotypes in 102 larval zebrafish mutants. This dataset enabled us to begin using high-dimensional phenotypes to explore the functional interrelatedness of these mutants by graph-theoretic approaches. A subset of 77 of these mutants with known homology to human genes was used to construct a series of biological networks based on phenotypic similarity. We find that, as a <i>group</i>, zebrafish mutants belonging to maximally-connected subgraphs (or \u201ccliques\u201d), with high phenotypic similarity to each other, appear to have shorter interaction path lengths than mutants with lower phenotypic similarity. However, we also find that the size, number, and membership of cliques varies considerably with the dimensionality and resolution of the phenotype dataset, suggesting that the reliability of functional associations between genes based on organ-level morphological phenotype similarity alone can be augmented by increasing the precision of phenotypic analysis, thus maximizing phenomic resolution.\n\nFinally, this thesis details the development and implementation of a novel content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system, called SHIRAZ (System of Histological Image Retrieval and Annotation for Zoomorphology). Using our robust set of semi-quantitative histological phenotype measurements as a training dataset, the current version of SHIRAZ is designed to be capable of automatically annotating images depicting histological abnormalities in the developing eye of the larval zebrafish, with the intention of providing a proof-of-concept demonstration of the potential for a fully automated high-throughput histological analysis laboratory workflow.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [605], "author_name_tesi": "Canada, Brian Ashley", "last_name_ssi": "Canada", "middle_name_ssi": "Ashley", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Z Wang", "James Z Wang", "Keith C Cheng", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss", "Joan Therese Richtsmeier", "Webb Colby Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Z Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "James Z Wang, Committee Chair", "Keith C Cheng, Committee Member", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Committee Member", "Joan Therese Richtsmeier, Committee Member", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["content-based image retrieval", "zebrafish", "histological analysis", "phenotyping", "phenomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Carbon Budget of Maize and Shrub Willow for Bioenergy ", "id": "25647", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11221", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In a world economy currently built around the availability of fossil fuels as a source of energy, biomass arises as an alternative and renewable source of energy. Biomass has been a source of energy since ancient times, but biomass industry and biomass production systems are relatively new concepts. As novel production systems, their impact on the environment is uncertain. Of particular relevance is the carbon balance of these systems.\n\nThe goal of this research is to measure and compare the daily and seasonal carbon balance of maize (Zea maiz L.), an annual crop, and shrub willow (Salix spp. and hybrids), a perennial woody biomass energy crop, in the northeastern US using eddy covariance (EC) systems. The speci\fc objectives are: 1) to measure the net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange (NEE) of maize and shrub willow in two neighboring \felds and, 2) to develop generalized NEE curves for maize and shrub willow crops for a growing season. Collectively, this information will allow us to quantify the NEE of these systems for a growing season.\n\nTwo EC towers were installed in each fieeld, one with an open path (OP) gas analyzer and the other with a closed path (CP) gas analyzer. These towers report\nNEE, net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux (G) , latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat (H), soil temperature, soil moisture, wind speed, wind direction and air temperature (Tair) and moisture, at 30 min intervals. Gaps in the NEE, H and LE data were fi\flled using marginal distribution sampling (MDS) technique developed by Reichstein et al. (2005). An energy balance closure evaluation was also performed and results were reported with and without corrections for energy imbalance (82% closure for shrub willow and a 67% closure for maize).\n\nIn this study, NEE from March to December for shrub willow and maize are reported. NEE half-hourly and daily curves, and cumulative values were compared\nto determine whether shrub willow presents an annual carbon storage higher than that of maize.

Recent dating determined the main phase of thrusting to have occurred between 74-59Ma. The Northern Disturbed Belt is a section of the Sevier Orogenic Belt that contains the Sawtooth Range with its four major structural provinces; Flathead Range Complex, Sun River Valley, Sawtooth Range Complex, and the High Plains Complex. Situated in northern Montana, the 250 km Northern Disturbed Belt thrust front has a common transport of ENE. At Sawtooth Range, the 100 km Sawtooth Salient has three general transport directions; E, ENE, and NE. Seismic evidence, well control, and structural measurement suggests that the orocline bend is a manifestation of thin-skinned Sevier tectonics interacting with basement topography. \n\nJointing in the Sawtooth Range and High Plains Complex help determine paleostress trajectories. Andersonian stress regimes for thrust faulting favors extension fracturing on a horizontal plane during thrust faulting. At Sawtooth Salient, vertical jointing prevails. A stress regime that produces vertical extensional fractures and maintains a horizontal maximum stress is strike-slip faulting. In order to facilitate vertical extension fracturing in a thrust faulting regime, there must be strike parallel stretching to counteract the less horizontal stress and convert it to the least compressive stress (\u00f33). During orocline development, significant strike parallel stretching occurs as an accommodation mechanism. In response to this transport with accommodating strike parallel stretching, joints will form parallel to localized transport. All locations contain a major set of ENE joints. Northern joint measurements contain both ENE and NE joints. Southern joint measurements contain both ENE and E joints. Abutment relationships in the field suggest that the ENE joint set was first to form and then both NE and the E set formed afterwards.\n\nAdditional field evidence of the ENE joint set occurs at Teton Anticline and Lesser Teton Anticline. Previously, jointing at Teton Anticline has been wholly attributed to folding stresses. Current field evidence shows that the ENE joint cuts through both Teton Anticline and Lesser Teton Anticline. Convincing evidence occurs at the nose of Lesser Teton Anticline. One hypothesis for jointing at an anticlinal nose is strike parallel stretching, creating an array of joints that follow dip direction. However, at Lesser Teton Anticline the ENE joint set dominates regardless of structural position. This evidence suggests the ENE joint set formed before the development of Teton Anticline and Lesser Teton Anticline.\n\nFinally, a switch of stress regimes from thrust faulting to strike-slip faulting occurred. First introduced as bedding parallel strike slip faults, large conjugate wrench faults occur at Teton Anticline and thrust sheets toward the hinterland. Current measurement shows slip sub-normal to bedding, suggesting wrench faulting after bedding rotation has occurred in the thrust sheets and Teton Anticline.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1452], "author_name_tesi": "Cannon, David L", "last_name_ssi": "Cannon", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Terry Engelder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Terry Engelder, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Swift Reservoir", "stress field", "fracturing", "transport direction", "joint", "Sawtooth", "Teton Anticline", "Sun River"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Orientations toward Mathematical Processes of Prospective Secondary Mathematics Teachers as Related to Work with Tasks ", "id": "13409txc285", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13409", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mathematics can be conceptualized in different ways. Policy documents such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) (2000) and the Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSSI) (2010), classify mathematics in terms of mathematical content (e.g., quadratic functions, Pythagorean theorem) and mathematical activity in the form of mathematical processes or mathematical practices (e.g., justifying, representing). A situated cognition perspective (Lave & Wenger, 1991) positing that how one learns mathematics and what one learns about mathematics are dependent on the context in which one engages in mathematical activity (Boaler, 2002; J. S. Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989) is used to think about learning mathematics and learning to teach mathematics. Mathematical activity in which learning is situated can be framed using mathematical processes. Four targeted processes of defining, generalizing, justifying, and representing from a processes and actions framework (Heid et al., 2015; Zbiek & Heid, 2012; Zbiek et al., 2014) are used to study opportunities for mathematical activity in classrooms. \nStudents\u2019 experiences with mathematics in the classroom, particularly with the mathematical tasks in which they engage, shape their views about mathematics. Teachers can help students form positive process conceptualizations of mathematics by selecting, modifying, and sequencing mathematical tasks (collectively referred to as task work) that provide opportunities for students to engage in mathematical processes. Yet, not all teachers provide such opportunities. Of particular interest are prospective mathematics teachers (PMTs), who might have personal experiences engaging in mathematical processes yet struggle to include such activity in their classrooms. \nThe construct of orientations toward mathematical processes (OMP) is used to understand the nature of PMTs work with tasks. A mathematics teacher\u2019s orientation toward mathematical processes (OMP) in school mathematics is a set of conceptions about mathematics, its teaching and learning related to mathematical processes, and engagement in mathematical processes that influences how a teacher provides opportunities for students to engage in mathematical processes. A situated view of teacher education (Borko et al., 2000) serves as a lens for investigating PMTs\u2019 OMPs and how they might be related to PMTs\u2019 task work. Specific research questions, briefly stated, are: What are PMTs\u2019 OMPs, and how are PMTs\u2019 OMPs related to how PMTs\u2019 select, modify and sequence mathematical tasks?\nFive secondary mathematics prospective teachers who had completed at least some of their student teaching experiences participated in the study. Data were collected using three qualitative interviews focused on components of OMP and the teaching activities of selecting, modifying and sequencing mathematical tasks to gather data for each of the participants. The definition of OMP with the processes and actions framework (Heid et al., 2015; Zbiek & Heid, 2012; Zbiek et al., 2014) guided the data analysis, which involved the creation of OMP profiles. An OMP profile is a description of an individual participants\u2019 OMP organized around a theme and paralleling research questions about the nature of OMP and its relationship to task work. \nAn organization of profiles into types based on pedagogical and mathematical differences structures findings to the first research question. The construct of task template as a means of simplifying task work forms the basis for findings to the second research question. The notion of discovery figured prominently in participants\u2019 OMPs and explains observations about PMTs\u2019 OMPs. Insights into PMTs\u2019 OMPs and their task work has potential implications for undergraduate teacher education and secondary mathematics curricula.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13728], "author_name_tesi": "Cannon, Tenille ", "last_name_ssi": "Cannon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tenille", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rose Mary Zbiek", "Rose Mary Zbiek", "Edith Frances Arbaugh", "Mary Kathleen Heid", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte", "Gwendolyn Monica Lloyd"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rose Mary Zbiek, Dissertation Advisor", "Rose Mary Zbiek, Committee Chair", "Edith Frances Arbaugh, Committee Member", "Mary Kathleen Heid, Committee Member", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte, Outside Member", "Gwendolyn Monica Lloyd, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mathematical tasks", "mathematical processes", "discovery", "prospective teachers", "teacher beliefs"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ADVANCING SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IN BRAZIL: PLANNING STRATEGIES\nFOR SOCIO-SPATIAL INTEGRATION IN VARJ\u00c3O, BRAS\u00cdLIA", "id": "11189", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6136", "abstract_tesi": "Core to this research is the concern with quality of life in developing countries that focus on open space, accessibility, housing, etc. In any discussion about \u201cquality of life\u201d it is agreed there are disparities between and amongst communities. Some communities are vibrant, well maintained, organized and flourish over time while others have to overcome many social and physical obstacles. In Bras\u00edlia , the capital of Brazil, the community of Varj\u00e3o is located relatively close to the city center - where jobs and services are concentrated - and surrounded by rich neighborhoods. However, Varj\u00e3o faces problems such as housing shortages, substandard conditions and lack of transportation. The uneven conditions faced by this poor community and other informal settlements exist in varying degrees and manifestations not only in Brazil and other developing countries, but also in some developed countries. Locations that face inequality in quality of life are examples of socio-spatial segregation (SSS).\nThe term SSS is used in this study to refer to the social and physical obstacles that prevent certain segments of the population from reaching better social, political and economic conditions (i.e. socio-spatial integration or a better quality of life). SSS mostly corresponds to deprivation and suffering resulting from poverty, lack of access to resources, public services and decision making opportunities to effect improvement in social programs and the physical environment of communities.\nSSS is integral to larger discussions in urban and community planning about how to achieve urban social sustainability, an important aspect of sustainable development scholarship. The sustainable development or sustainability discourse is fairly new and diverse, but so far its common ground can be defined as achieving living patterns that can coexist in equilibrium with the environment and at the same time meet people\u2019s economic and social needs in the long term (Dillard et al. 2009; Madanipour, 2003; Magis & Shinn, 2009; Marshall, 1973; Pol\u00e8se & Stren,2000). The goal of urban social sustainability, therefore, is to improve the quality of urban life in a world that is already predominantly urban and is projected to become even more urbanized.\nThe study focuses mainly on the conditions and efforts being made to improve the quality of life in informal and substandard communities in Brazil and the implications for addressing similar causes of SSS in other locations. The study argues that urban and community planning strategies as currently practiced to improve conditions in Varj\u00e3o and other impoverished and informal settlements in Bras\u00edlia are ineffective in achieving a sustainable quality of life. Socio-spatial integration (SSI)( a term used interchangeably with the concept of \u201cquality of life\u201d and an important aspect of social sustainability discourse) cannot be achieved only by means of federal, state and local government funding for social programs and community infrastructure. The more inclusive conditions of SSI are furthered by civil and grassroots structures. The hypothesis of this study is that planning and design strategies that remove obstacles to quality of life and also explore community-based solutions for alleviating poverty and promote long-term community empowerment are strategies for achieving SSI in Brazil. An analysis of the issues generated by traditional planning and urban design, an analysis of successful SSI examples, and a case study are examined to explore this hypothesis.\nThis study provides a general analysis of the conditions of SSS in Brazil and Bras\u00edlia as well as an in-depth analysis of the district of Varj\u00e3o (the case study).

The neuropsychological deficits after MTBI are commonly resolved within one week after injury but residual neurological impairments may persist. The EEG measures have been traditionally used to detect residual neural dysfunctions after MTBI. However, the conventional EEG measures have several shortcomings, yielding controversial and inconsistent results. It is feasible to hypothesize that advanced EEG research protocols can overcome these shortcomings and provide more clear information regarding the long lasting neural impairment in subjects suffering from MTBI. In this dissertation several novel EEG algorithms have been proposed and validated to verify that residual EEG abnormalities may be present in concussed individuals in absence of any signs and subjective symptoms of concussion. Specifically, our current findings have clearly documented that EEG entropy measures have significantly decreased in several brain regions as a result of MTBI. Moreover, the non-stationarity of EEG signals at occipital and parietal regions was found to be significantly reduced in MTBI subjects, overall suggesting the lack of adaptive strategies as a result of neurological dysfunction. In addition, using the ICA combined with sLORETA and graph theory methods we have found the alteration of long-distance connectivity of EEG signals in concussed individuals. We tried to predict the recovery rate from concussion based on initial baseline testing and the brain\u2019s initial response to first concussion. Indeed, differential response to first concussion may be a predictor of the rate of recovery. In addition, we applied the classifier support vector machine (SVM) to achieve the automatic classification of MTBI. We have demonstrated that by using novel nonlinear features and advanced robust classifiers, the residual deficit of MTBI can be identified in absence of any subjective symptoms of concussion. We believe that this research contributes to our current understanding of concussion, in general, and the neural dysfunctions in MTBI patients that can be overlooked if conventional assessment tools are implemented", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1216], "author_name_tesi": "Cao, Cheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Cao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Semyon Slobounov", "Semyon Slobounov", "Karl Maxim Newell", "Peter Cm Molenaar", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Semyon Slobounov, Dissertation Advisor", "Semyon Slobounov, Committee Chair", "Karl Maxim Newell, Committee Member", "Peter Cm Molenaar, Committee Member", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["EEG", "Traumatic Brain Injury"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Generalized Bootstrap Algebraic Multigrid", "id": "14776fwc5045", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14776", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we consider a classical algebraic multigrid form of optimal interpolation that directly minimizes the two-grid convergence rate and compare it with a so-called ideal interpolation that minimizes a certain weak approximation property of the coarse space.
