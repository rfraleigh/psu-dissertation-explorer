This is accomplished by either modifying the existing structure (i.e., redesign) to achieve an altered functionality or by introducing a completely new binding site. In this thesis computational modeling is first tested by altering the effector binding specificity of the bacterial transcriptional regulatory protein AraC to molecules other than L-arabinose. A systematic computational formulation was developed and employed to favor the binding of a targeted ligand while suppressing the binding energy of decoy molecules. Next we introduce a modified version of IPRO equipped with different implicit solvation modules to redesign Candida boidinii xylose reductase (CbXR) to use NADH as its cofactor by finding the optimal set of mutations in the CbXR binding pocket. Calculated cofactor binding energy was verified as a good surrogate to computationally drive cofactor alteration. We performed site-directed mutagenesis to redesign CbXR according to the designs predicted by IPRO. Experimental results for predicted mutants as well as control studies quantitatively demonstrated the value of using computations to guide protein redesign for altered cofactor usage. Finally we present the computational procedure OptGraft for placing a novel binding pocket onto a protein structure so as its geometry is minimally perturbed. This was accomplished by introducing a two-level procedure where we first identify where are the most appropriate locations to graft the new binding pocket into the protein fold by minimizing the departure from a set of geometric restraints using mixed-integer linear optimization. Upon identifying the suitable locations that can accommodate the new binding pocket CHARMM energy calculations were employed to identify what mutations in the neighboring residues, if any, are needed to ensure that the minimum energy conformation of the binding pocket conserves the desired geometry. OptGraft was successfully used to guide our experimental studies for transferring a calcium binding pocket from thermitase protein (PDB:1thm) into the first domain of CD2 protein (PDB:1hng).\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2378], "author_name_tesi": "Fazelinia, Hossein ", "last_name_ssi": "Fazelinia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hossein", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas", "Costas D Maranas", "Patrick Cirino", "David D Boehr", "Andrew Zydney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas, Dissertation Advisor", "Costas D Maranas, Committee Chair", "Patrick Cirino, Committee Chair", "David D Boehr, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["OptGraft", "Protein engineering", "Computational protein design", "Enzyme cofactor alteration", "IPRO"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "RIBOSOME RESCUE IS ESSENTIAL IN BACTERIA AND HUMAN CELLS", "id": "5712m6524", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12883", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "All life on earth relies on the ability to translate the genetic code into protein. DNA is transcribed first into mRNA, which is then decoded by the ribosome to produce all of the proteins in the cell. The ribosome is a large, multi-subunit entropy trap that catalyzes the assembly of each protein based on a series of codons provided by the mRNA. This reaction has been occurring for billions of years and is essential in every organism. As a result, the process is highly efficient, and extensive quality control mechanisms have evolved to maintain the fidelity of each step of protein synthesis, from initiation to termination. Ribosomes are extremely stable and the small and large subunits of the ribosome make extensive contacts with each other and with a long stretch of the mRNA. Additionally, the peptidyl transfer center maintains a water-tight seal to protect the peptidyl-tRNA from hydrolysis. The translation complex is therefore extremely stable, and must be actively disassembled after each round of translation. At the end of each protein coding reading frame, a stop codon signals the end of the peptide. Release factors make specific contacts with the stop codon and position a water molecule in the peptidyl transfer center to hydrolyze the peptidyl tRNA. Recycling factors can then disassemble the ribosome for a new round of translation. If no stop codon is present, the ribosome can not elongate or terminate the peptide. Instead, the ribosome is sequestered in a nonstop translation complex with the mRNA still bound and a peptidyl-tRNA remaining in the P site. Nonstop translation complexes arise so frequently that some estimates predict that each ribosome is bound up in a nonstop translation complex 5 times per cell division cycle. The findings in this dissertation will show that resolving nonstop translation complexes is essential in bacteria and human cells.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12167], "author_name_tesi": "Feaga, Heather Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Feaga", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Charles Keiler", "Kenneth Charles Keiler", "B Tracy Nixon", "Richard John Frisque", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Katsuhiko Murakami"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Charles Keiler, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth Charles Keiler, Committee Chair", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Outside Member", "Katsuhiko Murakami, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ribosome rescue", "translation", "trans-translation", "bacteria", "mitochondria", "Caulobacter crescentus"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Impact of body composition and exercise on food intake regulation in children", "id": "13349snf129", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13349", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent childhood obesity prevalence statistics suggest that 17% of children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 years are living with obesity. Determining alternative methods to decrease daily energy intake and increase energy expenditure is critical for childhood obesity prevention. A \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to treating obesity has not been effective. This dissertation is based on the Energy Balance Framework from Blundell and colleagues, which is a working model that describes the major influences on appetite control. Emerging research is working to better understand the dysregulation of energy balance, with recent studies in adolescents and adults. However, the effects of the energy balance system and appetite regulation pathways on food intake have not been fully examined in younger, pre-adolescent children. This dissertation extends previous research in these areas and examines the influences of individual differences in body composition and exercise on appetite regulation and food intake in children under the age of 12 years, across three separate cohorts of children. In three of the four papers of this dissertation, the role of fat-free mass as an appetitive driver in children emerged as a common theme, consistent with previous work in adults. There was limited evidence of an association between fat mass and food intake across the three cohorts of children studied. Exercise, compared to a sedentary control, was effective in reducing relative energy intake (i.e., energy intake adjusted for activity-related energy expenditure), but individual differences influenced these relationships. Children who rated the controlled bout of exercise as more difficult had greater ad libitum energy intake than children who rated it as easier. This finding demonstrates the potential for perceived exertion during exercise to influence food intake regulation. In addition to this cognitive factor, there may be individual differences in the brain\u2019s reward response to food-related cues that could also play a role in ingestive behavior. Therefore, the work in this dissertation highlights the role of the brain in the determination of energy balance-related behaviors. Collectively, the findings from these studies provide support for the Energy Balance Framework and extend these findings to pre-adolescent children. These three cross-sectional studies represent a few steps towards understanding the influences of body composition and exercise on food intake regulation in children. Additional longitudinal studies in these areas will aid in the understanding of the reciprocal interactions between energy expenditure, energy intake, and body composition over time. These studies may also inform the development of more effective and sustainable tailored weight management interventions.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13153], "author_name_tesi": "Fearnbach, Stephanie Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Fearnbach", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Loralee Keller", "Kathleen Loralee Keller", "Barbara Jean Rolls", "Rebecca L Corwin", "Charles Geier", "Danielle Symons Downs", "David Thivel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Loralee Keller, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathleen Loralee Keller, Committee Chair", "Barbara Jean Rolls, Committee Member", "Rebecca L Corwin, Committee Member", "Charles Geier, Outside Member", "Danielle Symons Downs, Outside Member", "David Thivel, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nutrition", "exercise", "childhood obesity", "energy balance", "body composition", "eating behavior"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Microwave Absorption and Heating in Copper Powder-metal Compacts\n\n", "id": "10611", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3539", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A decade ago, Roy and co-workers demonstrated that powder-metal compacts may be heated in both electric and magnetic microwave fields.  However, what remained unclear was an explanation of the origin of the heating trends, especially with regard to the direct interaction of microwaves with powder-metal compacts.  To address this question, we have systematically studied the absorption and dissipation of microwave energy in porous, copper-powder-metal compacts.  This study was accomplished through two main experimental thrusts: first, by characterizing heating behavior of the compacts as a function of microwave field (electric vs. magnetic), sample density, particle size, particle separation (oxide layer), and by observing the resulting microstructure evolution due to heating.  For the heating experiments, we employed a single-mode, 2.45 GHz microwave system in which a sample could be placed in a nearly pure electric- (E) or magnetic- (H) field with the sample surface temperature measured by infrared pyrometry.  Second, we observed the trends in the effective conductivity, permittivity, and permeability of the compacts as a function of exposure-time to the separate E- and H-fields.  By measuring the change in the quality factor and resonant frequency of a TM010 resonant microwave cavity with and without the samples, we determined the real and imaginary components of the permittivity and permeability by cavity perturbation theory.  Our studies confirm or establish three key results: at 2.45 GHz, magnetic dissipation is favored over electric in powder-metal compacts made with particle-sizes greater than the skin depth; magnetic dissipation is strongly dependent on particle-size, peaking near 6 microns; and an intrinsic oxide layer or other inter-particle separation is necessary for microwave dissipation to occur.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3520], "author_name_tesi": "Feather, Kelly Renee", "last_name_ssi": "Feather", "middle_name_ssi": "Renee", "first_name_ssi": "Kelly", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darin Zimmerman", "Darin Zimmerman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darin Zimmerman, Thesis Advisor", "Darin Zimmerman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["composite materials", "complex permeability", "Microwave heating", "metals", "copper", "sintering", "complex permittivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Online Detection of Water and Coolant in Engine Oil", "id": "13887dpf5013", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13887", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An online fluid property sensor was used to analyze the effects of small amounts of water and glycol-based coolant contamination in engine oil.

Sub-saturation levels of water contamination were introduced to oil via humid air in an environmental chamber.

Students in this study attended a high school life skills class in a rural school district during the fall 2013 semester.  Four students participated in this study, two males and two females.  Specifically, the purposes of this study were to  (a) describe students\u2019 processing of the augmented reality enhanced books by analyzing their spontaneous and prompted verbalizations; (b) identify students\u2019 perceived vocabulary word knowledge through a survey that is completed before  and after the augmented reality reading activity;  (c) examine students\u2019 vocabulary word knowledge as mean scores of criterion-referenced worksheets that were completed before and after the augmented reality activity and by their responses to prompted questions within the AR book. This study was guided by the following central research question: How does the use of an augmented reality book that is enhanced with layers of technological, instructional, and conceptual scaffolds, influence vocabulary knowledge and verbal responses of students who are diagnosed with special needs? \n\tThe iPad2, reading textbook, Aurasma, Muvizu, Audacity, and Glogster.edu were used to create the AR books.  This study lasted for four consecutive weeks, and collected approximately 24 hours of data, which consisted of student observations, transcripts, video data, perceived knowledge surveys, and criterion referenced worksheets.  Data were analyzed using an adapted coding scheme from Zimmerman and colleagues (2013), a perceived knowledge survey, and by assessing vocabulary depth knowledge through a matching worksheet, and using an adapted coding scheme by Christ, Wang, and Chiu (2011). \n\tFindings indicated that students participated in the perceptual talk category most often followed by conceptual, device use, unable to answer, affective, questioning, connecting, and learner awareness.  Another finding was that students\u2019 perceptions of vocabulary knowledge did not always match what was reflected in the transcripts, however, students\u2019 perceptions did move in a positive direction.  A third finding was students either maintained their knowledge of vocabulary words, or increased their scores from before the activity to after the activity on the worksheet.  In addition, students created novel sentences using the target vocabulary words more than half of the time.  Some implications for future research include varying the prompts to elicit a broader and deeper range of processing types.  In addition, given this sample, it is unclear as to the effectiveness of asking students their perceptions of what vocabulary they do and do not know prior to reading.  Lastly, providing students with a more direct prompt asking for a novel sentence might elicit a unique expressive response that could be categorized as a higher-level sentence.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9573], "author_name_tesi": "Fecich, Samantha Jo", "last_name_ssi": "Fecich", "middle_name_ssi": "Jo", "first_name_ssi": "Samantha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Learning, Design, and Technology ", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Susan Land", "Heather A Zimmerman", "Roy Clariana", "Kathryn D R Drager"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Susan Land, Dissertation Advisor", "Heather A Zimmerman, Committee Member", "Roy Clariana, Committee Member", "Kathryn D R Drager, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["augmented reality", "mobile device", "literacy", "special education"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "BDI Plan Update In Dynamic Environments\n", "id": "10109", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "352", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multi agent systems and agent oriented programming are becoming more popular each year and is even considered to be the successor to object oriented programming.  Many agent frameworks implement various models of agency including one of the most popular models, known as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI).  The most researched part of the BDI model is the intention module which involves planning.  The planning includes tasks that are run to satisfy a specific goal or condition that may be associated with the plan.  The most common recent implementation of the intention module is known as the Conceptual Agent Notion (CAN) and its successor (CANPLAN).  Some other implementations are JADE and SPARK agent frameworks.  Most agent frameworks discuss updating only in the sense of belief updates about the environment.  There is very little discussion about how to update a plan that is in the process of running when the environment changes.  This type of plan updating is the focus of this thesis.\n\nMost agent frameworks discuss plan updating in the context of conflict management, plan failure or plan aborting.  This assumes that something has already gone wrong and that steps should be taken to fix the problem.  Other methods of plan updating include an update when new important information is gathered by the agent.  There are two methods for updating in the context of new information which are to update after the intention finishes and the other is to stop execution, update, and then restart.  There are many examples of processes that effectively execute using one of the two updating methods.  However, these methods of updating are insufficient in many situations that come up in modern agents.\n\nThe method of plan updating that is introduced in this thesis is to update on the fly when new relevant information is gathered by the agent.  Updating on the fly is different from the other two methods of updating in that the agent will pause execution of the intention, run update tasks and update bindings, and then continue execution of the intention.  This thesis discusses in detail the full implementation of the BDI model used, as well as the new method of plan updating.  An example showing the usefulness of updating on the fly is also discussed giving test data and results.  The agent used is a driving simulation agent that drives from one place to another along a route and encounters traffic along the way.  Using the implementation of the BDI architecture with plan updating on the fly the agent successfully updates the driving plan to take into account new information, which in this case is the traffic.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [347], "author_name_tesi": "Fecteau, Anthony Roman", "last_name_ssi": "Fecteau", "middle_name_ssi": "Roman", "first_name_ssi": "Anthony", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Yen", "Tracy Mullen", "Wang Chien Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Yen, Thesis Advisor", "Tracy Mullen, Thesis Advisor", "Wang Chien Lee, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["plan abort", "plan fail", "plan update", "multi agent systems", "intelligent agents", "artificial intelligence", "r-cast", "BDI", "plan task execution", "plan step execution", "update dispatcher"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ADDING FEATURES TO DIRECT REAL TIME SEMI-DENSE MONOCULAR SLAM", "id": "13503clf189", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13503", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is the problem of determining both the position of a sensor while simultaneously mapping the environment.

Data comes primarily from 96 interviews with 83 engineering faculty, administrators, students, and various internal and external collaborators, supporters, and partners associated with this process, collected over a 10-month period. Analyses produced description of the process of curriculum innovation, and focused in particular on the perspectives and actions not only of the engineering instructor, as a curriculum entrepreneur, but also those who supported, contributed to, or viewed themselves as competitors of the program.

Our lab has demonstrated that UVB-induced activation of mTORC2 controls tumor initiation by enhancing the survival of damaged cells. FOXO3a is an important regulator of apoptosis and tumor suppressor in several types of cancer and is negatively regulated by mTORC2. Importantly, the role of FOXO3a in UVB-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes has yet to be studied.\nTo investigate the role of mTORC2 and FOXO3a in UVB-induced apoptosis, we utilized inhibitors and shRNA targeting FOXO3a and components of mTORC2 in cells exposed to an apoptotic dose of UVB. We established that loss of mTORC2 causes FOXO3a to be localized to the nucleus and sensitizes cells to UVB-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, this sensitization was rescued by knockdown of FOXO3a. Additionally, we showed that inhibiting mTORC2 increases the FOXO3a-dependent protein expression of TRAIL and the BH3-only protein NOXA, suggesting activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis. Using CRISPR/CAS9 technology to target TRAIL, as well as lentiviral shRNA against both TRAIL and NOXA, we found that only knockdown of NOXA is able to rescue the increased apoptosis following mTORC2-inhibition in a manner similar to that of FOXO3a.\nThe Regulated in DNA damage and Development 1 (REDD1) protein is a stress response protein that is activated by DNA damage and negatively regulates mTORC1, though the exact mechanism remains unclear. Importantly, the role of REDD1 in UVB-induced apoptosis has not been studied. To investigate this question, we used human keratinocyte HaCaT cells with REDD1 knockout via CRISPR-CAS9 and exposed them to an apoptotic dose of UVB. Chemical inhibitors of mTOR signaling were used to study the relationship of mTOR/AKT to REDD1. The UVB-induced apoptotic response was analyzed a by immunoblot analysis of apoptotic proteins and levels of apoptosis were quantified via annexin V/7-AAD FACS analysis. Notably, REDD1 knockout sensitized cells to UVB-induced apoptosis, which was surprisingly independent of both mTOR complexes.

The theoretical framework was Sierpinska\u2019s (1992, 1994) Indicators of Mathematical Understanding:  identification, discrimination, generalization, and synthesis.  Fourteen prospective secondary mathematics teachers were recruited, nine from a land-grant university and five from a private college.\n\nThree sets of items identified as assessing the concept of function were administered during the study.  Two sets were taken from items released by the Educational Testing Service PRAXIS SeriesTM, 21 multiple-choice items and 5 constructed-response items.  A third set, the researcher-developed constructed-response items (RD CR), was based on a framework developed by the investigator.  Four experts in mathematics and mathematics education reviewed the framework as appropriate for creating items and recommended the inclusion of six RD CR items for the study. \n \nParticipants met with the researcher for four sessions to respond to the three sets of items in a problem-solving interview setting.  They shared their process of solution aloud as they solved each item.  Audio and video recordings were made of each session and then transcribed for purposes of analysis.  Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used to analyze data:  quantitative (correctness of response) and qualitative (foci of items, correctness of mathematical reasoning, mathematical reasoning involving the function concept, extended Function Block, strategies, and Sierpinska\u2019s Indicators of Mathematical Understanding).\n\nThe investigator\u2019s findings affirm the potential of the constructed-response items, particularly the RD CR items, to assess a subject\u2019s understanding of the concept of function as characterized by Sierpinska\u2019s Indicators of Mathematical Understanding, particularly generalization and synthesis.  The investigator questions the potential of the multiple-choice items to assess accurately a subject\u2019s understanding of the concept of function because of the implementation of multiple-choice test-taking strategies (matching, elimination, substitution, etc.) and the use of mathematical reasoning not involving the concept of function.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8988, 8989, 8990, 8991], "author_name_tesi": "Feeley, Susan Jane", "last_name_ssi": "Feeley", "middle_name_ssi": "Jane", "first_name_ssi": "Susan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Glendon Wilbur Blume", "Mary Kathleen Heid", "Nigel David Higson", "Rose Mary Zbiek"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Glendon Wilbur Blume, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Kathleen Heid, Committee Chair", "Nigel David Higson, Committee Member", "Rose Mary Zbiek, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Understanding", "Function", "Secondary Mathematics Teachers", "Assessment", "Multiple-Choice Items", "Constructed-Response Items", "Sierpinska", "Indicators of Understanding", "Certification"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Perceptions of Executive Coaching as Shared by Four Executives in Central Pennsylvania", "id": "21580", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10016", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to define and understand the perspectives of four executives from differing fields of industry in the Central Pennsylvania area regarding their perceptions of executive coaching in order to gain a deeper understanding of the definition, value, and benefits of executive coaching in the selected geographic region and across the targeted categories of the companies chosen for this study. Data were collected through pre-constructed, semi-structured interviews conducted with each of the four executives. The participants were each asked 11 pre-constructed questions for the purpose of gathering information to answer the research questions about their perceptions of executive coaching. This study was modeled as a replication of a study conducted by Dr. John Stevens Jr., where seven CEOs and presidents were interviewed using the same instrument. Information for this study was gathered using the multiple-case study method for the purpose of answering research questions about the shared perceptions of executive coaching by the four participants.\n\tSome of the expectations the researcher had when conducting by research question (RQ) were: RQ1 executives consider trust, openness, and willingness to work through the process to be attributes of successful executive coaching engagements. RQ2 failure to develop a trust based relationship between the executive and the coach is considered to be an attribute of ineffective executive coaching engagements. RQ3 confidentiality is considered to be a key element and that executives would have expectations of confidentiality. RQ4 Executives consider training in business and psychology to be important assets of executive coaches.  RQ5 Executives would prefer external to internal executive coaches. \nSome of the findings from this study by research question: RQ1 some of the important attributes found in successful executive coaching engagements are trust, a feeling of comfort, and commitment to the process. RQ2 Ineffective executive coaching engagements lack trust between the coach and the executive, and are characterized by having an executive who believes that there is no need for change.  RQ3 confidentiality is an essential part of executive coaching. RQ4 executive coaches should have business training and knowledge as well as some psychology training in order to be effective.

A total of six institutions took part in this qualitative study. The study has resulted in a portrait of the steps institutions took in reaction to the market downturn (like financial initiatives and programs). Lessons learned by these institutions will inform the collegiate financial officer community of relevant practices and policies. This study is additive to the\ngrowing literature on financial management of higher education. Strategies employed by\nthese institutions could be applicable to all institutions interested in reducing costs and/or\nenhancing revenues.\n   The conceptual framework found in Chapter Three presented an initial hierarchy between revenue enhancements and cost containment. This research found that the process is more dynamic; that is, it is more fluid and less hierarchical. The process is complex where revenues and expenditures are considered together in a holistic fashion. Since the six institutions researched believed the recent recession was a minor event, the processes they followed may only describe institutional behavior when temporary cuts are needed. It seems that student fees are constantly under consideration in the budgetary\nprocess.\n    Four of the six institutions experienced enrollment growth since 2000. Without this growth, the institutions would have needed to substantially increase fees, make additional cuts or containments in expenses, or find alternative revenues. Many of these institutions increased their tuition discounting during the same period and maintained a healthy gap between net revenues and net expenses. These institutions cannot grow\nforever and eventually, as they achieve campus capacity, their enrollments will stabilize.\nWhen they lose the ability to contain costs through growth, these institutions will need to\nescalate revenue enhancements (like tuition hikes), reduce their tuition discounting, or cut\ncosts (probably a combination of the three). If the next financial market downturn hits when enrollment is flat or falling, its impact will be greater than the experience of the downturn studied.\n     This research provided a holistic description of not only the impact of and\nreaction to the recent financial market downturn, but also the institutional attributes that\nappear to influence the coping mechanisms. The research should serve as a foundation for\nfuture study. The research should be deepened by further exploring institutional frugality\nand endowment payout methods.

Early treatment is necessary to limit the potential for irreversible organ damage2,3. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial drug, is widely used in the treatment of both diseases1,4. However, it is unknown whether HCQ slows the progression of ILE to systemic lupus. The Study of Antimalarials in Incomplete Lupus Erythematosus (SMILE), a 96-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, recently was initiated in autumn 2017. This trial proposes to quantify the effectiveness of HCQ to slow or halt the progression of incomplete lupus into systemic lupus, as defined by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria.\nThe purpose of this thesis is to calculate statistical power and necessary sample size for the SMILE trial. Of primary interest is the risk of accumulating one or more SLICC criteria; secondary outcomes of interest include the risk of progressing from ILE to SLE, as well as changes in 52 soluble mediators and 13 autoantibodies over the course of the study. Original estimates for expected risk between treatment and placebo groups were provided by the principal investigators, and additional simulations to account for variance in risk estimates, inflation of sample size, and increased loss to follow-up were performed.\nForty percent of patients receiving placebo and 20% of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine are expected to accumulate at least 1 SLICC criteria throughout the course of the study. With a total of 180 subjects, there is 90% statistical power to detect a statistically significant difference with a two-sided, 0.05 level test between treatment and placebo groups. Total patient recruitment may be inflated to 240 subjects to allow for up to 25% loss to follow-up while maintaining 90% statistical power. Statistical power to detect a significant difference between treatment and placebo groups with a two-sided, 0.05 level test is decreased when the risk ratio between groups is decreased, and increased when the proportion of patients accumulating SLICC criteria increased. \nOverall, the SMILE trial is well-powered to detect a significant difference in the risk of accumulating one or more SLICC criteria between treatment and placebo groups with a target sample size of 180 subjects needed to complete the trial. Statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes also are detectable at this sample size. However, previous clinical trials of lupus patients have shown relatively large loss to follow-up in this population. Therefore an enlarged target sample size of 240 subjects is appropriate for the SMILE trial.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15673], "author_name_tesi": "Feger, Danielle Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Feger", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Danielle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vernon Chinchilli", "Duanping Liao", "Nancy Olsen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vernon Chinchilli, Thesis Advisor", "Duanping Liao, Committee Member", "Nancy Olsen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["power calculation", "sample size", "clinical trial", "lupus", "systemic lupus erythematosus", "incomplete lupus", "loss to follow-up"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Reconstructing Paleoclimates on West Antarctic Ice Sheet Using Ice Core Bubble Number-Density\n\n", "id": "10327", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2857", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new paleoclimatic indicator based on ice core bubble number-density shows a ~1.7\u00b0C cooling from ~257 B.C.E. to ~1686 C.E. at the WAIS Divide site in West Antarctica.  Independent estimates of paleoclimatic variables increase our confidence in reconstructions.  It is known that density increase and grain growth in polar firn are both controlled by temperature and accumulation rate, and the integrated effects are recorded in the number-density of bubbles as the firn changes to ice (Spencer and others, 2006).  Number-density is conserved in bubbly ice following \u201cpore close-off\u201d, allowing reconstruction of either paleotemperature, or paleo-accumulation rate if the other is known.  In this study, a new quantitative late-Holocene paleoclimate reconstruction is presented for West Antarctica that made use of new data obtained from the WAIS Divide field site, and the new steady-state bubble number-density model developed by Spencer and others (2006).  Using samples taken from the WDC06A ice core drilled during the \u201807-\u201908 West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide field season, bubble sections were prepared and digitally imaged at the National Ice Core Lab in Lakewood, CO. These images were then manipulated, error-checked and reduced into workable bubble number-density data.  For dating purposes and annual layer thicknesses, a preliminary chemistry-based depth-age scale for the WDC06A core was used (McConnell, 2009).  Accumulation rates were estimated from the layer thickness after correcting for ice-flow strain (a small correction made using a Nye model) and for densification.  (The results are thus subject to revision pending finalization of the depth-age scale for WDC06A).  The accumulation rates and bubble number-density data were then used to estimate paleotemperatures, finding a linear cooling of ~1.7\u00b0C \u00b1 0.7 between ~257 B.C.E. and ~1686 C.E.  This late-Holocene cooling is consistent with new &#948;18O isotope-derived temperature data (Steig, 2009), modeled borehole temperature data (personal communication from A. Orsi, 2009), and newly modeled elevation data (Pollard & DeConto, 2009; personal communication from D. Pollard, 2009) for WAIS Divide.  These results could be indicative of a Little Ice Age (LIA) event in West Antarctica, although paleotemperature \u00acdata from additional sites would help to corroborate this.  The bubble number-density model itself was further validated in this study by an observed ~9% increase in accumulation rate per degree of positive temperature change.  This observation is consistent with saturation vapor pressure values (Denton and others, 2005).\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2853], "author_name_tesi": "Fegyveresi, John Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Fegyveresi", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard B Alley", "Richard B Alley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard B Alley, Thesis Advisor", "Richard B Alley, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["climate", "paleoclimate", "ice core", "bubble number-density", "reconstruction", "West Antarctica", "modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Physical Properites of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide Deep Core: Development, Evolution, and Interpretation", "id": "23749", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10546", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The physical properties of the WAIS Divide deep ice core record meteorological conditions during and shortly after deposition, mean temperature during transformation to ice, deformation within the ice, and may retain information on past surface elevations.

My observations of the core were supplemented by near-surface studies spanning five consecutive austral summer seasons (2008-2012).  Near-surface processes including intense summertime solar heating produce distinct seasonal strata.  Prominent \u201cglazed\u201d crusts form very near the surface during times of steep temperature gradients and subsequently develop polygonal cracks, allowing ventilation of deeper firn.  The near-surface seasonal contrasts persist to, and beyond the bubble-trapping depth, where they have a weak effect on total trapped air.  A new record of total air content also shows that impurities may affect this important parameter, complicating interpretation of past elevation changes.  Paleoclimatic interpretation of the number-density of bubbles is extended successfully here through the \u201cbrittle ice\u201d zone, providing a record of surface temperature spanning ~5500 years.  This new record reveals relatively stable values through the first half of the interval, with a very-slight warming early, followed by a slight cooling over the most recent two millennia.  Bubbles were found to be preferentially elongated parallel to the basal planes of enclosing grains, with less overall elongation of bubbles in grains with lower resolved shear stresses on their basal planes, as expected if grain deformation occurs primarily on basal planes and proportional to the stress.

Phosphazenes are inorganicorganic\nmaterials that provide unusal synthetic advantages and unique process features\nthat make them useful in energy research. This particular thesis consists of six chapters\nand is focused on four specific aspects: lithium battery, solar cell, and fuel cell\nelectrolytes, and artificial muscles.\nChapter 1 is written as an introduction and review of phosphazene electrolytes\nused in energy applications. In this introduction the basic history and characteristics of\nthe phosphazenes are discussed briefly, followed by examples of current and future\napplications of phosphazene electrolytes related to energy. Notes are included on how the\nrest of the chapters relate to previous work.\nChapters 2 and 3 discuss the conductivity and fire safety of ethyleneoxy\nphosphazene gel electrolytes. The current highly flammable configurations for\nrechargeable lithium batteries generate serious safety concerns. Although commercial fire\nretardant additives have been investigated, they tend to decrease the overall efficiency of\nthe battery. In these two chapters the discussion is focused on ionically conductive, nonhalogenated\nlithium battery additives based on a methoxyethoxyethoxyphosphazene\noligomer and the corresponding high polymer, both of which can increase the fire\nresistance of a battery while retaining a high energy efficiency. Conductivities in the\nrange of 10&#8722;4 Scm&#8722;1 have been obtained for self-extinguishing, ion-conductive\nmethoxyethoxyethoxyphosphazene oligomers. The addition of 25 wt% high polymeric\npoly[bis(methoxyethoxyethoxy)phosphazene] to propylene carbonate electrolytes lowers\nthe flammability by 90% while maintaining a good ionic conductivity of 2.5\u00d710&#8722;3 Scm&#8722;1.\nChapter 2 is focused more on the electrochemical properties of the electrolytes and how\nthey compare to other similar materials, while Chapter 3 emphasizes the flammability\nstudies.\nChapter 4 expands the application of the ethyleneoxy phosphazene system to dye\nsensitized solar cell systems, and uses this material as a model for the study of electrodeelectrolyte\ninterfaces. We report here the results of our study on polymer electrolyte\ninfiltration and its effect on dye-sensitized solar cells. In-depth studies have been made to\ncompare the effects of different cell assembly procedures on the electrochemical\nproperties as well as infiltration of electrolytes into various electrode designs. The first\npart of the study is based on the use of thermoplastic phosphazene electrolytes and how\nthe overall fabrication procedure affects electrochemical performance, and the second is\nthe use of cross-section microscopy to characterize the degree of electrolyte infiltration\ninto various nanostructured titanium dioxide electrode surfaces. The results of this study\nshould eventually improve the efficiency and longevity of thermally stable polymer dye\nsolar cell systems.\nIn Chapter 5 the effect of pendant polymer design on methanol fuel cell\nmembrane performance was investigated. A synthetic method is described to produce a\nproton conductive polymer membrane with a polynorbornane backbone and inorganic\u2013\norganic cyclic phosphazene pendent groups that bear sulfonic acid units. This hybrid\npolymer combines the inherent hydrophobicity and flexibility of the organic polymer\nwith the tuning advantages of the cyclic phosphazene to produce a membrane with high\nproton conductivity and low methanol crossover at room temperature. The ion exchange\ncapacity (IEC), the water swelling behavior of the polymer, and the effect of gamma\nradiation crosslinking were studied, together with the proton conductivity and methanol\npermeability of these materials. A typical membrane had an IEC of 0.329 mmolg&#8722;1 and\nhad water swelling of 50 wt%. The maximum proton conductivity of 1.13\u00d710&#8722;4 Scm&#8722;1 at\nroom temperature is less than values reported for some commercially available materials\nsuch as Nafion. However the average methanol permeability was around 10&#8722;9 cms&#8722;1,\nwhich is one hundred times smaller than the value for Nafion. Thus, the new polymers\nare candidates for low-temperature direct methanol fuel cell membranes.\nFinally, Chapter 6 focuses on the electroactivity of a mixed-substituent\nphosphazene electrolyte and its viability as an actuator material. We report here an\nelectrochemically responsive polymer hydrogel based on ionic crosslinking. The\ncrosslinking by metal cations and anionic carboxylic acid side groups can be controlled\nby redox reactions. The crosslinks dissociate when the cation crosslinker is reduced to a\nlower oxidation state and reform following oxidation, which leads to a reversible and\nlocalized swelling\u2013contraction. By choosing biocompatible components and\nminiaturization designs, the system has potential in microrobotic and biomedical\napplications.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5940], "author_name_tesi": "Fei, Shih-To ", "last_name_ssi": "Fei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shih-To", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock", "Harry R Allcock", "Tom Mallouk", "Mary Beth Williams", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock, Dissertation Advisor", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Chair", "Tom Mallouk, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Williams, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lithium battery", "electrolyte", "Phosphazene", "fuel cell", "solar cell", "actuator"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Early Development of Mixed-oak Forest Stands\n", "id": "6456", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5944", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Throughout eastern America, natural regeneration of oaks (Quercus spp.) is often difficult to obtain even where oaks are dominant components in the overstory before harvest.  Our understanding of the reasons for this is in part hindered by insufficient quantitative, descriptive information about stands undergoing this process.  This study examines the composition, development, and constraints of regeneration of mixed-oak stands in the central Appalachians and proposes methods for quantifying the regeneration process.\nThe study employs four datasets collected in mixed-oak stands in the Ridge and Valley and the Appalachian Plateau physiographic provinces.  Two distinct forest subtypes, a red maple (Acer rubrum L.) \u2013 northern red oak (Q. rubra L.) \u2013 hayscented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula (Michaux) Moore) subtype and a red maple \u2013 chestnut oak (Q. montana Willd.) \u2013 blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) subtype, were identified in the study area.  Red maple was the most abundant species across the study area.  Northern red oak was the most abundant oak species on the Allegheny Plateau physiographic province, while chestnut oak was the most abundant oak species in the Ridge and Valley province. Comparison of overstory tree and advance regeneration importance values suggests a trend that red maple is expanding its dominance from the Allegheny Plateau to the Ridge and Valley and black birch (Betula lenta L.) is expanding from the Ridge and Valley to the Allegheny Plateau, while white oak (Q. alba L.) and chestnut oak are losing their prominence in both physiographical provinces but especially on the Allegheny Plateau.\nAssociations were found between tree regeneration and biotic and abiotic factors.  Red maple is abundant on most sites, but high red maple abundance is commonly associated with moist, north-facing slopes with no or low cover of mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia L.) and hayscented fern.  On a plot-level basis, regeneration of the three oak species is greatly favored by the presence of overstory trees of their own kind.  White oak regeneration is favored by south-facing, gentle, lower slopes with soils in the Buchanan series.  Chestnut oak tends to be associated with south-facing, steep upper slopes with stony soils.  There is also a positive association between chestnut oak and the density of huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata (Wangh.) Koch).  Northern red oak is favored by north-facing, moist sites with Hazleton soil and low levels of mountain-laurel and hayscented fern.  \nStand development after overstory removal was studied separately for stump sprouts and seed origin regeneration.  Sprouting probability was high for red maple and generally fair for oak species; it was very poor for white oak.  Sprouting probabilities for all the oak species were significantly influenced by stump age and/or stump diameter.  On average, red maple had taller dominant sprouts, more sprouts per stump, and larger sprout crown diameters than other species, at least through age five.  The pattern of growth in red maple stump sprouts appears to give that species an early advantage in the capture of future growing space.  High overstory density, high sprouting and survival probability, and fast response to overstory removal makes red maple stump sprouts superior competitors with oak regeneration early in stand development.\nAnalysis of early-stage development of seed origin regeneration indicated that advance regeneration is the most important factor influencing regeneration abundance after harvest, except for black birch seedlings.  Small advance oak regeneration grew into larger size classes after overstory removal and contributed greatly to overall regeneration success as measured by cumulative height of seedlings per unit area, a composite index of density and size.  Overstory removal and herbicide treatment reduced the frequency of plots with problematic non-tree vegetation cover (> 30 percent), affording a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d for tree regeneration to establish and grow above the herbaceous layer.  Red maple was the most abundant species of regeneration both before and after harvest.  The principal advantage of red maple regeneration is its ability to accumulate in large numbers prior to harvest and carry these seedlings forward after overstory removal.  Oak species had a slower response to overstory removal than non-oak species, as measured by cumulative height, and their largest seedlings also had slower height growth rate than the largest seedlings of other species.  However, oak preserved its occurrence frequency and level of dominance in cumulative height at least through four years after harvest.\nRegeneration stocking charts and equations were developed for mixed-oak stands using average maximum stand density as a reference level.  Minimum stand density was estimated using crown area vs. seedling height relationship of open-growing seedlings.  A developmental shifting point was observed for both open-growing seedlings and seedlings with the maximum level of competition.  The crown width-seedling height ratio initially decreases rapidly as seedling height increases toward the shifting point, and then increases slowly after the shifting point as the tree grows further in height.  Stocking charts were built separately for plots having average seedling height below and above the shifting point by plotting cumulative height on the y-axis and number of seedlings on the x-axis on a log-log scale.  The resulting stocking charts and equations provide an objective basis for evaluating stocking of young regeneration in upland, mixed-oak forests. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5938], "author_name_tesi": "Fei, Songlin ", "last_name_ssi": "Fei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Songlin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kim C Steiner", "James Craig Finley", "Todd W Bowersox", "Ganapati P Patil", "Marc Eric Mcdill", "Alan H Taylor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kim C Steiner, Committee Chair", "James Craig Finley, Committee Member", "Todd W Bowersox, Committee Member", "Ganapati P Patil, Committee Member", "Marc Eric Mcdill, Committee Member", "Alan H Taylor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stump sprout", "stocking", "stand development", "Regeneration", "Appalachian Plateau"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "SINGLE PARTICLE IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION: 2D TO 3D IN CRYO-EM", "id": "12574maf46", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12574", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has begun to emerge as the front-runner for obtaining atomic resolution structures of protein complexes. The work presented here shows the multiplicity of cryo-EM with a reconstruction of a small, asymmetric protein complex and a larger, icosahedrally symmetric virus.\nAcetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase (CDH) is an anaerobic, bifunctional enzyme complex in M. acetivorans. Its enzymatic activities include CO dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA synthase. CDH is key in the conversion of acetate to methane, which accounts for two-thirds of Earth\u2019s biologically produced methane. This 258 kDa complex is comprised of five subunits, \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3,\u03b4, and \u03b5, which together, make up three functional components, Cdh\u03b2, Cdh\u03b1\u03b5, and Cdh\u03b3\u03b4 . Structures of components of CDH-like proteins from distant relatives to M. acetivorans have been solved though no further structures for the entire CDH complex or components have been determined.\nA preliminary 27 \u00c5 resolution CDH structure was reconstructed from a small data set imaged on an Ultrascan 4000 charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera in a JEOL 2100 LaB6 cryo-EM microscope. The preliminary structure shows features indicative of CDH function, including a channel where CO is transferred between subunits, thus confirming the ability to obtain a structure of CDH through cryo-EM. \nIn order to improve upon the resolution of the preliminary structure, a data set taken on a DED microscope is currently being processed. The end result will be a high resolution structure of CDH in which structural features of each domain can be recognized and determined. Obtaining the structure of CDH is revolutionary to the field of study and will allow for studies of CDH that have been inconceivable without a complete structure to be possible.\nCanine parvovirus (CPV) is a member of the Parvoviridae, a family composed of non-enveloped viruses around 25 nm in diameter and containing a single-stranded DNA genome.  Though CPV is a systemic disease, it typically manifests as enteritis in canines between the ages of six weeks and six months. The CPV capsid displays a T=1 icosahedral symmetry and is assembled from 60 copies of a major capsid protein, consisting of 90% viral protein 2 (VP2) and 10% of a minor capsid protein, VP1. In wild type CPV, 10% of the VP2 in a virus capsid gets cleaved between residues Asp269 and Cer270. These residues sit on the internal, three-fold axis of the capsid. The proteolytic activity that results in a cleavage at this site is unclear. By mutating residue 270 from a cysteine to a serine, the cleavage event does not occur and results in a 100-fold decrease in virus production during infection. Therefore, in order to perform additional tests, a virus-like particle (VLP) of the mutant and wild type were made and reconstructed. \nA 5.41 \u00c5 preliminary reconstruction of CPV-VLP mutant and a 7.73 \u00c5 preliminary reconstruction of CPV-VLP wild type resulted from data sets imaged on a FEI Falcon 2 DED installed on a FEG Polara G2 microscope. When a CPV wild type crystal structure was fit into the mutant preliminary reconstruction, there was no noticeable change at the three-fold of the virus where residue 270 resides. The data are still being processed to cut the particles down to the best of the best to obtain a high resolution structure for both VLPs. \nObtaining a high resolution reconstruction of both mutant and wild type VLPs will allow for a direct comparison of the two structures. A localized reconstruction of the inner three-fold of these two structures may allow for a better understanding for the asymmetric cleavage event as well as why this even will not occur with the Cys270Ser mutation.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14297], "author_name_tesi": "Feinberg, Mandi Alysson", "last_name_ssi": "Feinberg", "middle_name_ssi": "Alysson", "first_name_ssi": "Mandi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Hafenstein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Hafenstein, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cryo-electron microscopy", "Acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/ synthase", "Canine Parvovirus", "Virus-like Particle", "Cryo-EM", "CDH", "CPV"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "HOx Measurements Taken During The Southern\nOxidant And Aerosol Study (SOAS), 2013 Campaign\nAnd Their Implications For HOx Modeling", "id": "23633", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10735", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "OH and HO2, collectively referred to as HOx play a key role in removing many pollutants from the atmosphere.

It has been suggested that this discrepancy is due to unknown chemical mechanisms taking place in the atmosphere that are not being represented in chemical models. Other evidence\nindicates that this discrepancy is due to an interference source increasing the HOx concentrations being reported by some frequently used instruments in these low NOx/ high VOC environments. This paper examines HOx measurements from the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) and compares them to HOx concentrations predicted by the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism Version 2, a common atmospheric\nchemistry model. SOAS is an environment with low NOx and high biogenic volatile organic compounds with many supporting measurements that can be used to constrain the relevant chemistry in the model. To explore the discrepancy in measured versus modeled\nOH in these environments, two methods for making OH measurements were used during SOAS. One of these methods is the standard way that OH has been measured in the past. The other is a newer method for measuring OH, the results of which are compared\nto the standard method. The results of this study imply that the model with known chemical mechanisms is able to reproduce the measured OH and that some instruments making measurements of HOx may be affected by an unknown interference signal. However, measured HO2 is twice modeled HO2 and half of the measured OH reactivity is missing. Thus, while the current mechanism and support measurements are adequate for describing OH, they are missing some important chemistry needed to describe HO2\nand OH reactivity.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10363], "author_name_tesi": "Feiner, Philip Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Feiner", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Philip", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Henry Brune"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Henry Brune, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Atmospheric Chemistry", "HOx", "Chemistry", "Oxidation", "Meteorology", "Atmospheric Science"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The expression and conceptualization of motion through space and manner of motion in Persian and English: A comparative analysis", "id": "7876", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5035", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is a comparative analysis of English and Persian expressions of motion events.  More specifically, using a discourse analytic approach, the study investigates how speakers of Persian and English express motion through space, as well as manner of motion, in elicited narratives based on two short films.  The analytic unit in this dissertation is that of the \u201cmotion event\u201d based on Talmy\u2019s (1991, 2000) framework.  The cross-linguistic design of the study is intended to uncover the similarities and differences between the expressions of motion in English and Persian as well as to help investigate the standing of Persian with respect to Talmy\u2019s binary typology of Satellite- and Verb-framed languages, particularly as it compares to English.  The discourse analytic nature of the study in the uncovering of patterns of motion description is similar to Berman and Slobin (1994) and Slobin\u2019s (1987, 1996, 2000) line of research. \nThe analysis in this study illustrates that the rhetorical style exhibited in the Persian narratives is similar to what linguists would expect of prototypical V-languages in the expression of manner, static scene setting, and ground description.  The analysis also uncovers the salience of the deictic center as a grounding element and a significant factor in the conceptualization of motion through space in the Persian narratives.  However, as observed, the Persian narratives contain seeming anomalies with respect to path expressions, and as such present a mixed picture of Talmy\u2019s typology. \nSpecifically, this study has revealed a considerable number of path expressions that are encoded through path satellites in Persian(thereby resembling S-framed languages) as well as expressions of path with conflation of fact of motion (thereby resembling V-framed languages).  In addition, it is only through the predominant focus on the discourse in the Persian narratives that this study has revealed a third medium through which path conceptualizations emerge:  the medium of inference, where path is neither encoded by a satellite or conflated within a verb; rather, in such instances, path is contextually implied. \nThe findings of this dissertation illustrate that the concept of path conflation cannot account for the complex nature of path conceptualization within actual discourse.  In other words, the discourse-based nature of this study has been crucial to the uncovering of such fine-grained conceptual distinctions in path expressions that morpho-syntax alone could not reveal.  \nI hope this dissertation inspires further studies on Persian language in general, and discourse analytic approaches to Persian in particular, the latter of which are rare at best.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5011], "author_name_tesi": "Feiz Zarrin Ghalam, Parastou ", "last_name_ssi": "Feiz Zarrin Ghalam", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Parastou", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan G Strauss", "James Lantolf", "Karen E Johnson", "Philip Baldi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan G Strauss, Committee Chair", "James Lantolf, Committee Member", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Member", "Philip Baldi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["motion event", "path", "manner", "Persian", "discourse analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Coupled Nonequilibrium Flow, Energy And Radiation Transport For Hypersonic Planetary Entry", "id": "19764", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9257", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hypersonic atmospheric entry is an important problem for space exploration. Vehicles which travel through space and enter into planetary atmospheres often travel at extreme speeds, up to approximately 15 km/s. At these speeds, the flow around such blunt bodies has a strong bow shock, where temperatures rise higher than 10,000 K. At these tem- peratures air gas species tend to dissociate, and ionize. Chemical and thermal nonequi- librium may also exist, as the low densities result in fewer particle collisions. In these extreme conditions, radiative heat transfer may become important, both with respect to heat transfer to the vehicle, and to the composition of the surrounding fluid. The descrip- tion of radiative transfer in such flows requires accurate, and computationally efficient models for the solution of the radiative transfer equation (RTE). The present work is aimed at developing a series of methods which can accurately and efficiently solve the RTE, and which can be closely coupled to state-of-the-art hypersonic computational fluid dynamics solvers, to study the effects of radiation\u2013flow coupling. The methods developed here include a line-by-line (LBL) accurate tangent slab solver, which is the current state-of-the-art.

This re-examination leads in two directions. First, the relationship between Foucault\u2019s engagement with history-writing (Historie) and his philosophical reflection must be made more precise. It is sometimes suggested that Foucault historicizes the Kantian project of transcendental philosophy; rather than repeat the usual objections made to such a project, I will instead argue that what is needed is a properly critical investigation of the concept and practice of historicization itself. The seeds of such an investigation can already be found, however, in the reflections of the French Historical School (the Annales) on the problem of the multiplicity of historical durations, as well as in the contribution of French historical epistemology (especially Georges Canguilhem) to a historical philosophy of concepts. Foucault was familiar deeply familiar with both tendencies and with the larger 1960s French debate on historical time and the philosophy of history (L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Sartre, Althusser). Placed back into this context, his 1970s discussion of the event and eventalization (\u00e9v\u00e9nementialisation) takes on new clarity. Indeed, I will argue that Foucault\u2019s decisive philosophical statements are often worked out in dialogue with historians rather than with philosophers. Finally, by following the thematic of the relationship between philosophy and history, I propose a reconsideration of the standard periodizations of Foucault and a new focus on the shifts in his thought that occur in 1978.\n\nThis first direction, however, is inseparable from the second side of my dissertation: an investigation, via Foucault, of the concept of history itself. In this respect, Foucault might fruitfully be compared to other historico-philosophical treatments of the concept of history, such as those of Reinhart Koselleck or Jacques Ranci\u00e8re. A truly critical understanding of historicization will only be won through a virtuous back-and-forth between Foucault\u2019s genealogy of the concept of history and a clarification of his practice of historicization.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13931], "author_name_tesi": "Feldman, Alex J", "last_name_ssi": "Feldman", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Alex", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Lawlor", "Leonard Lawlor", "Robert Bernasconi", "Nancy Tuana", "Greg Eghigian", "Amy Allen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Lawlor, Dissertation Advisor", "Leonard Lawlor, Committee Chair", "Robert Bernasconi, Committee Member", "Nancy Tuana, Committee Member", "Greg Eghigian, Outside Member", "Amy Allen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Foucault", "history", "continental philosophy", "French philosophy", "politics of history"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "MENTAL ROTATION IN CHILDREN WITH ADHD: A DIFFUSION MODEL ANALYSIS", "id": "15226jpf5339", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15226", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "OBJECTIVE: In recent years, the diffusion model has helped link well-documented cognitive deficits observed in ADHD (i.e., slower, highly variable, and less accurate responses) to slower acquisition of information needed to identify correct responses (i.e., slower drift rate, or v). Given that these findings have come almost exclusively from a limited number of tests of executive functioning (EF), we tested whether similar atypicalities in nondecisional processes (Ter), response criteria (a), and v accounted for the slower and less accurate performance of children with ADHD on tests of visuospatial abilities. METHOD: A sample of 8-12-year-old children with (n = 229) and without ADHD (n = 101) completed three blocks (144 trials total) of a mental rotation task.  Participants indicated via key press whether a visually presented comparison stimulus (i.e., an upright stick figure) and a simultaneously presented target stimulus rotated a \u201csmall\u201d (i.e. \uf0a3 90\uf0b0) or \u201clarge\u201d (i.e., \uf0b3 90\uf0b0) amount were identical. RESULTS: Children with ADHD were less accurate and more variable than control subjects, but did not differ in response time (RT). The ADHD group exhibited slower drift rates and faster Ter, but no group differences for a emerged. However, compared to controls, children with ADHD did show smaller differences in response criteria between the small and large rotation conditions.

However, ecological research on race/ethnicity and violence has been limited almost exclusively to black-white comparisons and has overlooked Hispanics and other race/ethnic groups.  Additionally, studies on race/ethnicity, social structure, and violence have been limited in that they (1) continue to debate whether the structural sources of violence are \u201cracially invariant\u201d (similar), (2) have focused on the effects of disadvantage while often overlooking how segregation, immigration, and other structural factors influence violence across race/ethnic groups, and (3) have faced methodological limitations that may have biased prior findings about racial/ethnic differences in violence and the structural predictors of violence.  \nIn light of its recent population growth and the paucity of research in the area, the primary objective of this project is to expand ecological research on race/ethnicity and violence by examining the structural sources of Hispanic violence \u2013 both alone and compared to whites and blacks.  Three key questions about the relationship between race/ethnicity, social structure, and violence are addressed.  First, this project tests the racial invariance hypothesis, which argues that the structural sources of violence are similar across race/ethnicity.  Specifically, I examine whether the structural predictors of violence and especially the effects of disadvantage on violence are the same for whites, blacks, and Hispanics, and also whether support for the racial invariance argument depends on how invariance is defined (Chapter 2).  Second, moving beyond the effects of disadvantage, this project examines whether racial/ethnic isolation influences black and Hispanic violence and whether the effects of segregation on violence are similar/invariant across race/ethnicity (Chapter 3).  Third, focusing specifically on Hispanics, I examine whether immigration influences Hispanic violence and whether immigration disorganizes or stabilizes Hispanic communities.\nTo address these questions, I use arrest data on violent crime and measures of social structure for whites, blacks, and Hispanics for more than 200 census places across California and New York during the 1999 to 2001 period.  Data on white, black, and Hispanic violent crime are drawn from the California Arrest Data (CAL) and the New York State Arrest Data (NYSAD).  Race/ethnicity-specific measures of social structure are drawn from 2000 U.S. Census data for each race/ethnic group at the census place-level.  Seemingly Unrelated Regression techniques are used to compare the structural sources of violence across race/ethnic groups, and structural equation models are used to identify the total, direct, and indirect effects of immigration on Hispanic violence rates.\nFindings from Chapter 2 provide mixed support for racial invariance arguments and indicate that disadvantage contributes to violence for whites, blacks, and Hispanics.  However, the effects of particular structural predictors and the magnitudes of structural effects on violence vary widely across race/ethnicity.  Thus, the racial invariance hypothesis is not supported when using narrowly-defined interpretations and receives modest support when using the broadest possible definitions of \u201cinvariance.\u201d  \nChapter 3, which examines the effects of racial/ethnic segregation on black and Hispanic violence, also provides mixed evidence for the racial invariance hypothesis and reveals that being residentially isolated (from whites and from all other race/ethnic groups) contributes to Hispanic violence and black homicide but appears to reduce black Violent Index rates.  Additionally, findings suggest that segregation effects on violence for both blacks and Hispanics are mediated by concentrated disadvantage.  \nChapter 4 relies on social disorganization theory and community resource arguments drawn from the social capital perspective to examine the effects of immigration on Hispanic violence.  The findings from this chapter suggest that immigration has little direct effect on Hispanic violence.  However, immigration appears to have multiple, offsetting indirect effects on Hispanic violence that work through social disorganization and community resource/social capital measures.  The combination of these direct and indirect effects shows that immigration has little total effect on Hispanic violence.  Chapter 5 concludes by discussing important implications of this project for research and theory on the ecology of crime and the relationship between race/ethnicity, social structure, and violence.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [677], "author_name_tesi": "Feldmeyer, Ben ", "last_name_ssi": "Feldmeyer", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ben", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier", "Barrett Alan Lee", "Eric Silver", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer", "James Eisenstein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier, Committee Chair", "Barrett Alan Lee, Committee Member", "Eric Silver, Committee Member", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer, Committee Member", "James Eisenstein, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["race/ethnicity", "violence", "social structure", "racial invariance", "segregation", "immigration"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ON-DEMAND VIDEO PROCESSING IN WIRELESS NETWORKS AN APPLICATION: ACTION RECOGNITION", "id": "w0892992w", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12550", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the widespread use of mobile devices with built in cameras, the number of captured videos has increased.

Despite astounding advances in perinatal care, the incidence of cerebral palsy has changed little over the last 50 years.  This demands that we pursue alternative therapeutic strategies that will reduce the significant morbidity associated with perinatal H/I encephalopathy.\n\nThe revelation that the brain retains populations of neural stem cells throughout life offers the promise of endogenous regeneration following brain injury.  Already extensive data have demonstrated that new neurons are born after cerebral ischemia and migrate to sites of injury.  The existence of multipotential, self-renewing neural stem and progenitors, however, suggests that this response could be much more significant.  This thesis offers data indicative of a mobilization of this population following perinatal H/I.\n\nUsing a clonal assay to quantify neural stem and progenitors (NSPs), we demonstrated almost a doubling in the numbers of NSPs following perinatal H/I.  This was accompanied by the generation of larger neurospheres and increased symmetric proliferative divisions in vitro upon EGF and FGF-2 stimulation.  Furthermore, a higher proportion of the clonal neurospheres retained the capacity to generate all 3 neural cell types upon differentiation.  These effects were preceded by an upregulation of genes important in the regulation of NSP maintenance and proliferation, including notably the EGF receptor and Notch1.\n\nFurther investigation demonstrated that the larger size of neurospheres following perinatal H/I was due to increased proliferation, specifically in response to EGF stimulation.  These effects as well as the induction of Notch1, were dependent upon signals from mature cells as demonstrated by an in vitro paradigm of H/I injury.  Other components of the Notch signaling cascade were also induced specifically within the NSP niche of the subventricular zone (SVZ).  Pharmacological inhibition of this pathway using a well-characterized inhibitor of \u00e3-secretase that prevents release of the intracellular mediator, the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) effectively reduced both the increase in numbers of NSPs as well as the increase in tripotency of the neurospheres.\n\nThese data provide evidence of a mobilization of the NSP population in response to perinatal H/I.  A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these results will identify therapeutic targets for enhancing this response.  It is no longer acceptable to settle for just managing neurologic injuries such as perinatal H/I encephalopathy; we must pursue strategies to repair the brain after such damage.  This thesis demonstrates the basis for endogenous regeneration of the CNS following brain injury and describes several potential molecules that may be used to manipulate this response.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5168], "author_name_tesi": "Felling, Ryan J.", "last_name_ssi": "Felling", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Levison", "Teresa Wood", "James Robert Connor", "Sarah Bronson", "Charles Palmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Levison, Committee Chair", "Teresa Wood, Committee Member", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Charles Palmer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neural stem cells", "subventricular zone", "regeneration", "perinatal hypoxia ischemia", "neurogenesis", "notch"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "What can we learn from twin studies?

The classic twin study method compares the similarity of monozygotic (MZ) twins on some trait with the similarity of dizygotic (DZ) twins on that same trait.  If the rearing environments of MZ and DZ twins are analogous, then the magnitude of genetic influence on variation in a trait can be estimated based on the extent to which the correlation for MZ twins exceeds the correlation for DZ twins. If the rearing environments of MZ and DZ twins are not analogous, then the estimates of heritability generated from the classic twin study method may be confounded with differences between MZ and DZ twins in the similarity of their rearing environment.  It has long been established that MZ twins grow up in a more similar environment than do DZ twins.  However, behavior geneticists have generally asserted that the greater degree of similarity in the rearing environments of MZ relative to DZ twins does not bias the results of twin studies.  Behavior geneticists claim that the similarity in outcomes is largely unaffected by similarity in rearing environments for MZ and DZ twins. This claim is known as the equal environments assumption (EEA).\n\nIn this paper, I argue that the empirical support for the validity of the EEA is not as strong as some behavior geneticists have claimed.  I reanalyze some of the data on which ritually cited research on EEA is based, and I find that the evidence is more mixed than latter-day interpretations have suggested.   I expose some of the flaws in the research that is frequently cited by researchers in support of claims about genetic influence on behavior.    \n\nFinally, I conduct the most comprehensive evaluation of the equal environments assumption to date.  My analysis incorporates a larger and more diverse set of outcome variables than any previous research on the EEA.  In my analysis, I also use a more extensive set of controls for environmental similarity than any previous study.  Finally, unlike most if not all previous research on EEA, I generate estimates of genetic influence with and without controls for environmental similarity, in order to show the extent of EEA violation in a straightforward manner.\n\nThe findings are not easily categorized as supporting or undermining the EEA.  Some violations of EEA were found for some outcomes, but the bias caused by these violations is likely to be modest in most cases.  Researchers should not conduct twin studies without including controls for environmental similarity.  However, the findings also indicate that many of the results of twin studies are robust with these controls.  The flaws of twin studies are not fatal, but rather seem no worse (and maybe better) than the flaws of the typical causal study that relies on observational data.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2777], "author_name_tesi": "Felson, Jacob ", "last_name_ssi": "Felson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jacob", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John David Mccarthy", "John David Mccarthy", "Roger Kent Finke", "Alan Booth", "Katerina Bodovski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John David Mccarthy, Dissertation Advisor", "John David Mccarthy, Committee Chair", "Roger Kent Finke, Committee Member", "Alan Booth, Committee Member", "Katerina Bodovski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["equal environments assumption", "behavior genetics", "twin studies"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Outsourcing Under Uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9899", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "802", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I conduct three studies on outsourcing in emerging Market under uncertainty.

In flowering plants, it is incompletely understood how these events are genetically controlled. Because transcriptional and post transcriptional regulations are suggested to be main molecular mechanisms in these events, it is important to examine the changes of all transcripts (transcriptome) and proteins (proteome) during plant reproductive development. However, only limited studies have been done to analyze the transcriptome and proteome during plant reproductive development. Part of my thesis work is an analysis of the transcriptome in the tapetum, which is an important sporophytic tissue that contributes to microsporogenesis and pollen formation. It is known that DYSFUNCTIONAL TAPETUM1 (DYT1) and ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS), two bHLH transcription factors, are required for the development and functions of the tapetum. However, it is poorly understood which genes are regulated by DYT1 and/or AMS. In Chapter 2, a transcriptome analysis of the dyt1-1 and ams mutants by using microarray is presented. It was found that DYT1 positively and negatively regulates approximately 600 and 300 genes, respectively, and that AMS positively and negatively regulates ~600 and ~900 genes, respectively. DYT1 is required to control a broad spectrum of tapetum functions in part by activating at least 32 transcription factors including AMS. However, AMS regulates not only common but also different sets of genes compared to DYT1, which suggests AMS might have distinct functions. In order to differentiate the direct and indirect regulation by DYT1, I searched the binding sites of DYT1 by in vitro (Selex and gel-shift) and in vivo (ChIP) protein-DNA interaction experiments, which is described in Chapter 3. The results indicate that DYT1 recognizes the E-box (CANNTG) in vitro and binds to its own promoter and the promoters of downstream genes in vivo. These findings not only reveal the spectrum of functions regulated by DYT1 but also suggest some mechanisms of the transcriptional controls in the tapetum. In Chapter 4, I present a systematic exploration of Arabidopsis floral proteome where I identify more than 2400 floral proteins and provide pieces of evidence for protein modifications (methylation, acetylation, and glycosylation etc.) of some proteins by using 2-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis/mass spectrometry and Multidimensional Protein Identification Technique (MudPIT).

A successful example is the wide application of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) in formulating system design and analysis problems. From a theoretic point of view, such problems can be considered solved, as convex optimization can be solved reliably and efficient using interior-point methods or other methods available in the literature and/or commercial software. On the other hand, however, many challenging problems in system and control theory have been proven to be NP-Complete or NP-hard. Therefore, unless proven P=NP the best way to tackle these problems is to find approximate solutions using limited computational resources. Recent developments in polynomial optimization, which include moment-based approach and its dual sum-of-square method, sheds some light on solving some of those challenging problems, as it provides systematic approaches to build asymptotically convergent convex relaxations to a general polynomial optimization problem.\nIn this dissertation, we use this as the main optimization tool to address various important yet difficult problems in system and control theory. The problems addressed are categorized into four topics: 1) chance-constraint optimization, 2) distributional robustness, 3) hybrid system identification, and 4) generalized fixed order interpolation. The first two topics is closely related to the probabilistic framework developed in recent years. In the first topic, we design special polynomial functions and use them to develop deterministic approaches to address the probabilistic constraints. Comparing the scenario approach in the literature of probabilistic control, which give soft bounds on probability, our approaches provide hard bounds. The second topic is connected to system analysis with uncertainty under probabilistic framework, in a distributional-free manner. Instead of assuming some fixed distribution on the uncertainty, it aims at finding the worst-case expected performance of the system, assuming the distribution of uncertainty is unknown but obey some loose conditions. The last two topics addressed concern hybrid system identification and generalized interpolation. We first show that these problems can be equivalently reformulated as polynomial optimization problems. While the recent developed polynomial optimization tools can construct convex relaxations to these problems, the required computational cost is prohibitively large. It is not surprising as a polynomial problem is NP-hard in general.\nIn this dissertation, we exploit the very specific structure of these problems and provide numerically efficient algorithms to solve these problems.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1221], "author_name_tesi": "Feng, Chao ", "last_name_ssi": "Feng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "David Jonathan Miller", "Ji Woong Lee", "Qian Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Dissertation Advisor", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member", "Ji Woong Lee, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Robust Control", "Probabilistic Control", "Distributional Robustness", "Switched System", "Identification", "Interpolation"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "ECONOMIC MODELS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS: INTERNET AUCTIONS AND INFORMATION GATEKEEPERS", "id": "6159", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2719", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we study two important features of the\nmarketplace based internet economy-the emergence of information\ngatekeepers and the use of auction-like mechanisms to allocate and\nprice goods sold on the internet.\n\nThe first essay ``One Auction or Two?

HS-(aq) was calculated to be the dominant sulfide species from pH 7.9 to 12.4. After 60 hours, polarization resistance (Rpol) of S-135 and UD-165 generally increased as pH increased at lower PH2S (0 and 0.83 kPa), whereas Rpol decreased and then increased as pH increased at higher PH2S (8.3 and 69 kPa). At each pH, the lower PH2S increased Rpol or did not significantly change Rpol, whereas the higher PH2S decreased Rpol. Two opposite effects from H2S were proposed, an accelerating effect due to H2S(aq) and HS-(aq) facilitating the Faradaic reactions and the localized corrosion, and an inhibiting effect due to the protectiveness of the corrosion products. The inhibiting effect was often observed at relatively low H2S concentrations at pH 7.9 and 12.4.\n\nThe electrochemical impedance did not change significantly at different stir rates for both S-135 and UD-165, indicating that mass transport in the bulk solution was not the rate determining step.

Polarization resistance values of UD-165 at 200 \u00b0C were consistently one to two orders of magnitude lower than at 85 \u00b0C, which corresponded to a drastic increase in corrosion rate at elevated temperature.

NaCl brine. It was found that a CO2:H2S ratio as high as 1000 was still enough for sour corrosion to dominate the conditions tested. The CO2+H2S condition and H2S condition had the similar anodic and cathodic Tafel slopes, which were smaller than the CO2 condition.

Graphene is arguably the most famous material which displays remarkable mechanical, thermal and optical properties. However, its lack of an electronic bandgap, limits its application in many areas. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as WSe2, WS2, and MoS2 are another kind of 2D material with semiconducting character. Its direct band-gap feature and favorable electronic and mechanical properties, complement graphene, leading to applications in high-end electronic and optoelectronic applications. This dissertation explores the optical properties of these 2D materials by Raman spectroscopy and their potential applications in molecular sensing have been explored.\n      Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction of various 2D materials, including graphene and TMDs. Crystal structure as well as electronic band structures for these materials have been introduced together with some potential applications of the 2D materials.\n      Chapter 2 gives an introduction on Raman spectroscopy. As one of the heavily used characteristic techniques to probe the optical properties of 2D materials, Raman scattering processes are studied from both macroscopic and microscopic approaches. In addition, normal Raman spectra of 2D materials are measured and by analyzing the Raman spectra, various information about the sample, such as crystallinity, thickness, doping and strain could be obtained indicating Raman can serve as a powerful tool to study properties of 2D materials.\n      In chapter 3, nitrogen-doped (NG) and silicon-doped (SiG) graphene are successfully synthesized through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) setup.  A variety of techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy are used to characterize the sample and discover how nitrogen and silicon atoms are incorporated into the graphene lattice. \n      Chapter 4 demonstrates that when graphene monolayers are used as substrates to probe the Raman signal of various dye molecules, such as rhodamine B (RhB), crystal violet (CRV) and methylene blue (MB), intensities of the Raman signals from the dye molecules enhance a lot, giving the term as graphene-enhanced Raman scattering effect (GERS).  In addition, NG exhibits an extraordinary sensing properties when compared to PG sheets. For example, the Raman vibrational modes of these particular dye molecules can be detected for concentrations as low as 10-11 mol/L and very close to single molecule detection limit. This is the lowest ever reported value when using graphene as a substrate so far. Electronic structure calculations and the simulation of the Raman spectra, performed by our collaborator Dr. Maria Cristina dos Santos from Brazil, suggests that a charge transfer excitation and the proper aligning of the HOMO-LUMO gap of the molecules with respect to the Fermi level of graphene are the key reasons for this enhancement..\n      Chapter 5 demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy could be a significant tool to study 2D materials by two simple examples. By applying polarized Raman techniques, a new Raman active peak, which is associated with first-order out-of-plane vibrational mode in TMDs is observed. Further experiments and calculations demonstrate that this peak only exist in few layer TMDs materials and does not show in monolayer or bulk samples. The unique property of this mode could potentially provide an easy method to distinguish monolayer TMDs sample just by Raman measurements.

In this dissertation, the phase-field approach is combined with other models and algorithms to study the effect of elastic energy, anisotropic mobility and structural defects on phase separation kinetics and morphological evolution in bulk systems. \nA multi-dimensional general phase-field model has been developed by combining the iteration method for calculating the elastic energy and a semi-implicit spectral method for solving the Cahn\u2013Hilliard equation. The model can efficiently calculate the microstructure evolution for systems with rather general elastic anisotropies, arbitrarily large elastic inhomogeneity, general misfit strain, and large anisotropic mobility. The microstructure and structure functions have been studied to show the effect of large anisotropic mobility together with the elastic energy.\nTo address the challenge of large scale simulations of microstructures which are still computationally expensive to date, an adaptive semi-implicit Fourier spectral (AFSIM) method is developed to solve Allen-Cahn equation by making grid points spatially adaptive in the physical domain via a moving mesh strategy, while maintaining a uniform grid in the computational domain for the spectral implementation. The moving mesh method is adopted since it is particularly efficient among recent efforts in developing advanced numerical algorithms. The newly developed approach not only provides more accurate treatment at the interfaces requiring higher resolution, but also retains the numerical efficiency of the semi-implicit Fourier spectral method. Numerical examples using the adaptive moving mesh semi-implicit Fourier spectral method are presented for both two and three space dimensional microstructure simulations, and they are compared with those obtained by other methods. By maintaining similar accuracy, the proposed method is shown to be far more efficient than the existing methods for microstructures with small ratios of interfacial width to the domain size.\nThe AFSIM is further implemented to solve Cahn-Hilliard equation with inhomogeneous, anisotropic elasticity. Numerical implementations and test examples in both two and three dimensions are considered with a particular illustration using the well-studied example of mis-fitting particles in a solid as they approach to their equilibrium shapes. It is shown that significant savings in memory and computational time is achieved while accurate solutions are preserved.\nThe dynamics of the structure defects such as dislocations generally control the material properties during non-equilibrium processing. In phase-fields description, the dislocations exist only along the dislocations lines parallel to the slip planes.  The total dislocation line length to volume ratio in dislocation motion is expected to be significantly smaller than the total area to volume ratio for interface motion.  Therefore, AFSIM is extended to study the dislocation motion. By comparing the results with analytical solutions for accuracy and with results from the uniform Fourier-spectral semi-implicit method (UFSIM) for efficiency, it is shown that AFSIM yields much more accurate results for the dislocation stress field and is an order magnitude more efficient than the UFSIM for the same accuracy.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6548], "author_name_tesi": "Feng, Weiming ", "last_name_ssi": "Feng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Weiming", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Long Chen", "Long Qing Chen", "Zi Kui Liu", "Qiang Du", "Padma Raghavan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Long Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Chair", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Member", "Qiang Du, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phase-field", "microstructure", "moving mesh", "anisotropic mobility"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Rate transient analysis of gas/water two-phase reservoirs - a density-based approach", "id": "g158bh28p", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12577", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As natural gas becomes an important energy source, a number of studies have attempted to solve gas problems numerically or analytically.

The unique Trp C6-Leu C\u03b2 single bond linkage of the target molecule was constructed via a highly regio- and stereoselective palladium-catalyzed aminoquinoline carboxamide-directed C-H functionalization using an 8-aminoquinoline \u03b1-phthaloylleucinamide 86 and a fully functionalized 6-iodotryptophan derivative 122 as coupling partners. The \u03b1-amino group in the coupling product 125 was converted to an azido group to reduce steric hindrance around the leucine carbonyl in azide 126. The 8-aminoquinoline auxiliary was subsequently removed via a N-Boc activation/LiOH-cleavage sequence to afford the key azido acid 128, which was further elaborated to the left-hand ring peptide acid 135 of celogentin C (4). Compound 135 was further converted to 137 by peptide coupling with a proline benzyl ester. The key His-N/Trp C2 linkage embedded in the right-hand ring of the target molecule was furnished by adopting Castle\u2019s strategy which involved an NCS-mediated oxidative C-N \u03c3 bond formation of the Trp-C2 of intermediate 137 with the His-N1 of an Arg/His dipeptide.  The right-hand ring of the natural product celogentin C (4) was eventually formed via a macrolactamization to afford celogentin C (4) in 23 steps from simple \u03b1-amino acid building blocks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart II\nDivergent total syntheses of the unusual monoterpenoid indole alkaloids alstilobanine A (15), E (14) and angustilodine (13) in racemic form have been completed. The synthesis started with a highly efficient Michael addition of a dianion of indole diester 44 to \u03b1-chloro-3-piperidone-derived nitrosoalkene 25, which forged the C15-C16 \u03c3 bond, producing a pair of diastereomers 47 and 82. Subsequent functional group manipulation including a C15/C16 epimerization afforded the key C15/C16 anti-ketoacid 57.  A Romo nucleophile-promoted aldol-lactonization (NPAL) of 57 furnished the advanced pentacyclic intermediate 72 with the requisite C15, C19 and C20 stereochemical configuration for the target alkaloids. The C16 hydroxymethyl group was then introduced stereoselectively via alkylation of the enolate of NH indole \u03b2-lactone ester 89a with monomeric formaldehyde to afford C16 hydroxymethylated \u03b2-lactone 99, which was conveniently converted to the corresponding C17 OTBS diol 117. A two-step Appel iodination/palladium-catalyzed reductive deiodination sequence converted intermediate 117 to the C18 methyl compound 108  and utimately provided racemic alstilobanine A (15) after tosyl and TBS protecting group removal.  After numerous unproductive attempts to access angustilodine and alstilobanine E, a silver(I)-promoted cyclic hemithioketal formation/palladium-catalyzed silane-mediated desulfurization sequence was established using C16 hydroxymethyl dithioketal 165, which provided an efficient access to the key oxepane 136. Syntheses of the target alkaloids were completed using oxepane 136, which afforded racemic alstilobanine E (14) in 21 steps in 16% overall yield, and racemic angustilodine (13) in 22 steps in 13% total yield. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9377], "author_name_tesi": "Feng, Yiqing ", "last_name_ssi": "Feng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yiqing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven M Weinreb", "Gong Chen", "Gong Chen", "Steven M Weinreb", "Raymond Lee Funk", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich", "Yanming Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven M Weinreb, Dissertation Advisor", "Gong Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Gong Chen, Committee Chair", "Steven M Weinreb, Committee Member", "Raymond Lee Funk, Committee Member", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich, Committee Member", "Yanming Wang, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["total synthesis", "natural products", "C-H functionalization", "nitrosoalkene"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Liposome-Mediated Down-Regulation of Gastrin in Pancreatic Cancer Cells\n", "id": "9571", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1206", "abstract_tesi": "Pancreatic cancer is among the most aggressive and lethal of all forms of cancer.\nDeveloping novel treatment strategies against pancreatic cancer can lead to increased\nsurvival time and increased chances for surgical removal of pancreatic tumors.

Because of\nits growth-stimulating effects, gastrin is a potential target for therapeutic strategies. For\nthat reason, lowering gastrin production could possibly also inhibit the growth of\npancreatic cancer. To examine this possibility, we have developed a nanoliposome-based\ndelivery system to deliver anti-gastrin siRNA to pancreatic cancer cells.

However, the results obtained suggest a trend toward the down-regulation of gastrin\nmRNA as well as the inhibition of tumor growth.

The experience of perinatal loss is different from other types of loss through death because it represents the loss of future hopes, dreams, and parenthood.  The period that follows perinatal loss is referred to as perinatal bereavement.  Despite an overall decline in infant and fetal mortality, non-Hispanic Black adolescents continue to experience rates of perinatal loss that are higher than any other racial or ethnic group.  Adolescents are at higher risk for complicated grieving after perinatal loss due to the sudden nature of the loss and the potential negative stigma associated with the pregnancy.  Numerous research studies have focused on the experience of perinatal loss and bereavement, however, most research has concentrated on the experience of middle-class, adult White women.  Consequently, there is limited scientific literature available to describe the experience of perinatal loss and bereavement in African American adolescents. \n\nPurpose: The overarching goal of this study was to build an understanding of the experience of perinatal bereavement in non-Hispanic Black (African American) adolescent females after perinatal loss.  There were two specific aims: To generate a disclosive theory of perinatal bereavement in non-Hispanic Black adolescent females and to identify critical transitions in the perinatal bereavement process that may signal a need for well-targeted, culturally sensitive bereavement support services.\n\nMethods: This study used qualitative methods of grounded theory to explore the experience of perinatal bereavement in eight non-Hispanic Black adolescents (ages 18-21) who had experienced recent perinatal loss.  IRB approval was obtained from six urban hospitals with a high-risk perinatal population.  Potential participants were approached by the perinatal bereavement coordinator at each hospital using a script for recruitment.  Upon obtaining verbal consent, participants were followed with interviews at three points in time over 12 weeks following their loss.  Data were analyzed using constant comparative methods.\n\nResults: The outcome of this research is a grounded theory, \u201cEnduring to gain new perspective\u201d which discloses the main theoretical concepts of the experience, grounded in the data from the thick, rich descriptions of the participants.  Analysis of the data revealed the following theoretical categories: Life before pregnancy; Reacting to the pregnancy (sub-categories: accepting and attaching); Living through the loss event (sub-categories: emotional response and physical response); Seeking and receiving support; Maintaining relationship; Searching for meaning; and Gaining new perspective.  The core conceptual theme was \u201cEnduring the loss\u201d.\n\nConclusions: The theoretical concepts of the theory correspond in many ways to what other perinatal bereavement researchers have found, yet the manifestations of the experience within the non-Hispanic Black adolescents in this study were different, mostly attributed to age and culture.  This study offers new knowledge and suggestions for interventions that add to the perinatal bereavement science.  Perinatal bereavement is an interpretive process that is lived out in relation to the meaning that the adolescents ascribe to their pregnancy.  Young African American women in late adolescence attribute meaning to the experience of perinatal loss and bereavement in interaction with partners, family and friends, taking cues from their cultural norms and inherent value systems.  Over time, as they endured the loss, these adolescents gained new perspective on how they have changed from the experience and how the experience will shape their future.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3608], "author_name_tesi": "Fenstermacher, Kimberly H", "last_name_ssi": "Fenstermacher", "middle_name_ssi": "H", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith E Hupcey", "Judith E Hupcey", "Kim Kopenhaver Doheny", "Mary Beth Clark", "Carol S Weisman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith E Hupcey, Dissertation Advisor", "Judith E Hupcey, Committee Chair", "Kim Kopenhaver Doheny, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Clark, Committee Member", "Carol S Weisman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["grounded theory", "qualitative research", "perinatal bereavement", "perinatal loss"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Comprehensive Survey of Occupational Health Issues of Women Working on Dairy Farms in Pennsylvania", "id": "9850", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2031", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Women play a significant role in Pennsylvania production agriculture, thereby potentially exposing them to occupational health risks.  This cross-sectional study sought to assess the incidence of health conditions with a possible zoonotic origin in this underserved population.

In addition to providing demographic data, the survey respondents (n = 624) reported a low incidence of gastrointestinal illnesses, while respiratory problems which were reported by about 10%, were associated with lack of use of a breathing mask, and dermatoses, the most commonly reported conditions, were associated with growing fruits and/or vegetables, raising swine, and not wearing gloves.

A number of theoretical articles have addressed the issue of power in psychotherapy but very few empirical examinations have been published. This dearth of research regarding how power is used in psychotherapy is problematic in understanding power, particularly as it relates to quality of care issues. The Interpersonal Power Inventory (IPI; Raven, Schwarzwald & Koslowsky, 1998) measures 11 power bases as conceptualized by French and Raven (1959) and Raven (1992). The IPI was adapted by the current author to examine how psychologists use power with female clients. It was named the Interpersonal Power Inventory-Psychologist version (IPI-P). The variables sex, sexism, agency, communion and the unmitigated forms of agency and communion were studied to examine their influence on the use of power in psychotherapy. The study was posted to the Internet research site Psychdata and listserves that cater to practicing psychologists were contacted (n = 156). A cluster analysis produced two homogenous groups that differed on their level of endorsement of the IPI-P scales. The clusters were labeled high and low power. The participants in the high power cluster had higher scores on every scale of the IPI-P. The high power cluster participants also scored significantly higher on the Hostile Sexism scale of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI; Glick and Fiske, 1996). Theoretical orientation differences were found for level of power endorsement. Female participants scored higher on the Personal Coercion scale of the IPI-P. Also, significant correlations were found between several of the variables although the correlations accounted for little of the variance. For example, small relationships were found between the Impersonal Coercion and Impersonal Reward scales of the IPI-P and the scales of the ASI. There were problems with low internal consistency for several of the IPI-P scales. The findings of this study offer support for the theory that psychologists differ in their level of endorsement of power in psychotherapy. Questions were raised regarding the French and Raven (1959) model and the use of the IPI-P as a measure of the complex construct of power in psychotherapy.

The goal of this dissertation is to extend previous research by exploring 1) characteristics of shows that may influence the likelihood that particular program will be binged and 2) exploring how the narrative engagement process differs for binged and non-binged programs. \n\nFollowing a pretest designed to help define binge watching and examine shows that are and are not binge-watched, two studies were designed. First, a survey was conducted to examine which content  (i.e., plot complexity, character complexity, suspense, quality, and seriality) and non-content (i.e., social pressure and availability) influence bingeability\u2014the likelihood that a show will be binged. Results from Study 1 indicate that suspense and seriality both significantly predicted bingeability, as did social pressures.\n\nFollowing this, a 2 x 2 quasi-experiment was designed, manipulating both suspense and whether a show was binge watched to examine both narrative engagement (i.e., transportation, identification, and parasocial interaction) and narrative outcomes (i.e., enjoyment, appreciation, likelihood to recommend, and psychological well-being). The suspense manipulation failed and was removed, but the results indicate that those who did not binge watch reported greater parasocial interaction over time, greater enjoyment, appreciation, and likelihood to recommend. Further, indirect effects were found, indicating that binge watching had a negative impact on intention to recommend through positive appraisals. These results and their implications for both theory and practice are discussed. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16383], "author_name_tesi": "Ferchaud, Arienne Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Ferchaud", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Arienne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Beth Oliver", "Mary Beth Oliver", "Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Fuyuan Shen", "Anne M Hoag", "Matthew Paul Mcallister"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Beth Oliver, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Beth Oliver, Committee Chair", "Matthew Paul Mcallister, Committee Member", "Fuyuan Shen, Committee Member", "Anne M Hoag, Outside Member", "Matthew Paul Mcallister, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["binge watching", "experiment", "television", "media effects", "engagement"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Defender of the weak or renegade of The Wasteland?

One of its key features is location recommendation, which encourages users to explore new locations. In this thesis, we propose methods for recommending locations that are interesting for the user in terms of closeness in proximity and spatial diversity in relation to the user's current location.\n\nFirst, most previous research on location recommendation services in location-based social networks (LBSNs) makes recommendations without considering where the targeted user is currently located. Such services, as a result, may recommend to a user traveling out of town a place close to her hometown. In this thesis, we study the issues in making location recommendations for out-of-town users by taking into account user preference, social influence and geographical proximity. Accordingly, we propose a collaborative recommendation framework, called User Preference, Proximity and Social-Based Collaborative Filtering (UPS-CF), to make location recommendation for mobile users in LBSNs. We validate our ideas by comprehensive experiments using real datasets collected from Foursquare and Gowalla. By comparing two baseline algorithms (i.e., popularity-based and distance-based approaches) and conventional collaborative filtering approach (and its variants), we show that UPS-CF exhibits the best performance. Additionally, we find that when users are in town, preference derived from similar users is important while social influence becomes more important as a user is out of town.\n\nSecond, studies have shown that users prefer diversity in their recommendation results, but few works have considered spatial diversity in terms of recommending locations. In this thesis, we investigate the k-nearest diverse neighbor problem, which chooses locations that are spatially diverse as well as close in proximity to the user's current location. By fixing deficiencies in a state-of-the-art framework, we first propose the Modified Index-Based Diverse Browsing (Mod-IBDB) framework. In addition, we propose the Distance-Based Diverse Browsing (DBDB) framework that improves upon an initial solution to provide spatially diverse and nearby locations. We develop two versions based upon selecting the initial framework: Distance-First DBDB and Diversity-First DBDB. Using Foursquare and Gowalla datasets as well as synthetic datasets, we show that Mod-IBDB improves upon the performance of its predecessor.

If you compare the environments in which we raise fish for stocking and the environments we expect them to survive in, there are many apparent differences. Previous research suggests that hatchery fish exposed to altered rearing environments behave more flexibly. Fish raised in plain hatchery environments have little exposure to complex environments that more closely resemble natural streams and lakes. By creating environmental complexity and variability during a fish\u2019s residence in a hatchery environment, fish may have the ability to learn and alter behavior in ways that increase post-stocking survival. Here I investigate the addition of variability in the environment of hatchery reared brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), by assessing behavioral changes and post-stocking survival in several Adirondack lakes.

Due to this design flexibility, parts designed for AM have the potential to withstand the same structural loads as traditionally manufactured parts at lower masses. In an attempt to reduce the mass of structural parts to a minimum, optimization techniques such as topology optimization can be employed to achieve geometries that may be unintuitive to designers. While in many cases AM is the only means to realize such an optimized design, the constraints of the particular AM process may require a design to be modified before it can be produced. \nThis thesis examines the current state of topology optimization technology and investigates how topology optimization software fits into the workflow of design for AM. This is achieved by exploring the problem of minimizing the mass of a mounting plate for an aerospace vehicle. Optimization is performed with varying boundary conditions and materials to observe their effect on resulting topologies and design performance. The results are then manually interpreted to conform to AM constraints. A 60% weight savings was achieved over the current mounting plate design, but the optimization software did not take AM constraints into account. Manual design modifications were required to ensure that the design was one continuous part and that a suitable prototype of the optimized design could be produced. \nIn the context of this problem, the benefits and limitations of incorporating topology optimization into design for AM are presented. It was found that manual design workflow for AM requires the designer to iterate design around performance, while incorporating topology optimization into the workflow requires the designer to iterate design around manufacturability.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11113], "author_name_tesi": "Ferguson, Ian ", "last_name_ssi": "Ferguson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson", "Mary I Frecker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor", "Mary I Frecker, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["additive manufacturing", "3d printing", "FDM", "DMLS", "topology optimization", "design", "optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EXPLICIT SECOND LANGUAGE VOCABULARY LEARNING:\nAN INVESTIGATION OF A GLOSS-EMBEDDED TEXT PLUS FORM, MEANING, AND USE EXERCISES\n", "id": "9510", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2779", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study attempted to determine whether English vocabulary words can be explicitly taught and effectively learned through interaction with an experimental reading-based, gloss-embedded text plus interaction with form, meaning, and use vocabulary exercises, and whether this approach would lead to higher retention rates compared to a more conventional vocabulary-learning approach involving a text plus dictionary use plus an opportunity to write on a related topic.

For this study, the degradation of water level and water quality conditions were theorized to detract from the overall outdoor recreation experience. The models used in this study assessed the extent that perceptions of environmental detractors (e.g., degraded water level and water quality conditions) elicited coping responses to maintain overall satisfaction. \nStudy findings indicated visitors predominantly recognized and were aware of environmental detractors, but did not perceive them to impact their outdoor recreation experience. However, results suggested visitors were more perceptive of, and more likely to be, impacted by water quality conditions as opposed to water level conditions. Further, this study determined that visitors employed several unique coping responses when encountering environmental detractors. These responses included: cognitive adjustments, direct actions, resource substitutions, temporal substitutions, activity substitutions, and absolute displacement.    \nAs a whole, this dissertation provided a novel approach to the study of coping responses in outdoor recreation. The ever increasing presence of GCC suggests the severity of environmental detractor impacts will continue to increase.

The latter reduces soluble ferredoxins that, in turn, act as electron donors to the cellular metabolism. Cytochromes return the RC to the ground state by reducing the oxidized BChl special pair. The work contained in this dissertation expands our understanding of these fundamental ET pathways by quantifying the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of RCs from both anaerobic (Heliobacterium modesticaldum) and aerobic (Chloracidobacterium thermophilum) phototrophs.\n\tIn heliobacteria, the midpoint potentials of A0 (\u2013854 mV), FX (\u2013504 mV), FA (\u2013452 to \u2013480 mV) and FB (\u2013524 to \u2013533 mV) are 50-200 mV more oxidizing than the respective cofactors in Photosystem I (PSI). The data suggest that the energy gap between A0 and FX is poised to maintain free energy for the reduction of ferredoxins while minimizing competition between charge recombination and cytochrome reduction of the oxidized BChl dimer.\n\tIn C. thermophilum, the kinetics of both the forward and charge recombination ET reactions are similar to those of the RCs of the anaerobic phototrophs. In contrast, the PscB protein harboring the FA and FB FeS clusters is more tightly bound to the RC than in either of the analogous proteins in the anaerobic species. The strength of this interaction resembles that between PsaC and PSI and may similarly provide oxygen stability to the FA and FB clusters.\n\tWhen heliobacteria are exposed to oxygen, BChl g and BChl g\u2032 are oxidized primarily to 81-OH Chl aF. Despite losses in energy transfer from the antenna, charge-separation decreases nonlinearly with respect to the amount of oxidized BChl g.

The subsurface flow problem requires time integration, each step of which uses a nonlinear solver. There are a number of ways to solve the nonlinear equation, one of which is Picard method which forms a symmetric positive-definite (SPD) linear system. Since the majority of computation involves the solution of large sparse linear systems, we evaluate solving systems with iterative preconditioned methods. SPD systems are often solved efficiently by a conjugate gradient (CG) solver using a preconditioner. There are a large number of available preconditioners to use. Two of the most promising preconditioners are incomplete Cholesky factorization (IC) and one formed from an algebraic multigrid (AMG) method. For the IC solver, we try reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM), minimum degree, and dissection reordering algorithms to improve performance. We also propose the use of thresholding small values from the matrix during the construction of the preconditioner to improve performance. Another avenue to improve performance is the use of mixed-precision algorithms, which we evaluate and propose as future work. Our results indicate that preconditioned CG with IC using RCM reordering can beat the best known performance of basic solvers, but the AMG preconditioner with application knowledge for parameter tuning showed the best overall performance.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3423], "author_name_tesi": "Fermoyle, Kelly ", "last_name_ssi": "Fermoyle", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kelly", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Padma Raghavan", "Padma Raghavan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Padma Raghavan, Thesis Advisor", "Padma Raghavan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sparse linear systems", "subsurface flow", "performance"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EVALUATING ECOSYSTEM AND WIND-FOLLOWING SERVICES FOR HYDRO-ELECTRIC DAMS\n\n", "id": "12006", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "353", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydropower can provide relatively inexpensive, flexible fill-in power to compensate for intermittent renewable generation, with minimal environmental effects compared to competing generation sources. Water management policies for hydropower dams maintain multiple services beyond electric generation, such as flood control, recreation, ecosystem services, and municipal water supply. Managing these multiple services involves various, sometimes conflicting policy objectives.  We perform a scenario analysis that models the profit-maximizing behavior of Dominion, a small-scale dam owner, when providing multiple services that include flow management for downstream ecosystem maintenance; utility profit-maximization in a day-ahead (DA) market; and a \u201cwind-following service\u201d similar to ancillary services.  Our specific case study uses the Kerr Dam, located on the Roanoke River in North Carolina. Wind-following service that Kerr provides allows the wind turbine to behave as a controllable or dispatchable generator, providing energy into the day-ahead market much like a hydroelectric dam does. The analysis focuses on the potential conflicts and trade-offs that arise from the formulation of energy policy differences separately from river-management policy decisions. Our analysis suggests that reserves market prices would not need to increase to move Kerr Dam from the DA to the ancillary services market to offer wind-following services. Yet, reserve payments steadily decrease with increased hydrological variability. A sensitivity analysis of the wind-following capacity amount sold at current ancillary (reserves) services market prices suggests that wind-following may be profitable for Dominion at low capacity levels, yet wind-following with ecosystem services yields revenue loss that typically cannot be recovered with current reserves market payments.  A significant policy tradeoff exists between ecosystem services and wind-following services. Water release patterns are inconsistent with the ecosystem-services goals when Dominion dedicates a significant portion of Kerr\u2019s capacity to wind-following, particularly in drought years.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [348], "author_name_tesi": "Fernandez, Alisha Rachel", "last_name_ssi": "Fernandez", "middle_name_ssi": "Rachel", "first_name_ssi": "Alisha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack", "Patrick M Reed", "Seth Adam Blumsack"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack, Thesis Advisor", "Patrick M Reed, Thesis Advisor", "Seth Adam Blumsack, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy policy", "hydro-electric power", "wind generation", "ancillary services", "ecosystem services", "sensitivity analysis", "drought"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Flexible Reserve Markets for Wind Integration", "id": "22573", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10249", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The increased interconnection of variable generation has motivated the use of improved forecasting to more accurately predict future production with the purpose to lower total system costs for balancing when the expected output exceeds or falls short of the actual output. Forecasts are imperfect, and the forecast errors associated with utility-scale generation from variable generators need new balancing capabilities that cannot be handled by existing ancillary services. Our work focuses on strategies for integrating large amounts of wind generation under the flex reserve market, a market that would called upon for short-term energy services during an under or oversupply of wind generation to maintain electric grid reliability. The flex reserve market would be utilized for time intervals that fall in-between the current ancillary services markets that would be longer than second-to-second energy services for maintaining system frequency and shorter than reserve capacity services that are called upon for several minutes up to an hour during an unexpected contingency on the grid. In our work, the wind operator would access the flex reserve market as an energy service to correct for unanticipated forecast errors, akin to paying the generators participating in the market to increase generation during a shortfall or paying the other generators to decrease generation during an excess of wind generation. Such a market does not currently exist in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  The Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM) is the Mid-Atlantic electric grid case study that was used to examine if a flex reserve market can be utilized for integrating large capacities of wind generation in a low-cost manner for those providing, purchasing and dispatching these short-term balancing services.\n\nThe following work consists of three studies. The first examines the ability of a hydroelectric facility to provide short-term forecast error balancing services via a flex reserve market, identifying the operational constraints that inhibit a multi-purpose dam facility to meet the desired flexible energy demand. The second study transitions from the hydroelectric facility as the decision maker providing flex reserve services to the wind plant as the decision maker purchasing these services. In this second study, methods for allocating the costs of flex reserve services under different wind policy scenarios are explored that aggregate farms into different groupings to identify the least-cost strategy for balancing the costs of hourly day-ahead forecast errors. The least-cost strategy may be different for an individual wind plant and for the system operator, noting that the least-cost strategy is highly sensitive to cost allocation and aggregation schemes. The latter may also cause cross-subsidies in the cost for balancing wind forecast errors among the different wind farms. The third study builds from the second, with the objective to quantify the amount of flex reserves needed for balancing future forecast errors using a probabilistic approach (quantile regression) to estimating future forecast errors. The results further examine the usefulness of separate flexible markets PJM could use for balancing oversupply and undersupply events, similar to the regulation up and down markets used in Europe.  These three studies provide the following results and insights to large-scale wind integration using actual PJM wind farm data that describe the markets and generators within PJM. \n\n\u2022\tChapter 2 provides an in-depth analysis of the valuable, yet highly-constrained, energy services multi-purpose hydroelectric facilities can provide, though the opportunity cost for providing these services can result in large deviations from the reservoir policies with minimal revenue gain in comparison to dedicating the whole of dam capacity to providing day-ahead, baseload generation. \n\n\u2022\tChapter 3 quantifies the system-wide efficiency gains and the distributive effects of PJM\u2019s decision to act as a single balancing authority, which means that it procures ancillary services across its entire footprint simultaneously.  This can be contrasted to Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO), which has several balancing authorities operating under its footprint.\n\n\u2022\tChapter 4 uses probabilistic methods to estimate the uncertainty in the forecast errors and the quantity of energy needed to balance these forecast errors at a certain percentile. Current practice is to use a point forecast that describes the conditional expectation of the dependent variable at each time step. The approach here uses quantile regression to describe the relationship between independent variable and the conditional quantiles (equivalently the percentiles) of the dependent variable. An estimate of the conditional density is performed, which contains information about the covariate relationship of the sign of the forecast errors (negative for too much wind generation and positive for too little wind generation) and the wind power forecast. This additional knowledge may be implemented in the decision process to more accurately schedule day-ahead wind generation bids and provide an example for using separate markets for balancing an oversupply and undersupply of generation. Such methods are currently used for coordinating large footprints of wind generation in Europe.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9932], "author_name_tesi": "Fernandez, Alisha Rachel", "last_name_ssi": "Fernandez", "middle_name_ssi": "Rachel", "first_name_ssi": "Alisha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack", "Seth Adam Blumsack", "R Larry Grayson", "Jeffery Brownson", "Susan W Stewart", "Patrick M Reed"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack, Dissertation Advisor", "Seth Adam Blumsack, Committee Chair", "R Larry Grayson, Committee Member", "Jeffery Brownson, Committee Member", "Susan W Stewart, Committee Member", "Patrick M Reed, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wind integration", "electricity markets", "hydro power", "PJM", "ecosystem services", "ancillary services", "wind forecast"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF ACCENTED SPEECH ON CODE-SWITCHING IN SPANISH ENGLISH BILINGUALS: AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY \u2028", "id": "hm50tr726", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12950", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Code-switching, the interchangeable use of two or more languages within or between sentences is considered to be one of the hallmarks of bilingualism. Previous studies have found that processing code-switched sentences is associated with a measurable processing cost in comparison to non-switched sentences. Even though code-switching occurs more frequently in spoken than written communication, the vast majority of neurocognitive research on code-switching focuses on the reading of code-switched sentences. This study examined intra-sentential code-switching in the auditory modality, which mimics natural discourse more closely, using Event Related Potentials (ERPs).\nThe focus on auditory processing of code-switched sentences brings a key aspect of bilingual speech into play: foreign-accented speech. It has been demonstrated that even highly proficient bilinguals often have a perceivable accent in their second language (L2). As of yet, the effects of such accent on the comprehension of code-switched speech have not been systematically studied. Based on the scarce literature on foreign-accent processing, we hypothesized that accented speech would modulate switching costs by increasing or decreasing these processing costs, depending on the direction of the switch.  To address this question the present study was divided in two separate, but related experiments. In the first, highly proficient Spanish-English bilinguals who were habitual code-switchers listened to non-accented and Spanish accented sentences.  This experiment sought to closely emulate the natural code-switching environment experienced by Spanish-English bilinguals in the U.S.  We hypothesize that in a sentence that begins with Spanish- accented English and switches to Spanish with no accent, the processing cost would be reduced due to the dual activation of the two languages resulting from the accented speech at the beginning of the sentence, which would facilitate the processing of a subsequent switch. On the other hand, if the same sentence begins with non-accented Spanish and then switches to Spanish-accented English, the non-accented speech at the beginning of the sentence would not (strongly) co-activate two languages, and a subsequent switch to Spanish would induce an increased processing cost.  Our results confirm our first prediction that Spanish-accented English would attenuate processing costs when switching to Spanish due to enhanced language co-activation.  This was seen by an attenuation of N400 effects. Switching from Spanish to Spanish-accented English did not incur increased processing costs.\nIn the second experiment Spanish-English bilinguals who were habitual code-switchers listened to non-accented and English accented sentences. This experiment sought to emulate a less common scenario encountered by Spanish-English bilinguals in the U.S by exposing them to English-accented Spanish code-switching. In this experiment, we hypothesized that in a sentence that begins with American-English accented Spanish and switches to English with no accent, the processing cost would be reduced because the dual activation of the two languages resulting from the accented speech at the beginning of the sentence will facilitate the comprehension of a subsequent switch. On the other hand, if the same sentence begins with non-accented English and then switches to English-accented Spanish the non-accented speech at the beginning of the sentence would not (strongly) co-activate two languages, and a subsequent switch to Spanish would induce an increased processing cost.  Our results indicate that English-accented Spanish did not attenuate processing costs when switching from Spanish to English. This was seen through the presence of an LPC effect in this condition. Switching from English to Spanish did not incur increased processing costs. \nAdditionally, some studies on accented-speech perception reported that prolonged exposure to accented speech overcomes initial comprehension problems. We therefore predicted that prolonged exposure to accented speech will also lead to a reduction in switching costs as listeners become more familiar with the accent. To test this, the effects of prolonged exposure to accented speech on processing costs of switches were examined by comparing switching-costs present on the second half of the experiment to those present in the first half. Our results indicate that there is no reduction in the processing costs of code-switched sentences produced with either an English or Spanish accented speech. \nTaken together, our results indicate that accented speech modulates processing costs of code-switched sentences depending on direction of the switch and previous experience with the type of accent encountered. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12485], "author_name_tesi": "Fernandez, Carla Beatriz", "last_name_ssi": "Fernandez", "middle_name_ssi": "Beatriz", "first_name_ssi": "Carla", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janet van Hell", "Michele Theresa Diaz", "Jonathan Emdin Cook"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janet van Hell, Thesis Advisor", "Michele Theresa Diaz, Committee Member", "Jonathan Emdin Cook, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["code-switching bilingualism neurocognitive"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Biochemistry of ectomycorrhizal fungi: from functional traits to ecosystem processes", "id": "20827", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9725", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi are a group of cosmopolitan symbiotic soil fungi that colonize the finest roots of tree species and play an essential role in plant nutrition and ecosystem function. These fungi account for the majority of microbial biomass found in forest soils and as a consequence the turnover of this biomass represents a large litter input into carbon and nutrient cycles.  The factors that control the decomposition of ectomycorrhizal fungi will strongly control forest litter decomposition as a whole and, thus, ecosystem nutrient and carbon cycling. Unfortunately, our understanding of these factors is poor. \n\tIt has often been suggested that chitin, a fungal cell wall polysaccharide, is a recalcitrant compound and thus a major controller of the decomposition of fungal litter. This, however, has not been explicitly examined. In Chapter 2 we examined the role of chitin in the decomposition EM fungal tissues. The study shows that chitin concentrations declined rapidly over the course of decomposition and a significant positive relationship between initial chitin concentration and decomposition was found. Together these results suggest that chitin is a labile compound relative to other compounds found in EM fungal tissue and probably does not explain the differences in decomposability of necromass across EM fungal species.  \n\tMelanin is a complex aromatic polymer found in fungal cell walls.  Its concentration varies widely across fungal species.  In Chapter 3 we hypothesize that variation in melanin concentration across fungal species explains a significant amount of variation in decomposition rate. To test this we examined the decomposition of EM fungal necromass of species with varying melanin concentrations in a comparative experiment. In addition, we manipulated melanin biosynthesis by inhibition in the highly melanized EM fungal species Cenococcum geophilum and examined the effect on decomposition.  Melanin concentration of the EM fungal necromass was negatively correlated with percent decomposition after 3 months. The inhibition of melanin in C. geophilum was found to increase the decomposability of its tissues. Together this suggests that melanin is likely a major biochemical control on the decomposition of EM litters and may have significant consequences on C and nutrient cycles in ecosystems. \n\tThe highly melanized and common ectomycorrhizal fungus, C. geophilum, is drought tolerant and abundant in water stressed habitats, yet the responsible functional traits have not been identified. In Chapter 4 we examined the role of melanin in the EM fungus C. geophilum under water stress by devising a series of experiments that tested the effect of the melanin biosynthesis inhibition on osmotic and desiccation stress tolerance. Melanin inhibition only had negative effects on growth when C. geophilum isolates were subjected to water stress but not under control conditions.  This suggests that melanin production is an important functional trait that contributes to water stress tolerance of this cosmopolitan ectomycorrhizal fungus and, given the results presented in Chapter 3, likely has implications for ecosystem function. \n\tIn Chapter 5 I synthesize the research presented herein and place it in the context of prior work in a research review examining the factors influencing the decomposition dynamics of ectomycorrhizal fungal litters.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9480], "author_name_tesi": "Fernandez, Christopher William", "last_name_ssi": "Fernandez", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Tai Koide", "David Eissenstat", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Roger Tai Koide"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Tai Koide, Dissertation Advisor", "David Eissenstat, Committee Chair", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Member", "Roger Tai Koide, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["carbon cycling", "chitin", "decomposition", "drought tolerance", "ectomycorrhizal fungi", "functional traits", "melanin", "nutrient cycling"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "DOCTORAL EDUCATION OF LATINAS AND LATINOS IN THE UNITED STATES: EXAMINATIONS OF (SUB)BACCALAUREATE ORIGINS, THE ROLE OF HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTIONS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOURCES OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND POST-GRADUATION PLANS", "id": "13648fyf5033", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13648", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work addresses nationally critical and timely policy concerns about the small percentage of Latinas and Latinos who earn doctorates relative to their share of the population, the role of Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) in helping to meet the needs of the Latina and Latino community, and the underrepresentation of Latinas and Latinos in the professoriate. The dissertation consists of three papers in which I analyze the national Survey of Earned Doctorates to examine doctoral education of Latinas and Latinos between 2000 and 2010. In the first paper, I examine the (sub)baccalaureate origins of Latinas and Latinos who earned doctorate degrees in education, humanities, and social sciences. Findings show that the plurality of Latina and Latino doctorates originate from community colleges and public, non-HSI universities. The first paper highlights the importance of supporting community colleges and public, non-HSI universities in preparing Latinas and Latinos to earn doctorate degrees. In the second paper, I seek to better understand the role that HSIs play in the production of Latina and Latino social scientists. I use multinomial logistic estimation to determine that Latinas and Latinos who earned baccalaureate degrees from HSIs were more likely to earn doctorates from less-research-intensive universities. An institutional pathway between HSIs and the nation\u2019s least-research-intensive universities is beneficial for increasing the number of Latinas and Latinos who earn social science doctorate degrees; however, it may be problematic for preparing future faculty members, most of whom are hired out of the nation\u2019s leading research universities.

To support this dramatic increase in food production, fertilizer utilization must undoubtedly increase; however, traditional resources for fertilizer production are dwindling. Phosphorus is an essential element for agricultural production and its reserves are estimated to not last more than one hundred years if the same agricultural practices keep being used (Balm\u00e9r, 2004). In addition, nitrogen-based fertilizer prices cannot always be afforded by developing countries (World Fertilizer Trends and Outlook, 2018), countries in which population is estimated to experience the highest increase (UN, World Population Division, 2015). For these reasons, new fertilization options must be found to effectively and sustainably produce enough food for future generations. \nAs human population increases, domestic wastewater production will also increase, a fact that will aggravate environmental deterioration if the nutrients are not recovered. Around 90% of wastewater generated by developing countries is discharged untreated into rivers, lakes, and oceans (FAO Control of Water Pollution From Agriculture 1996), increasing the nutrient loading into the environment. The excessive nutrient loading from domestic wastewater discharges, combined with agricultural runoff and other activities, typically leads to eutrophication, often generating irreparable damage to aquatic ecosystems. \nDuckweed, an aquatic plant, can grow in wastewater, sustainably treat the water by accumulating nutrients, and generate a by-product capable of replacing or supplementing commercial fertilizers. Five genera of duckweed are known, Lemna, Landoltia, Spirodela, Wolfia, and Wollfiella, and 38 species have been identified to date (Les et al. 2002). Literature on the use of duckweed as a soil amendment is lacking; therefore, an agricultural evaluation of duckweed is needed to assess its ability to be utilized as a soil amendment. In this study, duckweed was evaluated as a soil amendment in comparison with commercial fertilizer, and in combination with commercial fertilizer (in a 40:60 \u201cmix\u201d, duckweed:fertilizer w/w). Common root, leaf, and fruit vegetables (beet, kale, tomato) were tested in the greenhouse, while the drought-resistant grain, sorghum, was tested in both the greenhouse and the field. Relative to fertilizer in all cases, soils amended with duckweed leached less ammonia and nitrate. No differences in phosphorous (P) runoff were found among the different treatments utilized in the field, whereas no P leaching was observed in greenhouse pot tests. Sorghum yield in field plots treated with duckweed (120 \u00b1 15 bu/acre) and with a duckweed:fertilizer mix (134 \u00b1 15 bu/acre) were comparable to that of commercial fertilizer alone (177 \u00b1 12 bu/acre), when considering the reduction in germination observed in duckweed and mix plots (50% and 38% reduction, respectively) compared to fertilizer plots (90% germination). For the greenhouse experiment, duckweed treatment generated higher sorghum biomass (46.1 \u00b1 0.2 g) than fertilizer treatment (40.4 \u00b1 0.2 g), while the mix treatment generated higher tomato biomass (40.7 \u00b1 7.3 g) than fertilizer treatment (39.8 \u00b1 9.6 g).  Additionally, duckweed was observed to generate a higher percentage of nitrogen (N) and P content in sorghum grain tissue in the field experiment than other treatments (1.63 \u00b1 0.03 % N and 0.35 \u00b1 0.0 % P). Duckweed treatment also provided positive carbon (C) and P soil residue, nutrients that will be available to the soil after harvesting the crops. Additional field testing is needed to finish the evaluation of this floating plant as a fertilization option, such as additional germination studies, application to different crops, and testing in different soils. The results indicate that duckweed may be a viable alternative to commercial fertilizer from an environmental and agricultural perspective.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12847], "author_name_tesi": "Fernandez Pulido, Carlos Rolando", "last_name_ssi": "Fernandez Pulido", "middle_name_ssi": "Rolando", "first_name_ssi": "Carlos", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rachel Alice Brennan", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rachel Alice Brennan, Thesis Advisor", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Runoff", "Duckweed", "Crop Yield", "Sustainable soil amendment", "Soil nutrient residue", "Agricultural runoff", "Sustainability", "Fertilization"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "IMPROVED MOLECULAR MODEL GENERATION FOR SOOT, CHARS, AND COALS: HIGH-RESOLUTION TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY LATTICE FRINGES REPRODUCTION WITH FRINGE3D\n", "id": "10602", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6479", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Large-scale molecular models for carbon-rich structures are beneficial for advanced simulations and scientific progression. However, the generation of such structures is challenging and expensive, have considerable creator bias and often unrealistic simplifications are necessary. An improved and more desirable approach for carbon-rich structures should ease the construction process, enable large-scale model creation (>20,000 atoms) with reduced bias, improve accuracy, diversity capture, and greater utility. For this project models for carbonaceous materials were constructed by integrating HRTEM lattice fringe image analyses with computational techniques. The models constructed were the aromatic moieties of a diesel-soot \u201cprimary particle\u201d, a coal gasification char, and an extensive model of the economically important Powder River basin, Wyodak-Anderson subbituminous coal, which included heteroatom, aliphatic carbons, and water forms.\nImage analyses obtained from published HRTEM lattice fringe images were utilized to directly duplicate aromatic structural features such as fringe lengths (aromatic layer dimensions), fringes separation distance (interlayer spacing), the number of fringes per stack (stacking distribution), and fringe orientation. Basically, the Fringe3D process creates three dimensional (3D) aromatic structural features directly from HRTEM lattice fringe micrographs and populated the appropriate aromatic structures in 3D molecular space. The resulting slice aromatic models are an improved molecular representation as it captures the microstructure and more importantly the distributions of structural features.\nThis approach was used to construct a diesel soot \u201cprimary particle\u201d model with a realistic diameter and periodicity and gasification char with variation in stacking and orientations. Also,\nan extensive model of the economically important Powder River basin Wyodak-Anderson subbituminous coal was created, including heteroatom, aliphatic carbons, and water. The soot model was produced due the fact that only small-scale models with limited utility were available in the literature. A 60,000 atom aromatic carbons model was generated as a base structure. This model could assist to explain reactivity/microstructure relationships for fuel and generation-condition specific soot \u201cprimary particle\u201d structures, in addition to benefits for soot/environment/health issues. The gasification char model contains about 800 molecules based on graphene-like structure with various stacking extents and orientations. Such a large-scale model could aid in the process of exploring structure reactivity relationships, which are important in energy applications and offers a new cheaper and faster construction approach that are an improvement in comparison to current methods used such as Reverse Monte Carlo or manual manipulations. Modification to the base structure such as oxygen functionality, cross-links, and aliphatic components could be added to this method.\nNotwithstanding the economic importance to power generation in the U.S. and potential for coal-to-liquids production, few models of subbituminous coals exists. Around 40% of domestic coal production comes from the Powder River basin in Wyoming. Coal, especially low-rank coal, was a more extreme test of the model construction approach and it required some refinements to progress from aromatic carbons layers model to 3D representation including an extensive molecular weight distribution, heteroatom functionalities, aliphatic components, and water forms. The model created has ~25,000 atoms and was constructed utilizing a variety of published data, specifically nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR), fast neutron activation analysis, laser desorption ionization spectroscopy, and other mass spectroscopy for molecular weight\ndistributions. The model showed good agreement with: a) NMR parameters, b) average molecular weight of a cluster, and c) molecular weight distribution.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6477], "author_name_tesi": "Fernandez-Alos, Victor ", "last_name_ssi": "Fernandez-Alos", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Victor", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan P Mathews", "Jonathan P Mathews", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Randy Lee Vander Wal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan P Mathews, Thesis Advisor", "Jonathan P Mathews, Thesis Advisor", "Harold Harris Schobert, Thesis Advisor", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["soot", "molecular model", "3D HRTEM lattice fringe images", "char", "low-rank coals"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "PP-Wave Superalgebras of Supergravity Theories in Ten and Eleven Dimensions and Their Spectra", "id": "6373", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5943", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The duality between type IIB superstring theory on a plane-wave background and a particular large R-charge sector (`BMN sector') of four dimensional N = 4 super Yang-Mills gauge theory is a restatement of the AdS/CFT correspondence in the Penrose limit.

Applications of opsins requires knowledge of their per photon transport rates under different physiological conditions. To this effect, I have measured the transport rate of the light-driven anion pump halorhodospin (pHR) using both liposome-based reconstitution and oocyte-based expression systems respectively. pHR has a liposome-based Cl\u2013 transport rate of 442 (\u00b1 98) Cl\u2013/protein/s at a photon flux of 1450 photons/protein/s, i.e., 0.3 (\u00b1 0.07) Cl\u2013/photon. pHR-expressing oocytes yield a transport rate of 219 (\u00b1 98) Cl\u2013/protein/s for a photon flux of 630 photons/protein/s, i.e., 0.35 (\u00b1 0.16) Cl\u2013/photon.  Both the per photon transport rates are in agreement with earlier reported quantum efficiency of pHR of 30 % and also reconcile the disparity in earlier reported transport rates of pHR which span 3 orders of magnitude due to lack of standardization of the techniques employed. The results are also in agreement with flash photolysis experiments which, based on the possible rate-limiting step in the pHR photocycle, suggests a transport rate of ~400 ions/protein/s. \nA great challenge in conducting in vitro assays on MP is obtaining high yields of pure  functional MP which require amphipathic detergent molecules to stabilize their hydrophobic exterior. To improve the efficiency of extraction and post-purification stability of MP, I have developed a screening protocol and studied halorhodopsin and KR2 of the rhodopsin family and the highly-selective water channel, aquaporin as model proteins using a range of nonionic detergents. Longer chain detergents and higher salinity improve the extraction of MPs and retain their functionality post-purification; the tradeoff in these conditions arises from the formation of larger micelles that are more prone to retention during ultrafiltration(UF)-based concentration of MPs as the excess detergent can complicate characterization assays that require complete detergent removal. Through a combination of computational and experimental work, my research predicts that counterintuitive to conventional membrane-based separation approach, we can concentrate MP-detergent micelles while allowing empty ones to go through by carrying out UF under conditions of increased concentration polarization. The broader impact of this research stems from the medical relevance of MPs as drug targets for diseases including cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis and hypertension.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16217], "author_name_tesi": "Feroz, Hasin Maksura", "last_name_ssi": "Feroz", "middle_name_ssi": "Maksura", "first_name_ssi": "Hasin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Manish Kumar", "Manish Kumar", "Andrew Zydney", "Phillip E Savage", "Peter J Butler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Manish Kumar, Dissertation Advisor", "Manish Kumar, Committee Chair", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member", "Phillip E Savage, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Membrane protein", "detergent", "transport rate of opsins", "vesicle/oocyte-based rate", "extraction / purification", "ultrafiltration"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE d-Al-Ni-Co\nQUASICRYSTAL SURFACE AND XENON ADSORPTION\n", "id": "6853", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4764", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Quantitative low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) was used to characterize the structure of the tenfold surface of decagonal Al-Ni-Co quasicrystal.

Related to a number of epidemic properties R0 is a common metric for comparing transmission dynamics across populations.

I show that the transmission of the pollinator-borne smut fungus, Microbotryum violaceum, in populations of Silene latifolia is determined largely by preferential visitation by vectors to plants with many flowers.  I develop a theoretical model for the spatial dynamics of Microbotryum spread by combining a spatial diffusion model for insect movement with an optimal foraging model for host selection.  I also show that patterns of incidence of the bacterium, Erwinia tracheiphila, in populations of a wild gourd, Cucurbita pepo ssp. texana, with a mixed mating system are determined by selection of the beetle vectors for outcrossed rather than inbred hosts. \nI use explicit social network models to explore the effect of heterogeneities in transmission and exposure on population scale epidemic dynamics. I show that heterogeneities in exposure due to many network contacts predispose some individuals to infection resulting in a characteristic pattern of collapse in the active portion of the transmission network over the course of an epidemic.  I provide analytical methods to calculate the expected change in network connectivity due to epidemic removal and show the effect of this structural change in the transmission network affects the potential of subsequent epidemics to invade. Finally, the scaling of transmission across populations of varying size has presented a challenge for models that assume homogenous mixing of individuals.  I review the empirical evidence for the scaling of transmission and show that these patterns are in apparent conflict with the simple models of host mixing. I then show that explicit consideration of local heterogeneities due to host social organization can resolve the apparent paradox.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4140], "author_name_tesi": "Ferrari, Matthew J", "last_name_ssi": "Ferrari", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ottar N Bjornstad", "Andrew George Stephenson", "Peter John Hudson", "David Russell Hunter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Chair", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Member", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member", "David Russell Hunter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["epidemiology", "basic reproductive ratio", "plant pathogen", "vector-borne disease", "networks", "vaccination"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "A Concept-Based Approach to Writing Instruction: From the Abstract Concept to the Concrete Performance\n", "id": "6699", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4270", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates the development of theoretical thinking, writing improvement and the meaning-making process of ESL freshman composition students during implementation of an innovative genre-based writing course.

The course comprised three units that taught the genres of announcements, cover letters and argumentative texts to 14 ESL students, who were mainly from Asian and from Central American backgrounds. \n\tTo investigate development of theoretical understanding of genre among the students, visual representations of their understanding of the concept of genre, their answers to problem-solving tasks, and their answers to a problem situation question were analyzed. Out of the 14 students who participated in the study, six were selected to have their writing samples evaluated by three independent raters in a pre- and post-test procedure. The tests were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The qualitative analysis focused on the moves performed by the students while the quantitative analysis was based on a Wilcoxon Ranks Test of the scores assigned to the texts  by the three raters. The meaning-making process of the 14 students \u201e\u0178 their opinions about the course \u201e\u0178 were captured by the content analysis of the logs they kept during the course. In the logs the students were to comment on what they learned and on their impressions of the new pedagogical approach adopted.\n\tThe analyses of the data indicate that: a) students thought mainly empirically and occasionally revealed some signs of theoretical thinking; b) the students significantly improved in writing cover letters but not argumentative texts; c) overall students improved  to some extent in both genres but most of them did not abandon the five-paragraph format; d) most of the students did not actively engage in making sense of the course and when they did so, their perceptions  were highly affected by their past educational experiences; consequently, the impact of the new approach combining SFL theory and SCT psychological theory was not as robust as had been anticipated. The students were heavily influenced by their previous history as students in which writing was often defined in very empirical terms and was not connected to an understanding of human communication. \n\tThis dissertation highlights the need for education to focus more on the development of theoretical thinking and to engage students in meaning-making activities which engage them actively in dealing with the dialectical relationship of personal and external meanings.

A thorough literature review is presented of the development of characteristic methods as a specific class of spatial discretization to the discrete-ordinates approximation of the stationary transport equation. A classical derivation of the Arbitrarily High-Order Transport Method of the Characteristic Type for Unstructured Grids (AHOT-C-UG) is performed, which is based on a consistent generalization of lower-order short characteristic methods in structured grids. Novel techniques, such as coordinate transformations and series expansions of spatial moments, are introduced in order to avoid previous difficulties regarding computational precision and the treatment of internal voids. In addition, the arbitrary-order characteristic relation is re-derived in a form which satisfies emph{exactly} the arbitrary-order balance equation. The consequences of the equivalence are twofold: it provides an exact relation that is numerically stable as the computational cells become optically thin, and it underscores the fact that the characteristic relation conserves the local balance of all computed spatial moments of the particle population, which is an important property of good spatial discretizations to the transport equation. Furthermore, the AHOT-C-UG approach is subsequently reintroduced as a Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin projection, which allows us to bridge the gap between characteristic methods that are consistent with AHOT-C-UG and general finite element methods by providing a common setting from the point of view of variational analysis. Remaining mathematical and computational challenges regarding the AHOT-C-UG approach are noted and practical solutions to these issues are suggested. A rudimentary performance model of the method is introduced in order to address practical concerns regarding computational resources and runtime performance.

Recent events, including China\u2019s intercept of their Feng Yun-1C weather satellite and the United States\u2019 intercept of a non-functioning satellite, have dramatically increased the amount of space debris, which poses an increased risk for on-orbit collisions.  When the loss or degradation of a satellite in a constellation is experienced \u2013 be it from a collision with space debris, on-orbit malfunctions, or natural causes \u2013 the constellation may no longer be capable of fulfilling its mission requirements.  Instead of simply accepting the degraded performance, stakeholders may consider reconfiguration of the remaining spacecraft.  In this research, a general framework for the reconfiguration of satellite constellations is developed.\nThe key characteristic that separates this research from others that have come before it is that the future state of the reconfigured constellation is not assumed a priori; rather, it is this state that is found.  In other words, the reconfigured geometry can occupy any feasible region (this is mission dependent) of the design space in an attempt to provide optimal performance with respect to multiple-criterion.  These include the propellant expended, time of transfer, reduction in mission life, coverage performance, and risk due to maneuvering.  When modeled as mathematical functions, some of these concerns exhibit continuous behavior; however, most have nonlinear, discrete, discontinuous, and/or multimodal characteristics.\nThe framework adapts a best-in-class parallel Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm to approximate the optimal hypervolumes for this complex tradeoff-space.  Several loss scenarios for the Global Positioning System constellation are presented to demonstrate the framework.  An a posteriori procedure for decision support is introduced that enables down-selection to a final design from thousands of non-dominated reconfiguration alternatives.\nAmong the significant results to emerge from this research are the lessons learned as a result of the application of stochastic optimization to the constellation design problem domain.  One such lesson indicates that objective functions related to coverage have the greatest influence on the multi-modality of the design space.  Other results demonstrate that increasing the number of design variables and/or the application of operational constraints (such as fuel budgets) do not necessarily make the reconfiguration problem more difficult to solve; in some cases it becomes easier.  The method itself is successful in providing a global context to decision makers that allows for defendable design selection in what was previously a computationally intractable optimization problem.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4284], "author_name_tesi": "Ferringer, Matthew Phillip", "last_name_ssi": "Ferringer", "middle_name_ssi": "Phillip", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr David B Spencer", "David Spencer", "Robert Graham Melton", "Sven G Bilen", "Patrick M Reed", "Thomas Starchville Jr"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr David B Spencer, Dissertation Advisor", "David Spencer, Committee Chair", "Robert Graham Melton, Committee Member", "Sven G Bilen, Committee Member", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Member", "Thomas Starchville Jr, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["satellite constellation design", "multi-objective optimization", "evolutionary algorithms", "decision support", "high performance computing", "satellite constellation reconfiguration", "high-dimensional visualization"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Patch Correspondence Approach to Recognizing Faces Under Varying Pose Given a Single-view Gallery", "id": "14821", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7245", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While the development of face recognition technologies has been touted as one of the greatest successes of computer vision, many challenges still stand in the way of a robust solution.

Experiment 3 manipulates dot lifetime settings to examine how the response to motion-defined form displays will modulate as local-level motion vectors are increased or decreased.

In the case of object detection, regional differences of rigid motion allow for the segmentation of figures from their background, even in the absence of color or shading cues. Both classes of patterns are examples of complex motion, and are thus both dependent upon the integration of basic motion information across the visual field. Previous studies have attempted to chart visual evoked potential (VEP) response sensitivity to global space-time information in order to understand integrative versus local motion processing in the brain. However, important gaps remain, and so the experiments of this dissertation attempt to address these gaps. For instance, previous VEP studies on speed sensitivity concentrated only on one pattern type at a time, and only on optic flow. Experiments 1 and 3 therefore investigated the influence of pattern type on speed sensitivity for optic flow patterns and motion-defined figures, respectively. Experiments 2 and 4 provide human electrophysiological data for comparison with other studies on the temporal properties of motion integration mechanisms. Here, dot lifetimes were varied to determine the temporal constraints of the VEP responses to optic flow and motion-defined figures. Some of the results point to common mechanisms for the self- and object-motion patterns. Largely, however, the data suggest differential sensitivity: not only across the two classes of motion, but also across the patterns within each class, across scalp, and across speeds.

Gp150 encodes an ~150kd\ntransmembrane protein with an extracellular domain composed of 18 Leucine-rich repeat\n(LRR) domains and a short cytoplasmic domain containing three conserved tyrosine\nphosphorylation motifs (Tian and Zinn, 1994; Dhulkotia, 2000). Structural analysis of\nGp150 suggests a requirement of both the extracellular and cytoplasmic domain for\nGp150 activity. In the eye, removal of gp150 function causes defects in the refinement of\nR8 cells and the subsequent recruitment of cells into ommatidial clusters leading to the\nformation of adult eyes with fused ommatidia and ommatidia with too many or too few\nR-cells. Overexpression of gp150 causes dose dependent defects within second and third\ninstar eye imaginal disks. Due to similarities between phenotypes produced by gp150\nloss and gain of function and phenotypes produced through loss of notch signaling,\ngenetic interactions were tested between Notch signaling components and gp150. All\ngenetic assays tested strongly implicate gp150 as a regulator of Notch signaling.\nThrough expression analysis, we show that Gp150 is expressed within tissues where\ngp150 phenotypes arise. Within the third instar eye disk, Gp150 is expressed at high\nlevels within the morphogenetic furrow (MF) region. This expression is consistent with\nthe proposed role of gp150 modulating Notch signaling during early ommatidial\ndevelopment. Expression analysis also revealed that Gp150 is localized to intracellular\nvesicles which co-localize with the Notch ligand Delta within cells of the MF. These\nvesicles are most likely endosomes as Gp150 was shown to co-localize with the late\nendosomal markers DRab7. Therefore, it is proposed that Gp150 modulates the Notch\npathway through endocytic trafficking.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4139], "author_name_tesi": "Fetchko, Michael John", "last_name_ssi": "Fetchko", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhi Chun Lai", "Esther Siegfried", "Richard W Ordway", "Susan Abmayr", "Olanrewaju A Sodeinde"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Chair", "Esther Siegfried, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Susan Abmayr, Committee Member", "Olanrewaju A Sodeinde, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DROSOPHILA", "EYE DEVELOPMENT", "DEVELOPMENT", "TISSUE PATTERNING", "NOTCH PATHWAY", "CELL-CELL SIGNALING"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Impact of Heart Failure and Omecamtiv Mecarbil on Beta-Cardiac Myosin Function", "id": "28802", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12294", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\nPurpose:  Heart failure (HF) affects approximately 5.1 million people in the United States and is treated with a variety of drugs, many of which have long-term side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias.  Due to a high mortality rate, it is important to find a drug that is more efficient and safe for long-term use.  The small molecule cardiac myosin activator drug, omecamtiv mecarbil (OM), has been proposed as an effective treatment of heart failure.  In this study we investigate the effects OM has on the interaction of actin and myosin.  \nMethods:  Recombinant myosin was expressed in a C2C12 expression system which was compared to myosin purified from human heart tissue provided by The University of Kentucky Biobank.  We performed, in vitro motility and ATPase assays with and without OM to investigate the mechanisms of action of this drug.  In vitro motility was obtained using fluorescent microscopy after fixing myosin to the surface of a microscope slide and inserting fluorescently labeled actin to create interaction with the surface attached myosin.  The velocity, myosin density dependence, and actin filament length dependence were examined.  ATPase assays were performed by examining actin-activated ATPase in the presence and absence of OM.  The maximum ATPase rate (Kcat) and actin concentration at which the ATPase activity is \u00bd the maximum (KATPase) were obtained by plotting the ATPase activity as a function of actin concentration.\nResults:  ATPase assays showed there was a 6-fold decrease in the actin-activated ATPase rate.  In vitro motility showed a 100-fold decrease in filament velocity and a small difference in length dependence with and without OM.  Density dependence demonstrated that in the absence of OM, velocity increased as the density of myosin was increased while the trend was the opposite in the presence of OM.  Lastly, purified myosin from human heart tissue showed little movement in the absence of OM (3% filaments moving).  However, the presence of OM dramatically increased the percentage of filaments moving (93%). \nConclusion:  Based on our results, OM increased myosin\u2019s affinity for actin; however it remains unclear what the mechanism is behind the decrease in velocity in the in vitro motility assay.  The decrease in sliding filament velocity may be detrimental to heart function and thus a therapeutic dose may need to be carefully chosen.  Although the changes in the specific steps of the myosin ATP cycle are unclear, the enhanced interaction with actin in the presence of OM may increase force production in cardiac muscle.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11674], "author_name_tesi": "Fetrow, Christopher Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Fetrow", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Martin Yengo", "Patricia Mc Laughlin", "Charles H Lang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Martin Yengo, Thesis Advisor", "Patricia Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Charles H Lang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cardiac Myosin", "Heart Failure", "Omecamtiv Mecarbil"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF AN EXTRUDED FLAXSEED SUPPLEMENT ON TRANSITION COW IMMUNE FUNCTION AND EFFECTS OF A METHANE INHIBITOR ON TRANSITION COW OVARIAN ACTIVITY", "id": "13706mef5319", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13706", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In cattle, the transition period, which encompasses three weeks prior to three weeks after calving, is a critical time in the cow\u2019s life with increased incidence of metabolic and infectious diseases. During this time cows suffer from immunosuppression and negative energy balance. Negative energy balance (NEB) and immunosuppression are related in transition dairy cows and occur due to extreme metabolic stress and changing hormones as the cow transitions from a pregnant to energy-demanding lactating state coupled with decreased dry matter intake. Incidences of periparturient diseases are not only detrimental to the overall health and well-being of the cow, but they can also decrease milk output and reproductive efficiency, causing economic loss to the producer. For these reasons, improved management during the transition period that improves the health and well-being of the cow are paramount for setting the stage for successful reproduction and high milk production.\nTwo approaches were taken to address the challenges of the transition period. The first approach was to feed an omega-3 fatty acid extruded flaxseed supplement and measure effects on transition dairy cow immune function, plasma metabolites, and fatty acid composition of milk fat, plasma, and red blood cells. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) decrease expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines promoting an anti-inflammatory state. Further benefits of feeding fats include improved milk production and composition and improved fertility.\nThe second approach was to supplement transition dairy cows with a small molecule methane inhibitor and observe effects on return of ovarian activity. In a recent study, cows that received a methane inhibitor had increased body weight gain compared to cows that received a placebo. It is hypothesized that reducing methane production could make more energy available to the cow for other productive functions. To test this hypothesis, progesterone was measured in defatted milk via enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Parameters measured were days to evidence of a first corpus luteum (CL), length of first luteal phase, days to evidence of second CL, and interval between luteal phases. Evidence suggests that ovarian activity cannot resume until negative energy balance ceases and cows enter a positive energy balance. Cows that enter positive energy balance and cycle more before first service are more likely to have higher conception and pregnancy rates.\nThese two approaches were taken because NEB and immunosuppression are the primary causes of negative health events in transition dairy cows. Overall, the first approach showed cows receiving the flaxseed supplement had greater ALA in plasma and milk fat, reduced mRNA abundance of TNF and IL6, and reduced neutrophil phagocytosis and ROS. Results indicate that the omega-3 supplement altered the activation status of the immune system and reduced inflammatory responses. This reduction in neutrophil activity may increase energy available to the cow for productive functions, although this speculation needs to be confirmed with further research. The milk fat and plasma exhibited greater ALA the longer the cows were on the diet indicating this supplement can be used to produce milk with higher omega-3 fatty acids, which is an area of increased consumer interest. In the methane inhibitor study, there were no differences observed between treatment groups for any of the reproductive parameters. Results from both studies provide further support for the importance of maintaining proper energy balance during the transition period to support immune function and productive functions in dairy cattle.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14138], "author_name_tesi": "Fetter, Molly Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Fetter", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Molly", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Troy L.

This study is the first to use intervention and non-participant groups to see if there is a difference between the McGill Quality of Life (MQOL) total score between those that received full AgrAbility services and those that received minimal information.  The McGill QOL questionnaire was mailed to all 181 participants utilizing a three-part modified Dillman method with a cover letter, McGill survey and postage-paid return addressed envelope.  A response rate of 66.0% or 66 surveys were returned in the intervention group and 33.3% response rate or 27 returned surveys in the non-participant group.    \nNo significant differences were found between the intervention and non-participant groups based upon age and gender.   Significant differences were found between the two groups related to farm operation, work status, and primary disability.  The MQOL single-item mean score for the non-participant group was 5.79 and the score for the intervention group was 6.38 on the eleven point scale.  No significant difference was found (t = -.960; p > .05) between the groups based upon this statement.  Overall MQOL total scores were based upon a single-item physical question and four subscales.  No significant difference (t = .082; p > .05) was found between the groups.\nOne of the main findings was that the intervention group, which had received AgrAbility services; had a higher rate (95.5%) than the non-participant group (66.6%) in regards to remaining in production agriculture at either full or part time level.  A significant difference was found between the two groups in their ability to operate machinery (t = -3.24; p < .05) and their ability to change or modify their machinery (t = -2.64; p < .05).  Statements that were approaching significance related to completion of chores and their ability to manage their farm operation.  No statistically significance difference between the groups was found regarding accessibility to their workspace and ability to live in their home.  \n\tIn regards to farm operations, 50 out of the 93 farms represented in this study were dairy farms.

However, dairy farming represented a much larger majority of the farm operations in the intervention group compared to the non-participant group.  \nDairy farming is associated with manual labor and repetitive tasks and income fluctuations due to milk prices.  When comparing the MQOL total score for dairy farmers to the non-participant and intervention groups, mean scores for dairy farmers were 5.884 compared to 6.367 for non-participant and 6.248 for intervention.  There was no significant difference (F = .598; p < .05) between the three groups in regards to their overall MQOL total score. \n\tThree primary disabilities that ranked in the top three for the intervention group and the top five for the non-participant group included back injury, joint injury and arthritis.  These findings were expected due to the manual labor and repetitive motion tasks associated with production agriculture.

To this end the most common practice is to devote these frequencies to a single loudspeaker, or subwoofer, which is only responsible for the reproduction of low frequencies.  However, interactions between the subwoofer and the natural resonances of the listening room can lead to changes in the frequency spectrum at the listener location such that certain frequencies may be strongly reinforced by the room or strongly attenuated.  This can be problematic for consumer audio as it may lead to misconceptions about the quality of the source material or the sound system itself.  In a professional audio environment this can make it very difficult for an engineer to obtain an accurate perception of the source material, which is essential to their profession.\n \nOne possible solution to this problem involves the use of directional subwoofers which only radiate sound in certain directions, thus exciting only certain room resonances.  Modal coupling was investigated by modeling subwoofers as acoustic point sources and calculating the acoustic pressure at a listener location by using the green's function for a rectangular room with modal damping. \n \nIt was determined that the directionality of some sources did indeed dictate the excitation of modes, thus affecting the frequency spectrum at the listener location.  Furthermore, it was found that a particular configuration of the listener and a single dipole source can create a nearly flat response at the listener location below the second axial mode of the shortest room dimension.  For many applications this can cover the entire operating range of the subwoofer.  It was also found that two sources that are closely spaced but time delayed on the order of tens of milliseconds exhibit periodic amplitude changes that can be exploited to radiate sound effectively in frequency bands with very low modal densities.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8634], "author_name_tesi": "Feurtado, Philip Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Feurtado", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "Philip", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Carl Swanson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Carl Swanson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sound", "acoustics", "audio", "bass", "subwoofer", "room modes"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Quiet Structure Design Using Acoustic Black Holes", "id": "13604paf932", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13604", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years Acoustic Black Holes (ABHs) have been developed and demonstrated as effective, passive, lightweight vibration absorbers of flexural bending waves in beam and plate like structures.  ABHs employ a local power-law thickness profile into a beam or plate, typically resulting in a one dimensional wedge or a two dimensional indentation in the structure.  By reducing the thickness of the structure the ABH effect decreases the bending wave speed and increases the transverse vibration amplitude.  In the limit where the thickness goes to zero the wave speed goes to zero and the bending waves never reach the thin edge, thus they are `absorbed.'  Real, machined ABHs necessarily have some finite truncation thickness.  This results in local strain concentrations that effectively dissipate energy when coupled with a high loss material such as a traditional applied damping layer.  While the effectiveness of ABHs has been established and demonstrated, there is still a need to develop new insights that can help designers tailor the performance of ABHs for practical, realizable, noise and vibration control applications.  \n\nThis research aimed to expand the existing understanding of ABHs in ways that will be useful and instructive for designing ABH systems for practical noise and vibration control problems.  One of the ultimate goals of this branch of ABH research is to be able to prescribe a specific ABH design to suit a given noise and vibration control problem.  The results and methods developed here represent a significant and useful step towards that goal.  The first step involved investigating the limitations and implications of analytic ABH theory, the frequency dependent performance of ABH systems, and the structural acoustic coupling of embedded ABH systems with both response to distributed pressure excitations and radiation to the fluid surrounding the structure.  Analytic ABH theory provides predictions for the vibration reduction from a one dimensional ABH wedge, but the predictions conflict with key underlying assumptions such that better vibration absorption is predicted from more significant violations of the fundamental theory assumptions.  It was demonstrated that these effects can be significant for practical ABH designs and contribute to the effectiveness of ABHs, particularly at low frequencies.  A new design parameter was developed based on the theoretical assumptions to aid the design, assessment, and optimization of ABHs.\n\nThe low frequency performance, extension, and optimization of ABHs is also of particular interest because ABHs display a `cut on frequency' above which they become effective vibration absorbers.  Experimental investigations were conducted on plates with embedded arrays of ABHs as well as an individual ABH at low, mid, and high frequency in order to gain insight into the frequency dependent behavior of ABHs.  The results showed that the low frequency behavior of ABH systems is dictated by the activation of low order local ABH modes within the ABH taper.  Analyzing the vibration of the ABH plates in the wavenumber domain also revealed that ABH plates significantly affect the wavenumber characteristics of the structure, reducing the speed of supersonic bending waves to subsonic speeds and reducing the coupling between the structure and the surrounding fluid.  Additional transmission loss measurements and computational investigations demonstrated that the wavenumber sweep from the ABH effect also can significantly affect the power injection and response of embedded ABH plates to distributed pressure excitations.  Simulation results illustrated conditions for both positive and negative effects for ABH system noise control effectiveness.

S-RNase and PiSLF are the genes responsible for endowing specificity on the pistil and pollen parts, respectively, in Petunia inflata.  S-RNase was identified more than 15 years ago as the female determinant of SI and has been well-characterized through biochemical and in vivo functional analyses.  PiSLF, however, was only recently identified and confirmed as the male determinant, and biochemical characterization has just begun.  A series of in vitro binding results allowed our lab to propose a model, named the modified protein degradation model, to describe how the differential interaction between a PiSLF and its self and non-self S-RNases leads to the specific rejection of self pollen tubes during incompatible pollination.  Based on in vitro binding affinities of truncated forms of PiSLF to S-RNase, the lab proposed that PiSLF has three functional domains (FDs).  FD1 and FD3 comprise the S-RNase-Binding-Regulating Domain (SBRD) and FD2 is the S-RNase-Binding Domain (SBD), since FD2 alone interacted the strongest with S-RNase and addition of FD1 and/or FD3 weakened the interaction. \n \nThe lab acquired further experimental evidence to support the role of each domain by testing the interaction between several chimeric proteins and S-RNase in vitro.  Chimerics between PiSLF2 and PiSLFLb-S2, named b-2-b and 2-b-2, were made to test the function of FD2, since PiSLFLb-S2 is a PiSLF-like protein which does not interact with S-RNase at all.  Because 2-b-2 bound to S3-RNase less strongly than did full-length PiSLF2, and b-2-b did have some affinity for S3-RNase, it was concluded that FD2 is necessary but insufficient for the strong interaction between PiSLF and S-RNase.  In vitro binding assay results obtained from measuring binding affinities of chimeric proteins F1-2-1 and 2-1-2 to S2-RNase supported the specificity role of FD1 and FD3 as the regions of PiSLF which differentiate between self and non-self S-RNases.  \n\nMy thesis research focused on the use of in vivo approaches to examine the validity of some of these in vitro binding results and to further characterize the role of PiSLF in SI.  The first two objectives of my thesis research were to confirm whether the functions of the three FDs of PiSLF identified in vitro were physiologically relevant.  From in vitro binding analyses, FD1 and FD3 were purported as the regulatory regions of PiSLF, and FD2 was purported as the region responsible for the strong binding which occurs between PiSLF and S-RNase, especially during non-self interactions.  I approached these objectives by introducing several chimeric genes (b-2-b:GFP, F1-2-1:GFP and 2-1-2:GFP) and a construct containing FD2 only of PiSLF2 into S2S3 plants, and examined the SI phenotype of each transgenic line.  As outlined in Chapter 3, I confirmed that FD2 of PiSLF is necessary for the strong interaction between PiSLF and S-RNase, but that this region alone is not sufficient for the interaction to occur.  I could not confirm expression of the (His)6:T7-tagged FD2 construct on the protein level, but I designed another construct and alternative approaches to confirm expression of the original construct are discussed.\n\nThe results obtained from my analysis of the proposed SBRD, however, were not as clear-cut, and are described in Chapter 4.  The SBRD was proposed to endow specificity upon PiSLF, so I expected the chimeric protein F1-2-1:GFP to have the specificity of PiSLF1 in vivo and therefore, introduction of the chimeric gene F1-2-1:GFP into S2S3 plants to cause the breakdown of SI in both S2 and S3 pollen.  However, analysis of progeny raised from several of the (pLAT52)F1-2-1:GFP/S2S3 transgenic plants suggested the transgene only affected S3 pollen, and similar results were obtained from analysis of progeny raised from (pLAT52)PiSLF1:GFP/\nS2S3 control plants.  In contrast, the results of crosses involving transgenic (pLAT52)2-1-2:GFP/\nS2S3 plants were as expected.  The implications of these results are discussed in Chapter 4.\n\nMost F-box proteins whose functions are known act as the specificity component of an SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein) complex to mediate ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins through the 26S proteasome pathway.  The lab found that PiSLF bound to S-RNase, Cullin-1, PiSBP1 (P. inflata S-RNase-Binding Protein1), and an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in vitro, suggesting that a novel, PiSLF-containing SCF-like complex lacking a Skp1-like protein may be present in pollen.  My final thesis objective was to confirm the role of PiSLF as the F-box component of this proposed SCF-like complex in vivo.  To address this objective, I introduced RNAi and antisense constructs targeting PiSLF2 expression into plants.  If PiSLF is responsible for targeting S-RNase to the SCF-like complex during compatible pollination, we would expect suppression of PiSLF to prevent transgenic pollen tubes from delivering the sperm cell to the ovary to effect fertilization when pistils of any S-haplotype are pollinated.  Unfortunately, I did not observe any phenotype overall, and did not detect any suppression.  My results are discussed in detail in Chapter 5, which also includes descriptions of a previous Ph.D. student\u2019s attempts to suppress PiSLF2 expression, and my collaboration with another Ph.D. student to determine whether the suppression machinery is present in pollen of P. inflata.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [265], "author_name_tesi": "Fields, Allison Michelle", "last_name_ssi": "Fields", "middle_name_ssi": "Michelle", "first_name_ssi": "Allison", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Teh Hui Kao", "Teh Hui Kao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Teh Hui Kao, Thesis Advisor", "Teh Hui Kao, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Petunia inflata", "Self-incompatibility", "PiSLF"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Selection of a Preference Aggregation Method for Emergency Room Nurse Triage Decisions", "id": "9687", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1721", "abstract_tesi": "Most of the Emergency Departments (EDs) in major areas are often overcrowded.  Therefore, in order to recognize who is most in need of care, most EDs utilize a triage system to sort patients by severity of illness or injury.

The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a five-level triage system used by a majority of hospitals to assist in the prioritization. However, there is still a lot of subjective decision-making in the process which leads to discrepancies among nurses. In this work, we seek to determine a suitable aggregation method that best represents the individual nurse prioritizations and benefits an ED nurse staff by simplifying their decision-making. We chose five methods from the literature to explore, and through the application of utility theory combined with an expert opinion, determined the best method. The similarities and differences between the methods are also discussed. To this end, this study first analyzes the discrepancies in prioritizing patients from nurses at different hospitals and within the same hospital.  Nurses were given the same exercise of assigning an ESI number to several fictionalized patients and ranking them in order of importance.  Using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation comparison method, the results show that there are differences in ranking the patients, among nurses at different hospitals and even within the same hospital.\nWith this basis as justification for our work, utility theory is applied to select the best aggregation method for the situation. Next, four rank aggregation methods are applied to the prioritization data and then an expert evaluates the results and judges them on practicality and acceptability. The proposed recommendation for preference aggregation is the method of the estimation of utility intervals, and actually is different than the utility theory recommendation.

The most prominent signature of such outflows \nappears as broad absorption lines (BALs)  that are blueshifted from the emission line with a few thousands km/s velocities.\nIn this dissertation, I place further constrains upon the size scale, internal structure, dynamics, and  evolution of the \noutflows investigating profiles, properties, and variation characteristics of BAL troughs. \nI present observational results on BAL troughs in a large quasar sample \nutilizing spectroscopic observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey  spanning on multi-year timescales. \nThe results presented here, for the first time, provide a large and well-defined \nvariability data base capable of discriminating between time-dependent hydrodynamic wind calculations in a \nstatistically powerful manner.\n \nIn a  study of 582 quasars, I present 21 examples of   BAL trough disappearance. Approximately 3.3% of BAL quasars show disappearing \nC IV trough on rest-frame timescales of 1.1-3.9 yr. \nBAL disappearance appears to occur mainly for shallow and weak or moderate-strength absorption troughs but \nnot the strongest ones.  When one BAL trough in a quasar spectrum disappears, the other present troughs usually \nweaken. Possible causes of such coordinated variations could be disk-wind rotation or variations of shielding gas that \nlead to variations of ionizing-continuum radiation.\n\n\nI present a detailed study on  the variability of 428 C IV and 235 Si IV BAL troughs using a systematically \nobserved sample of 291 BAL quasars. BAL variation distributions indicate that BAL disappearance is an extreme type of \ngeneral BAL variability, rather than a qualitatively distinct phenomenon. The high observed frequency of BAL variability \non multi-year timescales is generally supportive of models where most BAL absorption arises at radii \nof 10-1000 light days. Average lifetime for a BAL trough along our line-of-sight  is a few thousand years which is \nlong compared to the orbital time of the accretion disk at the wind-launching  radius. \nWe have examined if BAL  variations on several timescales depend upon quasar properties, including quasar \nluminosity, Eddington luminosity ratio,  black hole mass, redshift, and radio loudness. Within the ranges of these \nproperties spanned by our sample, we do not find any strong dependences.\nThe coordinated trough variability of BAL quasars with multiple troughs suggests that changes in \"shielding gas\" may \nplay a significant role in driving general BAL variability.\n\nI present a study investigating the dependence of C IV BAL properties  and variation characteristics on \naccompanying Si IV and Al III absorption. Results of this study show that C IV BAL trough shapes, depths, \nvelocity widths and strengths show a strong dependence on the presence of Si IV and Al III BAL troughs \nat corresponding velocities. \nSimilarly, the variation characteristics and depth variation profiles of \nC IV BAL troughs also show a strong connection \nto BAL troughs in these transitions. Using these ions as a basic tracer of ionization level of the absorbing gas, \nsystematic measurements of variability and profiles for a large sample of C IV, Si IV, and  Al III BAL troughs\npresent observational evidences of the relation between ionization level, column density and kinematics of outflows.\n\nUtilizing  observational investigations on a large BAL quasar sample, we show that ionization level, column density and \nkinematics of outflows show correlated object-to-object differences. \nWe present a detailed comparison between the observational results of this study and the well studied disk-wind model \nof quasar outflows, which suggests that the wind is launched from the accretion disk at ~ 10^{16} - 10^{17} cm \nand radiatively driven by UV line pressure.

Funding per district was allocated based on student enrollment figures: $400 per student in grades k-3 and $2,000 per classroom teacher. The goal of Reading First was to enable every child to read by the third grade, through a scientifically research-based program of instruction and assessment.\n\tMy school district, which was the subject of this dissertation study, was one of the 43 in Pennsylvania that qualified for and was awarded a Reading First grant. As a local grant recipient, we were required to set up scientifically research-based reading programs and methods to test and track student achievement and progress and to provide professional development for kindergarten through third-grade teachers as well as to special education teachers. We were also mandated to hire one reading coach based on the number of teachers in our grant schools, who would implement the grant and provide the professional development. Although the roles of the coach were not articulated, they were expected to work directly with the teachers as a peer coach in their classrooms to help them improve reading instruction.\n\tThis dissertation study examined my role as a Reading First reading coach in a rural Pennsylvania elementary school during the first year of the program\u2019s grant implementation in 2003-2004. In order to holistically investigate my role as a reading coach and its meaning for those involved, I used a qualitative case study research design to systematically explore the phenomenon of the reading coach. Using systematic interviewing, as well data collected through my daily written log, I focused on discovering and interpreting my role as the reading coach in the classroom. I used a descriptive case study methodology that allowed for an examination of the program and the individuals involved. The bounded system selected for description and explanation included those directly responsible for implementing the Reading First grant in my school district. These included the three primary teachers (kindergarten, second, and third grade) in the elementary school along with the building administrator (the principal, curriculum coordinator, and the superintendent of schools). \n\tThe specific aim of this research was to examine my role as a Reading First coach during the first year of the program\u2019s grant implementation. The interviews allowed me to analyze the beliefs and attitudes of the teachers and the district administrators with respect to the Reading First policy implementation. My daily written log enabled me to compare the time I spent in certain roles and activities as a coach with their perceptions. The following were the research questions in the study:\n1.\tWhat were the perceptions of the district\u2019s teachers concerning the role of the Reading First reading coach?\n2.\tWhat were the perceptions of the district\u2019s administrators concerning the role of the Reading First reading coach?\n3.\tWere there differences in the ways the district\u2019s teachers and administrators perceived the role of the reading coach?\n4.\tWhich roles of the teachers did the reading coach take responsibility for?\n5.\tWhich roles of the administrations did the reading coach take responsibility for?\n6.\tWhat professional development opportunities did the reading coach provide to the Reading First teachers?\n7.\tHow much time did the reading coach spend in each of the coaching roles?\n\tFor the data collection in this study, I interviewed the six participants throughout the year of grant implementation (at the beginning, middle, and end), using open-ended questions. The interviews ranged from 30 minutes to over an hour. The data analysis consisted of three components: data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing/verification. Through this process, I identified six specific themes that revealed the perceptions of the district\u2019s administrators and teachers regarding the roles of the reading coach. At the same time, in my daily written log I documented the amount of time (in minutes) that I spent each day on specific tasks as the reading coach. I broke down these tasks into 18 categories and reformulated them into graphic documents to represent the information derived from my daily coaching log.\n\tSix themes emerged from my analysis of the interview data, which indicated that the study participants perceived the coach\u2019s role to include: ensuring fidelity to the grant, coordinating assessments required for the grant, modeling instruction for the Reading First teachers, and being a voice, mentor/encourager for them as well. The administrators and teachers strongly agreed that my role was to ensure fidelity to the Reading First grant initiative, including the core reading instruction and assessments. In addition, the teachers viewed my roles as being a resource and a voice. The administrators viewed my role differently, identifying my roles as voice, assessment coordinator, and model for instruction. The transcribed interviews confirmed that the teachers and administrators agreed that the coach\u2019s role did not take responsibility away from the teachers. In fact, the administrators thought that my role as coach empowered the teachers. My daily written logs did document the time I spent in roles that had previously been the responsibility of the teachers: parent trainings, meetings with parents, assessment of students, and data analysis. The three administrators believed that as the Reading First coach, I took on some of their responsibilities, including the coordination of assessment, informing the administrators about the grant status, and serving as a \u201cpseudo-administrator\u201d in the outlying buildings. The data from my coaching logs documented the administrative duties I assumed as the reading coach, i.e., taking on general administrative duties, planning professional development for teachers, performing grant writing and doing outreach.\n\tThe perceptions of the teachers and administrators that I gathered from my interviews were that all of the professional development opportunities that I provided for the teachers centered on the newly adopted reading series (Open Court) and the use of the mandatory Reading First assessments (DIBELS). My coaching logs documented that my time spent providing professional development included the planning, preparation, presentation, and organization of trainings provided by the Open Court consultant and myself.\n\tMy analysis of the data from my daily written log indicated that I spent the majority of my time during the year of the grant implementation in coordinating and administering student assessments, and providing and planning professional development for the teachers. I spent the least amount of my time engaged in peer coaching activities, i.e., co-teaching, observing, and modeling in the classroom. \n\tOne of the main conclusions from my findings in this study is that the reading coach cannot be solely responsible for grant implementation, i.e., predominantly administrative tasks and assessment, and still support classroom teachers in developing their practices to carry out the goals of Reading First and the No Child Left Behind Act. To be effective in facilitating the students\u2019 improvement in reading that Reading First promotes, the reading coach must spend the majority of her time working with teachers in their classrooms ensuring the transfer of learning. \n\tIt was vital to explore the six participants\u2019 perceptions since the roles of the reading coach in each district were largely defined by the way in which the administrators interpreted them. Additionally, how the classroom teachers perceived the role of the reading coach was important in regard to eliminating barriers to our driving forces for school reform, as well as for improving students\u2019 reading and academic achievement generally. Potentially, similar studies examining the perceptions of administrators and teachers on the role of the coach and identification of the reading coach\u2019s specific roles can help other school districts make informed decisions about how to incorporate the use of reading coaches into their school improvement plans. With this information, school districts can better integrate the coaching model into their existing structures.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5245], "author_name_tesi": "Fillman, Robin M", "last_name_ssi": "Fillman", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Robin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson", "Jacqueline Edmondson", "Daniel Dean Hade", "John W Tippeconnic, Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline Edmondson, Committee Member", "Daniel Dean Hade, Committee Member", "John W Tippeconnic, Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["literacy coach", "reading first", "rural schools"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Who Are Those Guys?

This study uses qualitative interviews with employees at a contract drilling company (pseudonym: Magna-Drill), and observations at work and in public to understand how the organization\u2019s structure enables and constrains masculinity among employees. The study finds that Magna-Drill\u2019s organizational structure reinforces domesticity\u2014economic system\u2019s masculine breadwinning norm. This means these men see breadwinning as their primary masculine role. Magna-Drill\u2019s organizational structure emphasizes health and safety policies and collectivist goals, which shape the ways men construct a masculinized occupational community. The formal organizational structure and informal occupational community structure shape the ways men construct masculinity at work, at home and in Marcellus Shale communities. Thus, Magna-Drill employees are \u2018undoing\u2019 conventional roughneck oilfield masculinities.

LSCs are resistant to TKI therapy, as they do not depend on BCR-ABL signaling for survival.

Organic residues in the O horizon include the biogeochemical \u201cleft-overs\u201d remaining in the system after losses predominantly associated with microbial mineralization to CO2, immobilization within living biomass, and leaching through the soil profile.

Refined extraction methods for organic-rich samples were developed for each biomolecule, with quantification of their concentrations in extracts achieved using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer. All biomolecules were found to contribute to the organic matter fraction of all samples, with concentrations decreasing from LMW polyphenols >> protein > DNA = chlorophyll. Differences in concentration and persistence by site and horizon were statistically significant and revealed two contrasting trends with increasing decomposition and depth: chlorophyll and LMW polyphenols decreased whereas protein and DNA increased. These trends are inconsistent with hypotheses based upon each molecules recalcitrance and aqueous solubility, suggesting the influence of alternative stabilization mechanisms that promoted their persistence in the soil.

Many researchers now believe that these declines are due in part to the effects of agrochemical pesticide use.  However, the majority of pesticide research focuses on the effects of pesticide active ingredients on adult honey bees without consideration for the complexities of real world exposure.  Pesticides are applied as formulated products composed of active and \u201cinert\u201d formulants, and these formulations are often tank mixed with inert adjuvants meant to enhance the spread and penetration of active ingredients.  Many inerts are assumed by the US EPA to be biologically inert, despite growing evidence that they are toxic to many non-target organisms.  Additionally, assessing the toxicity of agrochemicals to adult bees without consideration for their effects on developing larvae or potential interactions with other environmental stressors does not accurately represent their inherent risks.  This dissertation explores the effects and environmental fate of chemicals thought to be harmless or of lower risk to bees, including the inert organosilicone adjuvant product, Sylgard\u00ae 309 (OSS), the inert pesticide formulant N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and the organophosphate alternative, novaluron.  These experiments focus primarily on honey bee larvae, which are often overlooked in regulatory risk assessment.  First, a study was conducted to investigate the toxicity of OSSs to honey bee larvae when combined with exposure to common viral pathogens such as black queen cell virus (BQCV).  This exposure resulted in synergistic mortality related to decreased expression of a Toll-7 homologue and heightened BQCV titers.  The dying brood exhibited symptoms similar to those observed in hives used for almond pollination during the 2014 and 2016 seasons.  During almond pollination, tank mixes containing OSSs are often applied during bloom, and close proximity of hives from across the United States can facilitate the spread of viral pathogens.  Therefore, the study described here represents a real-world scenario likely encountered by many commercial beekeepers.  Next, the safety of the insect growth regulator formulation, Rimon\u00ae 0.83EC to honey bees was assessed.  Residue studies in apple orchards were performed to monitor the fate of its active ingredient, novaluron, and its major co formulant, NMP, and the results indicate that NMP is likely to dissipate in the environment before foraging bees come into contact with it, but novaluron residues, which were detected at 3 ppm in pollen 24 hours after application, are more problematic. Concurrently run larval rearing experiments and a nucleus colony study demonstrated that novaluron is highly toxic to honey bee brood.  These results suggest that applying novaluron to blooming flowers should be prohibited.  Finally, age related differences in tolerances to NMP were investigated.  In larval rearing experiments, NMP was chronically toxic to larvae at 100 ppm in diet, while adults are tolerant to significantly higher doses.  Honey bees were found to detoxify NMP via a cytochrome P450 mediated pathway, and larvae may be more sensitive to this co-solvent because of a deficit of P450 enzyme activity in the fat body.  This finding suggests that larvae may be more sensitive to some xenobiotics than adults, and highlights the importance of considering all members of a hive in honey bee risk assessment.  This work seeks to address assumptions in current pesticide regulation and explores the possibility that the use of agrochemicals thought to be inert or lower risk to pollinators may have unintended consequences for honey bee health.  By considering multiple variables, including the susceptibility of larvae to agrochemicals, agrochemical environmental fate, and the influence of multiple stressors, these results are easily extrapolated to real-world scenarios and indicate that follow-up studies to characterize the persistence of these chemicals in hive environments are warranted.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13790], "author_name_tesi": "Fine, Julia Diane", "last_name_ssi": "Fine", "middle_name_ssi": "Diane", "first_name_ssi": "Julia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher A.
