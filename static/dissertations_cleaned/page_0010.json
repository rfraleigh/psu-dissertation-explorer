However, the causal relationship between nicotine, the addictive component in tobacco, and its effects on immune function was not examined until the 1990\u2019s.  Immune cells have been exposed to nicotine via in vitro and in vivo designs.  However, the suppression of T- and B-lymphocytes, dendritic cell, macrophage, and neutrophil functioning by nicotine has only been observed using in vitro immune stimulation (e.g., concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide exposure).  Although valuable, these in vitro immune stimulation designs provide only a partial picture of the overall in vivo immune cell functioning.\n\tThis dissertation sought to understand how nicotine modulates the anti-viral immune response of male and female periadolescent C57BL/6J mice to herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection.  For seven days, male (n=59) and female (n=58) C57BL/6J mice were exposed to nicotine-spiked water at one of three concentrations (0 ug/mL, 50 ug/mL, and 200 ug/mL).  On day 8, all mice were infected with HSV-1 in both rear foot pads.  Nicotine exposure continued until day 12, when mice were sacrificed and popliteal lymph nodes were removed to observe the effects of nicotine on the HSV-1 anti-viral response (i.e., number of lymphocytes isolated, lymphocyte production of interferon-gamma (IFN-g, HSV-1 specific T-lymphocyte lysis).\n\tFemales exhibited a greater anti-viral response (e.g., number of lymphocytes isolated and lymphocyte production of IFN-g) to HSV-1 compared to their male counterparts.  In addition, the 50 ug/mL nicotine exposure group had a reduction in IFN-g production compared to the control group, which suggests a reduction in T-lymphocyte activation.  However, there were no sex or nicotine treatment group differences in HSV-1 specific immunity.  Therefore, the in vivo viral challenge resulted in a robust HSV-1 anti-viral response that was difficult to modulate with nicotine exposure in the present study.  A discussion of the results and suggestions for future studies are presented.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2835], "author_name_tesi": "Bennett, Jeanette Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Bennett", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Jeanette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Laura Klein", "Laura Klein", "Jennifer Graham", "David John Vandenbergh", "Robert Harold Bonneau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Laura Klein, Dissertation Advisor", "Laura Klein, Committee Chair", "Jennifer Graham, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["body weight", "anti-viral response", "sex differences", "herpes simplex virus-1", "adolescence", "nicotine"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Analysis of Stress Erythropoiesis: Stimulation of Toll-Like Receptors Induces Erythrophagocytosis and Activates Stress Erythropoiesis", "id": "14178lfb5037", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14178", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Stress erythropoiesis is a specialized stress response pathway capable of generating large numbers of new erythrocytes. Typically, stress erythropoiesis is activated in response to tissue hypoxia and acute anemic stress when homeostatic erythropoiesis is unable to compensate. During chronic inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines inhibit the production of new erythrocytes in the bone marrow, resulting in the development of anemia. However, recent work suggests that extramedullary stress erythropoiesis is activated in response to inflammation. This dissertation focuses on understanding the relationship between inflammatory signals and the stress erythropoiesis pathway. We have shown that stress erythropoiesis is activated in response to stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by a novel mechanism. Activation of TLRs results in increased erythrophagocytosis in red pulp macrophages in the spleen and the accumulation of free heme inside these cells. Heme acts as a signal to trigger the activation of stress erythropoiesis through the upregulation of critical regulators, Spi-C and GDF15. We demonstrate that stress erythroid progenitors respond differently to pro-inflammatory cytokines than progenitors in the bone marrow, and the activation of stress erythropoiesis is critical in delaying the onset of anemia during chronic inflammation.

In his model, sensations are not classified on the basis of anatomy, but rather by the function they serve. The idea of a \u201cchemofensor\u201d complex expands the Gibsonian model to include chemesthetic sensations, as well as the classical bitter and sour tastes and rancid or rotten odors. This comes at a fitting time when more unpalatable, but healthful compounds are incorporated into our diet. In particular, the discovery of oleocanthal, a compound responsible for the pungency of virgin olive oils, has reopened issues of qualitatively assessing the characteristics of chemesthetic compounds. This thesis includes a discussion of the difficulties surrounding a human behavioral approach to measuring chemesthesis and bitterness, including perceptual similarity, temporal considerations, and sensory adaptation. Major experimental findings include: Study 1- Differences between sub-qualities of irritation from olive oil, ibuprofen, and capsaicin were quantified, implicating that olive oil shares qualities with both ibuprofen and capsaicin. Study 2- Behavioral response to compounds that share structural similarity to oleocanthal and ibuprofen were used to identify functional parts of the molecules as well as further characterize the oral sensations from commonly used pain medications. The data from tyrosol and oleuropein suggest the functional end of oleocanthal does not include the phenol group, but may require the aldehyde groups at the other end of the molecule. Study 3- Ibuprofen and naproxen are similar to each other (high irritation, some bitterness), but not acetaminophen (high bitterness, little irritation). This result mimics what would be expected structurally. Finally, in Study 4- we explored the role of fat for masking unpleasant oral sensations from ibuprofen in dairy products. We observed a modest reduction in irritation with increasing milk fat, but bitterness was unaffected. Unexpectedly, the reduction cannot be explained by partitioning into the fat phase, so more sophisticated analyses are needed to understand the binding mechanisms responsible.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7271], "author_name_tesi": "Bennett, Samantha Michelle", "last_name_ssi": "Bennett", "middle_name_ssi": "Michelle", "first_name_ssi": "Samantha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John E Hayes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John E Hayes, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chemesthesis", "Bitterness", "Ibuprofen", "Olive Oil", "Sensory Evaluation", "Oleocanthal", "Structure Activity Relationships"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Examination of the Relationship Amongst Parenting Dimensions, Academic Achievement, Career Decision Making, and Commitment Anxiety Among African American High School Students\n", "id": "12370", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2834", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nDo parents play a significant role in the academic achievement and career decision making process of African American children? Studies have confirmed the importance of the role of parents and have even identified preferred parenting styles as having the best academic achievement (Dornbusch, Ritter, Leiderman, Roberts, & Fraleigh, 1987; Steinberg, Lamborn, Dornbusch, & Darling, 1992; Steinberg, Lamborn, Darling, Mounts, & Dornbusch, 1994) and career success outcomes (Amundson & Penner, 1998; Lopez & Andrews, 1987; McCollum, 1998; Penick & Jepsen, 1992; Perrino, 1985; Turner & Lapan 2002; Young, Valach, Paseluiko, Dover, Matthes, Paproshi, & Sankey, 1997).  However, current theories regarding the preferred parenting styles for academic and career success outcomes appear to have mixed thoughts regarding what is effective for African American adolescent development (Garg, Levin, Urajnik, and Kauppi,2005; Pong, Hao, & Gardner, 2005). As a result, this study examined the relationships amongst demographic background variables (gender, family configuration, parent/caregiver education level), parenting dimension variables (responsiveness, demandingness, responsiveness x demandingness interaction), career thoughts variables (decision making confusion, commitment anxiety) and academic achievement (ACT reading and math scores) of African American adolescents. A demographic survey, the Career Thoughts Inventory and the Parenting Style and Parental Involvement Inventory were administered to African American high school juniors and seniors from southeast Michigan to examine the relationships amongst variables. Participants included 117 high school students, ranging in age 16-19 years. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to examine and analyze the data. A significant model for ACT Reading emerged at a 99% and 95% confidence interval. The findings from these data suggested that reading level, not parenting, is associated with career thoughts processing. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2830], "author_name_tesi": "Bennett-Garraway, Jocelyn Maria", "last_name_ssi": "Bennett-Garraway", "middle_name_ssi": "Maria", "first_name_ssi": "Jocelyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counselor Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Spencer G Niles", "Spencer G Niles", "Jerry G Trusty", "Keith B Wilson", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Spencer G Niles, Dissertation Advisor", "Spencer G Niles, Committee Chair", "Jerry G Trusty, Committee Member", "Keith B Wilson, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["career decision", "academic achievement", "parenting", "African American students"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Conflict Stories in Multicultural Counselor Education: A Narrative Inquiry Among Counselors In Training", "id": "0g354f20t", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12823", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tA multicultural counseling class brings both challenges and rewards for its instructors and students.

The focus of this study was to illuminate this perspective in order to understand the conflict experiences that occur in multicultural counseling classes with master\u2019s counseling students. The purpose of this research was to provide insight about the retellings, characteristics, and meanings of conflicts that students experience by using narrative analysis. King and Baxter Magolda\u2019s model for intercultural maturity (2005) and Mezirow\u2019s (1978) transformational learning theory provided a conceptual framework and influenced the data analysis. \n\tSeveral findings emerged from this study. While each participant had uniquely distinct conflicts, qualitative analysis materialized thematic linkages across them. Three overarching domains surfaced in the horizontal analysis between stories: Class expectations, types of conflict experiences, and transformation.  Conflict experiences were also categorized with three integral themes: intercultural, intracultural, and institutional. The final domain, transformation, articulated the residues of conflict experiences: the generation of new meanings. \n\tFindings demonstrate the diverse and distinct quality of stories of master\u2019s level students who experience conflict in their multicultural counseling class as they navigate the complex tasks of professional identity development. Because not every student experiencing conflict articulated new meanings, further research may be needed about the factors of conflict experiences that foster transformation.\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12548], "author_name_tesi": "Benoist, Lauren N", "last_name_ssi": "Benoist", "middle_name_ssi": "N", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counselor Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Katie Kostohryz", "Dr. Katie Kostohryz", "Dr. Jason Gines", "Dr. JoLynn Carney", "Dr. Peggy Lorah"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Katie Kostohryz, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Katie Kostohryz, Committee Chair", "Dr. Jason Gines, Committee Member", "Dr. JoLynn Carney, Committee Member", "Dr. Peggy Lorah, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multicultural Counseling", "difficult dialogues", "counselor education", "narrative inquiry", "pedagogy", "conflict", "intercultural maturity", "transformative learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Market and Customer Knowledge and the Role of Value in Firm Performance", "id": "11013", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3436", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Market and Customer Knowledge and the Role of Value in Firm Performance provides a multi-tiered look at how and when market orientation impacts seller performance.

As our knowledge of the diversity and complexity of plant volatile signaling grows, we should view plant volatiles from an ecological perspective informed by signaling theory. This theoretical framework will provide insight into the evolutionary pressures involved in plant volatile communications. This approach will also generate predictions about features that may be found in plant volatile signaling, including mimicry, costly signaling, aposematic signaling, and kin selection.

In one study, I studied the effects of inbreeding on floral volatile signaling and pollinator interactions in horsenettle. I found that inbreeding negatively affects plant-pollinator signaling through floral volatiles and affects pollinator behavior. This is an example of ecologically mediated inbreeding depression caused by a breakdown of volatile communication. In another study, I investigated the possibility of plant-plant communication in horsenettle in preparation for studying kin selection in plants, though the evidence for plant-plant volatile communication in this study was not straightforward. Lastly, I investigated honest versus dishonest signaling in three species of tobacco and found evidence for a plant that honestly signals its defensive status, providing evidence for aposematic signaling through volatile emissions.

Special emphasis is placed on the development of his military strategy as he progressed from regional prince to lordship over the entire island.  \n     Brian\u2019s career has not received the scholarly attention given to his contemporaries elsewhere. His reign is either dealt with superficially in brief essays or treated more fully by writers interested in sensationalism. A careful study of Brian\u2019s strategy and operational method reveals that they continuously evolved during the course of his reign. This is contradictory to conventional wisdom that believes Irish military development to be static after the ninth century. Brian was a careful student of his enemies and neighbors. He increasingly relied on fleets, similar to the Vikings, to provide transportation and used a series of fortifications, in imitation of the Anglo-Saxons and Franks, both for defensive, as well as offensive operations.  \n     An argument to be made here is that the evolution of Brian\u2019s strategies can best be understood by examining his career in stages. The initial decade of his rule was spent gaining and consolidating authority within the southern province of Munster.  From 985 to 1002, Brian overcame rebellion within Munster and then expanded his rule to include the southern half of Ireland as well as gaining the submission of the previous high-king and the Viking center of Dublin.  The next decade reflected the mature campaigns of Brian as he moved into the northern kingdoms bringing them under his nominal control by the year 1012.  The final years of his life saw Brian responding to revolts and fighting his final battle at the field of Clontarf, just outside of Dublin.  \n     Another theme of this work is that Brian must be placed within the context of his European contemporaries.  Whatever the typical Irish kingship might have been, Brian was using tactics and methods usually believed to have been limited to Anglo-Saxon or continental monarchs. He consciously attempted to expand and define his authority in terms similar to those used by the Holy Roman Emperors, the Capetian kings of Francia, and the Anglo-Saxon kings of the family of Alfred the Great.  Brian\u2019s use of fleets, fortifications, and mercenaries combined with his efforts to secure the support of the church; all reflect an awareness of historical precedent and inspiration from outside Ireland.  Contrary to the popular perception of Brian as the liberator of Ireland from foreign dominance, he purposely used outsiders to expand his authority.  Brian \u201cBoru\u201d combined Irish tradition with innovation to become the most successful Irish king of his time.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1325], "author_name_tesi": "Beougher, David B", "last_name_ssi": "Beougher", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Thomas Hudson", "Carol A Reardon", "Baruch Halpern", "Janina M Safran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin Thomas Hudson, Committee Chair", "Carol A Reardon, Committee Member", "Baruch Halpern, Committee Member", "Janina M Safran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Brian Boru", "Clontarf", "Medieval Ireland"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Effects of Simultaneous Wall Shear Stress and Circumferential Strain on Endothelial Cell Junctions\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9478", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1367", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Complex hemodynamics play a role in the localization and development of atherosclerosis.  Endothelial cells (ECs) lining blood vessel walls are directly influenced by various hemodynamic forces: simultaneous wall shear stress (WSS), normal stress, and circumferential strain (CS) due to pulsatile flow, pressure, and diameter changes.  As such, ECs may sense and transduce these forces into biomolecular responses at intercellular junctions.  A hemodynamic simulator is used to investigate the combined effects of WSS and CS on EC junctions with emphasis on the stress phase angle (SPA), the temporal phase difference between WSS and CS.

The fast-paced life most people operate in today makes outdoor experiences limited, causing a lack of contact with the natural world.

The following study examines barriers that influence parental participation in non-formal education activities with their children. \u201cResearch has long shown that parents\u2019 positive involvement with their children\u2019s schooling is related to many positive outcomes\u201d (Horowitz & Bronte-Tinkew, 2007, p.1). Parental involvement in non-formal education would therefore help children function better in society. \nTo further investigate the question of parental involvement, 41 parents of camp attendees were surveyed about their participation in their children\u2019s environmental education. The surveys were evaluated for reasons why parents might, or might not, participate in their children\u2019s environmental education.\nThe research found that parents want to participate in non-formal learning with their children, and perceive their participation to be important in their children\u2019s academic performance. One barrier found was that parents do not always have time to participate in their children\u2019s education as much as they would like. A second barrier found was that parents do not always have the finances to pay for non-formal education programs. Educators could use this information to create better programs and enhance their curriculum. Results from this research can impact the creation of programs to involve parents in more environmental education activities with their children. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4184], "author_name_tesi": "Berardi, Mary Kate", "last_name_ssi": "Berardi", "middle_name_ssi": "Kate", "first_name_ssi": "Mary", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Ewing", "John Ewing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Ewing, Thesis Advisor", "John Ewing, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["barriers", "involvement", "outdoor education", "informal education", "non-formal education"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Low Temperature Processing of Sulfide and Oxide Lithium Solid Electrolytes to Bridge Ionically Resistive Boundaries", "id": "13156ssb176", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13156", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tSolid electrolytes are enabling materials for solid-state batteries.

While this is an improvement from the days when transgender communities were erased from both entertainment and news narratives, there still remain critical questions scholars must interrogate regarding the types of representation available to viewers. The majority of representations are trans feminine, leaving trans masculine folks largely invisible. Also, a good deal of transgender content is spectacularized in entertainment and news media, leaving little room to cover the bleak material realities that many transgender folks face. Yet individuals must be aware of the prevalence of discrimination against transgender people if society is to work against marginalization; media silence becomes rhetorical violence. \n\nThis dissertation first argues for a recognition of the paradox of trans visibility, phraselogy I use to highlight the process whereby glamorous, celebrity trans individuals attract media attention while the dire material realities of everyday trans people are erased. Secondly, I argue that such paradox is one of the consequences of narrative\u2019s heteroideology (Roof, 1996). However, because this dissertation focuses more on content and message (ideology), as opposed to narrative\u2019s structure and form, I instead use the term \u201cheteroideological narrative\u201d after establishing narrative\u2019s heteroidology as that which makes heteroideological narratives possible. I further argue that such paradox is attractive for media makers because certain aspects of experience must be omitted to return audience members to comfortable, normative tropes. Specifically, heteroideological narrative returns consumers to normativity politics of sexual identity through obfuscating queer, fluid bodies that deviate from \u201cproper\u201d heterosexually charged iconography that supports sex, gender, and sexual orientation binaries. Furthermore, binary sexual orientation is also locked into place through removing amorphous bodies that challenge the foundation of either male/female. It is through the shifting body that one can begin to complicate the attraction toward a particular sex, as no stable sex is present.\n \n \tThrough combining textual analyses of some mainstream transgender representations with a virtual ethnography of three trans masculine YouTube video bloggers (vloggers) and in-person interviews (Oregon, California, and Maryland), this project illustrates how these producers work against heteroideological narrative. These YouTube channels work against hegemonic categorization schemas that lead to stigma, gender policing, and discrimination through their explicit focus on their shifting forms. Their focus on malleable bodies then results in discussions of orientation and attraction that unravel widely accepted imaginaries of binary, stable sexual orientations. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14420], "author_name_tesi": "Berberick, Stephanie Nicholl", "last_name_ssi": "Berberick", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicholl", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle Rodino-Colocino", "Michelle Rodino-Colocino", "Russell Frank", "Matthew McAllister", "Nancy Tuana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle Rodino-Colocino, Dissertation Advisor", "Michelle Rodino-Colocino, Committee Chair", "Russell Frank, Committee Member", "Matthew McAllister, Committee Member", "Nancy Tuana, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transgender", "YouTube", "Trans masculine", "video blogs", "paradox of visibility", "narratives heteroideology", "heteroideology", "sexual orientation", "gender expression", "virtual ethnography", "textual analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Vacation From Civilization: The Origins and Emergence of Thru-hiking on the Appalachian Trail", "id": "15406", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7710", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis delves into the origins and emergence of thru-hiking on the Appalachian Trail.

Colorado\u2019s decision to banish the Olympics was the product of a change in how Coloradans viewed economic growth, combined with broadened understandings of the political power of citizenship.  A pro-growth and pro-development mindset present in early 1960s motivated Denver\u2019s political and business leaders to initiate their bid and facilitated their overriding confidence in the notion that they had the support of a large majority of Colorado\u2019s populace.  By the beginning of the 1970s, however, the idea that growth and development were unequivocal social goods had been quieted by a diverse set of issues connected to expectations regarding individual rights.  Namely, within Colorado, anxiety over the infringement of open spaces near people\u2019s homes, objections to undue spending of taxpayer dollars, and anger that citizens had been shut out of decision-making procedures inspired various people to challenge the wisdom and morality of hosting the Olympics.

This aggregated and forward-looking disclosure appears to reveal either (1) the more uncertain and unfavorable information that pending litigation is potentially material or (2) the more certain and favorable information that pending litigation is not expected to be material.  If textual variation in this seemingly boilerplate disclosure indeed captures relevant information about a firm\u2019s litigation, then it should be associated with measures of credit uncertainty and the cost of debt capital.  Using a hand-collected and manually-analyzed sample of materiality statements from the litigation disclosures (Item 3 and/or contingency notes) in the 2010 annual reports of S&P500 firms, I find that firms disclosing pending litigation is potentially material have greater credit uncertainty (more bond rating disagreement), worse credit quality (worse bond ratings), and a higher cost of debt capital (higher bond yields) than firms disclosing pending litigation is not expected to be material.  The nature (e.g., class action status) and not necessarily the quantity of the lawsuits relative to the firm\u2019s size as well as the potential threat of shareholder litigation are determinants of this materiality disclosure.  And, for the small minority of S&P500 firms that separately disclosed litigation-related charges in the subsequent period, I find that firms disclosing pending litigation is potentially material accrue a larger litigation-related charge than firms disclosing pending litigation is not expected to be material.  These findings suggest that a firm\u2019s general litigation materiality disclosure captures credit-relevant information about the firm\u2019s pending litigation \u2013 specifically, information about the importance of the litigation and expected litigation losses.

It is essentially a natural extension of earlier work in this group with functionalized polymer blends, where it was proposed that the number of intramolecular contacts far exceeded what one would expect from the classical mean field theory. Models with varying degrees of complexity were investigated, where intramolecular contacts, in each case, were treated explicitly.\nFirst a very simple modification of the classical Flory-Huggins theory is investigated, and it is shown that it is possible to reproduce the concentration dependence of the interaction parameter in polymer solutions with surprising accuracy. It is also shown that the calculated spinodals were in good agreement with experimentally reported data, especially at higher molecular weights.\nFree volume effects are then accounted for through a modification of the Flory-Orwoll-Vrij Equation of State model. The model was tested for a number of systems at &#952;-conditions as well as non &#952;-conditions, for its ability to reproduce the concentration dependence of the interaction parameter, using solubility parameters as well as internal pressures, with varying degrees of accuracy.\n\tAnother simple modification of the Flory-Huggins theory for polymer blends is presented. It is shown that the model is able to reproduce the very peculiar phenomenon observed in the behavior of the interaction parameters determined from Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) in isotopic polymer blends, by varying the screening factor for one of the components by less than 3 %.\n\tFinally it is shown that a further modification to accommodate copolymer blends, leads to a model which is equally well equipped to describe the strong concentration dependence of the interaction parameter observed experimentally. A few assumptions are made in these calculations, and the most important of these is that the copolymers are treated as homopolymers. Since only isotopic copolymer systems were investigated it is presumably a safe assumption. It was found that a small change of less than 4 % in the screening factor of one of the components was enough to obtain extremely good correspondence with the experimentally observed data. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3858], "author_name_tesi": "Berg, Lennart Paulmann", "last_name_ssi": "Berg", "middle_name_ssi": "Paulmann", "first_name_ssi": "Lennart", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul C Painter", "Ronald C Hedden", "James Patrick Runt", "Ramanathan Nagarajan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul C Painter, Committee Chair", "Ronald C Hedden, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Ramanathan Nagarajan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["intramolecular screening effects", "thermodynamic modelling", "concentration dependence of the interaction parame"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INTEGRAL TIME-OF-FLIGHT AND CHARGE EXTRACTION BY LINEARLY INCREASING VOLTAGE TECHNIQUES FOR DETERMINING CARRIER MOBILITY \n", "id": "10399", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "63", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Charge transport properties of thin film organic solar cells are investigated using both integral time-of-flight (I-TOF) and charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV) measurement techniques.

Both results are close to published data, with our I-TOF data being somewhere in the middle, and the CELIV results being slightly lower [1-5].\n\nIntegral TOF mobility results are probed as a function of collection capacitance, voltage, and light intensity.  No significant variation is seen for changing the capacitance or the light intensity, but changing voltage yields the intriguing negative mobility dependence which has been reported in literature [6].\n\nComparison between the two techniques is made.

To advance their agenda of social change, social movements put \npressures on both American society in general and on specific segments of this society for change.  American corporations represent one significant segment of American society often\ntargeted by social movements.  However, little is known about how social movements influence organizations (Oliver, 1991). This dissertation examines this issue by examining the impact \nof one social movement, the contemporary environmental movement, on organizational behavior. It asks the question, under what conditions do organizations respond to social movements?\n\nA panel of fifty-seven firms from two industries was the focus of this study. These firms were followed from 1970 until 1995 to assess the impact of the contemporary environmental movement\non their structures and actions. Institutional theory provided the basis for explaining how social movements influence organizations. Following institutional theory logic four primary forces\nwere identified: public support, industry attention, legal support, and regulatory support for the environmental movement.\n\nThe results suggest that firms do respond to social movements. In particular, firms were most likely to respond to increases in public support for and industry attention to the environmental \nmovement. Further, contrary to conventional wisdom (c.f. Hardin, 1968)increases in coercion by the federal government in terms of legal mandates and regulatory power did not appear to influence\norganizational actions.  Surprisingly, firms appear to learn about their environment through watching other firms and not from their own experiences. Finally, and most generally, the findings suggest\nthat social movements do influence organizational behavior even in the face of organizational inertia and financial constraints.\n\nThese findings have several implications for theoretical development. First, they suggest that the institutional environment should not be thought of as monolithic. The various institutional forces\nappear to influence organizations differently. Further, the results suggest that direct coercion may not play an integral role in organizational action, as has been expected. Finally, these findings\nsuggest that firms appear to learn about and experience their environments vicariously and that these lessons may be more powerful than a firm's own direct experiences.

Experiments comparing the cognitive abilities of animals coming from populations exposed to contrasting ecological environments have provided insights into the factors that contribute to variation in learning and memory ability. To investigate this further, I selected natural populations of tropical freshwater fish, the Panamanian bishop (Brachyrhaphis episcopi) that are naturally exposed to contrasting levels of predation. The research presented in this thesis compares the spatial learning abilities and the memory duration of an associatively learned task in B. episcopi from these different populations.\nFirst, I compared spatial learning performance to determine whether fish varied in their ability to solve a maze task, and in the information that they paid attention to as they moved through the maze. Fish from high predation sites were quicker to make decisions about which route to take, but were also more apt to make mistakes. In contrast, fish from low predation areas made slower, more accurate decisions. The relative exposure to predators did not predict which kinds of spatial information the fish would use, but differences were found between rivers.\nMy second experiment examined the ability of the fish to learn a conditioned response (associate a light cue with the delivery of a food reward) and then compared the rate of extinction of this learned association once the light cue no longer predicted the arrival of food. While fish with different experiences of predation showed no differences in the rate at which they formed the conditioned association between the light and the food, we did find that fish from low predation sites were quicker to show an extinction response compared to high predation conspecifics. \nTogether, the results presented in this thesis indicate that ecological variables, specifically predation, play a substantial role in shaping learning, memory and other behavioral traits in fish.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8048], "author_name_tesi": "Beri, Steven Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Beri", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read", "Paul Allen Bartell", "Tracy Lee Langkilde"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read, Thesis Advisor", "Paul Allen Bartell, Thesis Advisor", "Tracy Lee Langkilde, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cognition", "Brachyrhaphis episcopi", "cognitive ecology", "predation effects", "speed accuracy trade-off", "extinction response"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Models of Growth and Mortality Following Long-term Translocation of Wild Ash Populatinos", "id": "26422", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11154", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Climate change predictions have implications for long-lived, slow-growing, sessile organisms such as forest trees.

I have used data from two provenance tests, one of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.) and one of white ash (Fraxinus americana L.), to model the responses to climate change of green and white ash and 55 and 50, respectively, natural populations within each. Using a mixed-effects modeling framework, I have developed models of 32- to 39-year survival and mean annual diameter growth as functions of climatic distance, or the difference between the climate of the plantation site and the climate of the population autochthony. Three models have peaks in survival or growth at small negative or positive climatic distances, possibly indicating that most populations are reasonably well adapted or have a small lag in local adaptation. White ash growth, however, is highest at a large, negative climatic distance, which possibly reveals limitations in the data used in the models. For both species, the random effect of plantation has a significant effect on growth and survival, and the random effect of provenance has a significant effect on growth. Standard deviations, pseudo-r-squared values, and variance components reveal that the effect of plantation on the response to climatic distance was large in all models, indicating that management of site conditions could be used to potentially ameliorate the negative effects of climate change on growth and survival of these species.

The current study evaluates the impact of oxidative jet fuel stability on the following low-temperature properties: crystal size, crystal shape, freeze point, and viscosity.     \n\tIt was found that over the range of oxidative conditions studied, compositionally similar products were produced for each fuel.

The conventional method for specifying the interfacial area concentration in the two-fluid model is through flow regime-based empirical correlations coupled with regime transition criteria. However, a more physically consistent approach to predicting the interfaciala area concentration is through the interfacial area transport equation (IATE), which can address the deficiencies of the flow regime-based approach. Some previous studies have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of IATE in developmental versions of the nuclear reactor systems analysis code, TRACE. However, a full TRACE version capable of predicting boiling two-phase flows with the IATE has not been established.\n\nTherefore, the current work develops a version of TRACE that is capable of predicting boiling two-phase flows using the IATE. The development is carried out in stages. First, a version of TRACE which employs the two-group IATE for adiabatic, vertical upward, air-water conditions is developed. An in-depth assessment on the existing experimental database is performed to select reliable experimental data for code assessment. Then, the implementation is assessed against the qualified air-water two-phase flow experimental data. Good agreement is observed between the experimental data for and the TRACE code with an average error of 9% for all conditions. Following the initial development, one-group IATE models for vertical downward and horizontal two-phase flows are implemented and assessed against qualified data. Finally, IATE models capable of predicting subcooled boiling two-phase flows are implemented. An assessment of the models shows that TRACE is capable of generating interfacial area concentration in subcooled boiling two-phase flows with the IATE and that heat transfer effects dominate the evolution of in these flows.\n\nIn parallel to developing a TRACE version with the IATE capability, an extensive study is performed to improve the capabilities of the four-sensor conductivity probe. These include improvements in both the signal processing software and processing schemes. Furthermore, experiments are performed in 14 additional test conditions.

I measured occupancy as the number of birds that occupied 30-m grid cells that covered two 18-ha study sites over the 12-year period and similarly calculated reproductive success rates within each grid cell.  I measured first-year return rates and used GIS to calculate shift distances and overlap between consecutive territories.  Despite variation in occupancy, reproductive success rates were generally high.  Return rates also were high and birds rarely moved more than a territory width (68 m) during their lifetimes.  There was no relationship between site fidelity and past reproductive success, but shift distances decreased with age.  My results differed from past studies that found a relationship between breeding dispersal and past reproductive success for species in a number of habitats.  The lack of territory movements of Ovenbirds at Hawk Mountain Sanctuary may represent a general case for songbirds breeding in stable, high quality habitats, where sources of failure are infrequent and unpredictable.  Birds may base dispersal decisions on more than personal breeding experience by monitoring the performance of neighbors to make broader assessments of habitat quality, which could explain why patterns of fidelity differ among habitats based on quality and level of heterogeneity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4129], "author_name_tesi": "Bernard, Michael Jeffrey", "last_name_ssi": "Bernard", "middle_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham", "Margaret Brittingham"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham, Thesis Advisor", "Margaret Brittingham, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["decision rules", "Ovenbird", "breeding dispersal", "site fidelity", "habitat selection", "territory shift"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Hard/Soft Information Fusion in the Condition Monitoring of Aircraft", "id": "23631", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10606", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The synergistic integration of information from electronic sensors and human sources is called hard/soft information fusion.

A synoptic climatology (i.e., composite average) of upper troposphere (UT) variables (temperatures, specific humidity, horizontal winds, and vertical lapse rate) for these longer-lasting jet contrail outbreaks was also developed to link the impacts of contrail outbreaks with conditions favorable for their formation.

The South outbreaks generally covered a larger area, occurred in conjunction with an anomalously cooler UT, and were more likely to take place in a region of warm air advection. Moreover, large wind shear values and strong gradients of the aforementioned UT variables across the outbreak box, symptomatic of a baroclinic environment, characterize the formation of the long-lived contrail outbreaks. The results of this study demonstrate the impact jet contrails have on short-term weather and climate through the reduction of DTR.

This study sought to understand how disrupted systems adapt to injury both during resting and goal-directed brain states by establishing whether individuals with TBI show increased connectivity compared to healthy controls (HCs), whether the increased connectivity is occurring through dedifferentiation of networks, and finally, how differences in connectivity compared to healthy controls relate to cognitive functioning.  Participants and Methods: Graph theory was implemented to examine functional connectivity in 18 individuals with moderate to severe TBI and 18 HCs.  Adjacency matrices were created and the weights of surviving edges were compared both within group during rest and task and between groups.  The relations between these metrics were then compared with performance on cognitive measures.  Results: TBI subjects showed no differences in weighted degree between rest and task, in contrast to HCs who demonstrated increased weighted degree during task compared to rest.  Individuals with TBI were hyperconnected during rest compared to HCs, and increased connectivity of nodes involving task-related regions of interest (ROIs) accounted for much of the hyperconnectivity observed during rest in individuals with TBI compared to HCs.  There were no significant differences in connectivity during task at the network level in TBI subjects compared to HCs.  Increased connectivity during rest between task-related ROIs was associated with worse performance on a measure of set-shifting during task, whereas increased connectivity with nodes of the DMN, typically not associated with task, was associated with better performance on Digit Span Backward.  Conclusion: The relation between increased connectivity and cognitive functioning depended on what state and between which networks the hyperconnectivity occurred.  Therefore, examining hyperconnectivity at a global level obscures specific relations between hyperconnectivity and cognitive function.  Continuing to explore connectivity changes during recovery at the network level during specific cognitive states will elucidate specific connectivity profiles used to better understand and predict recovery following injury.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12041], "author_name_tesi": "Bernier, Rachel Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Bernier", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Frank Hillary", "Nancy Anne Coulter Dennis", "Peter Andrew Arnett", "Stephen Jeffrey Wilson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Frank Hillary, Thesis Advisor", "Nancy Anne Coulter Dennis, Committee Member", "Peter Andrew Arnett, Committee Member", "Stephen Jeffrey Wilson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Traumatic brain injury", "functional connectivity", "hyperconnectivity", "fMRI", "graph theory", "network theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Parameter Estimation For Subdiffusive Processes With Applications To Microrheology", "id": "20735", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9862", "abstract_tesi": "The statistical analysis of complex biological \u001dfluids is a research area of active interest.

Non-ultramafic substrates show significant climate-driven vegetation change while ultramafic substrates show relative compositional stability, suggesting that ecosystem responses to climate are strongly mediated by substrate.

Growth sensitivity to temperature and precipitation variables-- monthly, seasonal and annual-- is examined.

Specifically, I analyze Philadelphia Puerto Ricans\u2019 adoption of three sound changes in-progress in the greater metropolitan area\u2014filling a curious lacuna in an otherwise well-studied speech community. Conversational and read speech data were collected in the field alongside sociodemographic information, permitting a detailed description of the usage patterns of this longstanding minority population and an assessment of their linguistic production relative to the larger (predominately white) majority community. \n\nEach of the three sound changes analyzed has a distinct level of social awareness in the majority community and is at a distinct point along the typical trajectory of language change. Ey-Raising, where /e\u026a/ raises in closed syllables to make fate sound more like feet, lies under the level of social awareness and is geographically restricted to Philadelphia. Raising of /a\u026a/ before voiceless codas (\u2018Canadian Raising\u2019), where the vowels in price and prize cease to be homophonous, is a marker present in many areas of the northern United States, which in Philadelphia shows style shifting but no clear independent effects of socioeconomic status. Finally, /\u0254/ lowering is a stereotype wherein a raised mid-high or high variant of /\u0254/, which is also present in New York, has reversed its trajectory and is lowering toward its original height\u2014likely driven by a desire to distance oneself from stigmatized, working-class speech.\n\nThe social and linguistic conditioning of the Puerto Rican data are analyzed using generalized additive mixed modeling, a relatively new and powerful statistical tool for investigating trends over time. The spectral variability of /\u0254/ relative to /\u0251/, a reference vowel, is assessed using the Pillai score, a metric derived from MANOVA that approximates the degree of spectral overlap. Trends in Puerto Rican production patterns are then interpreted within the context of the changes in-progress described for white Philadelphians and with respect to principles of language change more generally. Additionally, a social network analysis is conducted that utilizes graph-theoretic metrics of embeddedness and betweenness to explore the importance of one\u2019s social connections on the adoption of the target changes in-progress.\n\nDespite limited contact with white Philadelphians, the common belief that they speak poor, accented English, and the general folk wisdom that minorities don\u2019t participate in majority sound change, Puerto Ricans have in general adopted the sound changes-in-progress in greater Philadelphia\u2014both in overall rates and in linguistic conditioning. Of note is that while speakers show trends in line with white Philadelphians in their vocalic production, their usage patterns represent trends present on a larger scale than Philadelphia per se. There is evidence that they are more advanced than whites in Canadian Raising, which is geographically prevalent in the northern US, and younger Puerto Rican men appear to be using the geographically ubiquitous COT-CAUGHT merger to avoid the stigmatized /\u0254/ vowel. \n\nFurthermore, the data suggest that minority speakers, who may have weaker ties to the majority speech patterns, are more adaptable to changes in-progress in their surroundings than majority speakers. While participation in the Philadelphia-centric Ey-Raising increases with social network density, the geographically widespread Canadian Raising shows a negative relationship between graph metrics, suggesting that weaker ties to the social network advance this change.

A cure for this debilitating disease has remained ellusive in part due to its complex genetics. Linkage studies have identified over 25 Insulin dependent diabetes (Idd) regions known to be associated with T1D development. We focused on one of these regions, a ~200 gene region called Idd9. This region contains genes known to regulate lymphocyte function and development and can confer greater than 90% protection from T1D in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a spontaneous T1D animal model of human T1D in which the NOD Idd9 is exchanged with the same region from a T1D-resistant mouse strain. The goal of this dissertation was to further elucidate the mechanisms by which Idd9 confers protection from T1D development in NOD mice. We investigated the role of this region in the regulation of islet-specific, autoimmune CD4+ T cells and the role of a sublocus of this region, Idd9.3, in overall T1D development. \nTo identify the role of Idd9 in the regulation of diabetogenic, islet-specific CD4+ T cells, we developed novel NOD.B10 Idd9 (line 905) congenic mice that harbor predominantly islet-reactive CD4+ T cells expressing the BDC2.5 T cell receptor (BDC-Idd9.905 mice). We compared these BDC-Idd9.905 mice containing the Idd9 from the T1D-resistant C57BL/10 (B10) mouse to BDC2.5 TCR transgenic (BDC2.5) mice containing the NOD-derived T1D-susceptible Idd9. Overall, these findings identified Eno1, Rbbp4, and Mtor as candidate genes in the regulation of diabetogenic islet-specific CD4+ T cells and suggest their role in T1D pathogenesis. \n\tIdd9.3 contains 19 genes instead of the ~200 found on full-length Idd9, allowing us to more easily focus in on individual genes to identify specific genes and genetic mechanisms contributing to T1D. We used congenic NOD mice containing the T1D-resistant B10 Idd9.3 (NOD B10 Idd9.3) and compared them to NOD mice and found that NOD.B10 Idd9.3 mice had a vast reduction in B cells. Constitutive expression of MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a), one of the genes on Idd9.3, had previously been shown to mediate an early B cell developmental block by repressing the B cell developmental transcription factor Foxp1. We therefore set out to determine whether the B cell development block in NOD.B10 Idd9.3 mice was controlled by the miR-34a-Foxp1 axis. We investigated miR-34a expression and Foxp1 levels in developing B cells of NOD.B10 Idd9.3 mice and found a significant increase in miR-34a expression that directly correlated with a decrease in Foxp1 levels. This finding implicated miR-34a and  its repression of Foxp1 as a likely mechanism underlying the B cell paucity seen in NOD.B10 Idd9.3 mice. We also show that reduced B cell numbers and impaired B cell APC function in NOD.B10 Idd9.3 mice directly correlates with inefficient diabetogenic CD4+ T cell proliferation as compared to NOD mice, likely due to reduced numbers and ability of B cells to act as APCs. Therefore, miR-34a-mediated B cell paucity may contribute to inefficient priming of diabetogenic CD4+ T cells, resulting in T1D protection in NOD.B10 Idd9.3 mice.\n\tOverall, our studies of Idd9 and Idd9.3 have led to the identification of novel Idd9 candidate genes and identification of novel mechanisms by which these genes may contribute to T1D protection. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9782], "author_name_tesi": "Berry, Gregory John", "last_name_ssi": "Berry", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hanspeter Waldner", "Hanspeter Waldner", "Laura Carrel", "Todd Schell", "Neil David Christensen", "Jianxun Song", "Laura Carrel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hanspeter Waldner, Dissertation Advisor", "Hanspeter Waldner, Committee Chair", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Jianxun Song, Committee Member", "Laura Carrel, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Type 1 Diabetes", "NOD mouse", "Insulin-dependent diabetes locus 9", "B cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Effects of daily almond consumption (1.5 oz.) on cardiometabolic risk factors in individuals with elevated LDL-cholesterol: lipids and lipoproteins, body composition, and interindividual variation", "id": "22712", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10232", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nut consumption is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. The benefits of nuts are likely due to their unsaturated fatty acid profile, fiber and phytosterol content, and other bioactive nutrients. Reductions in total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C can be achieved by substituting foods high in unsaturated fat, like nuts, for those high in saturated fat and/or refined carbohydrates. Of all the tree nuts, almonds provide the most fiber, protein, and \u03b1-tocopherol per one ounce serving, and clinical evidence consistently shows lipid and lipoprotein improvements with almond consumption. Previous controlled-feeding almond studies employed diet designs that incrementally decreased some or all foods to accommodate the caloric addition of almonds. Thus, almonds have not been evaluated in a controlled-feeding setting using a diet design with only a single, calorie-matched food substitution to assess their effects on cardiometabolic risk factors. We hypothesized that substituting whole almonds for a high-carbohydrate snack, within the context of a low-fat, low-cholesterol background diet, would improve lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins and decrease abdominal adiposity in adults with elevated LDL-C. A randomized, 2-period (6 wk/period), crossover, controlled-feeding study of 52 individuals with elevated LDL-C (148.0 \u00b1 2.7 mg/dL) was designed to compare a cholesterol-lowering diet with almonds (1.5 oz. of almonds/d) to an identical diet with an isocaloric muffin substitution (no almonds/d). Differences in the nutrient profiles of the control (58% CHO, 15% PRO, 26% total fat) and almond (51% CHO, 16% PRO, 32% total fat) diets were due to nutrients inherent to each snack; diets did not differ in saturated fat or cholesterol. The almond diet, relative to the control diet, decreased non-HDL-C (-6.8 \u00b1 2.4 mg/dL; P = 0.01), LDL-C (-5.2 \u00b1 1.9 mg/dL; P = 0.01), and remnant lipoproteins (-2.8 \u00b1 1.2 mg/dL; P = 0.03); whereas, the control diet decreased HDL-C (-1.8 \u00b1 0.6 mg/dL; P <0.01). Almond consumption also reduced abdominal fat (-0.07 \u00b1 0.03 kg; P = 0.01) and leg fat (-0.12 \u00b1 0.05 kg; P = 0.02), despite no differences in total body weight. \n\tIt is well established that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol decrease CVD risk factors, including TC and LDL-C. Consequently, this dietary change also results in decreased HDL-C concentrations. We have shown that a cholesterol-lowering diet incorporating almonds decreases HDL-C to a lesser extent than a traditional low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. HDL has atheroprotective properties that extend beyond absolute HDL-C concentrations, therefore we investigated the dietary effects of almonds on HDL biology and function. We hypothesized that incorporating 1.5 oz./d of almonds in a cholesterol-lowering diet would attenuate decreases in HDL function (i.e. cholesterol efflux) and HDL subspecies that are observed with traditional cholesterol-lowering diets. The almond diet decreased \u03b1-1 (-1.4 \u00b1 0.7 vs. -3.4 \u00b1 0.7 mg apoA1/dL; P = 0.001) and the \u03b1-1: pre\u03b2 ratio (-0.06 \u00b1 0.16 vs. -0.55 \u00b1 0.17; P = 0.02) significantly less than the control diet. In addition, the almond diet reduced small HDL \u03b1-3 compared to the control diet (-1.0 \u00b1 0.6 vs. 0.1 \u00b1 0.6 mg apoA1/dL; P = 0.04). There were no treatment effects on global or transporter-specific cholesterol efflux. Collectively, almonds reduced LDL-C, remnant lipoproteins, and central adiposity and improved HDL subparticle distribution, all of which are important risk factors for cardiometabolic dysfunction. Daily consumption of almonds, substituted for a high-carbohydrate snack, may be a simple dietary strategy to prevent the onset of cardiometabolic diseases in healthy individuals. \n\tIndividual responses to dietary treatment varied widely in our study population. We were interested in examining the contributions of interindividual characteristics on treatment response variability. We hypothesized that the almond diet, relative to control, would provide greater benefits in individuals who were normal weight (BMI <25 kg/m2) versus overweight/obese (\u226525 kg/m2), individuals with low CRP (<1.0 mg/L) versus those with higher CRP (\u22651.0 mg/L), and in individuals with higher cholesterol absorption (lathosterol-to-\u03b2-sitosterol ratio <0.95) compared to those with lower cholesterol absorption (\u22650.95) on the basis of lipids and lipoproteins. Subgroup analyses revealed that responses to diet were influenced by baseline BMI, CRP, cholesterol absorption, and age categories. In lean participants, the almond diet improved TC (-14.2 \u00b1 4.2 mg/dL; P = 0.01), LDL-C (-12.6 \u00b1 3.3 mg/dL; P <0.01), and HDL-C (3.5 \u00b1 1.0 mg/dL; P = 0.01) compared to the control diet. The almond diet also improved HDL-C in participants with lower relative cardiovascular risk (2.8 \u00b1 0.7 mg/dL; P <0.01) and in those with higher cholesterol absorption (3.3 \u00b1 0.7 mg/dL; P <0.01). In older participants, the almond diet improved TC (-10.7 \u00b1 3.2 mg/dL; P = 0.01) and LDL-C (-9.8 \u00b1 2.5 mg/dL; P <0.01). Participants that were younger, overweight/obese, had an average to higher cardiovascular risk, or lower cholesterol absorption experienced no treatment effects.

While deficits seen in quadriplegic and paraplegic individuals clearly include impaired motor control of the limbs, autonomic nervous system function is severely impaired, as well.  Clinical and experimental reports indicate that high thoracic or cervical spinal trauma often leads to pathologically depressed gastrointestinal (GI) transit accompanied by bacterial translocation. It is estimated that 10% of all mortalities in the SCI population are attributed to GI dysfunction. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X), is the source of parasympathetic control to the stomach  The sensory limb (afferent vagus) of gastric reflexes is via bipolar neurons in the nodose ganglia which extend from the stomach to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS).  This sensory signal is then integrated within the NTS second order neurons. The motor limb (efferent vagus) begins with neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) in the caudal brainstem (medulla) which synapse onto enteric neurons within the stomach to elicit gastric contraction or relaxation, thus completing the vago-vagal circuit.  While the vagus nerve remains anatomically intact following a SCI, derangements in GI function suggest that the vago-vagal signaling is disrupted.  The pathophysiology of post-SCI gastric dysmotility remains to be fully understood, however, previous data have suggested that diminished vagal signaling within the afferent limb of the gastric vagal reflex may play a significant role in the observed pathophysiological changes.  \n\nUsing an acute rat model of T3-SCI combined with molecular in vivo and pharmacological approaches this research tested the hypothesis that following spinal cord injury, gastric inflammation initiates gastric dysmotility through increased expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 receptor (TRPV1).  \n\nUsing a strain gage transducer, of our own construction, the first experiments assessed the anatomical, neurophysiological, and functional integrity of gastric-projecting DMV neurons (efferents) in T3-SCI rats. Immunohistochemical, whole cell in vitro recordings, and in vivo functional assessment of gastric efferent integrity in both control and T3-SCI rats revealed no significant differences between groups. These data suggest that the acute, 3-days to 1-week post-SCI, dysfunction of vagally-mediated gastric reflexes do not include derangements in the efferent DMV motoneurons. This observation extends our previous conclusions that dysfunction of gastric vago-vagal reflexes following T3-SCI may be due, in part, to compromised vagal sensory input affecting the gain of vagally-mediated reflexes.\n\nThe next experiments were designed to identify a possible mechanism for the initiation of vagal afferent dysfunction. High-thoracic or cervical SCI produces marked deficits in sympathetically-mediated vascular control leading to chronic hypotension. The systemic pooling of blood may limit blood flow through the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) perfusing a majority of the GI tract.  Vascular hypotension can result in visceral hypoperfusion, leading to ischemia, the initiation of an inflammatory cascade, and end-organ dysfunction. Following T3-SCI, rats displayed significantly reduced SMA blood flow under all experimental conditions. The postprandial elevation of SMA blood flow following duodenal infusion was delayed or diminished after injury. These data suggest that arterial hypotension diminishes mesenteric blood flow and that the resulting GI ischemia may be an underlying pathology leading to gastric dysfunction seen following SCI. Subsequent experiments employed molecular techniques to test the hypothesis that T3-SCI triggers GI inflammation. As a basis for comparison, we further analyzed the expression of inflammatory markers following mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion injury in age-matched animals. \n\nThe final series of experiments tested the hypothesis that the reduction in gastric blood flow and increase in gastric inflammation lead to an up-regulation in TRPV1 expression within vagal afferent neurons. Quantitative assessment of CCK, CCK-1r and TRPV1 expression by qRT-PCR revealed significant elevation of TRPV1 and CCK-1r within the nodose ganglion after acute T3-SCI. In conclusion, these data suggest that derangements in gastric reflex function are related to dysfunction of vagal afferent signaling. Targeted reduction of inflammatory mechanisms which occur post-injury may offer therapeutic strategies to reduce such alterations, thereby improving the short- and long-term GI function of individuals with SCI. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10456], "author_name_tesi": "Besecker, Emily Mae", "last_name_ssi": "Besecker", "middle_name_ssi": "Mae", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gregory Michael Holmes", "Kirsteen Nairn Browning", "Charles H Lang", "Ann Ouyang", "Patricia Mclaughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gregory Michael Holmes, Dissertation Advisor", "Kirsteen Nairn Browning, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Ann Ouyang, Committee Member", "Patricia Mclaughlin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spinal cord injury", "Vago-vagal reflex", "Gastrointestinal", "Inflammation", "TRPV1"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Mental Health Disparities among Women in Midlife:  A Longitudinal Study of Depressive Symptoms, Status, and Disease in the United States\n\n\n", "id": "8868", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3741", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The literature on the effects of depressive symptoms on women\u2019s lives is quite extensive.

As a result of this supposed allegiance, Botticelli produced several paintings which contain iconography derived from the sermons of Savonarola. In this thesis, I seek to overthrow this classic paradigm of Botticelli as a follower of the friar. Though many of the Botticelli\u2019s later paintings contain Savonarolan iconography, they are not a direct indicator that he himself was a follower of friar. Instead, I present Botticelli as both an economically savvy and adaptable artist who produced artwork containing a variety of themes at the request of a multitude of patrons. This group of patrons consisted of both Savonarolan followers who requested artwork of Savonarolan themes and those who were either ambivalent to the friar or against his movement completely. Therefore, regardless of his personal feelings, it seems that Botticelli was willing to access a new Florentine demographic willing to commission artwork\u2014the followers of Savonarola. I first analyze Botticelli\u2019s interaction with his patrons in order to discuss their role in the decision of the iconography of the paintings they commissioned. I also discuss modes of artistic production such as the use of pigments, gold leaf, and the influence of Roman relief sculpture. In this, I illustrate that, rather than experiencing an artistic and intellectual decline as a result of a conservative religious movement, Botticelli continued to actively display artistic agency in the art production at the end of his life, the same as he had in Florence before Savonarola.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8311], "author_name_tesi": "Betz, Timothy A", "last_name_ssi": "Betz", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian A Curran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian A Curran, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sandro Botticelli", "Savonarola", "Business of Art", "Patronage", "Gold Leaf"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Life Cycle of Voluntary Associations in the United States, 1972-2001", "id": "12104", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5922", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Groups are one of the primary means for the public to engage government and one of the most important. Elections may be the most studied means of representation in democratic systems, but groups are able to provide more information concerning public preferences in a form that is also accessible to government. After all, government is faced with a state of information abundance and groups help filter that information. It is little wonder then that so much literature focuses on group influence. \n\nHowever, the literature on groups misses a crucial element of group influence the context that it occurs in. Group populations can take many different types of actions in order to influence government, but how those actions are perceived and received by government depends on the traits of group populations. The age of the group system, its size and how entrenched groups are with government have unique effects on group representation. For example, issues with a large population of groups experience more competition between interests, but also generally have a larger audience in government given the ties between groups and policy-making. Smaller group communities may be less competitive, but small communities also have fewer opportunities for representation. The traits of groups affect how they interact with government, but the traits of group populations are severely understudied in political science. Specifically research aimed at explaining group population traits are too few. Furthermore, due to data limitations the generalizability and even the importance of this work have been called into question.  \n\nThis dissertation focuses on those questions. Namely what affects the traits of group populations and more specifically how the political environment affects group traits? This is accomplished by using new data on national level voluntary associations in the United States from 1972-2001 from the Encyclopedia of Associations Project. This work compliments the existing literature on group traits by making it more generalizable and further ads to it with insights from several other group literatures. The most significant of these additions is a greater focus on ecological processes namely the interdependence of group traits and the persistent nature of these traits driven by the behavior of entrepreneurs. While previous work on interest group ecology has gone a long way in the study of this important question data limitations have prevented the findings of this work to be as comprehensive as possible. \n\nThe results of the various statistical analyses contained in this dissertation suggest that group population traits follow ecological processes with highly persistent tendencies and high levels of interdependence amongst traits. This dissertation also finds that individual group characteristics partially those associated with an ability to influence government positively affect survival and are related to increased group formations and decreased failures. Finally, the analyses suggest that many of the traits of group populations are dependent on the political environment, but that the environment filters through the group system through different traits. In other words, some environmental factors affect group formation, while others affect group failure. \n\nThese findings suggest several things concerning groups and group representation. In particular they demonstrate that maintenance of the status quo and a bias towards higher resource interests that are engaged with government start with group population traits themselves. In total this dissertation offers a broad range of findings concerning the context of group representation and suggests that further work is necessary to do the discipline\u2019s continued interest in group influence justice in the future.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5916], "author_name_tesi": "Bevan, Shaun ", "last_name_ssi": "Bevan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shaun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Lowery", "David Lowery", "Frank Baumgartner", "Suzanna Linn", "Christopher Jon Zorn", "John David Mccarthy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Lowery, Dissertation Advisor", "David Lowery, Committee Chair", "Frank Baumgartner, Committee Member", "Suzanna Linn, Committee Member", "Christopher Jon Zorn, Committee Member", "John David Mccarthy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Interest Groups", "Representation", "Organizational Ecology", "Time Series", "Associations"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Differential Magnetic Catch and Release: Separation, Purification, and Characterization of Magnetic Nanoparticles and Particles Assemblies", "id": "14627", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7138", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Magnetic nanoparticles uniquely combine superparamagnetic behavior with dimensions that are smaller than or the same size as molecular analytes. The integration of magnetic nanoparticles with analytical methods has opened new avenues for sensing, purification, and quantitative analysis. Applied magnetic fields can be used to control the motion and properties of magnetic nanoparticles; in analytical chemistry, use of magnetic fields provides methods for manipulating and analyzing species at the molecular level. The ability to use applied magnetic fields to control the motion and properties of magnetic nanoparticles is a tool for manipulating and analyzing species at the molecular level, and has led to applications including analyte handing, chemical sensors, and imaging techniques.  This is clearly an area where significant growth and impact in separation science and analysis is expected in the future. In Chapter 1, we describe applications of magnetic nanoparticles to analyte handling, chemical sensors, and imaging techniques.\nChapter 2 reports the purification and separation of magnetic nanoparticle mixtures using the technique developed in our lab called differential magnetic catch and release (DMCR). This method applies a variable magnetic flux orthogonal to the flow direction in an open tubular capillary to trap and controllably release magnetic nanoparticles. Magnetic moments of 8, 12, and 17 nm diameter CoFe\u00ac2\u00acO\u00ac4 nanoparticles are calculated using the applied magnetic flux density and experimentally determined force required to trap 50% of the particle sample.  Balancing the relative strengths of the drag and magnetic forces enable separation and purification of magnetic CoFe2O4 nanoparticle samples with < 20 nm diameters. Samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy to determine the average size and size dispersity of the sample population. DMCR is further demonstrated to be useful for separation of a magnetic nanoparticle mixture, resulting in samples with narrowed size distributions.\nDifferential magnetic catch and release has been used as a method for the purification and separation of magnetic nanoparticles. In Chapter 3 the separation metrics are reported. DMCR separates nanoparticles in the mobile phase by magnetic trapping of magnetic nanoparticles against the wall of an open tubular capillary wrapped between two narrowly spaced electromagnetic poles. Using Au and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles as model systems, the loading capacity of the 250 \uf06dm diameter capillary is determined to be ~130 \uf06dg, and is scalable to higher quantities with larger bore capillary. Peak resolution in DMCR is externally controlled by selection of the release time (Rt) at which the magnetic flux density is removed, however longer capture times are shown to reduce the capture yield.  In addition, the magnetic nanoparticle capture yields are observed to depend on the nanoparticle diameter, mobile phase viscosity and velocity, and applied magnetic flux. Using these optimized parameters, three samples of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles whose diameters are different by less than 10 nm are separated with excellent resolution and capture yield, demonstrating the capability of DMCR for separation and purification of magnetic nanoparticles. \nIndividual hybrid nanocrystals possess multiple structural units with solid state interfaces, giving them a wide range of possible applications. Synthesis of truly monodisperse nanoparticles and hybrid nanocrystals is a formidable task, which has led us to apply our analytical technique, differential magnetic catch and release, to separate and purify magnetic nanoparticles. Using an open tubular capillary column and electromagnet, DMCR separates magnetic nanoparticles based on a balance of their magnetic moment and hydrodynamic size. Chapter 4 focuses on the purification of real world samples of hybrid nanocrystals including Au-Fe3O4 heterostructures and FePt-Fe3O4 dimers. Samples are characterized with transmission electron microscopy, UV-Vis, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction, electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. After DMCR purification, the hybrid nanocrystals have distinct properties, suggesting that purification is vital for the proper characterization and utilization of these in new applications. As magnetic nanostructures become more complex, development of new separation/purification tools in parallel with optimizing hybrid nanocrystal syntheses is paramount for nanostructure construction and use.\nProbing the kinetics of nanoparticle nucleation, crystallization, and oxidation has historically been difficult to achieve. In Chapter 5 preliminary results using DMCR to monitor chemical reactions involving nanoparticles are discussed. Many characteristics of nanoparticles affect their magnetic properties, i.e. size, composition, crystallinity, phase purity etc. DMCR thus provides a method to assess these characteristics during a chemical reaction, and plot the kinetics of these transitions. Insights into nanoscale reaction kinetics will allow mechanistic insights for designing high quality nanocrystal syntheses that produce well defined pure products and hybrid materials. As a proof of concept, the crystallization of Fe3O4 is tracked using X-Ray diffraction analysis while the nanoparticle morphology is examined using transmission electron microscopy. In conjunction with these well-established techniques, DMCR is used to quantitatively assess the crystallization by magnetically tracking the magnetic properties as the reactions progresses, as well as imparting mechanistic insight into their architectural transformations.\nChapter 6 presents unpublished data regarding using magnetic nanoparticles for magnetically manipulated/magnetic bursting of microcapsules, magnetic manipulation through microfluidic channels, non-spherical synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles, and DMCR of hollow Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Also discussed are ideas for the future improvement of DMCR to address a more inclusive size regime and composition of magnetic nanoparticles.

The first study employed focus group methods to assess the perceived challenges to diabetes self-management in older adults living with multiple concurrent chronic conditions. The most common challenges to clinical management included Healthcare, Medical costs and insurance, and Conflicting treatment regimens. Complications, Physical disability and limitations, Acute illness, and Stress were the most frequently cited challenges to active self-management. The second study employed focus group methods and Q-sorting techniques to define, identify, and rank the values and preferences older adults express for their diabetes care. Findings revealed that older adults expressed Individual and Shared values for care in addition to diverse Treatment, Interpersonal and Practice preferences for care. In sum, contemporary issues, such as clinical heterogeneity and diverse values and preferences, challenge the health community to provide comprehensive care to older adults living with diabetes. The findings of this research support the need to assess the impact of comorbidity in diabetes self-management and understand the diverse values and preferences older adults express in their diabetes care.

The decades following the New Negro Movement marked a new era for the art education of African-American students when renowned African-American artists began to prepare future generations of artists and art educators. Douglas and Woodruff spent their tenures teaching the visual arts at historically Black universities in Nashville, Tennessee, and Atlanta, Georgia, respectively. They both had a profound influence on this new era of art education, in which they were situated in a Black experience in the segregated United States. I specifically explore to what extent and for what goals racial consciousness and Black content were a part of the instruction, artwork, and lives of Douglas and Woodruff.\nThe majority of the data examined for this study was discovered in special collections in the archives of the libraries at Fisk and Atlanta Universities. Artist statements, letters, curricular materials, class and lectures notes, exams, interviews, artwork, and testimony of their former students were all closely examined to understand the political, cultural, aesthetic, and pedagogical influence of these two teaching artists. The data convincingly conveys that Douglas and Woodruff were influential figures outside of the classroom.  My findings indicate that various political factors and the limitations of classroom instruction within these institutions did not allow Douglas and Woodruff to teach content which affirmed the historical and cultural significance of African-Americans in the United States, but their lives and artwork served as pedagogy which instilled racial pride, tenacity, and perseverance that was absent in the curriculum.\nI conclude the study with my speculation, as an art educator at a historically Black university, on the relevance of Douglas\u2019s and Woodruff\u2019s methods of educating African-American art students in the 1930s and 1940s to current students. Understanding how these two art educators effectively used their pedagogical, creative, and professional influence to earn the support of the Black community while navigating a White-male dominated field is critical to empowering and educating today\u2019s Black youth. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5797], "author_name_tesi": "Bey, Sharif ", "last_name_ssi": "Bey", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sharif", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Treat Keifer Boyd", "Brent Guy Wilson", "James B Stewart", "Charles Richard Garoian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Treat Keifer Boyd, Committee Chair", "Brent Guy Wilson, Committee Member", "James B Stewart, Committee Member", "Charles Richard Garoian, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Black Art Pedagogy", "History of African-American Art Education", "Aaron Douglas", "Expanded Pedagogy", "Teaching Black Art", "Hale Woodruff"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "INSIGHTS INTO THE DYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF THE BETARETROVIRAL GAG POLYPROTEIN", "id": "11695", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "346", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is an oncogenic retrovirus that causes mammary carcinoma in infected mice.  Unlike most retroviruses that assemble virus particles concurrent with budding at the plasma membrane, MMTV and other betaretroviruses first form immature capsids in the cell cytoplasm and subsequently target the immature particles to the plasma membrane for budding.  The entire assembly process is driven by the viral structural protein, Gag, which is also responsible for the selective packaging of the viral genomic RNA.  Additionally, MMTV Gag contributes to tumorigenesis in infected mice through an unidentified mechanism.  Though MMTV has served as a classical model system for exploring oncogenes and signaling pathways involved in breast cancer, the molecular mechanisms of assembly for this betaretrovirus remain largely unexplored.  \nRecent evidence from the Parent laboratory and others indicate that the trafficking of the retroviral Gag protein from translation on ribosomes to the plasma membrane for budding is not a direct linear pathway.  Studies using the avian oncoretrovirus, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), have shown that its Gag protein follows a complex pathway whereby targeting and export signals within Gag direct it to transiently traffic through the nucleus.  As a Type C morphogenetic virus, RSV Gag is then targeted to the host membrane for simultaneous capsid assembly and egress.  Despite evidence that Gag proteins of other retroviruses participate in nuclear trafficking, further studies have not determined whether mechanisms similar to RSV Gag nuclear import/export are employed.  The existence of putative nuclear trafficking signals within MMTV Gag, as well as data from a collaborator that suggested MMTV Gag interacts with a cellular ribosomal protein, provided the impetus for me to characterize the MMTV Gag protein.   The research presented in this dissertation focuses on the elucidation of signals within MMTV Gag that mediate the trafficking, localization, and budding of virus particles from infected cells.\nA GFP-tagged Gag system was employed to visualize the localization of Gag proteins in transfected mouse cells.  Under steady state conditions, MMTV Gag exists primarily in the cytoplasm within bright foci with very little detectable Gag in the nucleus.  However, fractionation of transfected cells indicates that a population of Gag is detectable in cell nuclei.  Localization of Gag truncation mutants implies that a nuclear localization signal within the p8 domain of Gag plays a role in nuclear import.  MMTV Gag was found to be insensitive to the drug Leptomycin B, which specifically inhibits nuclear export by interacting with the cellular factor CRM1.  Additionally, data showing no effect of mutation on putative CRM1-export signals in Gag suggest that MMTV Gag nuclear export is mediated by alternative means.  \nFurther lines of evidence suggest that MMTV Gag participates in dynamic trafficking throughout the infected cell.  Interestingly, overexpression of ribosomal protein L9 (RPL9), a host interacting protein of MMTV Gag, results in the relocalization of Gag to the nucleoli where RPL9 accumulates.  Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis and coimmunoprecipitation reveals the direct protein-protein interaction between Gag and RPL9.  The NC domain of Gag contains nucleolar localization signals, though RPL9 appears to mediate the translocation of Gag to the nucleolus through interactions with the CA domain.  With the knowledge that RPL9 serves as a tumor suppressor, it is tempting to speculate that Gag interferes with the activity of RPL9 in the nucleolus, leading to increased carcinogenesis.  Additionally, the aggregation of Gag into cytoplasmic foci under steady-state conditions was shown to colocalize with protein components of cellular P-bodies and stress granules, repositories of ribonucleoprotein complexes.  Collectively, these data reveal two novel steps in the MMTV Gag assembly process involving the cell nucleus and cytoplasmic RNA granules which may serve as assembly nucleation sites.  \nWith the established dogma that retroviral Gag proteins are sufficient for the production and release of virus-like particles (VLP), it was surprising that MMTV Gag-GFP expression did not lead to the production of VLPs.  Further evaluation of the components required for Gag budding reveal that the Env protein, which aids the assembly of other intracellular-capsid-forming retroviruses, does not rescue VLP formation.  Although studies have indicated that RNA transport elements within the viral RNA direct the proper assembly and budding of retroviral Gag proteins, the addition of various RNA transport signals to MMTV Gag expression vectors did not rescue Gag particle production.  Thus the minimal components needed for Gag budding remain unknown, and efforts aimed to elucidate this information are ongoing.  \nThe observations described within this dissertation are the first to examine the localization of MMTV Gag in cells and show that MMTV Gag is insufficient to form detectable capsids in cell media.  The collective data of this thesis confirms the uniqueness of MMTV in comparison to other retroviruses and supports the need to continue efforts in characterization and understanding of MMTV viral assembly.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [340], "author_name_tesi": "Beyer, Andrea Rae", "last_name_ssi": "Beyer", "middle_name_ssi": "Rae", "first_name_ssi": "Andrea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leslie Joan Parent", "Leslie Joan Parent", "John Warren Wills", "Richard James Courtney", "Sarah Bronson", "Neil David Christensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leslie Joan Parent, Dissertation Advisor", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Chair", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member", "Richard James Courtney, Committee Member", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mouse mammary tumor virus", "ribosomal protein L9", "Gag protein", "retrovirus assembly", "cellular trafficking"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A Machine Learning Approach to Automatically Capture Designers\u2019 Affective States during Prototyping Activities", "id": "z316q156s", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12948", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Prototyping helps design teams explore multiple approaches and ideas, hereby reducing risk and ensuring that all the design requirements are met. The iterative prototyping process can be time-consuming as well as physically and mentally demanding. It has been shown that positive affective states such as happiness, excitement or interest influence productivity. Most studies show a positive relationship between a designer\u2019s engagement or \u201cinterest\u201d and productivity during the prototyping process. Interest in a particular prototyping task can sometimes be the deciding factor in the success of the final product. In order to increase growth and sustainability of design teams by promoting productivity, it is important to measure affective states such as interest of designers. Though interest during the prototyping process is important, the use of power- operated machines and other such equipment require designers to be comfortable with using this kind of equipment. Comfort and interest can be measured in various ways such as filling out surveys or questionnaires at the end of a particular task. However, these methods are disadvantageous as they do not provide real-time feedback and have cost as well as scalability concerns. Addressing these issues, semi-automated/automated technologies have been developed to capture designers\u2019 internal representations using text, speech or body language. However, analyzing designers\u2019 internal representations using these modalities may be impractical due to interference with the task at hand. To mitigate this challenge, this thesis proposes a machine learning approach to model designers\u2019 affective states such as interest and comfort by capturing their facial expressions. Automatic prediction of these affective states will provide real-time feedback and thus help in building intelligent systems which have the potential to improve efficiency and productivity during the prototyping process. Moreover, they will be extremely useful in the preparation of workforce training protocols used to train the new engineering design workforce. A machine learning approach is proposed to detect these affective states using trained Support Vector Machines (SVMs). An SVM classification model is used to predict interest and the accuracy is found to be 72%. An SVM regression model is used to predict comfort and it yielded an R^2 value of 0.68. The two case studies illustrate that the prediction of affective states such as interest and comfort is possible with a reasonably good accuracy. This thesis has the potential to transform the manner in which design teams utilize engineering equipment, towards more efficient concept generation and prototype creation processes.

This thesis looks different aspects of the phenomenon of informational cascades that results due to this social learning. The first essay theoretically analyzes the herd behavior in the presence of payoff externalities. The second essay looks at the optimal product launch and pricing strategy of the monopolist when its consumers learn by observing the unknown quality of the product. The last essay is an empirical investigation of herd behavior among financial forecasters.\n\n\nChapter 1. Waterfall versus Sprinkler Product Launch Strategy: Influencing the Herd\n\nA monopolist must decide the sequence in which a product of unknown quality should be launched across many regions and how it should be priced. The sequencing is important because consumers in regions with later launches can observe the prices and sales in earlier launches. In our model a high price is informative for later consumers as it is an indication that the product is likely to be of high quality. We show that on an average prices decrease over time. Despite the fact that prices decline over time, the profits (per market) actually rise over time. Finally, we identify circumstances in which sequential and simultaneous launches are optimal. We analyze the case where consumers can choose when to consume the product. We find that prices no longer on an average decrease over time. Compared to the case of non strategic consumer case, the monopolist launched the product sequentially for a smaller range of beliefs.\n\nChapter 2. Endogenous Timing, Payoff Externalities and Informational Cascades\n\nPrevious literature on herd behavior has either looked at models with endogenous timing or payoff externalities but not both. I analyze a more general problem where both issues are analyzed together. To begin with, we theoretically analyze the existence of herd behavior and timing of actions of agents when both informational and payoff externalities are present. In an empirical investigation, we estimate the nature of payoff externalities in the remuneration of financial analysts using I/B/E/S data set.\n\nWe find that under negative payoff externalities, a herd does not arise and all agents take an action together without any delay. This leads to truthful revelation of all private information. On the other hand, an incentive structure with positive externalities gives rise to a herd led by the most precise agent with a delay in the disclosure of information. From the perspective of firms or investors looking for financial advice, using negative payoff externalities, such as relative performance evaluation, is the most efficient form of incentive structure. Such a structure not only ensures an un-mimicked financial advice but also leads to information disclosure without any delay.\n\nChapter 3. Do Forecasters Herd? Social Learning Among Rational Analysts\n\nThis paper empirically analyzes two key issues related to herd behavior among financial forecasters.\n\nFirst, we examine if rational analysts learn from each other and hence form an informational cascade. We conduct two tests- a nonparametric and a parametric structural test to infer if analysts learn from the forecasts of previous analysts. We conclude that forecasters do learn from their predecessors when making a prediction. It is also found that most forecasters believe that the predictions of their immediate predecessors contains all information available so far.\n\nNext, we test for the nature of payoff externalities in the remuneration system of these forecasters listed with I/B/E/S. We find that the underlying payoff externalities are negative i.e. the benefit from making dissimilar forecasts is higher than that from making similar ones.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4369], "author_name_tesi": "Bhalla, Manaswini ", "last_name_ssi": "Bhalla", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Manaswini", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Z Wang", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Vijay Krishna", "Edward James Green", "Susan Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Z Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Member", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "Susan Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Informational Cascades", "Social Learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION EVALUATION OF A PHOTOVOLTAIC DC LED LIGHTING SYSTEM \n\n", "id": "8655", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3260", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The market demand for commercialization of Photovoltaic (PV) systems depends a lot on the reliability, efficiency and performance of various components within the system.

A large body of empirical work has tested the effectiveness of quality \u201creport cards\u201d, focusing heavily on outcomes related to consumer choice (e.g., choice of physicians or hospitals) or on changes in market shares of providers after publication. Despite recognition of the importance of dissemination of report cards to consumers, none of the existing studies attempt to capture the proactive dissemination strategies used by publishing sources or model how media coverage of issues related to provider quality and comparative performance impacts consumer awareness or use of report cards. In this study, we develop a framework that conceptualizes the trajectory by which public reports \u201creach\u201d consumers to affect their attitudes towards comparative quality information (CQI), and their \u201cshopping\u201d behaviors for high quality providers.

The first is to examine the effects of household demographic, socioeconomic and neighborhood characteristics on the use of modern bio-chemical (chemical fertilizers and pesticides) and mechanical (tractors, pumpsets, and farm implements) inputs in agriculture. Despite the efforts by the government, the use of inputs in agriculture is very low. Studies suggest that no or low use of modern inputs is one of the major reasons for low and stagnant agricultural productivity in the country. This thesis seeks to provide new knowledge about the possible reasons behind the limited use of inputs in Nepalese agriculture. The second objective is to explore a recent phenomenon in Nepal, namely, the rapid change of occupation by farm households toward non-farm activities, in other words, exit from farming. I explore possible routes out of farming using household demographic, socioeconomic and neighborhood contextual characteristics as determinants of farm exit. No other study has examined these issues in Nepal. \nTo achieve these objectives, I analyze household- and neighborhood-level data collected from farm households in the western Chitwan Valley of Nepal. The evidence shows that presence of working-age family members is one of the important determinants limiting adoption of labor-saving technologies in farming. Moreover, although presence of both working-age men and women family members matter, the presence of women is more important than men in technology adoption decisions. Socioeconomic characteristics such as land ownership, education, exposure to communication media, and ethnicity also were important in the adoption of these technologies. Further, the availability of services such as banks, cooperatives, and bus service in the community were not associated with the adoption of modern inputs. The findings question the relevance of the government\u2019s policy to increase adequate and timely distribution of modern inputs, at least in this setting of Chitwan Valley. \n\tOn occupational transition, the findings revealed that the availability of working-age individuals in a household particularly children, the access to cultivated land, and the keeping of livestock hindered farm exit decisions. The access to community services, the effect of which was mediated by the proportion of non-farm households in the community, was found to be an important route out of farming, perhaps suggesting that greater off-farm employment opportunities were influential in households\u2019 decisions to leave farming. \n\tIn conclusion, this study provides evidence that in addition to other socioeconomic and neighborhood characteristics, the presence of family labor is one of the obstacles to adoption of modern inputs. This could be an important explanation for the no or low use of modern inputs, and subsequently, the persistently low and stagnant productivity of Nepalese agriculture. This study also suggests that the development of community services particularly suitable for small holder farmers with no livestock may facilitate farm exit, which could relieve population pressure in agriculture. Since the primary focus of the Nepalese government is to increase food production per unit of land and to divert the farm population toward off-farm sectors, the policy implications and suggested avenues for further research stemming from this research are especially salient.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4833], "author_name_tesi": "Bhandari, Prem Bahadur", "last_name_ssi": "Bhandari", "middle_name_ssi": "Bahadur", "first_name_ssi": "Prem", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leif Jensen", "C Shannon Stokes", "Diane K Mc Laughlin", "Stephen Matthews", "Richard C Stedman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leif Jensen, Committee Chair", "C Shannon Stokes, Committee Chair", "Diane K Mc Laughlin, Committee Member", "Stephen Matthews, Committee Member", "Richard C Stedman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Technology use", "agriculture", "occupational mobility (farm exit)", "demographic", "socioeconomic", "Nepal"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "TOWARDS A FRAMEWORK FOR AUTOMATED EVALUATION OF\nCOMPLEX PROBLEM SOLVING ENVIRONMENTS\n", "id": "8528", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1514", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of Interactive simulation models has gained increasing popularity over\nthe last decade towards human training and evaluation. These simulations provide a\nunique opportunity to study complex problem solving behavior in real life tasks, which\notherwise are difficult to recreate in a laboratory. While the complexity of the tasks\nprovide a rich assortment of problems to study human performance in a wide variety of\ncomplex settings, the increasing complexity and cost involved in user experimentation,\noften with human experts, adds considerable time and cost to the experiments.\nThere is, thus, enormous implication from the possibilities of representing\nautomatic decision making behavior in complex simulation models by synthesizing\nknowledge of decision processes, limitations and capabilities of human participants early\non in the design process. By introducing automatic decision making, the total available\nsimulation experiment time and resources may then be used more efficiently to expand\nsimulation experiment scope, explore new alternatives, or perform added simulation\nsensitivity and validation activities. Therefore, techniques to generate automatic decision\napproximating expert decision-making behavior are of interest, both as an automatic\ndecision making component in simulation model experiments and as a tool to assess\ndecision making level of performance.\nThe main objective in this research is to explore automation techniques to conduct\neffort-accuracy analysis of human strategies in complex simulation models. Of particularinterest and major challenge is the conceptualization and representation of behavior so\nthat relationships between wide ranging human strategies and their differential\nperformance can be assessed and explained in a quantitative manner. To address this\nrepresentational issue, this study assumes a theoretical framework of human information\nprocessing that accounts for the multiple activities of effort-accuracy trade-off. By\napproximating strategies over attribute processing and plan processing, an argument is\nmade that a holistic representation, better suited for predicting effort-accuracy\nrelationships of broad range of information processing strategies can be achieved.\nUsing this representation, this study models a human-machine task environment\nusing a Constraint Satisfaction Framework. Behavior, in this framework, is generated\nusing a search mechanism that takes into account, both the cost and accuracy of\nprocessing. Because of this quantitative representation, strategies are represented as\nconstraints into the model that controls the search through an underlying network of\ntasks. We demonstrate this framework in the analysis of strategies in a path-planning task\nin an existing simulation of a Command-and-Control domain. The proposed constraintbased\nframework provides a useful tool to conduct such analysis because this framework\nalso allows a number of other environment variables of interest to be presented as\nconstraints in an additive and independent manner. Due to this, the differential\nperformance of information processing strategies under varying conditions can be\npredicted, thus providing an estimate of the kind of adaptive behavior that may be\nexpected from an expert human in complex problem solving tasks.\nLastly, the utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated using an empirical\nstudy with 24 human participants. The study benchmarks the correspondence between model outcomes with observed human outcomes in the path-planning task. Specifically,\nthe study examines the impact of human\u2019s observed process parameters on the expert\nmodel, and compares differences between the expert and the human performance over\ncategories of data. The results, while showing high correlation between model and human\ndata, also suggested deviations in performance. Data analysis suggested that performance\ndeviations between model and human data correlated with search space. Subsequent\nanalysis indicated that this difference in performance appeared because human\nparticipants were seen as employing simplification procedures during their interaction\nwith the task as opposed to the \u201cideal\u201d procedures used by the model. In sum, while the\napproach presented here showed promise towards the representation and analysis of\nhuman information processing, it also draws attention to the challenges and the\nconsiderations that must be given in future research involving human strategies. In\nclosing, this research extends existing literature in studying human adaptive strategies\nbeyond simple choice tasks and provides a foundation for future studies involving\ncomplex problem solving.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1499], "author_name_tesi": "Bhandarkar, Damodar ", "last_name_ssi": "Bhandarkar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Damodar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ling Rothrock", "Soundar T Kumara", "Richard Donovan Koubek", "Frank Edward Ritter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ling Rothrock, Committee Chair", "Soundar T Kumara, Committee Member", "Richard Donovan Koubek, Committee Member", "Frank Edward Ritter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["simulation.", "human computer interaction", "human factors"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "WORK PARTICIPATION, MOTIVATION, AND BENEFIT RECEIPT FROM OFF-FARM WORK ON U.S. FARMS: A HOUSEHOLD BARGAINING APPROACH\n\n", "id": "7555", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3885", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this study was to further understanding of farm household behaviors and adjustment as a unit (joint decision-making), and at the individual level relative to participation in off-farm work. The study contributes to the literature by extending earlier empirical research on off-farm participation decisions of the farm woman and her spouse/partner using a static Nash Bargaining Model with agricultural production in the household to analyze the labor allocation decisions of individuals in a farm household. Participation in off-farm work was found to be increasing with age, more education, presence of older children, high debt-asset ratio, and commuting zone population growth rate, and decreasing with presence of young children, commuting zone unemployment rate and amount of land owned. \n\nVery few studies have tried to explore factors affecting work motivations and specifically analyzing the impacts of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in combination with individual characteristics, family characteristics, farm-related factors, financial characteristics, and local labor market characteristics on labor market participation, and none in the context of farm populations working off-farm. Ordered probit models incorporating a correction for sample selectivity are estimated for specific work motivations (wanted the money for family household expenses; supporting farm expenses; wanted  benefit; wanted to develop or use job skills; wanted to get out of the house, see people; wanted to have own source of income). In addition, the six specific work motivations are divided into intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to study the impacts of motivations on work outcomes by estimating multinomial logit models of alternative participation-motivation choices: no work, work with extrinsic motivation and work with intrinsic motivation. Results for the ordered probit models indicate that motivation to support farm expenses is important among women aged in their thirties or forties, but changes to meeting or seeing other people in the early fifties and sixties. Higher education supports the motivation of maintaining skills rather than working to get out of the house and see other people. Farm women are less likely to be motivated to work off-farm to support farm expenses when children are less than 6 years of age or when they are between the ages of 6 to 11, inclusive. However, they are motivated to work off-farm for meeting or seeing people when children are between the ages of 6 to 11 inclusive. Results for the multinomial logit indicate that individual characteristics inluding different categories of age and education are important for farm women working for intrinsic or extrinsic motivation; however, work with extrinsic motivation (work for external rewards) is more likely at higher levels of educational attainment. With regards to presence of children in different age groups, results indicate that farm women are less likely to work off-farm with intrinsic or extrinsic motivations, and more likely to stay on the farm or at home, when the children are less than six years in age or between ages 6 to 11, inclusive. In terms of local labor market characteristics, a low commuting zone unemployment rate increases the likelihood of working with extrinsic motivation and a large farm reduces the probability of working off-farm for intrinsic reasons.\n\nFinally, the study uses a multinomial logit model to estimate the influence of benefit receipt (health insurance) on labor participation, taking into account the joint decisions of farm women and men. Households with a high degree of educational attainment were found to be working at full-time jobs with health insurance and were adjusting their labor participation decisions especially in case of presence of children according to demands of the situation, making sure that there is health insurance for the family, either through the farm woman\u2019s job or through the spouse\u2019s off-farm job. It was interesting to observe that despite operating large farms, farm women may still work at part-time jobs perhaps for social or professional reasons such as maintaining their skills.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3859], "author_name_tesi": "Bharadwaj, Latika ", "last_name_ssi": "Bharadwaj", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Latika", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Michael Smith", "Cynthia Ann Brewer", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Michael Smith, Committee Member", "Cynthia Ann Brewer, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["health insurance", "motivations", "labor supply"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Medium Resolution Transmission Measurements of CO2 and H2O at High Temperature and a Multiscale Malkmus Model for Treatment of Inhomogeneous Gas Paths\n", "id": "6594", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5917", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-01-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Radiative heat transfer is often the dominant mode of heat transfer in fires \nand in commercial combustion systems.

We developed a descriptive and predictive bionetwork model for phospholipase C-coupled calcium signaling pathways, built with non-kinetic experimental information.

Furthermore, knock-out simulations of the IP3R, TRPC3, and multiple other proteins recapitulate experimentally derived results.   The potential of this approach can be observed by its ability to predict previously undescribed cellular phenotypes. Indeed, our cellular analysis of DANGER1a confirms the counter-intuitive predictions from our Boolean models in two highly relevant cellular models.  Based on these results, we theorize that with sufficient legacy knowledge, Boolean networks provide a robust method for predictive-modeling of any biological system. \n\tA limiting factor to this bionetwork-boolean approach is the lack of information regarding structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics of individual network components. In most cases, this lack of information arises from inability of conventional homology detection programs to measure homology in highly divergent datasets. Further, Inability to resolve deep node relationships is a major factor that stymies evolutionary studies of highly divergent/rapidly evolving protein families. To resolve the shortcomings of conventional homology detection programs, we propose a computational approach towards resolving homology between highly divergent familial proteins using phylogenetic profiles.  Indeed, phylogenetic profiles have been demonstrated as a method for simultaneous measurements of structure, function, and evolution.\n\tHerein, we describe a MSA independent method to infer evolutionary relationships, and use this method to study rapidly evolving (Mab21-containing DANGER superfamily), highly divergent (Retroelements) and convergent (Haloacid Dehalogenase) benchmark superfamilies. We also compare the results obtained from our method (PHYRN) with other MSA dependent methods and show that PHYRN provides better evolutionary history recapitulation, and provides more robust measurements at deep nodes. Further, PHYRN also provides quantitative measures that can aid in identifying outgroups and convergent evolutionary events. Using Retroelements (RT) as a benchmark superfamily, we show that this approach can be scaled up efficiently to study mega-phylogenies with thousands of sequences. Taken together with PHYRN\u2019s adaptability to any protein family, this method can serve as a good tool in resolving ambiguities in evolutionary studies of rapidly evolving/highly divergent protein families.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2107], "author_name_tesi": "Bhardwaj, Gaurav ", "last_name_ssi": "Bhardwaj", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gaurav", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Randen L Patterson", "Randen L Patterson", "John Edward Carlson", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Edward C Holmes", "Damian B Van Rossum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Randen L Patterson, Dissertation Advisor", "Randen L Patterson, Committee Chair", "John Edward Carlson, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Edward C Holmes, Committee Member", "Damian B Van Rossum, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Evolution", "Bionetworks", "calcium signaling", "phylogenetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Using simulation for improving the performance of a manufacturing system through dynamic workforce scheduling", "id": "16315", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7311", "abstract_tesi": "A skilled workforce is one of the expensive resources for organizations and is now extensively worked upon from savings point of view. It poses as a challenge to utilize workforce available in an optimal way. This study aims in evaluating the best scheduling technique for workers in terms of increase in their utilization and overall productivity of system. In other words it proposes a framework which assimilates worker efficiencies, simulation and job shop scheduling technique for dynamic workforce scheduling in a manufacturing environment. Research focuses on evaluating best job-shop scheduling technique along with workforce scheduling. This type of scheduling is extremely useful in a dynamic manufacturing environment where there is lot of complexities involved in terms of resources available. A simulation model is constructed using MATLAB to determine an optimal solution for the problem. Assignment of tasks is based on MWR (Most Work Remaining) rule where tasks with more number of jobs and which consume more time for completion are given priority. Some exceptions were considered while applying this rule. Based on MWR rule two cases were considered for assigning tasks to workers: when most efficient worker is assigned task first and when slowest worker is assigned task first. Second algorithm considers slowest worker as a bottleneck and aims in evaluating efficiency of algorithm when bottleneck activity is given preference. Results obtained show that the overall productivity is a bit more in the former case (when most efficient worker is assigned task first) when compared with latter case (when slowest worker is assigned task first). However worker utilization is more in the latter case. Reason being that slow worker will consume more time in doing same task when compared to other workers for same task. Based on results obtained we can say that depending upon number of units to be produced and worker availability both methods can be employed for improving  performance of the overall manufacturing system. In cases where extra time is required for machine maintenance,   workforce training, quality procedures it is recommended to use the most efficient worker first. This will also provide opportunity to other operators to learn about other tasks and eventually improve their performance. After comparing gantt charts for each week we can say that best algorithm to be used is first one where we assign most efficient worker first.

Multilevel modeling was used to examine the change in parental involvement over time. Results showed that parents reduced their home based and school based involvement across middle and high school; however, they engaged in similar levels of academic socialization over time. African American parents engaged in more home based involvement and academic socialization than European American. Parents from low SES families engaged in more home based involvement and academic socialization and less school based involvement than high SES families. In addition, parents engaged in more home based involvement for boys and more academic socialization for girls. The findings for the association of neighborhood structure and social dynamics with parental involvement were mixed.

This method utilizes proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM) data on blades\u2019 geometries, and sector analyses using ANSYS and solid modeling. First the algorithm to compute reduced-order mass and stiffness matrices from ANSYS sector analyses is provided. It is also shown that the algorithm can be efficiently used to perform Monte Carlo simulations of mistuning patterns arising out of arrangements of a given set of mistuned blades. Numerical examples dealing with variations in natural frequencies and forced responses are presented for different patterns of geometric mistuning. MMDA is then expanded to use 2nd order Taylor series approximations of perturbations in mass and stiffness matrices (&#948;M and &#948;K) instead of exact &#948;M and &#948;K. It is shown that the reduced order model based on 2nd order approximation is accurate enough to provide results comparable to exact MMDA. It is also shown that with the use of Taylor series expansion the calculation of reduced order matrices is just a block assembling exercise which is computationally inexpensive hence this method is ideally suited for Monte Carlo simulations. As a numerical example 1000 mistuning patterns generated by random values of mistuning parameters are analyzed to support the fact that the technique can be efficiently used for Monte Carlo simulations. It is also shown that although a large number of POD features are present in a mistuned bladed disk assembly, only a few are dominant and inclusion of only the dominant POD features in the bases vectors is sufficient to get accurate results. The algorithm for MMDA is then modified to use the mode shapes from cyclic analysis of actual sectors instead of mode shapes from sectors modified along POD features, hence avoiding the step of creating artificial sector geometries perturbed along POD features. The idea is further extended to be applicable in the case of extremely large mistuning where normal POD approach breaks down and it is shown that explicit inclusion of mode shapes from cyclic analysis of blade with extremely large mistuning in the bases rectifies the problem and provides accurate results.\nA reduced order model of a multi-stage rotor in which each stage has a different number of blades is developed. It is shown that a reduced order model can be developed on the basis of tuned modes of certain bladed disks which can be easily obtained via sector analyses. Further, it is shown that reduced order model can also be obtained when blades are geometrically mistuned.  This algorithm is similar to the modified modal domain analysis. The validity of this algorithm is shown for the finite element model of a two-stage bladed rotor. In addition, the statistical distributions of peak maximum amplitudes and natural frequencies of a two-stage rotor are generated via Monte Carlo simulations for different patterns of geometric mistuning. \nThe Taylor series expansions of deviations in mass and stiffness matrices due to geometric mistuning gives a direct approach for generating the reduced order model from the components of POD features of spatial variations in blades\u2019 geometries. Reversing the process, algorithms for mistuning identification based on MMDA are presented to calculate the geometric mistuning parameters. Two types of the algorithm, one based on modal analysis and the other on the forced responses are presented. The validity of the method is then verified through a mistuned academic rotor.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6817], "author_name_tesi": "Bhartiya, Yasharth  ", "last_name_ssi": "Bhartiya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yasharth ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alok Sinha", "Alok Sinha", "Asok Ray", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Suzanne Michelle Shontz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alok Sinha, Dissertation Advisor", "Alok Sinha, Committee Chair", "Asok Ray, Committee Member", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member", "Suzanne Michelle Shontz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mistuning Identification", "Mistuning", "Reduced Order Modelling"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Inference for Complex Computer Models and Large Multivariate Spatial Data with Applications to Climate Science\n\n", "id": "11351", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3418", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Computer model calibration involves combining information from simulations of a complex computer model with observations of the process being simulated by the model. Increasingly, computer model output is in the form of multiple spatial fields, particularly in climate science.

We first describe an inferential approach using Gaussian processes to emulate the computer model, thereby establishing a connection between the calibration parameters and the multiple spatial fields. We carry out statistical inference for the climate parameters using a Bayesian approach, accounting for spatial dependence, model discrepancy and other sources of uncertainty.  We conduct a study of the merits of including a model discrepancy term in the statistical model.  One flexible model we develop allows for non-linear relationships among the spatial fields by modeling the spatial fields using a conditional hierarchical approach.   \nFurther, we develop a new flexible computationally tractable approach for calibration combining three or more multiple spatial fields using a Linear Model of Coregionalization (LMC) allowing for a non-separable covariance, reducing data-specific modeling decisions, and for a more flexible construction of model discrepancy.    \nWe demonstrate an application of our approach to infer vertical diffusivity, a climate parameter that plays a key role in obtaining probabilistic projections of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC).

Radar waveform design has also been proposed for optimal detection and target information extraction. We propose an adaptive multimodal radar sensor that is capable of progressively varying its range resolution depending upon the target scattering features. Low range resolution profiles are formed using a low bandwidth waveform. High range resolution processing is then performed on selected range cells in which targets are declared. Thus the multimodal radar has the ability to provide target indication with a large range extent and can progressively switch to a narrow range extent mode for extracting recognizable target features. It consists of a test-bed that enables the generation of linear frequency modulated waveforms of various bandwidths for achieving the optimum resolution to image the target. This paper discusses the multimodal concept, explaining the advantages of a radar having different fields of view. Simulation results are presented to provide an initial demonstration of the proof-of-concept of multimodal radar. The architecture of the multimodal radar is explained, focusing on the important system parameters. The operation of the radar in staring and scanning mode is described. In staring mode, the radar is stationary and looks at the target scene. In scanning mode, an antenna positioner is used to enable surveillance of a wider field. Detailed experimental results are provided for both of these modes. A theoretical method to optimize the bandwidth used by the radar is also described. These theoretical results are compared with the results obtained in the field. Simulation results are provided which provide an insight into the performance of the radar. Receiver operating characteristic curves for the multimodal radar are presented.\nIn multi-functional radio frequency systems, bandwidth is a very scarce commodity which must be managed with diligence for optimal system performance. The multimodal radar uses variable bandwidth, making it possible to share the remaining bandwidth with some other application. In this work, we explore bandwidth sharing scenarios between radar surveillance, tracking and communications. We divide the surveillance space into sectors and use fuzzy logic to arrive at priorities for each sector. Priority for radar is based on separation between targets, signal to noise ratio, and existence of clutter. Multi-\niv\nobjective optimization is used to arrive at solutions making the best use of available bandwidth between radar and communications. We also consider the problem of scheduling between tracking and surveillance for the multimodal radar. Smart scheduling is employed to make the best use of available radar resources. The algorithms are applied to representative target scenarios for maximizing the track update rate while providing an adequate surveillance rate. Static radar scheduling algorithms are introduced for specific target scenarios. Dynamic radar scheduling is implemented to adapt to the changing target scenarios. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of these algorithms. The targets are tracked using the particle filter.

This is work takes forward the idea of using solid state laser technology for studying the near-surface region of a semiconductor or the interface region of a semiconductor - dielectric interface. The choice of laser (wavelength) is material dependent and the tool, built around a probe station, has the ability to measure pre-patterned small geometry samples. A detailed description of the experimental procedure is provided. The tool has the ability to form reliable ohmic contact with dielectric of thickness less than 50nm without the need for any additional etching steps. The tool is then used to monitor silicon surface change after an HF clean following which it is left to stand in the ambient over time. The results are compared with a surface sensitive contact angle tool. The near-surface PCD (ns-PCD) technique is compared to conventional microwave PCD commonly used to measure bulk lifetime of a semiconductor. The near-surface tool shows a shorter lifetime value for the back surface than the polished front surface of the sample, while microwave PCD gives the same lifetime value for both surfaces. Thus the surface sensitivity of the tool is established. Next thin dielectrics grown on semiconductors are explored using the ns-PCD technique. The time limitation for the diffusion/oxidation furnace to form high quality silicon oxide on silicon is determined to be 8 minutes. This is shown by observing the PCD lifetime that reflects the interface quality of the oxide - silicon. Two different dielectrics in alumina and tantalum oxide are grown on silicon and the PCD plots are compared. The importance of laser choice is demonstrated by taking measurements using 658nm and 980nm lasers. The former shows a more defective interface in the case of tantalum oxide. A different semiconductor material in gallium antimonide is considered in another experiment. One sample is degreased using acetone and IPA clean while the other sample is cleaned using HCl. Alumina is grown on both samples using atomic layer deposition. ns-PCD shows that HCl degrades the surface of GaSb. However forming gas anneal shows an improvement in near surface lifetime implying that HCl clean is needed to remove the uncontrolled GaO and SbO formed under ambient. Lastly it is shown that ns-PCD can be used to explore three dimensional fin structures. An ungated InGaAs quantum well fin structure is grown for this purpose. Nine devices with decreasing fin width are measured using ns-PCD.

However, carbon monoxide (CO), a by-product of both the on-board and off-board hydrocarbon reforming processes, is a poison to fuel cell catalysts.  In addition, the size of either an on-board hydrogen storage system or hydrocarbon reforming system puts severe packaging constraints on vehicle architecture.  This thesis is a comprehensive study of the effects of methanol reformate on the performance of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell.  While investigating the problem of vehicle architecture constraints, it was found that humidification and pressurization of this fuel cell system can be optimized, and thus make room available on-board for either a methanol reforming/CO treatment system or hydrogen storage system.  In addition, it was found that methanol reformate, which contains dilute hydrogen and trace quantities of CO, is extremely detrimental to the performance of a PEM fuel cell.  Furthermore, it was discovered, both experimentally and theoretically, that the transient process of poisoning is not only a function of CO concentration, but is also highly dependent on the level of hydrogen dilution.  After studying the poisoning process, an actual methanol reforming fuel cell system was integrated and tested for overall efficiency.  It was found that anode air injection was capable of greatly reducing the poisoning effect.  This integrated methanol reforming system was compared to a direct methanol fuel cell system at various power levels.  For automotive power applications, cost constraints proved the indirect system superior to the direct methanol system.  However, with a well-to-wheel efficiency of 22%, the indirect methanol system was inferior to direct hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

Bridges, being an important component of the transportation system, are therefore required to be designed such that they can withstand these large impacts and remain functional post-earthquake event. The present study is focused on conducting a parametric study and evaluating the performance of skewed bridges under seismic activities by considering the orthogonal effects in nonlinear time history analysis, wherein, two seismic waves, in the form of time histories, act simultaneously at the structure at right angles to each other. Such a set of waves is known as the orthogonal set of time histories. Any one of the two seismic waves can be assumed to be acting in a principal direction, i.e. along the direction of the ground motion. The other seismic wave, thus, acts in a direction perpendicular to it. Responses of the bridge are obtained in the directions along the length of the bridge (longitudinal) and perpendicular to it (transverse). These responses are statistically independent of each other. \nFor conducting the analysis, Painter Street Overpass located in Rio Dell, CA is modeled as a dual-beam stick bridge using OpenSees.  After validating the analytical model, the bridge is subjected to a suite of orthogonal set of time histories developed for the California region. The angle formed by the seismic wave acting along the principal direction, with the central axis of the bridge, in the longitudinal is called as the angle of incidence. This angle is made to rotate from 00 to 1800 with a step of 150. Skew angle of the bridge is defined as the angle made by the bents or abutments with the axis along the transverse direction of the bridge. The above procedure is repeated for different skew angles of the bridge varying from 00 to 500 with a step of 100. The effect of the variation of these two parameters on the response of the structure is analyzed to determine the critical angle of incidence for a ground motion on the bridge. It is concluded that angle of incidence, by itself cannot determine the critical response of the structure, as critical angle of incidence, which generated the critical response in the structure, varied for different ground motions used for analysis. It is suggested to include a seismic parameter like peak ground acceleration (PGA) to the parametric study, to determine the combination that produces a critical response.\nFragility curves are developed in order to provide insight into the vulnerability of the bridge to different seismic loading conditions. The effect of change in skew angle and angle of incidence is studied on the fragility plots for different damage states of the bridge, as described by HAZUS-MH, thus linking the variation in PGA to the parametric study. It is derived that inclusion of PGA in probabilistic terms results in obtaining a range of critical incident angle and skew angle, for which the critical response can be generated in the structure. A study is conducted, in which variation of the median value of the PGA is observed along with variation in angle of incidence and skew angle of the bridge. It is inferred that the peak response in the structure occurs for incident angles ranging from 300 to 800, and for skew angles of 400 and 500. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6370], "author_name_tesi": "Bhatnagar, Unmukt Rajeev", "last_name_ssi": "Bhatnagar", "middle_name_ssi": "Rajeev", "first_name_ssi": "Unmukt", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Swagata Banerjee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Swagata Banerjee, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Orthogonal effects", "Fragility Curves", "Directionality Effects", "Seismic Analysis", "Skewed Bridge"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "FORMULA 1 RACE CAR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT BY OPTIMIZATION OF THE AERODYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR WINGS", "id": "23699", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9979", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The sport of Formula 1 (F1) has been a proving ground for race fanatics and engineers for more than half a century. With every driver wanting to go faster and beat the previous best time, research and innovation in engineering of the car is really essential. Although higher speeds are the main criterion for determining the Formula 1 car\u2019s aerodynamic setup, post the San Marino Grand Prix of 1994, the engineering research and development has also targeted for driver\u2019s safety. The governing body of Formula 1, i.e. F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) has made significant rule changes since this time, primarily targeting car safety and speed. \n\nAerodynamic performance of a F1 car is currently one of the vital aspects of performance gain, as marginal gains are obtained due to engine and mechanical changes to the car. Thus, it has become the key to success in this sport, resulting in teams spending millions of dollars on research and development in this sector each year. Although F1 car aerodynamics is at a highly advanced stage, there is always potential for further development. With the under-body aerodynamics banned by the FIA, the only significant changes that can be made to improve the aerodynamic performance of the car are by modifying the front and rear wings cross-sections, i.e. airfoils, or by developing new diffuser to modify the air flow underneath the car. Airfoil design is one of the important factors to consider while designing the car. Design of the most optimum airfoils is track-dependent, as each track has different aerodynamic requirements. The development of the F1 car is regulated by the rules sanctioned by the FIA. In recent years, the FIA has reduced the allowable operational hours for development at the wind-tunnel by a F1 team. From the 2015 season onwards, use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software for the development of the F1 car is also being limited. This rule change will result in limited test-runs every season. This study, thus, focuses to provide a preliminary estimate of the most optimum aerodynamic loads acting on the front and rear wings for achieving the best lap times possible around a particular track. This will effectively focus the area of development leading to targeted use of CFD simulations.\n\nTo perform the optimization, a genetic algorithm (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy \u2013 CMA-ES) is used. In order to obtain all the telemetric information, a lap simulation tool called AeroLap is used. For simulation, the Sepang F1 race track, which annually hosts the Malaysian Grand Prix (GP), is selected. This track provides a perfect conundrum of whether to design the car for high downforce or low drag configuration, as it contains fast-turning corners and long straights. The optimization is performed for a given F1 car setup used for the 2010 season, with the aerodynamic loads acting on both the front and rear wings as well as the racing line being optimized. First, an optimum racing line is derived for this particular race track using CMA-ES. It is observed that the lap time is reduced by a margin between 0.542 to 1.699 seconds when compared with the best lap time for the actual race during the 2010 Malaysian GP.  For this racing line, the optimum values of the aerodynamic loads in the form of lift and drag coefficients for the front and rear wings are calculated. The optimum values of lift coefficients for the front and rear wings are calculated as 1.123 and 1.651 respectively. The optimization of drag coefficients for the obtained lift coefficient values led to the conclusion that the best lap times always occurred for the least value of the drag coefficient that had been set as the lower limit for the simulation. As a result, a parametric study is performed by varying the drag and lift coefficients for the front and rear wings. The results are summarized in form of contour plots, displaying the change in lap times with variation in the aerodynamic loads for the front and rear wings. The best lap time for the minimum set of drag coefficients and the optimized lift coefficients is observed to be at least 2.02 seconds better than the lap time performed by an actual F1 car that raced in the 2010 season. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9695], "author_name_tesi": "Bhatnagar, Unmukt Rajeev", "last_name_ssi": "Bhatnagar", "middle_name_ssi": "Rajeev", "first_name_ssi": "Unmukt", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark David Maughmer", "Sven Schmitz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark David Maughmer, Thesis Advisor", "Sven Schmitz, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Formula 1", "Aerodynamics", "Optimization", "Lift Coefficient", "Drag Coefficient", "Lap Simulation", "Genetic Algorithms"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Distributed Hydrologic Modeling System: Framework For Discovery And Management Of Water Resources", "id": "16281", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8169", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research deals with numerical watershed simulation as a basis for management of multi-scale, multi-process environmental systems.

A fundamental understanding of the\ngeospatial and temporal nature of catchment hydrology is important for transport of nutrients and sediments. Numerical watershed models are\nincreasingly being used by scientists for hypothesis testing, designing of observation networks and by agency professionals for watershed\nmanagement and related decision-making. Central to the next generation of models is the incorporation of geospatial properties of the watershed (for e.g. topography, vegetation, soil, geology, regolith, etc.) in addition\nto the national observing system for precipitation, meteorological parameters, streamflow, groundwater, and soil-moisture, etc. Empirical and conceptual models face challenges in applicability at different scales\nand transferability of calibrated parameters due to lack of relation between the model parameters and the geospatial watershed properties.\nMore importantly, such models may not provide sufficient insight regarding the internal hydrologic processes of the catchment. Physics based distributed modeling frameworks that utilize geospatial information hold the potential to improve the performance of the watershed predictions, while providing a more comprehensive tool for assessing impacts, advantages, and disadvantages of management scenarios and decision making.\n\nImplementations of Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) for watersheds of multiple scales in the Chesapeake Bay watershed were studied where new generation of high-resolution accessible national geospatial data serve as a practical basis for numerical watershed simulations.

Turbulent spray flames for two single-component fuels (n-heptane and n-dodecane) are simulated. The modeling framework is a hybrid Lagrangian-particle/Eulerian-mesh probability density function (PDF) method. This framework allows for arbitrarily large chemical mechanisms, and features Lagrangian-based spray breakup and dispersed-phase models, soot models, and an optically thin radiation model. The influence of turbulent fluctuations is explored by comparing results from the PDF method (which explicitly accounts for turbulent fluctuations) with those from a model that neglects the influence of turbulent fluctuations on local mean chemical reaction rates (a well-stirred reactor \u2013 WSR \u2013 model) for the same chemical mechanism. Computed results are compared with experimental measurements that are available through the Engine Combustion Network. Here a 40-species mechanism has been adopted for n-heptane, and a 103-species chemical mechanism for n-dodecane.\n\nOverall, it is found that for conditions that correspond to robust diesel combustion (e.g., high initial temperatures, high initial pressures and/or high oxygen concentrations) the computed liftoff lengths and ignition delays for the WSR and PDF models are close to each other, and both are in good agreement with experiments. For less robust conditions (e.g., low initial temperatures and/or low oxygen concentrations), the computed liftoff lengths and ignition delays from the two models can be significantly different, and the results from the PDF model are generally in better agreement with measurements. The differences between the two models are especially apparent for n-dodecane at low initial temperatures. For n-dodecane at an initial temperature of 800 K, the WSR model fails to ignite, while the PDF model shows a distinct two-stage autoignition process and the computed ignition delay and liftoff length are within 30\\% of the experimental values. For n-dodecane at an initial temperature of 900 K, the WSR model predicts an ignition delay that is three times higher than the measured value, while the PDF model prediction is within 5\\% of the measurement. For both fuels and for all initial conditions, the WSR and PDF models produce significantly different turbulent flame structures, and the differences are greater for lower initial temperatures and/or oxygen concentrations. The WSR model produces a laminar-like flame structure, whereas the PDF model produces a broader turbulent flame brush that is qualitatively more consistent with what is expected for a turbulent flame, and with what is observed in the experiments.\n\nWhile it has been shown in the literature that some global characteristics (e.g., ignition delays and liftoff lengths) of high-pressure turbulent spray flames can be captured using a WSR model and a chemical mechanism that has been tuned for this purpose, the present results suggest that this approach effectively amounts to changing a model for one physical process (chemical rate coefficients) to account for deficiencies in modeling a different physical process (turbulent fluctuations in composition in temperature). It is expected that by properly accounting for turbulent fluctuations, it will be possible to develop a model that can be applied over a broad range of engine-relevant conditions without changing the model coefficients.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8028], "author_name_tesi": "Bhattacharjee, Subhasish ", "last_name_ssi": "Bhattacharjee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Subhasish", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Connell Haworth", "Stephen R Turns", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Connell Haworth, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen R Turns, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Turbulence", "Combustion", "TCI", "WSR", "PDF"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "IMPACT OF RFID ON RETAIL VALUE CHAIN: A MIXED METHOD STUDY\n\n\n", "id": "11345", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4400", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) mandates by large retailers and various government agencies have driven a large number of organizations to roll out the technology. Despite these commitments the business case for RFID is far from reality and is still at its infancy. This dissertation work aims at providing realistic perspective on the potentials of RFID taking business processes and value chain activities into account. The research is applied and interdisciplinary in nature and bases itself on inductive reasoning. The dissertation deals with two broad research questions. The first research question focuses on the impact of RFID on retail value chain. The second research question focuses on the factors that influence RFID adoption decision in retail organizations. To answer the research questions a mixed methodological approach that well caters to the exploratory nature of the work is used. First, formal content analysis methodology is used to analyze both academic and trade articles to come up with key issues and concepts that are developed iteratively. The results from the content analysis along with guiding theories act as the input for the Delphi study which is the second methodology that is used. The results help to develop a conceptual framework of the impact of RFID on retail value chain providing deep insights and enhancing the understanding of potential benefits, RFID applicable business processes and value chain activities, and adoption challenges. These relevant issues are classified across different adoption stages in the framework. Drawing on the extant information systems and organizational innovation literature, this dissertation also investigates the salient drivers of emerging RFID adoption in retail organizations, and develops an RFID adoption decision conceptual framework. According to this framework technological factor relative advantage, environmental factors competitive pressure and catalyst agent, and value chain factor complexity in retail value chain influence RFID adoption decisions in retail.\nThe findings from this research will provide a theoretical platform for future RFID research work as well as aid in drawing meaningful managerial conclusions. It will allow to better understand what RFID can deliver, what deficiencies companies reveal, what business processes can be improved, and where its application in the value chain is sensible and likely to occur. It will also aid in better understanding the RFID adoption decision process particularly for retail. The dissertation concludes by highlighting both theoretical and practical implications and suggesting directions for future research. Four recommendations have been provided to future adopters drawing from the two conceptual frameworks derived in this dissertation. The derived frameworks are envisioned to be further refined and tested for other industries to test for generalizability.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4370], "author_name_tesi": "Bhattacharya, Mithu ", "last_name_ssi": "Bhattacharya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mithu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Tracy Mullen And Dr Lynette Kvasny", "Tracy Mullen", "Lynette Marie Yarger", "Irene Johnston Petrick", "Zhibiao Zhao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Tracy Mullen And Dr Lynette Kvasny, Dissertation Advisor", "Tracy Mullen, Committee Chair", "Lynette Marie Yarger, Committee Chair", "Irene Johnston Petrick, Committee Member", "Zhibiao Zhao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Content analysis", "Adoption", "RFID", "Delphi"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE GLOBAL IMPACT OF TERROR: 9/11 AND MEDIA FRAMING OF THE INDIA-PAKISTAN CONFLICT", "id": "7900", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5774", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The events on 11, September 2001, have cleaved the world into two ideological camps \u2013 a coalition of willing democracies led by the United States versus authoritarian \u2018axis of evil\u2019 regimes, harboring extremist groups. While most countries were pressured to clarify their position in this debate some are re-evaluating global discourses post September 11th, in light of their own struggles against terrorist activity. One such nation is India whose contentious relationship with Pakistan over the state of Jammu and Kashmir, raises concerns about Pakistani sponsored terrorism in this area. The Indian press\u2019 coverage of the September 2001 attacks shows a concerted effort to position India in line with other global democracies on this war against terror, while simultaneously attempting to undermine its neighbor and political rival. \nThe impact of American rhetoric thus extends beyond a divide between democracy and authoritarianism to include the experiences of other countries.

Iron (Fe) complexes with organic matter (OM) represent an important class of structures whose chemistry and reactivity require further understanding under different environmental conditions since Fe speciation and mobility affect the availability, cycling, and transport of metals, OM and nutrients. The objective of this doctoral research was to increase scientific understanding of redox reactions of Fe with OM. Experimental studies were conducted both at molecular and field scales which are documented in the three manuscripts included in this dissertation.\nThe first study determined the oxidation state and coordination environment of Fe in peat soils under varying redox conditions using chemical techniques, spectroscopic analyses and theoretical CTM4XAS multiplet calculations. This is the first time that CTM4XAS has been used to quantify Fe oxidation states along with their coordination environments in complex, heterogeneous soil systems. The results from this investigation provide clear direct and indirect evidence that tetrahedral ferrous (Fe2+) and octahedral ferric (Fe3+) iron species co-exist in peat soils under oxic, suboxic and anoxic redox conditions with varying coordination environments.  Fe showed a higher affinity to bind with heterocyclic N-containing molecules which have an available pair of electrons on their N atoms for donation to the Fe center compared to the more abundant O-containing functional groups. Complexation of Fe with soil organic matter (SOM) was considered to be the most important process in stabilizing the Fe2+ and Fe3+ species. In addition to the Fe-OM complexes, the findings of this chapter also aid in the identification of stable inorganic Fe species present in these peatlands.\nThe second study specifically focused on the electron exchange interactions between the redox active metal (Fe) center and the different functional groups of cysteine (carboxylic, amine and thiol) in laboratory-synthesized Fe(II)-cysteine and Fe(III)-cysteine complexes as a function of time (0 and 12 months). Here, we detailed changes in oxidation states of Fe together with that of the elements in cysteine (C, N, O and S) under controlled conditions in a laboratory setup. The study of the oxidation state of Fe indicates preservation of Fe2+ in Fe(II)-cysteine and initial reduction of Fe3+ in Fe(III)-cysteine systems. Fe2+ in the former underwent oxidation with time whereas Fe3+ in the reduced complex underwent partial oxidation and retained most of its reduction features. The coordination environments and Fe-ligand bond character of Fe(II)- and Fe(III)-cysteine complexes were also altered with time. Besides the \u2013COOH, -NH2 and \u2013SH functional groups, the C-backbone in cysteine also actively participated in the intramolecular electron transfer reactions stabilizing Fe2+ and Fe3+ in these complexes. \nThe third study further explored the binding of Fe with amino acids (cysteine, histidine and arginine) with different reactivity present in their side chains. While \u2013SH was responsible for stabilizing Fe2+ in Fe-cysteine complexes, the N present in the heterocyclic 5-membered imidazole group of histidine and the basic guanidine side chain of arginine stabilized Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the Fe-histidine and Fe-arginine complexes, respectively. Inner-sphere Fe-amino acid complexes were formed but the strength of Fe-O, Fe-N and Fe-S interactions varied greatly, depending on the electron shuttling capability of the donor atom of the ligand as well as that of the redox-active Fe. Fe-C interactions were observed in the second coordination shell of Fe(II)-histidine indicating that the cyclic C-chain in histdine can act as effective electron shuttles. The second coordination shell of Fe(III)-arginine and Fe(III)-histidine exhibited Fe-Fe interactions indicating the formation of stable ferrihydrike-like amorphous phases in these complexes.\nThe research findings presented in this dissertation contribute to our understanding of Fe-OM interactions and to the factors which stabilize the Fe redox species in terrestrial and aquatic systems where such complexes are abundant.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8065], "author_name_tesi": "Bhattacharyya, Amrita ", "last_name_ssi": "Bhattacharyya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amrita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carmen Enid Martinez", "John Earl Watson", "Brian Dempsey", "Lasse Jensen", "Douglas Archibald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carmen Enid Martinez, Dissertation Advisor", "John Earl Watson, Committee Member", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member", "Douglas Archibald, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["redox-active Fe", "natural organic matter", "peat soils", "XANES", "EXAFS", "CTM4XAS", "Fe-minerals", "Fe-cysteine"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Graphene Oxide Supported Ruthenium for CO Methanation", "id": "16164", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7843", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The sustainable exploration of space requires minimization of re-supply from Earth through the implementation of In-Situ Resources Utilization (ISRU) strategies developed by NASA. One such strategy for lunar exploration is the production of oxygen from lunar regolith, a complex mix of minerals with large oxygen content. In the case of carbothermal-based oxygen production, reaction byproducts, i.e. carbon oxides, should be converted to methane for reintroduction into the carbothermal system. For this purpose, development of a methanation reactor to efficiently convert the mixed-carbon oxides into methane is essential to the integrity of the ISRU process.\nNickel has been the favored catalyst for the methanation reaction because of its activity, selectivity and catalyst life.  Yet Ni and Ni-based catalysts are particularly sensitive to poisoning by sulfur and coking by carbon. For these reasons Group VIII metals, in general far less prone to such detriments, have been in focus as alternatives to Ni, particularly Ru. Presently recent literature on methanation catalysts is concerned with preparative techniques and catalyst support, factors markedly affecting catalyst properties. \n\tThe research reported here is focused on developing a new, more-efficient catalyst for the methanation component in NASA\u2019s ISRU oxygen scheme.  Efficiency generally translates into high catalyst exposure or high surface-area availability in heterogeneous catalysis.  As a high surface area support graphene was chosen.  Dispersion of Ru on graphene was achieved via a two-step decoration process using graphene oxide as a precursor.  Notably GO production also facilitates graphene layer separation to create a high surface-area support. Yet agglomeration can occur during its reduction and deposition within a reactor bed, thereby lessening the effectiveness of the catalyst dispersion it supports.  This is particularly problematic for nanoscale carbon materials as supports, given their high self-affinity between particles or platelets. Preventing this agglomeration will provide an increase in the accessibility to the surface metal sites on the support and ultimately could increase the performance activity of the catalysts.\t Towards this goal different Ru-based catalyst systems, using grapheme, were prepared and compared.  \nThe support of interest, grapheme, was first prepared as graphene oxide (GO) by the modified Hummers process and later decorated with ruthenium using a poly-ol process. A traditional catalyst system of ruthenium supported on alumina (Al2O3) was also prepared using the same process so as to facilitate comparisons. Another catalyst was synthesized in which the alumina was also introduced in the synthesis process along with GO to produce a mixed catalyst with the alumina helping to separate the graphene sheets, thereby partially alleviating their agglomeration..\n\tThese catalysts were then impregnated within hierarchical alumina foams and loaded into a microchannel methanation reactor based upon a simple pipe construction and Swagelok fittings. The use of alumina foams provided excellent contact area for the methanation gases (H2, CO) while maintaining a low pressure drop. The characterization techniques of FE-SEM and TEM identified the Ru catalyst particle size and dispersion on the graphene support. EDS identified the ruthenium elemental state with XPS measuring the GO elemental content. By TGA analysis the ruthenium content in the catalyst was determined. With this well characterized and quantified catalyst, methanation tests were performed at a temperature of 409oC.  For these the catalyst was first pre-reduced at 300oC in the presence of H2.  Reactant gas concentrations (i.e. the CO/H2 ratio) and space velocities were varied to test catalyst activity and selectivity, using gas chromatography to analyze the product gas mixture after characterization of the different catalysts for activity and selectivity, hypothesis related to both measurement.  \nAmongst the catalyst systems of Ru/GO, Ru/Al2O3, Ru/ (GO+Al2O3), the mixed catalyst (Ru/ (GO+Al2O3)) performed the best with a CO conversion of 100 percent and selectivity of 100 percent towards methane. The comparisons made between the catalysts (Ru/GO)+bare Al2O3) and Ru/(GO+Al2O3) revealed that physical separation of the catalyst support layers, i.e. the graphene platelets, by the nanoalumina is the operative factor for highest activity.  Graphene layer separation facilitates the Ru catalyst exposure, consequently the high Ru catalyst dispersion is effective.  TEM images suggest this synergy of the mixed catalyst system with catalyst activity validating its impact. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7773], "author_name_tesi": "Bhimanapati, Ganesh Rahul", "last_name_ssi": "Bhimanapati", "middle_name_ssi": "Rahul", "first_name_ssi": "Ganesh", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Randy Vander Wal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Randy Vander Wal, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Graphene Oxide", "Ruthenium", "carbon monoxide", "methanation", "alumina."]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Scalable Synthesis of Graphene Based Heterostructures and their use in Energy Sensing, Conversion and Storage", "id": "13717gvb5099", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13717", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "2D materials are a unique class of materials system which has spread across the entire spectrum of materials including semi-metallic graphene to insulating boron nitride.

In the current work, heterostructures based on graphene, hBN and TMDs have been made, which were used to study the fundamental process-property relations and their use in energy conversion and storage have been studied. \nThe first part of this dissertation focusses on scalable approach for liquid phase exfoliation of graphene oxide (GO) and hBN (Chapter 2). The current work successfully shows an exfoliation efficiency of ~25% monolayer material for hBN, which was not previously achieved. These exfoliated materials were further mixed in the liquid environment to form a new heterostructure BCON (Chapter 3). This newly formed heterostructure was studied in detail for its process-property relations. At pH 4-8, BCON was highly stable and can be dried to form paper or ribbon like material. New bonds were observed in BCON which could be linked to the GO linkage at the nitrogen sites of the hBN. This free standing BCON was tested under various radiation sources like x-rays, alpha, beta, gamma sources and heavy ion like Ar particles and was found that it is very robust to radiation (Chapter 5). By understanding the chemistry, stability and properties of these materials, this could lay a foundation in using these materials for integration in conductive and insulating ink development, polymer composite development to improve the thermal and mechanical properties.\nAnother major focus of this dissertation work is combining TMDs and graphene for energy applications specifically hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and Lithium ion batteries (LiBs). TMD\u2019s specifically MoS2 and WSe2 were grown on graphite paper using powder vaporization and metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) (Chapter 4). Control over the architecture of the MoS2 and WSe2 was achieved by varying the precursor concentration and pressure, which was observed by using scanning electron microscopy. These samples were further characterized using cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and raman microscopy confirming the high quality of the material that was grown. The MoS2/graphite flowers were tested for hydrogen evolution reactions and were found that they are highly active for catalysis and by modifying the surface using simple UV-Ozone treatments, this activity can be increased by 4x (reducing the Tafel slope from 185 to 54 mV/Dec). Similar performance was observed for WSe2/Graphite heterostructure where the tiny 100 nm vertical flakes on graphite paper showed one of the lowest reported Tafel slope of 64 mV/Dec (Chapter 6). MoS2/Graphite was further tested for lithium ion batteries and was found that it had a higher cyclic capacity of 750 mV/Dec. This enhanced stability and performance for energy applications was achieved because of the direct growth technique on graphite. Hence this technique could be used as a scalable alternative to make anodes for lithium ion batteries.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13795], "author_name_tesi": "Bhimanapati, Ganesh Rahul", "last_name_ssi": "Bhimanapati", "middle_name_ssi": "Rahul", "first_name_ssi": "Ganesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua A Robinson", "Joshua A Robinson", "James Adair", "Mauricio Terrones", "Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua A Robinson, Dissertation Advisor", "Joshua A Robinson, Committee Chair", "James Adair, Committee Member", "Mauricio Terrones, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["graphene", "molybdenum disulfide", "heterostructures", "radiation", "hydrogen evolution reactions", "HERs", "lithium ion batteries", "LiBs", "transition metal dichalcogenides", "tungsten diselenide"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Multimethod Solvers: Algorithms, Application And Software", "id": "6420", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5799", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The solution of large sparse linear systems is a fundamental problem in scientific computing.

However, a large part of the world remains ungauged and requires robust model identification and evaluation approaches to improve predictions in ungauged locations. This paper demonstrates both benefits and challenges associated with predictions in ungauged basins (PUB) framework that uses multi-objective optimization in combination with hydrologic indices regionalization to improve ensemble predictions at ungauged sites. Our objective is to assess how the quality of regionalized hydrologic constraints impacts the difficulty of identifying behavioral parameter sets using multi-objective optimization. This work characterizes the modes of failure in the optimization algorithm using random seed analysis and ensembles of hydrologic predictions obtained from high, intermediate and low quality regionalized constraints for representative watersheds in the United Kingdom. The results highlight that a slight increase in model complexity can lead to severe difficulties for the multi-objective PUB framework when the new model fails to produce simulated hydrologic indices within the feasible ranges attained from regionalization. Results also point to the issue that low quality regionalized constraints can still yield improved ensemble predictions given longer search durations for the optimization algorithm. Random seed analysis for the search dynamics of the multi-objective optimization algorithm and scatter plots showing the overall coverage of the behavioral indices space defined by regionalized hydrologic constraints provide key diagnostics of the quality and effectiveness of the predictions attained from the multi-objective PUB framework in the absence of observations.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5379], "author_name_tesi": "Bhushan, Rashi ", "last_name_ssi": "Bhushan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rashi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick M Reed", "Dr Thorsten Wagener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick M Reed, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Thorsten Wagener, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Regionalization", "Ungauged Basins", "Calibration", "Conceptual models", "Optimization", "Regional Sensitivity Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Colloidal Chemistry Synthesis and Electron Microscopy Characterization of Shape-controlled Metal and Semiconductor Nanocrystals", "id": "23401", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10475", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Solution methods of materials synthesis have found application in a variety of fields due to the diversity of products accessible, facility of process scalability, and the ease of tuning their properties through prudent selection of reaction conditions.  Control of experimental variables during the formation of colloidally stable nanoscale solids within a liquid matrix allows for tailoring of the particles\u2019 characteristics, including shape, size, composition, and surface chemistry.  In this dissertation, I will discuss how the manipulation of reaction chemistries can be used to synthesize shape-controlled metal and semiconductor colloidal nanocrystals.  Further, I will elaborate on the mechanisms by which these particles form from molecular precursors and describe how their properties can differ from their bulk analogues through extensive characterization, especially using transmission electron microscopy.  These studies contribute to the continued development of chemical routes to nanocrystals and their application as functional materials.\n\nFirst, I will review recent advances in the synthesis and characterization of shape-controlled nanocrystals, as well as highlight their promising applicability in a number of emerging technologies.  These principles will then be leveraged to the specific case of catalytically-active rhodium nanocrystals, which can be synthesized with morphological and dimensional control using a polyol solution-mediated strategy.  I describe an innovative shape-controlled synthesis to monodisperse colloidal rhodium icosahedra, cubes, triangular plates, and octahedra using this route.  Additionally, new insights into the important role of the polyol reducing solvent on the synthesis of these nanocrystals are revealed, and how these might be exploited to engender superior reaction control and novel products.\n\nNext, I will describe how a crystallization mechanism was established for the synthesis of numerous morphologies of noble metal nanocrystals.  I present a thorough analysis of the synthesis of shape-controlled rhodium nanocrystals, using extensive transmission electron microscopy characterization, and relate these findings to one of the primary synthetic levers available in the polyol synthesis: the anionic ligands present.  Further, I show that the crystallization process proceeds by a nonclassical mechanism in which cluster particles serve as a stable intermediate between molecular precursors and the final product.  I then apply these principles to the shape-controlled synthesis of other noble metal nanocrystals before expounding a generalized formation mechanism in the polyol synthesis of colloidal metal nanocrystals.  \n\nFinally, I will highlight my efforts in the designed synthesis and characterization of colloidal tin(II) sulfide (SnS) semiconducting \u201cquantum dot\u201d nanocrystals.  I describe a route for the solution synthesis of monodisperse colloidal SnS nanosheets, nanocubes, and nanospherical polyhedra in high yield.  Further, detailed crystallographic characterization of these nanocrystals using transmission electron microscopy indicates that their atomic structure possesses a previously-unreported nanoscale deviation from the bulk phase.

Prior to marketing, small fruits are not washed or otherwise treated to extend their shelf life.  Previous research has shown that conventional sanitizers are not effective in killing food borne pathogens on small fruits.  Therefore, there is a need to evaluate novel technologies as a method of inactivating pathogens on the surfaces of berries.  Two such technologies are ozone and pulsed ultraviolet-light.  Ozone has been used as a disinfectant in the water industry for over a century, and was approved in 1997 by the USDA for use as a disinfecting agent.  Pulsed UV-light is a much more efficient method of applying UV-light, in that is supplies greater instantaneous energy and thus reduces treatment times.  The goal of this research was to evaluate ozone, gaseous and aqueous, and pulsed UV-light for the purpose of inactivating E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica on the surfaces of berries.  \n\tThe efficacy of gaseous ozone to decontaminate pathogens on strawberries and raspberries was evaluated. Fruits were treated with four ozone treatments; i) continuous ozone flow (5% wt/wt) for 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 min, ii) pressurized ozone (83 kPa) for 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 min, iii) continuous ozone (64 min) followed by pressurized ozone (64 min), and iv) vacuum followed by 64-min pressurized ozone.  To determine the efficacy of ozone used as an additive to wash water, pathogen inoculated fruit were treated with aqueous ozone at 20oC and 4oC, and with water as a control.  Pulsed UV-light was evaluated as a method for decontamination.  There was no observable damage to the fruits at UV doses deemed optimal.  All technologies were modeled using the Weibull distribution to calculate microbial inactivation.  Finally, a separate study was conducted to model the penetration of pulsed UV-light through model food systems.   \n\tThe results obtained in this study indicated that both ozone and pulsed UV-light have potential to be used as methods of decontamination.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3448], "author_name_tesi": "Bialka, Katherine L", "last_name_ssi": "Bialka", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali Demirci", "Virendra Puri", "Paul Walker", "Robert Bruce Beelman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali Demirci, Committee Chair", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Paul Walker, Committee Member", "Robert Bruce Beelman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["strawberries", "raspberries", "blueberries", "novel technologies", "food safety", "food engineering"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Information Asymmetry and Residential Mortgage Choices\n", "id": "12020", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6664", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When financing real estate properties through a mortgage, borrowers often face a variety of loan products. During the recent housing bubble the variety of mortgage products and features proliferated. The recent mortgage foreclosure crisis leads many commentators to point to the growth in the use of these alternative mortgage features as being predatory. A number of academic studies provide supporting evidence to this view. In contrast, economists have long noted that mortgage menus provide an effective mechanism for reducing the information asymmetry that exists between borrowers and lenders. This dissertation focuses on the screening mechanisms of mortgage features. One of the goals is to analyze the welfare implications of allowing for a greater variety of loan products in the residential mortgage market.\nThis dissertation also aims to contribute to the existing literature on mortgage choices by incorporate multiple risk dimensions in a unified framework. Most previous studies limit their exploration to a single risk dimension, default or prepayment risk. While examining one risk dimension at a time substantially simplifies the analysis, it also omits the fact that multiple sources of information asymmetry may be at work in shaping the mortgage market equilibrium. It is well-known that a mortgage contract contains two types of risk: default risk and prepayment risk. A single device may possess dual screening roles.\nChapter 2 of this dissertation illustrates the screening role of prepayment penalty on default and prepayment risks. It examines the interaction between the two screening functions of prepayment penalty, and shows that the borrower mobility and default risks jointly determine the mortgage market equilibrium. In particular, the willingness of a borrower to accept a prepayment penalty may stem from her low mobility risk and/or high default risk. The choice of a higher prepayment penalty sends the lender conflicting signals about the borrower\u2019s mobility versus default risk type; thus rendering the screening role of prepayment penalty ambiguous. Chapter 3 studies the dual screening role of mortgage discount points. It shows that there exists a separating equilibrium such that borrowers with higher (lower) transaction costs pay more (less) discount points to obtain a lower (higher) interest rate. This theoretical prediction suggests a new screening function of mortgage points, and it complements the conventional mobility-based theory that suggests that the choice of discount points is a signal of the borrower\u2019s expected mobility. Chapter 3 also empirically examines the screening role of discount points from the lender\u2019s perspective. The empirical results suggest that lenders tend to securitize loans originated by borrowers with higher transactions cost. Chapter 4 offers a theoretical model to show that when future income uncertainty is private information, there exists a separating equilibrium such that borrowers with higher default risk are more likely to choose mortgage contracts with prepayment penalties. I further test the prediction of my model using a sample of securitized mortgages that contain loans with and without a prepayment penalty. I find that the positive correlation between prepayment penalties and default rates is attributable to information asymmetry. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6661], "author_name_tesi": "Bian, Xun ", "last_name_ssi": "Bian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brent William Ambrose", "Brent William Ambrose", "N Edward Coulson", "Austin Jay Jaffe", "Jiro Yoshida"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brent William Ambrose, Dissertation Advisor", "Brent William Ambrose, Committee Chair", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member", "Austin Jay Jaffe, Committee Member", "Jiro Yoshida, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["prepayment penalty", "Prepayment risk", "default risk", "information asymmetry", "mortgage choice", "discount points"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Looking Back to Inform the Future: The Role of Cognition in Forest Disturbance Characterization from Remote Sensing Imagery", "id": "22608", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10194", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Remotely sensed images have become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives.

In response to these cognitively demanding environments, expert analysts develop specialized knowledge and analytic skills to address increasingly complex problems.\nThis study identifies the knowledge, skills, and analytic goals of expert image analysts tasked with identification of land cover and land use change.

Deficiencies in this nutrient can result in decreased DA clearance, transporter density, and in dopamine (D1 and D2) receptor densities.  These studies were designed to examine the relationship between iron deficiency and diurnal cycle on catecholaminergic systems.  Through the use of in vivo microdialysis we have demonstrated several novel findings regarding iron deficiency and catecholamines in vivo as well as extended our knowledge regarding the impact of iron deficiency. The first aim was designed to probe the interaction between iron deficiency and the functionality on the link between the D2 receptor and the dopamine transporter.  Using the D2R agonist quinpirole coupled with the no net flux protocol we found that the synthetic pathway through protein kinase A was not altered by iron deficiency, however, the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway which upregulates transport was compromised.  These findings indict the PKC signal transduction pathway as a potential target for the influence of iron deficiency on catecholaminergic systems and a site for future work.  The second aim focused on the interaction of L-DOPA and iron deficiency on monoamine metabolism.  We observed that L-DOPA administration to ID rats favored the synthesis of norepinephrine (NE) while also resulting in a blunted dopamine (DA) response. Additionally, tissue concentrations of NE along with increased dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity were also observed indicating that iron deficiency also alters the noradrenergic system. This has potential ramifications in iron deficient patients who are prescribed L-DOPA as the efficacy of the drug may be compromised.  The third aim was designed to examine the effects of iron deficiency on diurnal extracellular catecholamines and behavior.  We found that iron deficiency resulted in increased DA concentration but decreased NE concentration at the onset of the dark cycle.  This indicates that diurnal regulation of synthesis or release is altered by iron deficiency.  Although the exact mechanism for these findings is unknown most likely iron deficiency results in a dysregulation of D\u0192\u00d2H activity. Additionally, we also found that in the forty five minutes prior to onset of the light cycle (transition to inactive phase) stereotypy is also increased in ID rats.  This is interesting as it corresponds to the complaints of increased symptoms before bed in restless legs syndrome (RLS) patients.  The fourth aim focused on the effects of iron infusion into the ventral midbrain vs the striatum.  In this experiment, we attempted to remediate DA functioning in the striatum by rescuing iron status in the VMB (cell bodies) or the ST (terminal fields) by iron infusion.  We found that VMB but not striatal infusion ameliorated defects in extracellular DA and intracellular DA. Additionally, infusion into the VMB also corrected the deficits in the D2R \u00a1V DAT linkage reported in aim 1.  Finally, we examined how iron deficiency altered diurnal and sex effects in the dopaminergic system of a genetically inbred strain of mice.  First, we found a sex by diet effect in the striatal concentrations of NE and HVA.  We also measured DA efflux by infusion of amphetamine and again found an effect of time of day, diet, and sex with increased DA overflow in ID female mice in the morning. These results confirm the hints in the literature regarding a differential effect of ID in males vs females.  Thus, this is clear evidence that female subjects must also be considered in future work. These findings are very important given the relationship between iron deficiency, dopamine, and restless legs syndrome.  They serve to further our understanding of the impact of iron deficiency in catecholaminergic systems in the brain.

We utilized the pump-probe technique to excite to the C (2 1A&#8242;) state of the molecule with a pump of 200 nm and a probe of 400 nm.  The results from this one photon pump to the C state are compared to previous findings of two-photon pumping to the same state.  Specifically, the addition of more SO2 molecules to the cluster does not affect the relaxation dynamics, suggesting that self-solvation does not influence these electronic energy levels of the potential energy surface of SO2 to an appreciable extent.  However, the probe photon order demonstrates that clustering frustrates the appearance of molecular fragments, demonstrating a strongly cohesive cluster with high binding energy.  This also suggests that the energy of the C state shifts lower upon clustering, thereby requiring additional photons for ionization. Therefore, growth in cluster size does not create an environment that suppresses the electronic energy levels of the potential energy surface of SO2, and as such, we observe the prompt dissociation of SO2.  Finally, under very intense laser illumination, clusters are observed to undergo Coulomb explosion, resulting in the appearance of charge states for atoms of the heterogeneously composed cluster requiring nearly identical sequential ionization potentials.\nIn addition to the SO2 cluster studies, formic acid-water cluster studies were performed utilizing 800 nm pump and 400 nm probe.  These mixed cluster species demonstrate a mono-exponential decay that increases in time with increasing cluster size via either component.  Another experiment performed while studying formic acid-water clusters involves the Water-Gas Shift reaction.  Since the mid 1800\u2019s the reverse water gas shift reaction has been tested.  It has been known for a long time that adding strong acids, such as hydrochloric, to a beaker of formic acid will catalyze the decarbonylation of formic acid in the bulk phase, thereby producing carbon monoxide.  Here we demonstrate that this reaction can occur on a molecular scale.  Further, we show that excitation by a UV laser can speed the reaction to occur on a sub-picosecond time scale.  Additionally, we have demonstrated quantum control by selectively enhancing the production of H2O and CO upon the addition of HCl, and upon the addition of water clusters we produce H2 and CO2 gas.  We find that in the absence of steric hindrance of a bulk liquid (where this reaction is known to occur), the application of ultraviolet light allows the reaction to occur on a femtosecond scale.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4622], "author_name_tesi": "Bianco, Nicholas Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Bianco", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "John V Badding", "Miriam Arak Freedman", "James Kasting"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Chair", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Miriam Arak Freedman, Committee Member", "James Kasting, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["spectroscopy", "pump-probe", "decay", "femtosecond", "dynamics", "clusters", "water", "formic acid", "sulfur dioxide", "time-of-flight", "ultraviolet"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "DIRECTED SELF-ASSEMBLY OF INORGANIC REDOX COMPLEXES AND THE FORMATION OF CHARGE SEPARATED STATES", "id": "13734bmb281", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13734", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-01-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Photosynthetic organisms efficiently absorb photons and transfer electrons over long distances, through a series of spatially ordered donor and acceptor molecules that are arranged within a complex architecture to create charge separated states capable of catalysis.

Using a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ chromophore linked to various donors and acceptors via an aminoethylglycine (aeg) backbone, we are able to systematically study the structural features that lead to long lived charge separation in an inorganic supramolecular structure.\nTris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) complexes were functionalized with an aeg backbone functionalized with either a phenothiazine (PTZ) ligand or a phenyl-terpyridine (\u0424-tpy) ligand. The PTZ-functionalized aeg backbone covalently binds the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ acceptor to the PTZ donor by forming an amide bond between the [Ru(bpy)32+] and the aminoethylglycine. Addition of Zn2+ causes the linkage of the \u0424-tpy-functionalized aeg [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to pyridine-functionalized aeg derivatized with PTZ, creating a donor/acceptor complex via metal coordination.  \nThese donor/acceptor complexes provide a facile method to study through space electron transfer and excited state relaxation dynamics, which can include the formation of a charge separated state. We examine these properties by measuring and comparing the emission quantum yields, lifetimes, and rates of electron transfer of these compounds. Our study shows an increase in the nonradiative decay rate when the donor-acceptor pair is linked, either directly or via formation of the Zn coordinative complex, i.e. when the PTZ is attached to [Ru(bpy)3]2+. An increase in the nonradiative decay rate is observed as the distance between the Ru and PTZ donor/acceptor decreases. Both of these observations are consistent with excited state relaxation via an electron transfer from the Ru excited state to the bound PTZ acceptor. \nTo further test our hypothesis, the aeg \u0424-tpy-functionalized [Ru(bpy)3]2+ was coordinated to an aeg pyridine-functionalized methyl viologen (MV2+) by addition of Zn2+. As before, the excited state dynamics of the Ru-MV2+ compound were observed: linking the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ compound via Zn coordination to the viologen results in a decrease in the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ excited state lifetime, and increased rates of radiative and nonradiative decay. These rates however are slower in comparison to the rates observed in the Ru-PTZ complexes. The decrease in decay rates may be attributed to conformational flexibility in the Zn coordinated complexes and the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged Ru and MV2+ in the Ru-MV2+ complex potentially keeping the donor and acceptor at a further distance than in the Ru-PTZ complexes. Based on literature precedence and our observations of the energy levels of excited state [Ru(bpy)3]2+*, PTZ, and MV2+ along with the observed increase in the rates of radiative and nonradiative decay upon formation of either the Ru-PTZ or Ru-MV2+ complexes leads us to conclude that the formation of a charge separated state was achieved. Ongoing investigations aim to directly observe the charge separated state via transient absorption spectroscopy. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14096], "author_name_tesi": "Biber, Benjamin Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Biber", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Thomas E.

Past research has focused on hard maturational constraints as the constraining factor in adult L2 learning, but recent studies challenge those accounts by demonstrating that some adult L2 learners have achieved native-like processing in the L2. The present study shifts the focus in adult L2 learning from the L2 to the native language (L1), by testing a new hypothesis that the L1 must change in the process of L2 learning, and that the learners who are better able to tolerate L1 changes achieve higher L2 proficiency. Tolerance to L1 change incorporates two types of changes, L1 costs and L2 sensitivity. L1 costs are thought to be modulated by inhibitory control, whereby L2 learners who are better able to inhibit the L1 would have lower L1 performance compared to monolinguals, but overall higher L2 proficiency. The other prediction was the L2 learners who reveal the influence of the L2 during L1 processing, or L2 sensitivity, would have higher L2 proficiency. To test this hypothesis, L2 learners of various proficiency levels were tested in the L1 and the L2 on tasks of comprehension (lexical decision task) and production (semantic fluency task) and compared to monolinguals in the L1 tasks. ERP measurements were taken during the comprehension task to investigate neural sensitivity to the L2 that might not otherwise be present in behavioral measures. Statistical analyses revealed that L2 learners and monolinguals benefited from the presence of cognates in the L1, but the ERP waveforms and scalp distributions revealed that only the L2 learners demonstrated neural activity consistent with cognate facilitation, in the form of a reduced N400 for cognates compared to noncognates. Interestingly, the L2 results from the comprehension task showed that the beginning L2 learners did not produce an N400 for cognates compared to noncognates, but the advanced L2 learners had a clear N400 effect. Results are discussed in terms of the hypothesis and past research finding L2 sensitivity during L1 processing.

Prior literature shows that CEOs benefit from engaging in M&As even when the M&As do not benefit the shareholders. Poor governance appears to be a contributing factor in a CEO\u2019s ability to extract rent through the M&A process.  Shareholders have an interest in combating this agency issue.  I study the influence of mutual funds, the largest shareholders.  Mutual funds can influence the compensation of the acquiring firms\u2019 CEO through two actions: voting against management and voting with their feet.  Results show that mutual funds do successfully mitigate CEOs\u2019 ability to extract rents during the M&A process by voting against management.  This effect is strongest among firms owned by higher numbers of monitoring funds.\n\nIn the second essay, I examine the information embedded in the three day volatility around an M&A announcement.  Volatility can reflect the probability of deal completion, the time to deal resolution, and the CEO tenure subsequent to deal completion.  For bad acquisitions, lower volatility indicates investors\u2019 agreement that the acquisition lowers the value of the firm; therefore, these acquisitions should have lower probability of completion.  Complexity of a deal can lead to longer time to deal resolution as well as higher volatility.  Disagreements regarding synergies the CEO can create through the merger signify the potential private information the CEO has regarding the merger.  Therefore, the firm should allow the CEO more time to divulge his capabilities.  The results show that volatility is positively related to probability of completion among bad deals.  Volatility also correlates positively to the time to resolution and CEOs\u2019 tenure subsequent to deal completion.  Additionally, I find that the relationships between volatility and both deal completion and CEO tenure are prominent for firms with good governance.  These findings show that three-day volatility contains information regarding firm decisions after the deal announcement.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7593], "author_name_tesi": "Bick, Patty Liu", "last_name_ssi": "Bick", "middle_name_ssi": "Liu", "first_name_ssi": "Patty", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle Lowry", "Michelle Lowry", "Laura B Field", "N Edward Coulson", "Fenghua Song"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle Lowry, Dissertation Advisor", "Michelle Lowry, Committee Chair", "Laura B Field, Committee Member", "N Edward Coulson, Special Member", "Fenghua Song, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mergers", "acquisitions", "compensation", "mutual funds", "volatility", "voting", "CEO compensation", "M&A", "announcement volatility"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Mechanizing Rammed Earth:\nmaking New Earth Construction Viable in the Us\n", "id": "29163", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12487", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rammed earth and stabilized rammed earth, two common forms of earth construction, are readily accessible techniques with long histories of use as building methods in many parts of the world.  Despite this global commonplaceness, they are currently considered specialized and/or antiquated forms of construction in the United States (US).  While mechanization and industrialization have significantly enhanced other materials and methods commonly used in building construction, modern forms of rammed earth and stabilized rammed earth used in the US still employ traditional labor intensive construction processes, and simple tools.  Although contemporary technology has been applied in refining the earth material mix and toward creating better understanding of the material behavior and the ramming tools themselves, it has not been brought to bear on the rammed earth construction process.

Three distinct machines \u2013 Monument, Mass, and Needle \u2013 were designed and are presented as means to advance earth as an US building material through mechanization/industrialization, with the ultimate goal of re-inserting it into the portfolio of contemporary US building methods.

Pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 15-20% of all pregnancies, and women who experience these pregnancy losses are likely to become pregnant again within 18 months.  The experience of pregnancy after a previous perinatal loss may be marked by high levels of fear, anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, women who give birth to a healthy baby subsequent to a perinatal loss may experience continuing emotional difficulties related to the previous loss, which could impact the formation of a healthy relationship between the mother and her infant. Objectives.  The objective of this study was to longitudinally examine the emotional impact of previous perinatal loss on maternal depression and maternal infant bonding in a sample of women giving birth for the first time. Methods. Secondary data analysis was completed on a longitudinal cohort study, the First Baby Study (FBS). The FBS enrolled 3006 pregnant women in the third trimester who were planning to give birth to their first live-born baby in Pennsylvania, USA between 2009 and 2011. In this analysis, 453 women with a history of miscarriage were compared to 2401 women experiencing their first pregnancy on two outcomes: maternal depression and maternal-infant bonding. Maternal depression was measured during the third trimester, and at 1, 6, and 12 months postpartum via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), while maternal-infant bonding was measured at all postpartum time points using the Shortened-Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire. First, bivariate analysis was completed for each outcome using Chi-square or Student\u2019s t-test followed by appropriate regression models adjusted for confounding factors significant in bivariate models. Longitudinal analysis was completed with each outcome variable as a repeated measure.  Results. Women with a history of perinatal loss did not differ significantly from those without a history of perinatal loss on probable depression (EPDS>12) except that they had higher risk at 1 month postpartum (adjusted OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.03 \u2013 2.69). Women with a history of perinatal loss also reported bonding scores that did not differ significantly from those without a history of perinatal loss. Furthermore, there was no interaction between time and perinatal loss history in longitudinal analysis. Conclusions. The results of this study provide limited support for the hypothesis that a history of perinatal loss has a negative impact on maternal mental health and maternal-infant bonding in a subsequent pregnancy and postpartum. Future research should utilize population-based samples of women in order to avoid selection bias that is found in some of the existing literature.  It is recommended that researchers focus on identifying the specific sociodemographic or psychosocial risk factors that place women at risk for persistent emotional consequences of a perinatal loss history during subsequent pregnancy and postpartum.
