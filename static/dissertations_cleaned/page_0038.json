Such data accessibility could be realized by exploring unused communication opportunities between the short-range radios, such as Bluetooth or WiFi, of mobile devices, when they opportunistically move into the communication range of each other. These devices, therefore, form Opportunistic Mobile Networks.\n\nThe specific goal of this dissertation is to develop comprehensive solutions for providing mobile data accessibility in opportunistic mobile networks, when the cellular 3G or WiFi network infrastructure is unavailable. In particular, this dissertation explores the social behavior patterns of mobile users to address the challenges in network uncertainty, low quality, and subjectivity, and ensures that data can be efficiently disseminated to users being interested in the data by selecting appropriate nodes as relays to carry and forward data. An overall research strategy is to explore the correspondence of sociological concepts, including centrality, community, and homophily, in opportunistic communication among mobile users. Analytical measures of sociological concepts are devised to extract users' implicit social links from observations of their social behavior patterns. These measures are then exploited for efficient network decisions on data dissemination.\n\nThis dissertation synthesizes three aspects of users' social behavior patterns for prompt and efficient data dissemination. First, we investigate users' social contact patterns, from which we propose centrality and community measures for facilitating opportunistic communication. Second, we take the satisfaction of socially correlated user interest into consideration, and incorporate users' social interests into measuring user centrality. Third, we study the impact of homophily on data dissemination performance, and provide theoretical analysis on the optimal relay selection policies, from the correlation between friendship and interest similarity of mobile users.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7475], "author_name_tesi": "Gao, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Gao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "C Lee Giles", "George Kesidis", "Xiaolong Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Dissertation Advisor", "C Lee Giles, Committee Member", "George Kesidis, Committee Member", "Xiaolong Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["opportunistic mobile networks", "data dissemination", "social networks", "mobile computing", "user interest", "centrality", "community"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Modeling Uncertainty in Large_scale Urban Traffic Networks", "id": "27358", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11958", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent work has proposed using aggregate relationships between urban traffic variables\u2014i.e., Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs)\u2014to describe aggregate traffic dynamics in urban networks. This approach is particularly useful to unveil and explore the effects of various network-wide control strategies. The majority of modeling work using MFDs hinges upon the existence of well-defined MFDs without consideration of uncertain behaviors. However, both empirical data and theoretical analysis have demonstrated that MFDs are expected to be uncertain due to inherent instabilities that exist in traffic networks. Fortunately, sufficient amounts of adaptive drivers who re-route to avoid congestion have been proven to help eliminate the instability of MFDs. Unfortunately, drivers cannot re-route themselves adaptively all the time as routing choices are controlled by multiple factors, and the presence of adaptive drivers is not something that traffic engineers can control. Since MFDs have shown promise in the design and control of urban networks, it is important to seek another strategy to mitigate or eliminate the instability of MFDs. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop a framework to account for the uncertain phenomena that emerges on the macroscopic, network-wide level to address these unavoidable stochastic behaviors.\nThis first half of this work investigates another strategy to eliminate inherent network instabilities and produce more reliable MFDs that is reliable and controllable from an engineering perspective\u2014the use of adaptive traffic signals. A family of adaptive signal control strategies is examined on two abstractions of an idealized grid network using an interactive simulation and analytical model. The results suggest that adaptive traffic signals should provide a stabilizing influence that provides more well-defined MFDs. Adaptive signal control also both increases average flows and decreases the likelihood of gridlock when the network is moderately congested. The benefits achieved at these moderately congested states increase with the level of signal adaptivity. However, when the network is extremely congested, vehicle movements become more constrained by downstream congestion and queue spillbacks than by traffic signals, and adaptive traffic signals appear to have little to no effect on the network or MFD. When a network is extremely congested, other strategies should be used to mitigate the instability, like adaptively routing drivers. Therefore, without sufficient amounts of adaptive drivers, the instability of MFDs could be somewhat controlled, but it cannot be eliminated completely. This is results in more reliable MFDs until the network enters heavily congested states. \nThe second half of this work uses stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to depict the evolutionary dynamics of urban network while accounting for unavoidable uncertain phenomena. General analytical solutions of SDEs only exist for linear functions. Unfortunately, most MFDs observed from simulation and empirical data follow non-linear functions. Even the most simplified theoretical model is piecewise linear with breakpoints that cannot be readily accommodated by the linear SDE approach. To overcome this limitation, the SDE well-known solutions are used to develop an approximate solution method that relies on the discretization of the continuous state space. This process is memoryless and results in the development of a computationally efficient Markov Chain (MC) framework. The MC model is also supported by a well-developed theory which facilitates the estimation of future states or steady state equilibrium conditions in a network that explicitly accounts for MFD uncertainty. Due to the fact that current formalization of Markov Chains is restricted with a countable state space, some assumptions which redefine the traffic state and stochastic dynamic process need to be set for the MC model application in dynamic traffic analysis. These assumptions could be sabotaged by inappropriate parameter selections, producing excessive errors in analytical solutions. Therefore, a parametric study is performed here to illustrate how to select two key parameters, i.e. bin size and time interval to optimize the MC models and minimize errors.\nThe major advantage of MC models is its wide flexibility, which has been demonstrated by showing how this method could well handle a wide variety of variables. A family of numerical tests are designed to include instability of MFD model, stochastic traffic demand, different city layouts and different forms of MFDs in the scenarios under static metering strategies. The results suggest that analytical solutions derived from MC models could accurately predict the future traffic state at any moment. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis also illustrates that Markov chains could easily model dynamic traffic control based on traffic state and pre-determined time-varying strategies by adjusting the transition matrix. Overall, the developed MC models are promising in the dynamic analysis of complicated urban network control under uncertainty for which simpler algebraic solutions do not exist.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11400], "author_name_tesi": "Gao, Xueyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Gao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xueyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vikash Varun Gayah", "Eric Todd Donnell", "Sukran Ilgin Guler", "Minghui Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vikash Varun Gayah, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Todd Donnell, Committee Member", "Sukran Ilgin Guler, Committee Member", "Minghui Zhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram", "Adaptive Signal Control", "Urban Traffic Control", "Markov Chain Model"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "High effciciency terahertz generation for standoff detection", "id": "16149", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8047", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "   In this dissertation, high efficiency terahertz (THz) generations for standoff detection are investigated. First, a multi-frequency excitation system is introduced which serves to greatly sensitize the standoff detection system regarding the buried or concealed target materials. Based on this system, in order to precisely identify the targets by using THz technology which processes many advantages compared with other detection methods, such as microwave or IR, several ways for THz generations based on nonlinear crystals, femtosecond laser-induced air plasma, photoconductive (PC) antenna, are theoretically and experimentally discussed. However, one of the downside of these THz generation approaches is the low conversion efficiency from optical pump energy to THz radiation, which limits many practical THz applications. Therefore, how to improve the efficiency of THz radiation becomes a hot research topic in THz area. Regarding the PC antenna-based THz generation, we proposed two novel approaches to not only greatly improve the conversion efficiency, but also highly broaden the bandwidth of THz radiation. Furthermore, another novel THz generation approach based on surface plasma excitation via nanostructured surfaces is also quantitatively studied, and a physical model is built to understand the mechanism underneath as well as the factors that could affect the efficiency of THz radiation. In order to better use THz technology for the standoff detection, we demonstrate to use the pulsed THz waves to remotely determine the existence and the location of the target materials, such as metal grids.

As train speed increases, the responses of the train and track substructure present larger dynamic behavior, which raises problems in passenger comfort, operational safety and track structures. With the boom of modeling and computing techniques, numerical simulation becomes a more feasible, safe and effective tool to identify the problems in railroad engineering. In this dissertation, a self-developed three-dimensional train-track interaction model is formulated, validated and implemented to predict the potential risks and explore the mechanisms of rail track problems.\nThe developed 3D dynamic track-subgrade interaction model includes a train model, 2D discrete support track model and 3D computation-efficient finite element (FE) soil subgrade model. The rail beam is modeled as a Euler-Bernoulli Beam. The 2D track model discretizes the tie and ballast as rigid bodies with designated spacing. The discretely supported system enables the track model to take the track longitudinal variations into consideration. The subgrade model is simulated by finite element method with quadrilateral elements. Since the subgrade of a tangent track is considered as homogeneous in the moving direction, the formulation of the subgrade is derived in a computing-efficient way by expanding the longitudinal direction in the frequency domain. Therefore, the computing time is significantly reduced. The entire model is a self-developed program, which is coded in MATLAB.\nField data collected in x, y, z directions were used to validate the accuracy of the dynamic track-subgrade interaction model. Testing sites were located on Amtrak\u2019s highest speed (240 km/hr) line near Kingston, Rhode Island, on the Northeast Corridor in United States. Track deflections and the ground wave motion measured in the field were compared with those predicted by the 3D dynamic track-subgrade interaction model.\nSome applications of the 3D dynamic track-subgrade interaction model are included in this dissertation, as follow.\nCritical speed study: Amtrak requires more frequent maintenance for the North East Corridor (NEC) at Kingston, Rhode Island (known as the Great Swamp area). It was suspected that a condition, known as critical speed, might exist at this particular location. The conventional definition of critical speed of a railroad system is the speed at which vibrations propagate within the track structure and subgrade at a speed close to the Rayleigh wave velocity of the subgrade soil. As trains travel at speeds approaching the critical speed, all track components are expected to present significantly increased vibrations. However, no historical data indicated such dramatic increment in track responses at the \u201cGreat Swamp\u201d area. Therefore, the 3D dynamic track-subgrade interaction model was used to evaluate the track performance under the current range of operation speeds and predicted the track responses at train speeds higher than the track speed limits. According to the results and analysis, the critical speed effect at the Kingston site could not be comprehensively explained by the conventional definition of the critical speed. Therefore, a two-level explanation is used to address the phenomenon at this site.\nHanging tie detection: the hanging tie condition is that in which voids have developed beneath the ties, causing tie-ballast gaps. The existence of the tie-ballast gaps can result in larger peak accelerations at the unsupported or poorly supported ties. This will increase the dynamic contact force between tie and ballast, and then further deteriorate the track structure. However, currently the railroad industry has difficulties in identifying hanging ties in the field since the problem is buried beneath the track. Therefore, the previously developed model was used to propose a fast, nondestructive screening method to identify the hanging tie problem. The method utilized a dynamic track model to characterize the track's \u201cMoving Deflection Spectrum (MDS)\u201d under different tie-supporting scenarios. The MDSs of tracks without a hanging tie problem have a clear peak at the \u201cTie Spacing Frequency.\u201d However, tracks have a hanging tie problem if the MDSs present a significantly increased peak in the low frequency region (the frequency below the \u201cTie Spacing Frequency\u201d). The modeling results were further validated by the field investigations conducted on three metro lines in Boston and St. Louis. Accelerometers were mounted on a high-rail vehicle to measure the acceleration of the moving wheels. The MDSs were then calculated to predict the potential locations of hanging ties. The locations of hanging ties predicted by the model matched the field observations. \nTie movements characterization: modeling techniques were used to predict the movements of railroad ties under moving train passage in this study. The ballast and other track substructures performances are largely dependent on the tie-ballast contact. Therefore, characterizing the tie movements could potentially bring new concepts to the conventional laboratory tests and practical maintenance for railroad engineering. In order to obtain the tie movements numerically, two steps were made by combining a commercial vehicle dynamics model with a track model established in the commercial software ABAQUS. The modeling results showed that the motion of ties not only contains translational movements, but also rotations. The field tests to validate this finding were conducted on an Amtrak high-speed passenger line and a freight railroad short line. The measuring units were mounted on ties to record the accelerations and the changes in Euler angles of the ties in three orthogonal directions. The measurements of tie displacements and rotations in the field tests had good agreement with the modeling results. Moreover, field tests indicated that the tie-ballast gaps may cause higher accelerations and angular velocities of ties. Then the effect of tie rotation was investigated by discrete element modeling. The modeling results showed that the acceleration of individual ballast particles and ballast contact forces could have significant increase when the tie rotation is considered.\nOverall, the 3D train-track interaction model is capable of simulating the railroad tracks of various conditions by integrating the discrete supports and 3D subgrade model. The model can be a reliable and effective tool for railroad industry. The versatility of the model makes it have great potential for future research and references.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12645], "author_name_tesi": "Gao, Yin ", "last_name_ssi": "Gao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hai Huang", "Shelley Marie Stoffels", "Tong Qiu", "Patrick Joseph Fox", "Jamal Rostami", "Hai Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hai Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Shelley Marie Stoffels, Committee Chair", "Tong Qiu, Committee Member", "Patrick Joseph Fox, Committee Member", "Jamal Rostami, Outside Member", "Hai Huang, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["train-track interaction", "track dynamics", "field validation", "critical speed", "hanging tie", "crosstie movement"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECT OF OTHER CONSUMERS, LOYALTY TIER AND REWARD UNCERTAINTY ON CONSUMERS\u2019 LOYALTY REWARD DONATION ", "id": "14223yzg104", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14223", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although loyalty reward programs and corporate social responsible (CSR) activities have become ubiquitous in the marketplace, little is known about how they can be synthesized to benefit companies as well as those in need.

To decipher the vascular signals, it is essential to understand the spatial and temporal hemodynamics during natural behaviors. At pia surface, arterioles form an interconnected network that gives rise to penetrating arterioles, which enter into the brain to feed surrounding neurons. Besides the pia mater, the dura mater is another meninge that is densely covered by blood vessels. However, it is not known whether the intracortical arterioles and venules behave similarly as those on the brain surface, whether this hemodynamic response is spatially localized, or whether the dural vessels actively respond as the cortical vessels during natural behavior. To address these questions, we imaged individual vessels in various brain regions using two-photon microscopy, in awake, head-fixed mice during voluntary locomotion.\n\nLocomotion drives fast and strong pial arterial dilation, and slow and small venous distension. Their distinct dynamics can be well fitted by a linear convolution model, and can be further applied to separating the fast and slow components in global blood volume signals. To quantify the diameter changes of intracortical vessels more accurately than previous methods, we developed a novel algorithm \u2013 Thresholding in Radon Space (TiRS), which makes use of the global structure of the image. We found that surface arterioles and venules dilate significantly more than the intracortical branches. The reduced amplitude of intracortical vessel dilation is attributed to the mechanical restriction by brain tissue. Dural vessels, on the contrary, constrict during locomotion instead of dilating like pial vessels. Under drug-induced migraine condition, dural vessels but not pial vessels are dilated. We conclude that the mechanical properties of the brain may play an important role in sculpting the laminar differences of hemodynamic responses.

Here we report that several lamin network proteins and nuclear import components are involved in centrosomal attachment. Disruption of C. elegans lamin frequently resulted in a single detached centrosome, while the second centrosome remained associated with the nucleus. Disrupting lamin-binding proteins by RNAi co-depletion of emr-1 (emerin) and lem-2 (MAN-1) or by RNAi of baf-1 (BAF) resulted in an identical single detached centrosome phenotype. In addition, the same phenotype was observed in C. elegans nucleoporin NPP-6 or importin-depleted embryos as well. The localization of ZYG-12 and SUN-1 to the nuclear envelope was normal in all of these RNAi-treated embryos. We conclude that the reason for centrosomal detachment in lamina network proteins RNAi embryos may be different from that of ZYG-12- or SUN-1- depleted embryos.\nAll of the RNAi-treated embryos also show reduced nuclear size. We proposed that reduced nuclear size causes the single detached centrosome. We observed these RNAi embryos and wild-type as nuclear size increased during the cell cycle, a common event in pronuclear migration. As the cell cycle progresses, the detached centrosome was observed to frequently migrate to the sperm pronucleus and attach. This attachment occurred as the nuclei reached a reproducible size, suggesting a threshold of available nuclear surface area that is required for attachment.\nIn embryos fertilized with anucleated sperm, the normal size female pronucleus can hold two even three centrosomes. However, the small female pronucleus can only capture one centrosome and the other one only moved slightly toward the nucleus. We conclude that the attachment of centrosome to the nucleus depends on the interaction between the nuclear surface area and the microtubules. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6967], "author_name_tesi": "Gao, Zhizhen ", "last_name_ssi": "Gao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhizhen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose", "Christian Lorenzo Malone"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose, Thesis Advisor", "Christian Lorenzo Malone, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lamin-binding proteins", "Nuclear lamins", "Nuclear size", "Centrosome attachment", "Nuclear Pores"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "The role of vascular smooth muscle cells and adventitial fibroblasts in flow-mediated mechanisms of intimal hyperplasia and arterialization", "id": "6883", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3003", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) reside in the medial layer of blood vessels and under physiological conditions, maintain a quiescent phenotype through which they carry out their primary function: regulation of the systemic blood pressure via control of vessel dilation and contraction.  In regions of vascular injury, such as at the site of vessel repair by angioplasty and at the anastomoses of a vascular graft with the native artery, SMCs transform to a proliferative phenotype, resulting in abnormal proliferation in the media and subsequent migration to the intima.  The contribution of hemodynamics to the regulation of this intimal hyperplasia (IH; accumulation of cells and matrix in the intimal layer) has received considerable attention.  The conventional view of mechanical forces on SMCs is that due to the presence of the endothelium, SMCs are shielded from direct blood flow and its subsequent shear stress (SS) and are primarily exposed to circumferential stress and strain associated with the pulsatility of blood flow.  However, recent modeling studies have shown that medial SMCs in an intact vessel are subjected to physiologically relevant shear stresses through their exposure to transmural interstitial flow driven by the transmural pressure gradient (arterial pressure \u2013 tissue pressure) that are near the order of magnitude of those experienced by the endothelium due to luminal blood flow.  In fact, due to the funneling of transmural flow through the pores of the internal elastic lamina (IEL), the most superficial layer of SMCs is exposed to SS much greater in magnitude than the underlying layers.  This, accompanied by the fact that SMCs are directly subjected to blood flow SS in cases of vascular injury (endothelial denudation and IEL damage), necessitates an understanding of the role of SS in the control of SMC migration and proliferation.\n\n\nThere is considerable in vivo evidence suggesting that IH progression is attenuated in regions of elevated blood flow and, conversely, that IH is enhanced in low flow areas.  In vitro studies have supported this notion by reporting inhibition of SMC proliferation in response to SS, but similar studies to evaluate the role of SS on SMC migration have yet to be conducted.  We therefore seeded rat aortic SMCs on porous cell culture inserts coated with Matrigel (a representative basement membrane matrix) and quantified their migratory activity toward platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB when exposed to 1, 10, or 20 dyn/cm2 SS for 1-4 h with a rotating disk apparatus.\n\n\nFour h of either 10 or 20 dyn/cm2 SS significantly inhibited SMC migration through the Matrigel layer to the underside of the insert.  This inhibition was associated with downregulation of SMC matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 activation in response to SS.  Four h of 10 dyn/cm2 markedly increased the SMC production of nitric oxide (NO).  Addition of a NO synthase inhibitor (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester; 100 microM) to cells abolished the shear-mediated increase in NO production as well as the inhibition of SMC migration and MMP-2 activity.  Through the use of a NO donor (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; 500 microM), it was shown that NO acts to suppress SMC migration via the reduction of both total (proenzyme + active) and active MMP-2 levels.  Addition of 50 ng/ml exogenous active MMP-2 to inserts significantly elevated SMC migration levels whereas addition of 10 microM MMP-2 Inhibitor I to inserts significantly reduced SMC migration levels, lending further support to the role of MMP-2 in SMC migration.  Western blots showed no effect of 4 h of 20 dyn/cm2 SS on SMC production of PDGF-AA, another chemical known to suppress SMC migration.  Thus, it appears that SS inhibits SMC migration by upregulating the cellular production of NO which subsequently downregulates MMP-2 activity.  \n\n\nVascular fibroblasts (FBs) are primarily contained in the outer adventitial layer of blood vessels, which has historically been considered a supporting tissue.  Recent in vivo work, however, suggests that, along with SMCs, FBs also contribute to intimal lesion formation and that this involvement is at least in part mediated by their acquisition of the smooth muscle (SM)-specific phenotypic marker, SM alpha-actin, and differentiation to smooth muscle-like cells, the myofibroblasts (myoFBs).  FBs are sparsely populated in the adventitia and come into closer contact with other FBs and medial SMCs as they migrate to the intima following injury.  We hypothesize that the proximity of FBs to neighboring cells plays a role in modulating their conversion to myoFBs through the expression of SM alpha-actin.  As described above for SMCs, FBs are exposed to transmural interstitial flow (SS) driven by the transmural pressure gradient.   \n\n\nOther studies conducted on the microcirculatory level have shown that interstitial FBs are involved in the arterialization of capillaries that connect two high pressure arteriolar trees, allowing for improved regulation of local blood flow to tissues during processes such as exercise hypertrophy and wound healing.  The expression of SM alpha-actin by interstitial FBs as they approach the arterializing vessel and come into closer contact with neighboring cells suggests that the degree of confluence of FBs may affect their expression of SM-specific phenotypic markers.  The recruitment of FBs to arterializing vessels has been suggested to be regulated in part by local hemodynamic conditions, namely elevated circumferential stresses in the arterializing vessel due to elevated luminal pressure compared to surrounding capillaries.  We suggest that the elevated luminal pressure in the arterializing vessel drives enhanced interstitial flow that subjects nearby FBs to enhanced levels of fluid SS, and that this force directly recruits these cells to the vicinity of the vessel.\n\n\nThe involvement of FBs and myoFBs in physiologic and pathologic processes on both the macrocirculatory and microcirculatory levels accompanied by the lack of existing studies of the effects of mechanical and chemical stimulation on their function motivated the present study.  Rat adventitial FBs were isolated and maintained at either subconfluent (30-50% confluence in culture) or confluent (100% confluence in culture) culture conditions.  Both cell populations were analyzed for their expression of two SM-specific phenotype markers: SM alpha-actin and SM myosin heavy chain (MHC), a marker of mature, fully differentiated SMCs.  Cells maintained at subconfluent culture conditions expressed a modest amount of SM alpha-actin and virtually no SM-MHC whereas confluent cells expressed a large amount of SM alpha-actin and modest SM-MHC.  Based on these results, subconfluent cells were labeled \u201cfibroblasts\u201d and confluent cells were termed \u201cmyofibroblasts\u201d according to literature convention.  Each cell population was seeded on Matrigel-coated porous cell culture inserts in the presence of PDGF-BB and exposed to 4 h of 20 dyn/cm2 SS in experiments similar to those conducted using SMCs above.  The contractile responses of serum-starved FBs and myoFBs to an interstitial fluid solute (serum) were also determined.  In stark contrast to the SMC migratory response to SS and contractile response to serum, FBs enhanced their migration upon exposure to shear and did not contract when re-exposed to serum.  MyoFBs, on the other hand, displayed SM-like responses by inhibiting their migratory activity when exposed to SS and significantly contracting within 2 min of re-exposure to serum.  These data suggest that modulation of FB phenotype appears to be one way to regulate their involvement in both physiologic and pathologic processes.   \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2994], "author_name_tesi": "Garanich, Jeffrey Stock", "last_name_ssi": "Garanich", "middle_name_ssi": "Stock", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J Butler", "John Michael Tarbell", "Herbert Herling Lipowsky", "David A Antonetti", "Michael J Eppihimer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter J Butler, Committee Chair", "John Michael Tarbell, Committee Chair", "Herbert Herling Lipowsky, Committee Member", "David A Antonetti, Committee Member", "Michael J Eppihimer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vascular smooth muscle cells", "shear stress", "migration", "interstitial flow", "intimal hyperplasia", "nitric oxide", "matrix metalloproteinase-2", "platelet-derived growth factor", "adventitial fibroblasts", "myofibroblasts", "phenotype", "contraction", "arterialization"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Regulation of Reverse Cholesterol Transport by Micrornas and impact of Diet and Xenobiotics.

Factors that promote atherosclerosis typically involve perturbations of cholesterol and lipid homeostasis as well as a sustained chronic inflammation, ultimately leading to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Hence it is important to develop and improve interventions that slow the development of arterial lipid plaques. An endogenous physiological process that contributes to the reduction of cholesterol accumulation and reduces the progression of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is the Reverse Cholesterol Transport (RCT) pathway. RCT involves the removal of excess cholesterol from atherosclerotic plaques to be transported back to the liver and excreted as bile acids through the intestines. Numerous endogenous and exogenous factors regulate the RCT pathway.  In the in vitro and ex vivo studies presented herein, human macrophages, liver and intestinal cell lines were used as a model to study the effects of regulators of cholesterol uptake, transport and efflux. \nThe nuclear receptor Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) is a bile acid sensor that has gained considerable interest as a therapeutic target for the treatment of CVD. Agonists of FXR increase cholesterol efflux and impact gene expression in MDFC, liver and intestine. The expression of genes involved in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and bile acid production, as well as the expression of microRNAs (miRs) are affected by FXR. MicroRNAs are non-coding transcripts that regulate the expression of key metabolic genes, although their role in FXR-dependent cholesterol efflux was not known. In parallel studies we explored the miRs whose levels were affected by the FXR ligand GW4064 in THP-1 macrophage derived foam cell (MDFC) the effects of various miRs on cholesterol efflux was examined. Of the several miRs that were regulated by GW4064 and in turn influenced cholesterol efflux in vitro, miR-708 was chosen for further study.\n\tWhether the induction of miR-708 by GW4064 was causally related to enhanced cholesterol efflux was examined in several in vitro studies. Following miR-708 transfection and subsequent treatment with oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and GW4064 in MDFC, there was a significant decrease in nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) and interleukin 1 beta (Il-1\u03b2) gene expression, concomitant with an increase in cholesterol efflux. Ectopic expression of miR-708 repressed CD38 mRNA and protein levels in the in vitro models listed above. CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme that utilizes NAD+ in the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose and is involved in immune function and calcium signaling. Targeted knockdown of CD38 augmented expression of the metabolism regulator gene, Sirtuin-1 (Sirt-1) and enhanced cholesterol efflux. Our results suggest miR-708 affects cholesterol efflux, at least in part via its regulation of CD38, and is a beneficial microRNA in regards to its role in atherosclerosis and the reverse cholesterol transport pathway.\nDiets rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as docosahexanoic acid (DHA), are protective against CVD and increase cholesterol efflux and RCT. Multiple targets for DHA exist including nuclear receptors Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs) and FXR, which in turn affect cholesterol homeostasis via altered gene and miR expression. Serum samples from subjects participating in a postprandial feeding study were investigated for effects on cholesterol efflux and microRNA expression. In foam cells treated with postprandial serum samples ex vivo, the DHA-supplemented diet increased cholesterol efflux. The expression of mir-30, -33 and-181 was increased in serum of those individuals receiving the DHA-enriched diet, relative to their serum prior to intervention. In THP-1 MDFC, DHA increased the expression of mir-30 and mir-708, without affecting miR-33, -144 and -181. These observations stress the complexities of how PUFAs modulate cellular cholesterol homeostasis in vitro and ex vivo. Also, these studies identified certain miRs as potential biomarkers for PUFA activity and CVD risk \n\nThe model systems developed were used to explore the potential effects of xenobiotic exposure on the RCT pathway. Some cross-sectional epidemiology studies have suggested an association between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluoroctane sulphonate (PFOS) exposure with increased serum cholesterol levels. However, whether this linkage is causal is unclear, in part due to the lack of mechanistic understanding of this response and the absence of laboratory animal concordance. Since cholesterol homeostasis is dependent on multiple tissues, the present studies examined the effects of PFOA and PFOS on cholesterol transport and gene expression in model systems described above. Both PFOA and PFOS increased cholesterol efflux from THP-1 MDFC, Huh-7 and Caco-2 cells with no observable differenced in cholesterol uptake. Several genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis were examined in THP1, Huh7 and Caco-2. In THP1 cells, PFOS increased liver X receptor \u03b1 (LXR\u03b1) mRNA while Very Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (VLDLR) mRNA was increased by both PFOA and PFOS in Huh7 cells. There were no changes in mRNAs involved in cholesterol homeostasis in Caco-2 cells. Overall, these studies show that PFOA and PFOS have effects on cholesterol efflux but do not affect the uptake of cholesterol nor do they cause changes in the expression of cholesterol homeostatic genes consistent with the observed epidemiology associations, in these in vitro models systems.\n\nTaken together, the model systems and approaches developed herein were utilized to study the effects of several endogenous and exogenous factors on the RCT pathway. Of particular note is the FXR and DHA regulated miR-708, which exhibits anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and may be beneficial in the prevention and/or regression of coronary heart disease. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11477], "author_name_tesi": "Garban, Josephine A", "last_name_ssi": "Garban", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Josephine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Wendy Hanna Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Dissertation Advisor", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coronary Heart Disease", "Atherosclerosis", "Reverse Cholesterol Transport", "Cholesterol Efflux", "MicroRNAs", "DHA", "Xenobiotics", "PFOA", "PFOS"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Factors Influencing Student Engagement  in an Online Asynchronous Discussion Forum Measured by Quantity, Quality, Survey, and Social Network Analysis", "id": "14920alh245", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14920", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This iterative study examined factors that influence student engagement in an online asynchronous discussion forum (DF), which is a standard feature of most learning management systems (LMSs) and thus of most online courses at the university level.

More than 80% of the Western U.S. electric power system's total production for the year 2015 came from water-dependent generators (gas, coal, nuclear, and hydro). The potential for future droughts and high temperatures have lead the power sector to prepare to mitigate these effects. The purpose of this work is to explore the vulnerabilities of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) power system on water-dependent thermal generators (non-hydro). It is important to take into account that hydro power plants are not considered in this analysis as potential shut down generation, and I am only exploring the system vulnerability to thermal plants.

These approaches have been successful in exposing the large variety of physiological capabilities (enrichment cultures) and vast phylogenetic diversity (16S rRNA surveys) of the microbial world.  Yet they pose severe limitations to furthering our understanding of microbial diversity and to the discovery of microorganisms with novel physiologies.  Another approach, metagenomics, has emerged as a powerful tool to study community composition, physiological capabilities of microbial communities and to discover novel microorganisms.  A particularly fascinating group of microorganisms to study are the chlorophototrophs.  Chlorophototrophs use a membrane-embedded chlorophyll-protein complex called a reaction center to harvest light energy and transform it into chemical energy.  Prior to the work presented here there were five known different bacterial phyla that contained chlorophototrophs including the Cyanobacteria, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria.  These distinct groups vary in their reaction centers, accessory pigments and carbon metabolism among other properties.  Microbial mats in alkaline hot springs of Yellowstone National Park are dominated by chlorophototrophic microorganisms and provide an ideal setting for studying them.  The mats from two particular springs, Octopus and Mushroom Springs, have been the subject of over three decades of research and much is known about their geochemistry and microbial composition.  Two phyla of chlorophototrophs, the Cyanobacteria and the Chloroflexi reside in these low carbonate and low sulfide mats.  A metagenomic study conducted on these mats revealed the presence of a third type of chlorophototroph that had escaped detection by other approaches and that belongs to the phylum Acidobacteria, a phylum previously not known to contain chlorophototrophs.  An analysis of this metagenome predicted this new chlorophototroph, Candidatus Chloracidobacterium thermophilum, to have Type 1 reaction centers, the Fenna Matthew Olson protein and chlorosome antenna structures, properties also found in the chlorophototrophic Chlorobi.  Unlike the Chlorobi, however, Cab. thermophilum was predicted to be an aerobe. The present work describes the isolation in culture of this new chlorophototroph and its initial characterization. An enriched culture of Cab. thermophilum has been generated from a cyanobacterial enrichment culture cultivated from the mats of Octopus Spring that contained Cab. thermophilum as a minor component.  Like other Acidobacteria, Cab. thermophilum is difficult to culture and has  long generation times and fastidious growth requirements.  In addition, the culture contains heterotrophic microorganisms that seem to be providing some unidentified essential growth factor.  Physiological studies of this culture have confirmed the metagenomic predictions that Cab. thermophilum is an aerobic chlorophototroph that synthesizes chlorosomes as antenna pigments.  In order to further understand the physiology of Cab. thermophilum its genome has been sequenced.  It consists of two chromosomes, both of which harbor essential genes.  The genome contains all of the genes required for phototrophy with chlorosomes as antenna structures but lacks key genes in all of the known carbon fixation pathways, as well as genes for assimilatory nitrate and sulfate reduction. In addition, it lacks the biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of the amino acids valine, isoleucine and leucine. These genomic analyses clearly define Cab. thermophilum as a chlorophotoheterotroph that is dependent on other members of the mat community for essential nutrients.  The structure of the chlorosome antenna complex of Cab. thermophilum has been investigated and its protein, lipid, quinone and pigment composition elucidated.  These chlorosomes, although from an aerobe, resemble those of the other green bacteria in their general shape and in the presence of CsmA and CsmI-like proteins.  However, they contain additional unique proteins and lipids.  Moreover, the presence of the xanthophylls echinenone and canthaxanthin reflects the aerobic environment from which Cab. thermophilum was isolated.  Like the chlorophototrophic Chlorobi, Cab. thermophilum synthesizes three types of chlorophylls, bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) c, chlorophyll (Chl) a and BChl a.  High performance liquid chromatography analyses combined with mass spectrometry have revealed that Cab. thermophilum methylates its BChl c at the C-8 and C-12 positions and that its C-17 propionic group is esterified with a variety of isoprenoid and straight alkane moieties.  The most abundant BChl c species, especially at high light intensities has been elucidated to be [8-iBu, 12-Et]-BChl c esterified with the unbranched C-18 alcohol, octadecanol.  Interestingly, although Cab. thermophilum is an aerobe, its BChls exhibit redox-dependent quenching of fluorescence emission.  Lastly, carotenoid biosynthesis in Cab. thermophilum has been investigated.  Three genes predicted to code for a lycopene cyclase, a ketolase, respectively, and a hydroxylase have been expressed heterologously and their enzymatic activity confirmed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [266], "author_name_tesi": "Garcia Costas, Amaya Maria", "last_name_ssi": "Garcia Costas", "middle_name_ssi": "Maria", "first_name_ssi": "Amaya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Bryant", "Donald Ashley Bryant", "Jean Elnora Brenchley", "John H Golbeck", "Dr Stephan Schuster", "Jennifer Macalady"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Bryant, Dissertation Advisor", "Donald Ashley Bryant, Committee Chair", "Jean Elnora Brenchley, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member", "Dr Stephan Schuster, Committee Member", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phototroph", "thermophile", "chlorosome", "acidobacteria", "alkaline hot spring", "carotenoid"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Streamflow Response to Land-cover Change in Southern Mexico: Projections of Water Balance in the Tulija River Watershed", "id": "26642", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11315", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vegetation plays a crucial part in the water distribution within watersheds, as the type and extension of land cover influences the interaction of complex spatio-temporal hydrologic processes.

Sounding too formal or informal for a given situation can have social ramifications as well as effects on comprehensibility. This dissertation investigates, through the lens of word duration, how L2 German speakers produce the different speech styles of read and conversational speech. Additional included factors that moderate word duration are word frequency, word class, and second mention (i.e., where the second mention of a word is produced with a shorter duration than the first mention of the word). In order to determine how these discourse-level factors affected L2 speech, 17 advanced L1 English-L2 German speakers and 17 L1 German speakers read two page-length stories aloud and completed a conversational speech appointment-making task with a native-speaking confederate. Recordings of these two speech styles were transcribed and target words were measured for word duration. The duration variables listed above, fluency variables, such as speech rate, and learner variables, such as the number of years of instruction, were submitted to a linear mixed model. In read speech, both the L1 German and the L1 English-L2 German speakers\u2019 word durations were affected by word type, word frequency, and second mention, with the L1 English-L2 German speakers having a greater second mention effect with content words than function words. In conversational speech, both L1 German speakers and L1 English-L2 German speakers had significant effects of word frequency and word type. Second mention affected word duration for the L1 German speakers and approached significance for the L1 Englsh-L2 German speakers. However, the L1 German speakers had a greater second mention effect with function words than content words, which was unexpected. The L1 English-L2 German speakers reduced function words in a native-like manner and produced a greater second mention effect in content words than function words, demonstrating that advanced L2 learners can successfully use discourse-specific cues in a native-like manner. The results also showed that the speech produced by L1 English-L2 German speakers exhibited frequency effects, pointing to similar frequency representations for native and non-native speakers. In addition, the results of this dissertation indicate that advanced L2 speakers do produce read and conversational speech differently, making it evident that research on L2 speech should not solely rely on read speech data. Together, these findings indicate that it is possible for L2 learners to reach a proficiency level where they can produce differences between speech styles in many of the same ways as L1 speakers.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11738], "author_name_tesi": "Gardner, Christine Elaine", "last_name_ssi": "Gardner", "middle_name_ssi": "Elaine", "first_name_ssi": "Christine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carrie Neal Jackson", "Carrie Neal Jackson", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Michael Travis Putnam", "John Lipski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carrie Neal Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "Carrie Neal Jackson, Committee Chair", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member", "Michael Travis Putnam, Committee Member", "John Lipski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["German", "Read Speech", "Conversational Speech", "Word Duration", "Speech Style", "Second Language Acquisition", "Second Mention"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Northern Goshawk Habitat Suitability and Monitoring Plan", "id": "9945ieg5002", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9945", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) is an umbrella species of large mature forests in the northeastern United States and has recently shown a breeding population decline. It has been declared \u201cVulnerable\u201d in Pennsylvania, \u201cCritically Imperiled\u201d in West Virginia and Maryland, and \u201cExtirpated\u201d in Virginia. While much of the natural history and habitat preferences of this species is known, the breeding distribution and regional population size is not. I identified two objectives to determine those unknowns: 1) Create a habitat suitability model for Northern Goshawk in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, and Virginia; 2) Develop a monitoring plan and define conservation guidelines for Northern Goshawk in the region. The entire study is based on a 600-hectare grid network of sampling units that was overlain on the region. Confirmed nest locations from 1980 to 2013 were compiled. Sampling units that intersected a 600-hectare buffer around the nest points were categorized as being occupied (1) and all others as unoccupied (0). A habitat envelope was created to constrain the study to only potential habitat using a threshold of 40% forest canopy cover. Sampling units with an average canopy cover less than 40% were labeled as non-habitat and removed from the analysis. The following predictor covariates were averaged for each sampling unit: canopy bulk density , canopy height , canopy cover, dominant forest group, edge/core forest proportion, elevation, slope, annual precipitation, maximum temperature. These covariates represent forest habitat, topography, and climate parameters. Because the study area is so large, it was divided by level III ecoregions and tested using a Multiple Comparisons of Means Tukey Test to compare habitat preferences of goshawks in each ecoregion. Northern Goshawk habitat preferences for elevation, slope, annual precipitation, and maximum temperature were all significantly different between each ecoregion and substantiated splitting the study area into three ecoregions: Allegheny Plateau, Central Appalachians, and Ridge and Valley. Habitat suitability models for each ecoregion were then calculated using logistic regression between sampling unit occupation (1,0) and habitat covariates (forest, topography, and climate covariates). The top models were selected for each ecoregion by using AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) weights. The top Allegheny Plateau ecoregion model equation suggested Northern Goshawks prefer habitats with higher canopy bulk density (above-ground tree biomass), canopy cover, canopy height, and mean annual precipitation, a dominance of Northern hardwood tree species (maple/beech/birch forest group), lower elevation, slope, and mean temperature during breeding season, and less edge habitat based on significant covariates. The top Central Appalachians ecoregion model equation suggested Northern Goshawks prefer habitats with high canopy cover, elevation, and mean annual precipitation, a dominance of Northern hardwood tree species, and lower canopy bulk density, slope, and mean temperature during breeding season. The top Ridge and Valley ecoregion model equation suggested Northern Goshawks prefer habitats with higher canopy bulk density, canopy height, mean annual precipitation, a dominance of Northern hardwood tree species, and lower elevation, slope, and mean temperature during breeding season. Sampling units for each ecoregion were then ranked as primary or secondary using predicted probabilities. Much of the primary habitat coincided with state and federal land, which is generally managed as contiguous mature forest. Logistic regression should be used to revise the habitat suitability models every five years and include new occupation and habitat covariate data when available. \nA limited field season was used to test the breeding Northern Goshawk survey protocols established by Hargis and Woodbridge (2006). Playback-based field surveys were conducted in the Allegheny Plateau (Allegheny National Forest) and Ridge and Valley ecoregion (Rothrock, Moshannon, and Bald Eagle State Forests). Ten primary and ten secondary sampling units were randomly selected in each ecoregion within the public land boundaries. Surveys were conducted during the nestling (mid-May to mid-June) and fledgling (mid-June to mid-July) phases of goshawk development. 120 playback points were uniformly distributed along transects 250 meters apart in each sampling unit. Three-minute playbacks of goshawk territorial vocalizations were broadcast at each point. Due to poor weather and a limited number of surveyors, only 5 primary and 4 secondary sampling units were surveyed in Allegheny Plateau, and 7 primary and 6 secondary sampling units were surveyed in Ridge and Valley ecoregion. Surveys were only conducted once per sampling unit. Two Northern Goshawks were detected for 246 work-hours in the Allegheny Plateau surveys. One Northern Goshawk was detected for 393 work-hours in the Ridge and Valley surveys. Therefore, one goshawk was detected for every 213 work-hours within 22 sampling units surveyed. Because only one survey was conducted at each sampling unit, population estimates could not be calculated. Our limited surveys were constrained by lack of funding to employ additional survey personnel. To maximize use of funds and decrease the work-hours involved in detecting goshawks, a reduced protocol using 60 playbacks per sampling unit could be implemented. Simply reducing the number of playback points by half will drop the estimated 24-32 work-hours per sampling unit by three hours. \nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission, U.S. Forest Service, PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and MD Department of Natural Resources should use the following set of conservation guidelines for monitoring and conserving Northern Goshawk potential and established breeding habitat: 1) Revise the Habitat Suitability Model for the four-state region every 5 years using logistic regression with latest Northern Goshawk occurrences and any more accurate habitat parameters. 2) By 2026, targeted surveys should be conducted on public land with a concentration of primary sampling units and potential threats of forest fragmentation, such as those identified in Figure 13 for north central Pennsylvania. 3) Conduct further research on Broadcast Acoustical Survey protocol to determine if revised survey of reduced playback points is effective for determining frequency of occupation in sampling units. 4) Establish two concentric buffer zones around active or presumed active (within 10 years of activity) nest trees. No disturbances should be permitted within the 300-meter radius of the first buffer zone. Only limited disturbances, such as low-impact silvicultural practices, should be permitted within the 800-meter radius of the second buffer zone. Disturbances should be isolated to the non-breeding season (October \u2013 February).\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13507], "author_name_tesi": "Gardner, Ian Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Gardner", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Ian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Doug Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Doug Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Northern Goshawk", "Habitat Suitability Model", "Monitoring Plan"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Ultrasonic Guided Wave Nondestructive Evaluation Using Generalized Anisotropic Interface Waves", "id": "20035", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9584", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The motivation for this work is a goal to inspect interfaces between thick layers of materials that can be anisotropic.  The specific application is a thick composite bonded to a metal substrate.  The interface is inspected for disbonds between the metal and composite.  The large thickness allows the problem to be modeled as a half space.  The theory behind guided waves in plates is presented.  This theory includes the calculation and analysis of dispersion curves and the resulting wave structure.  It is noted that for high frequency-thickness values, certain modes will converge to the half-space waves, e.g. the Rayleigh wave and the Stoneley wave.  Points of high energy, especially shear energy, at the interface are desirable for interfacial inspection.  Therefore, the wave structure for all modes and frequencies is searched for ideal inspection points.  Interface waves are inherently good modes to use for interface inspection.  Results from the dispersion curves and wave structures are verified in the finite element model software package called Abaqus.  It is confirmed that the group speeds and wave structures of the modes match the predicted values.  \n\nA theoretical development of interface waves is given wherein Rayleigh, Stoneley, and generalized interface waves are discussed.  This is applied to both isotropic and anisotropic materials.  It is shown that the Stoneley wave only exists for a certain range of material parameters.  Because the Stoneley wave is the interface wave between two solid half spaces, it might appear that only certain pairs of solids would allow for inspection via interface wave.  However, it is shown that for perturbations of the Stoneley-wave-valid material properties, interface waves which leak energy away from the interface can still propagate.  They can also be used for inspection.  Certain choices of materials will leak less energy and will therefore allow for longer inspection distances.  The solutions to the isotropic leaky wave problem exist on eight different Riemann sheets which allow one to confine multi-valued functions such as the square root onto these single-valued Riemann sheets.  The ranges of existence for three of these sheets is presented along with the values of the complex wave speed.  The three types of interface waves are Rayleigh-like, Stoneley, and interface.  For anisotropic materials, the solutions to the anisotropic leaky wave problem exist on thirty-two different sheets and the possibility of all three displacement components being coupled exists.  The predicted values of sound speed and absorption for the leaky waves are confirmed by way of a finite element simulation.  The wave structure for leaky waves grows in amplitude away from the boundary in any half space where leaked energy is allowed.  The leaked partial waves are visualized via a snapshot of a finite element animation.\n  \nA discussion of composite materials is given. Classical lamination theory is presented as well as the cube-cutting procedure for elastic constant determination.  The composite used in this research is cut into cubes and measured; the results are presented.  Physical experiments were performed on two specimens.  The same unidirectional composite was bonded to both aluminum and nickel-aluminum-bronze.  Mylar inserts were placed before bonding to simulate a debonding type defect.  A phased array comb  transducer was used to inspect the parts with varying time delays and frequencies in a mode-sweep technique to account for uncertainty in the material parameters and bonding conditions.  The 1-direction (fiber-direction) results were predicted to be better than the 2-direction results because of the lower leakage and higher in-plane energy at the interface for the 1 direction.  These predictions were confirmed in the experiment.  These results were also found to be repeatable.  An immersion scan was also performed on the aluminum part wherein the leaked energy was detected as it leaked into the water.  Results showed that the 1-direction results were superior to the 2-direction results at detecting the defect.  Measurement of the complex sound speed for the interface wave in the aluminum part was made.  Results were within an acceptable range of predictions.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9351], "author_name_tesi": "Gardner, Michael D", "last_name_ssi": "Gardner", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Kevin L Koudela"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Dissertation Advisor", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Kevin L Koudela, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ultrasonic", "Guided Wave", "Nondestructive Evaluation", "Anisotropic", "Interface", "Acoustics"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Effects of Video-based Instruction Using Graduated Guidance on Daily Living Skill Acquisition for Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder", "id": "23353", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10506", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Being able to perform life skills with independence plays a critical role in the successful inclusion of individuals with autism spectrum disorders in the community and workplace environments.

In this situation, an overall approach for optimal operation and control of power units becomes of paramount relevance for the survival of utilities competing under liberalized generation markets. In response to these circumstances, this dissertation contributes a methodology to design a generalized overall unit control system for a fossil fuel power unit (FFPU), and develops a minimum prototype to demonstrate its feasibility.\nToward the above goal, the associated research project was undertaken as a technology innovation process with its two ends identified as follows. First, it is recognized that the coordinated control strategies constitute the uppermost control level in current FFPUs, and so, are responsible for driving the boiler-turbine-generator set as a single entity. Second, a FFPU is envisioned as a complex process, subject to multiple changing operating conditions, that should perform as an intelligent system, for which an advanced integral control concept is needed. Therefore, as an outcome of the innovation process, a generalized unit control concept that extends the capabilities of current coordinated control schemes is proposed. This concept is presented as the Intelligent Coordinated Control System (ICCS) paradigm, which establishes an open reference framework for the development of overall unit control schemes. \nThe ICCS realizes a multi-agent system for which a multidisciplinary approach, that amalgamates control, process, and software engineering concepts, is established for its design. The ICCS's system goals are identified using power plant process engineering concepts, and intelligent control systems engineering concepts are used to identify main tasks and to achieve system functional decomposition. A software engineering agency concept is used to identify and group agents according to their knowledge and purpose interactions. The resultant ICCS structure is an open set of functionally grouped agent clusters in a two-level hierarchical system. The upper level, mainly characterized for knowledge-driven processes, performs the supervisory functions needed to provide self-governing operation characteristics, while the lower level, mainly characterized for data-driven processes, performs the fast reactive behavior functions necessary for hybrid real-time control and protection. \nThe Minimum Prototype of the Intelligent Coordinated Control System (ICCS-MP) comprehends a minimum set of functions needed by the power unit to participate in the total automation of power systems. Basically, the ICCS-MP provides the means to achieve optimized wide-range cyclic operation, by being able to follow any given unit load demand profile issued by upper level economic dispatch and unit commitment agents, and to optimally accommodate an arbitrary number of generally conflicting operating objectives.\nDeveloped through several stages, the ICCS-MP finally implements a two-level hierarchical intelligent hybrid multi-agent coordinated control system. The supervisory functions include optimization and command generation, learning and control tuning, and performance and state monitoring. The direct level consist of a multivariable feedforward and feedback control scheme. The implementation core of the system is formed by three modules: reference governor, feedforward control processor, and feedback control processor. The performance and state monitoring, and learning and control tuning functions can be executed either under demand in an off-line basis or are implicitly included in the main modules.\nThe reference governor generates set-point trajectories for the lower level control loops by solving a multiobjective optimization problem, for which the objective functions and their priorities can be set arbitrarily, in number and form. This approach allows for process optimization, and provides a way to specify the operating policy to accommodate a great diversity of operating scenarios. The proposed feedforward-feedback control scheme is an extension of the general linear single-input-single-output feedback control scheme, with both reference feedforward and disturbance feedforward actions, to the nonlinear multivariable case. The feedforward control processor is implemented using a set of multi-input-single-output fuzzy inference systems designed from plant input-output data using a neural network paradigm. This approach provides the control system with off-line learning capabilities to attain process optimization under changing operating conditions. The feedback control path is implemented as a PID-based decentralized (multiloop) control scheme with a loop interaction compensator. The compensator is equivalent to a disturbance feedforward compensator and is designed using the relative gain array technique. Both the control algorithms and the compensator are first order Sugeno-type fuzzy inference systems, scheduled in two dimensions (power and pressure) to achieve satisfactory disturbance rejection and uncertainty compensation during wide-range operation. The process operating window is partitioned to take into account the process nonlinear characteristics, and tuning is carried out by a genetic algorithm at the points of interest in the partitions.\nThe performance of the ICCS-MP is demonstrated through simulation experiments. Results show the feasibility of the proposed ICCS paradigm. An open purposeful self-governing overall unit control system for a FFPU can be systematically designed, built and upgraded to effectively satisfy arbitrary operation conditions. Remarkably, the ICCS paradigm provides a convenient conceptual framework such that the integration of applications can be carried out making use of the best characteristics that either algorithmic or heuristic techniques have to offer, while keeping large system complexity manageable.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5387], "author_name_tesi": "Garduno-Ramirez, Raul ", "last_name_ssi": "Garduno-Ramirez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Raul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mario Sznaier", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Robert M Edwards", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Kwang Yun Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mario Sznaier, Committee Member", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Member", "Robert M Edwards, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member", "Kwang Yun Lee, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["INTELLIGENT HYBRID SYSTEMS", "OVERALL CONTROL", "POWE PLANTS"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Zeta Potentials and Mineral Replacement at Surfaces in Saturated Salt Solutions", "id": "14122azg191", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14122", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Surfaces, fixed or mobile, exposed to salt solutions interact with the solution and with other surfaces through physical interactions, chemical reactions and transport.

However, their behavior is not adequately understood, especially from a colloidal and surface chemistry perspective. The complexity of interactions under saturated salt conditions and experimental difficulties in carrying out certain measurements have contributed to our limited understanding in this regard. The subject of this thesis is to characterize and transform the nature of surfaces exposed to saturated salt solutions through an in-depth understanding of the surface charge, fluid transport and dissolution-precipitation phenomena in these systems. \n\nThe work presented here is conceptually focused on two subjects \u2013 zeta potential and mineral replacement.

These SiNWs are typically synthesized using the gold-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth mechanism. However, for SiNW device fabrication, a number of post-growth processing steps are required, such as collecting/harvesting the nanowires from the growth substrate, transferring them and manipulating/assembling the nanowires on another substrate for device fabrication.  As a result, such \u2018grow-and-place\u2019 approaches to SiNW device fabrication typically suffer from low yields, contamination issues, and overall complexity of the process.\n   The nano-tunnel template \u2018grow-in-place\u2019 approach recently demonstrated by our group provides a unique and very convenient methodology for SiNW synthesis and nanowire device fabrication. In this approach, a nano-tunnel template guides the nanowire growth and provides control on the dimensions and position of the nanowire, thereby eliminating the need for any post-growth nanowire manipulation/assembly steps. Two different versions of the nano-tunnel template approach were investigated in this study, one in which the nanowires are allowed to grow without any confinement outside the template (i.e. the extruded SiNW growth approach) and the other in which the nanowires are allowed to grown confined inside the template (i.e. the encapsulated SiNW growth approach). This study investigates the basic electrical properties of the nanowires and/or the nanowire devices fabricated using these grow-in-place approaches.\n   The extruded SiNW approach, while not allowing us precise control on nanowire dimension and position, is well suited for investigating the basic electrical properties of VLS-grown SiNWs. We have used this approach to characterize the resistivity of VLS-grown SiNWs, and have identified how the presence of residual gold catalyst incorporated into the nanowire can lead to the observed \u2018unintentional\u2019 p-type doping in the gold-catalyzed VLS-grown SiNWs. The extruded SiNW approach was also used to further explore accumulation-mode (AMOSFET) devices. The impact of source/drain contact resistance, as well as influence of annealing on AMOSFET transfer characteristics has been investigated. The properties (ION/IOFF ratios, subthreshold swing) of AMOSFETs fabricated in this study were found to be comparable with the best reported values for SiNW FETs in literature. AMOSFETs were also fabricated on intentionally doped SiNWs in an attempt to improve AMOSFET performance; however, these devices exhibited very poor transfer characteristics. Reasons for this observation and possible solutions are discussed in this work. \n   The encapsulated SiNW approach was explored in this study as a means to synthesize arrays of SiNWs with precise control on dimensions and position of the nanowires, and fabricated devices on them. While we succeeded in synthesizing arrays of precisely controlled SiNWs, the devices fabricated on encapsulated SiNWs exhibited very poor transfer characteristics due to the very high resistance of the encapsulated SiNWs. Moreover, the surface of the encapsulated SiNWs was found to be very rough, and presence of voids/pores was also observed in some SiNWs. Some possible solutions to these issues are discussed in this work.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4975], "author_name_tesi": "Garg, Pranav ", "last_name_ssi": "Garg", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pranav", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash", "Stephen Joseph Fonash", "Dr Sanjay Joshi", "Samia A Suliman", "Jun Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Joseph Fonash, Committee Chair", "Dr Sanjay Joshi, Committee Member", "Samia A Suliman, Committee Member", "Jun Huang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["VLS growth", "Silicon nanowires", "unintentional doping", "AMOSFETs"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Optimizing Storage System Power and Performance\n", "id": "11990", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5441", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The quest of building bigger and better computing systems has resulted in tremendous growth in the size of the storage systems.

Axonal injury is a type of mechanism of traumatic brain injury primarily characterized by damage to the axons.  Enhanced understanding of the axonal deformation during a mechanical impact may facilitate a better understanding of the short and long-term sequela. The objective of this dissertation is to develop, validate and employ a multiscale model of the axonal fiber tracts that simulates the white matter of the brain and can be used to investigate the evolution of axonal damage under injurious loading conditions. An axonal fiber tract consists of hundreds or thousands of axons aligned together, which can experience mechanical deformation under a non-physiological loading such as impact and blast loading. To model axonal injury, we developed a new embedded element based head model using an explicit description of the diffusion tensor magnetic resonance tractography. This approach enables us to resolve the complex mechanical response of the axonal fibers during injurious loading conditions. The most promising aspect of this modeling approach is the capability of modeling the fiber tracts explicitly in a traditional finite element head model. This model was validated against experimental results followed by an in-depth finite element analysis. Upon subjecting to impact and blast loading conditions, the model revealed some new insights into the evolution of the axonal injury. The model was subsequently improved in terms of anatomical resolution and material complexity. We have also made theoretical improvements to the embedded element technique and developed an open source finite element library in this direction.

Accommodation, which describes the ability of a user to fit or use a device or environment in a preferred way, is a key measure of the performance of many devices. Methods that offer a better understanding of accommodation of broad user populations would allow for the design of products that are more cost-effective, safer, and/or lead to greater levels of customer satisfaction. Target user populations are often characterized by measures of anthropometry, or body dimensions. A methodology is proposed that makes extensive use of visual tools for understanding and exploring accommodation across the variability in anthropometry of a target user population. Two demonstration studies are presented that illustrate the methodology and provide opportunity for discussion of its impact. The first study investigates the simple univariate problem of dimensionally optimizing the seat height and range of adjustability of an exercise cycle. The second study investigates the more complex problem of optimally configuring the driver package of a commercial truck. Data from a 2001 study investigating the posture of commercial truck drivers is considered in this second demonstration study. The principal contributions of this research are methods for: (1) assessing binary accommodation of individuals using a \"virtual fit\" methodology, (2) evaluating the probability of accommodation for individuals, and (3) examining trends in the probability of accommodation across the range of anthropometric variability.

The objective of this work is to investigate the current state of affairs in these areas, propose new or improved methods and tools where appropriate, and evaluate these tools.\n\nThe multivariate nature of typical problems involving body size and shape\u2014also called anthropometry\u2014makes it difficult to precisely configure a product that meets\u2028the needs of a target population of users. As a result, designers may overestimate the robustness of their designs, and many users may be unintentionally excluded by design limitations in some way. This has implications for the safety and comfort of the users, and manufacturers may experience decreased market share and profits as well as regulatory violations for failing to properly consider the spatial requirements of the users of their products. Three objectives/broad impacts of the research are: (1) understand challenges facing appropriate application of anthropometry for design, (2) determine effective alternatives to traditional methods of designing for body size and shape, and (3) develop recommendations that capitalize on the findings for effective alternatives.\n\nTo support the three broad impacts, four areas of activity were explored for the research: (1) assessment of human factors/ergonomics (HF/E) education by sampling available course syllabi for courses addressing physical ergonomics in the U.S., (2) assessment of industrial application of practices for designing for user body size and shape via conversations with industrial practitioners in the United States and the Republic of Ireland, (3) experimental evaluation of new representations and tools for visualizing and interacting with multivariate anthropometric data with participants acting as \u201cdesigners\u201d, and (4) implementation of the findings in practical recommendations and a prototype mobile application.\n\nSeveral key results follow from the four areas of research activity, and a few of them are highlighted here. The course syllabi survey showed that anthropometry is covered in the vast majority of courses, but receives an average of only 9% (1.6 days) of lecture time. Most course texts\u2019 treatment of anthropometry indicates that students are not provided with adequate tools to properly design for body size due to inappropriate, insufficient, or outdated anthropometric data. The survey of ergonomics practitioners showed that designing for the industry-standard 5th-95th percentile accommodation is a common goal among ergonomics specialists. The survey also showed that both specialists and general design practitioners make use of the traditional Dreyfuss templates (e.g., Measure of Man) despite important limitations on their use. Awareness of principles and tools for designing for body size was the greatest challenge identified by respondents, along with availability of reliable anthropometric data.\n\nTwo experimental web-based evaluations of representations showed, among other findings, that employing interactivity in tools for designing for human variability enhanced subjective measures of tool performance, representative humanoid glyphs are insightful and need not be intricate to be effective, and familiar and well-laid-out figures provide the most benefit for designers considering body size. These results are combined with best practices for designing for human variability to develop a set of recommendations and a prototype mobile application for designing for anthropometry.\n\nThe impact of the work is far-reaching\u2014offering guidance for developing improved tools for designers, improved comfort and safety for users, and enhanced profit and easier regulatory compliance for manufacturers. The research may find application for a wide variety of products, from cars and aircraft to workstations and hand tools. The research is also relevant to a broad audience, from students and practitioners to architects and product designers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7216], "author_name_tesi": "Garneau, Christopher John", "last_name_ssi": "Garneau", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew B Parkinson", "Timothy William Simpson", "Ling Rothrock", "Samuel Todd Hunter", "John F Lockett, Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew B Parkinson, Dissertation Advisor", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Samuel Todd Hunter, Committee Member", "John F Lockett, Iii, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["anthropometry", "design for human variability", "ergonomics", "universal design"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Spatio-temporal Dynamics of a Multiple Predator-Single Prey System", "id": "6564", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1373", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although numerous examples exist of intra-guild dietary separation among co-existing species, studies of spatio-temporal niche partitioning among species sharing a single food resource are rare. I investigated spatio-temporal patterns of multi-species predation on moose (Alces alces) calves in an Alaskan boreal forest community where moose are the only large herbivore, and constitute the primary prey of co-existing black bears (Ursus americanus), brown bears (Ursus arctos), and gray wolves (Canis lupus). The two most closely related predators, black bears, and brown bears, overlapped temporally but segregated spatially in their consumption of moose calves. Moreover, both bear species segregated spatially and temporally from wolves when killing moose calves. In addition, I recorded the movement patterns of 20 GPS-collared black bears from den emergence to onset of moose parturition in 2003. Over approximately 3 weeks prior to parturition, results from average distance calculations suggest that black bears moved closer to probable moose calving-site habitat. Likewise, the average proportion of seasonal habitat use by black bears surrounding dens reflected the same trend for areas where cow moose gave birth in spring 2003, with a propensity to use needleleaf forest more than any other habitat. The objective of my final study was to document habitat use of GPS-collared black bears during peak and non-peak seasons of black bear-induced and brown bear-induced moose calf mortality within southwestern interior Alaska, in spring 2002. Results from this study suggest that GPS-collared black bears use the same habitat as conspecifics more often than expected during the peak period of predation on moose calves by black bears, whereas GPS-collared black bears use habitat as it is available during the peak period of predation on moose calves by brown bears. GPS-collared black bears have a tendency to use mixed-deciduous forest and needleleaf forest less than expected as compared to that of black bears and brown bears during non-peak portions of the season of predation.

Decision-makers rely on air\nquality forecasts to produce informed decisions that reduce the emission of and exposure to\npollution. In these decision scenarios, air quality forecasts provide value of information. To increase the value of air quality forecasts in the mid-Atlantic region, an ensemble statistical post-processor (ESP) is designed. An analysis of the current value of information provided by air quality forecasts establishes a baseline to which the forecast using the ESP is compared. Air quality forecasts produced by the National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC), human air quality forecasters, and persistence are evaluated for predictive skill and economic value when used to inform decisions regarding pollutant emission and exposure. Surface ozone forecasts and observations are collected from 40 monitors representing eight forecast regions throughout Washington D.C., Virginia, and Maryland over the 2005 - 2009 ozone seasons (April - October). The value of the forecasts are quantified using a decision model based on costs to protect the public against a poor air quality event and the losses incurred if no protective measures are taken. The results indicate that the most skillful forecast method is not necessarily the most valuable forecast method. Air shed managers need to consider multiple forecast methods when deciding on multiple protective measures, because a single measure of forecast skill can often hide the user's sensitivity to forecast error for a specific decision. \nSecond, the next-generation numerical air quality model is assessed for value of information to determine a goal for the ensemble statistical post-processor. The NAQFC and an experimental version of the NAQFC (NAQFC-beta) provided flight decision support during the July 2011 NASA DISCOVER-AQ \ffield campaign around Baltimore, Maryland. Ozone forecasts from the NAQFC and NAQFC-beta\f are compared to surface observations at six air quality monitoring stations in the DISCOVER-AQ domain. A bootstrap algorithm is used to test for \fsignificant bias and error in the forecasts from each model. The NAQFC-\fbeta tends to produce an average background ozone mixing ratio of at least 3.51 ppbv greater than the NAQFC throughout the domain at 95% significance. The difference between the two models is significant during the overnight and early morning hours likely due to the way the Carbon Bond 5 mechanism in the NAQFC-beta\f handles reactive nitrogen recycling and organic peroxide species. The value of information each model provides is tested using a static cost-loss ratio model. By standard measures of forecast skill, the NAQFC generally outperforms the NAQFC-beta\f; however, the NAQFC-beta\f provides greater value of information. Five of the six sites exhibit an increase of value between 20% - 70% at low cost-loss ratios when using the NAQFC-beta\f. The NAQFC generally produces equal or greater value for higher cost-loss ratio decisions. \nFinally, the ESP is developed for the NAQFC to address the unique challenges of forecasting surface ozone in Baltimore, MD. Ozone and meteorological data are collected from the eight monitors that constitute the Baltimore forecast region. These data are used to build the ESP using a moving-block bootstrap, regression tree models, and extreme-value theory. The ESP is evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation to avoid evaluation with the same data used in the development process. Results indicate that the ESP is conditionally biased, likely due to slight over\ffitting while training the regression tree models. When viewed from the perspective of a decision-maker, the ESP provides a wealth of additional information previously not available through the NAQFC alone. The user is provided the freedom to tailor the forecast to the decision at hand by using decision-specific probability thresholds that define a forecast for an ozone exceedance.

The findings show that executive appointees have significantly higher levels of perceived autonomy to interact within the policy community, frequency of interaction with policy community members and involvement within the stages of the policy cycle than SMS members.

Out of that perspective developed the operationalization of competencies that counselor should have for providing effective multicultural counseling to clients from diverse backgrounds.\nAlthough empirical evidence indicates that the racial attitudes of counselors might also affect the services that they provide to clients, the focus of research has remained on counselors\u2019 multicultural counseling competencies and the multicultural courses through which they are intended to be acquired primarily. This study focuses instead on counselor training programs and racial attitudes. Specifically, the purpose is to investigate whether there is a relationship between the racial attitudes of counselors-in-training and the amount of credit hours they have taken in their counseling programs.\nA cross-sectional research design will be used to investigate the relationship between racial attitudes and amount of credit hours taken. Scores obtained on the Quick Discrimination Index by counselor trainees at the master\u2019s level will serve as the criterion (dependent) variable while amount of credit hours will be the predictor (independent) variable. A questionnaire specifically constructed for this study will collect data related to demographics and the coursework that participating counselor trainees have taken. \nInasmuch as racial attitudes are influenced by personal and social variables, the investigation will account for the effect of the independent variables of age, gender, race/ethnicity, exposure to multicultural/diversity courses or workshops, and amount of experience as a practitioner. Furthermore, seeing that some counseling programs are accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) while others are not, the study also includes accreditation as an independent variable.\nIt is expected that results from the study will have implication for the pedagogical goals and curricular content of counseling programs. Also, inasmuch as research indicates that counselors with multicultural counseling competencies provide more effective service than those without, the results of this study could lead to future studies that examine whether counselors can hold prejudicial racial attitudes but still provide effective multicultural counseling services due to their multicultural counseling competencies. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2057], "author_name_tesi": "Garraway, Garbette ", "last_name_ssi": "Garraway", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Garbette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counselor Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Spencer Niles", "Jerry G Trusty", "Keith B Wilson", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Spencer Niles, Committee Chair", "Jerry G Trusty, Committee Member", "Keith B Wilson, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["counselor education", "counselors-in-training", "racial attitudes", "multicultural counseling competencies", "counseling program accreditation"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Comparison of Water, Helium, and Carbon Dioxide as Coolants for Next Generation Power Plants using TRACE", "id": "15210grg5094", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15210", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to compare the use of water, helium, and carbon dioxide as coolants for Generation IV and fusion power plants.  The Symbolic Nuclear Analysis Package (SNAP) was used to create input files for the TRAC/RELAP Advanced Computational Engine (TRACE) thermal hydraulics and neutronics coupled code representing this phenomenon.  In addition, TRACE was used to perform simulations comparing how Helium, Carbon Dioxide, and water perform as coolants for power plant systems.  \n\n\nTo start, a TRACE model was built for each coolant of this study that represented a 600 $MW_{th}$ fusion Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) power plant.  The vessel and power source were the same for each model of this study.  The TRACE models include all components of the primary side of a Rankin cycle power plant, including pumps, heat exchangers, a reactor vessel, pipes, coolant channels, etc.  The reactor vessel in the TRACE models represented a hollow cylinder at vacuum with a fusion FRC power source inside this hollow cylinder.  The materials that comprised the cylinder wall were chosen based on thermal conductivity, attenuation coefficients, and other factors.  Part of the cylinder wall was coolant channels with the coolant flowing through it.  Besides flow through the steam generators, most of the secondary side components were represented by a control system that calculated the turbine output work.  Once the model for each coolant was built, simulations were performed to ensure the models reached steady state.  \n\n\nAfter the models prove to reach steady state, parameters were changed to optimize the performance of the systems for each coolant based on the various system requirements.  The final water cooled model operated at similar conditions to those of a PWR.  The final helium and carbon dioxide cooled models operated at conditions based on AGRs, GFRs, and other similar gas cooled systems.  Simulations were performed, and the results were used to analyze how each coolant performs for the power system analyzed in this study.  Before performing analysis based on the TRACE predicted results, verification was performed for helium and carbon dioxide in TRACE because TRACE is only verified and validated with water as the fluid in simulations.  \n\nTo ensure the results from the helium cooled and carbon dioxide cooled TRACE models were reliable, the method of manufactured solutions was used to perform verification for various test cases.  The TRACE results were compared to hand calculated results for identical test cases.  The verification process determined the TRACE predicted results from the helium and carbon dioxide models were reliable for the range of conditions of each respective model.  Further verification and validation can be performed for helium and carbon dioxide as fluids in TRACE models and simulations.   \n\nAfter performing the tasks mentioned in the previous paragraphs, analysis was performed based on the TRACE predicted results for each coolant.  Based on the system requirements and the results from the TRACE simulations, it was determined that water was the best coolant for the system analyzed in this study.  For the operating conditions used in this research, water was able to keep the temperature of certain materials below their maximum temperatures much easier than the helium and carbon dioxide cooled systems.  Specifically, beryllium was used as a material in the system and was determined to have a maximum temperature of 800\\textdegree C for its applications in this study.  Additionally, this temperature limit restricts the efficiency and capabilities of the helium and carbon dioxide cooled systems.  There is also uncertainty associated with the turbine efficiencies used in this study.  This introduces uncertainty into the overall efficiency of the system for each coolant.  So, the overall efficiency is not as important of a parameter in determining the best coolant for the system in this study as other parameters.  Theoretically, the helium and carbon dioxide cooled systems should have a higher efficiency than the water cooled model.

Ultimately, such heightened attuning results in exaggerated visual representations of outgroup faces in line with phenotypic stereotypes (i.e., Black faces perceived higher in Afrocentrism on the basis of anti-Black prejudice). I found strong support for my theoretical framework, which I call motived interpersonal perception theory, in the results of four studies. Essentially, I established a preliminary link between anti-Black prejudice and perceived Afrocentrism on Black faces. Moreover, I showed that manipulating prejudice resulted in heightened attuning to between racial group, but not within group, facial identity changes and that such attuning predicts highly Afrocentric mental representations of Blacks stored in memory.

This work addresses mechanisms of loss and performance of Ba1-xSrxTiO3, such as residual ferroelectricity, enhanced flexocoupling, and dc electric field induced piezoelectricity.\nThe presence of residual ferroelectricity \u2013a persistent ferroelectric response above the global phase transition temperature, adds a contribution to dielectric loss from either motion of domain walls or the boundaries of micropolar regions, degrading the tunable performance over a wide frequency range. Rayleigh behavior as a function of temperature was used to track the ferroelectric behavior of BST materials through the ferroelectric to paraelectric transition temperature. The irreversible Rayleigh parameter serve as a metric for the presence of ferroelectricity because this response is dependent on the presence of domain walls, cluster boundaries or phase boundaries. Chemical solution deposited Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 films, with relative tunabilities of 86% over 250kV/cm at 100kHz, demonstrated residual ferroelectricity at least 65\u00b0C above the ostensible paraelectric transition temperature. The Rayleigh behavior was further corroborated with second harmonic generation, polarization-electric field hysteresis loops and the frequency dependence of the Rayleigh response. The temperature extent of residual ferroelectricity in sputtered and chemical solution deposited films and bulk ceramics was investigated as a function of chemical inhomogeneity on the A-site using electron energy loss spectroscopy. All samples showed some residual ferroelectricity, where the temperature extent was a function of the sample processing. The application of AC electric field for residual ferroelectric measurements of these samples lead to a 100% increase in loss for ac fields exceeding 10kV/cm at room temperature.\nThe presence of residual ferroelectricity in BST also correlates to the increased flexoelectric response in these materials. Residual ferroelectricity is observed in barium strontium titanate ceramics 30\u00b0C above the global phase transition temperature, in the same temperature range in which anomalously large flexoelectric coefficients are reported. The application of a strain gradient in this temperature range was shown to lead to strain gradient-induced poling, or flexoelectric poling, enhancing the flexoelectric response.  Flexoelectric poling was observed by the development of a remanent polarization in flexoelectric measurements upon the removal of the applied strain gradient. Additionally, an induced d33 piezoelectric response was observed in samples after the removal of the applied strain gradient, indicating that the polarization was realigned during flexoelectric measurements. Flexoelectric poling lead to the production of an internal bias of 9 kV/m. It is concluded that residual ferroelectric response considerably enhances the observed flexoelectric response.  \nIn order to investigate the effects of dc electric field induced piezoelectricity, metrology was designed, developed and calibrated for the measurement of the e31,f piezoelectric coefficient as a function of applied electric field and strain. This allowed for direct measurements of the field-induced piezoelectric response for Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 (70:30) and Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 (60:40) thin films on MgO and silicon. The relative dielectric tunabilities for the 70:30 and 60:40 composition on MgO were 83% and 70% respectively, with a dielectric loss of 0.011 and 0.004 at 100 kHz respectively. A linear increase in induced piezoelectricity with field to \u20133.0 C/m2 and \u20131.5 C/m2 at 110 kV/cm was observed in 60:40 BST on MgO and 70:30 BST on Si. Large and hysteretic piezoelectric and tuning responses were observed in the 70:30 BST thin films on MgO. This was consistent with the irreversible Rayleigh behavior, indicating a ferroelectric contribution to the piezoelectric and dielectric response 40\u00b0C above the global paraelectric transition temperature. This information should enable advancements in tunable dielectric components through the removal of piezoelectric resonance-based loss mechanisms.\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10207], "author_name_tesi": "Garten, Lauren M", "last_name_ssi": "Garten", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Michael T Lanagan", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Piezoelectricity", "Ferroelectricity", "Flexoelectricity", "Barium Strontium Titanate", "Tunable Dielectrics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "How Consumer Goal Characteristics Determine the Influence of Goal Progress on Goal Perseverance", "id": "14987", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7630", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "How does progress toward a goal impact the tendency to pursue that goal?

However, the mechanistic underpinnings of age-related differences in cell death following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in females remains largely unexplored.  This line of investigative research is critical if therapeutic targets to restore and preserve cardiac function in aged females are to be realized. Here, it was hypothesized that programmed necrosis (PN), in concert with altered mitochondrial respiration, morphology, and quality control, conspire to produce mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility to cell death upon an ischemic stimulus in the aged female heart. Given known reductions in cardioprotective reserve capacity with senescence, the role of PN inhibition as a pathway to protection was also employed and a novel model to simulate post-menopausal E2 deficiency in rodents established.\nThe first study (Chapter 3) aimed to determine the relationship between mitochondrial ultrastructure and subpopulation function as a result of advancing age and I/R injury in the female heart. Fischer 344 female rats were ovariectomized (OVX) at 15 mo and studied at 22 mo (MO OVX) vs adult (6 mo). Hearts were subjected to in vivo coronary artery ligation (CAL) with 31or 55 min I and variable times of R (10 min, 6 hr, and 24 hr) to establish PN. Respiration rates of isolated mitochondria were reduced selectively by age and I/R in subsarcolemmal (SSM) and interfibrillar (IFM) mitochondria, respectively, leading to a significant reduction in left ventricular function (p<0.05). Mitochondrial morphology assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) suggests an age-dependent alteration in the time course of autophagic flux.\nToward a mechanism of protection and therapeutic intervention in the E2-deficient female heart, the aim of the second study (Chapter 4) was to determine the efficacy of PN inhibition on infarct size reduction and preservation of LV function following I/R injury. Necrostatin-1 (nec-1; 3.5 mg/kg or 5.7 mg/kg), when delivered upon R, significantly reduced infarct size by 34% and improved LV function following CAL (55 min I/2 or 6 hr R) in MO OVX. While age-associated elevations in cyclophilin D (CypD) and mitochondrial acetylation (p<0.001) were unaffected by nec-1, profound reductions in serum cytokines (p<0.05) and cardiac immune cell infiltration were observed in MO OVX but not adult, suggesting a distinct protective mechanism involving RIP1 signaling and post-I/R inflammatory responses.\nIn the third study (Chapter 5), mitochondrial targets of ethanol (EtOH)-induced cardiac dysfunction were determined in adult and aged rats. Chronic EtOH consumption is known to predispose the aged female heart to the development of alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and as such served as an additional model system in which to evaluate age-related changes in cardiac mitochondrial adaptive responses to a superimposed stress. Mitochondrial proteomic changes were evaluated using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) 8plex labeling and mass spectrometry. Adult, adult OVX, aged, and aged OVX rats were fed a control or Lieber-DeCarli \u2018all liquid\u2019 EtOH diet (36% of total kcals) for 20 weeks. After EtOH, significant differences were observed in proteins involved in the electron transport chain (ETC), lipid metabolism, and cellular defense, suggesting a possible link to congestive heart failure. Additionally, EtOH significantly reduced SSM state 3 respiration in all groups, yet only reduced respiratory control index (RCI) in the aged OVX rat heart (p<0.05). \nIn summary, key findings are as follows. 1) A sex-specific mitochondrial phenotype was identified whereby it is hypothesized that reductions in both SSM and IFM function may play an additive role in the enhanced susceptibility to I/R injury and myocardial infarction in aged females. Moreover, novel insight into altered mitochondrial quality control with age highlights a potentially important regulatory role of mitochondrial dynamics on sustaining respiratory function in the aged female heart. 2) PN was identified as the dominant cell death mechanism in the aged female heart. PN inhibition was found to be cardioprotective in adult and aged females through distinct cellular mechanisms. Reductions in RIP1-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines were specific to MO OVX. 3) Chronic EtOH consumption exacerbates cardiac dysfunction in E2-deficient hearts. Furthermore, the combination of mitochondrial protein alterations and reduced mitochondrial function in the aged OVX suggest a possible link to congestive heart failure, whereas the adult heart was virtually unaffected by EtOH-induced changes in the mitochondrial proteome. Collectively, these data emphasize the vulnerability of the aged, E2-deficient female heart to cardiac injury, and characterize distinctive cell death mechanisms that ultimately rely on acute or chronic mitochondrial dysfunction in the adult and aged, respectively.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13483], "author_name_tesi": "Garvin, Alexandra M", "last_name_ssi": "Garvin", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Alexandra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donna Hope Korzick", "Donna Hope Korzick", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Joshua D Lambert", "Gregory C Shearer", "Chee Lim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donna Hope Korzick, Dissertation Advisor", "Donna Hope Korzick, Committee Chair", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member", "Gregory C Shearer, Outside Member", "Chee Lim, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["heart", "ischemia/reperfusion", "mitochondria", "aging", "female", "cell death"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ASSOCIATION OF VARIABILITY IN CARDIOVASCULAR RESPONSIVENESS TO REFLEX ACTIVATION OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WITH GENETICS OF PERIPHERAL SENSORY RECEPTORS", "id": "14295nmg5181", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14295", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "       Cardiovascular disease accounts for approximately 1 in 3 deaths in the United States and high blood pressure (BP) is one of the risk factors implicated. Given its importance, extensive research has been done on the regulation of BP and BP responsiveness to stress.\t\u201cStress reactivity\u201d has long been used as a metric to assess and predict morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases. For example, exaggerated exercise and noxious cold water-induced BP changes may represent a risk factor for death from cardiovascular causes, act as a predictor for hypertension, and be related to heart disease and cardiovascular events. \n       The source(s) of the variation in cardiovascular reactivity are probably multifaceted and poorly understood.  This dissertation explores the thesis that genetic variation accounts for, at least in part, population differences in autonomic responses to stress.  \nThe general experimental design was two-fold: 1) the normal range of BP responses to post-exercise circulatory arrest (PECA) following static handgrip (SHG), a common laboratory exercise technique, was rigorously defined; and 2) these norms were used to selectively recruit groups with high and low responses to investigate the mechanisms accounting for the disparate BP responses between groups and to relate these differences to functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding sensory receptors.\n\tThe first study (Chapter 3) aimed to define the normal range of BP responses to 2-min PECA following 3-min SHG at 30% of maximum voluntary contraction. Testing involved instrumentation for continuous measurement of BP (finger photoplethysmography) and heart rate (ECG) during PECA. Regression modeling of the BP change from control vs. the grip force was used to identify individuals with BP residuals at the highest and lowest response quartile. Average mean arterial pressure change from control was 29\u00b112 mmHg during PECA after 3 min of SHG. Grip force during SHG accounted for ~37% of the variability in BP response. High and low response groups were defined as having a BP residual of +6 and \u20136 mmHg, respectively. \n\tThe second study (Chapters 4-9) was designed to compare these explicitly defined cohorts with stressors that evoke autonomic responses and to test for associations of responsiveness to SNPs in the genes coding for several sensory afferent receptors. Thus, the aim of the study was to associate a BP phenotype with sensory afferent genotype.\n\tVolunteers recruited from each group performed up to 6 protocols in a single ~4 hour visit to the lab. Subjects were instrumented for the continuous measurement of BP (finger photoplethysmography), heart rate (ECG), blood flow (duplex Doppler ultrasound), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (peroneal microneurography) and performed exercise (SHG and rhythmic handgrip (RHG); both followed by PECA), caloric stimulations of the hand (cold, hot, and thermoneutral water immersion), and hypercapnic, hyperoxic rebreathing. In general, there was an inter-stressor response specificity to stressors primarily sensed in the periphery (hand and forearm); that is, subjects with a high BP response during the initial PECA protocol, on average, had a high response to SHG, RHG, PECA, cold immersion, and hot immersion. Hypercapnic rebreathing, which is primarily transduced by central chemoreceptors, did not show any dichotomy between high and low response groups, suggesting that metabo/chemo-sensation during PECA after SHG is not related to chemosensation during hypercapnia.\n\tA chi-square test of independence was performed on the response group (high vs. low) and trait allele frequency (trait allele carriers vs. non-trait allele carriers). In addition, gene scores for multiple SNPs of interest were created by coding the trait allele in all individuals. Genetic results indicated that the frequency of trait allele carriers for the TRPV1 gene SNP rs8065080 may be present in different frequencies in the low and high response groups (P=0.055). The non-carriers:carriers ratio of the trait allele was 13:12 and 9:24 for the low and high response groups, respectively. However, BP residuals, and BP and heart rate response during SHG and RHG with PECA, cold and hot immersion, and rebreathing could not be directly associated with any combination of SNPs via gene score analysis.\n\tThe results of this dissertation can be summarized in three key findings: 1) the BP response to PECA following SHG is variable, normally distributed, and can be used to define groups with distinctly different BP responses;  2) subject BP responsiveness classification is maintained over several, but not all, types of stresses against homeostasis (SHG, RHG, PECA, and cold and hot water immersion, but not hypercapnia); and 3) the trait allele for the missense (isoleucine\u2192valine) TRPV1 gene SNP rs8065080, that codes for an ion channel previously known to be expressed in afferent nerves, may appear with disproportionate frequency among high and low response groups and thus may partially explain the BP response variability between them. An exaggerated BP response to stress is of interest for cardiovascular health and disease. The genetics of peripheral sensory receptors may be one component of the variation of the normal human BP responsiveness to stress.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15298], "author_name_tesi": "Garvin, Nathan Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Garvin", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Nathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative and Biomedical Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Anthony Pawelczyk", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "David Nathan Proctor", "Gail Doreen Thomas", "John E Hayes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Anthony Pawelczyk, Dissertation Advisor", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Chair", "David Nathan Proctor, Committee Member", "Gail Doreen Thomas, Committee Member", "John E Hayes, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["blood pressure", "autonomic", "single nucleotide polymorphism"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT AND ANALYSIS OF THE \nTHERMAL DESIGN FOR THE OSIRIS-3U CUBESAT\n", "id": "15404", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7259", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Proper spacecraft thermal design ensures spacecraft reliability despite the variations in its environment that it will encounter, such as heat inputs from the Sun and Earth, and the influence of full sun-lit and eclipse phases.

This represents a divergence from traditional research paradigms in the social sciences which attempted to identify human processes by examining how variables relate across people at one time point. Towards the goal of identifying processes as they occur within individuals, data are increasingly being collected across time for each participant. Despite acquisition of such rich data, the current standard for looking at data obtained across time is to aggregate across individuals in some manner prior to analysis. This aggregate approach is particularly problematic in the field of brain processing research which utilizes functional MRI data because the processes are highly heterogeneous and often cannot be explained by one model. The present dissertation attends to this issue in 3 ways: 1) demonstrates the spurious relations which occur when heterogeneous data are aggregated across individuals prior to model selection; 2) introduces a novel estimation method, Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME), for recovering reliable parameters at the group and individual levels; and 3) tests GIMME under a variety of confounds and experimental conditions common in fMRI data analysis. Findings suggest that GIMME far outperforms most other brain mapping techniques in terms of reliability.

Latin was not necessary to display one\u2019s Romanness, especially since Greek had its own status as a language of culture and intellectualism. Residents of Anatolia who were confident in their Romanitas and their social position, such as high level Roman aristocrats and military personnel, were comfortable using the standard Greek as well as, or instead of, Latin, for Greek highlighted their education and connection to the Greek heritage. They did not need to use the Roman language to communicate their inclusion in Roman society. Instead, inscriptions with Latin were particularly coveted by groups that had special relationships with Rome and Roman power. This was particularly the case for Roman soldiers, veterans, and freedmen, whose elevated social statuses were direct results of their connections to Rome and their involvement in core Roman institutions. Much like religious converts, naturalized Roman citizens in the East were the most eager to use Latin, as it allowed them to lay claim to and express their newfound Roman identity instead of, or alongside, their native identity. \nOf particular interest in this project are the bilingual texts, for they were particularly effective in exhibiting one\u2019s membership in both Roman and Greek societies.

An example of one such practice is a fast track \u2013 a dedicated set of resources within an ED reserved for processing patients of the lowest severity.\n\nThe ED of the Williamsport Regional Medical Center (WRMC) utilizes a fast track (referred to as Urgicare). Currently, the hospital is undergoing a renovation and expansion. As construction is completed, the ED will transition to the remodeled areas in phases.

Therefore, WRMC is interested in reserving beds of the Main ED for treating Urgicare patients.\n\nIn this thesis, simulation is used to model the bed allocation for ED patients at WRMC.

The theoretical issue is whether or not the relationship between social bonds and delinquency is reciprocal.  To address this issue, I examine the bidirectional relationship between parenting and types of delinquency.  Parenting is operationalized using measures of parental attachment, parental monitoring, and parental involvement.  Delinquency is operationalized using measures of overall delinquency, which included 13 delinquent behaviors, property delinquency, and violent delinquency.  One main research question guided this research.  Is there a bidirectional relationship between parenting behaviors and delinquency?  In other words, are there both parent effects on delinquency and adolescent effects (through delinquency) on parenting?  In order to test for bidirectionality, eighteen main models were estimated, accounting for three delinquency outcomes, each with one of the three parenting measures as the key predictor, and three parenting outcomes, each with one of the three delinquency measures as the key predictor.  In each model, the time 1 measure for the outcome was controlled in a cross-lagged regression to control for prior delinquency or parenting behaviors.  This allowed me to estimate the effect of each key predictor on change in the relevant outcome, thus factoring individual differences related to each of the dependent variables of interest.  The data used in this research were collected for the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).  Add Health is a nationally representative, school-based longitudinal study of adolescents in grades 7 through 12 in the United States in 1994-1995.  \n\nI found that there are bidirectional affects between perceived parental attachment and each of the three types of delinquency.  There were no bidirectional effects for parental monitoring or parental involvement.  Rather, I found no significant parent effects between parental monitoring and delinquency or between parental involvement and delinquency, and no significant adolescent effects between parental monitoring and delinquency.  Overall delinquency and property delinquency both had negative effects on parental involvement, providing evidence of adolescent effects.  The findings regarding perceived parental attachment provide strong evidence for the existence of a bidirectional relationship between parenting and delinquency, consistent with both the transactional and interactional models of bidirectional parent-adolescent relationships.  Contrary to prior criminological research that has focused on or assumed a unidirectional relationship of parents on adolescents, the data here show that the influence goes both ways in the relationship between perceived parental attachment and delinquency.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4059], "author_name_tesi": "Gault, Martha Elaine", "last_name_ssi": "Gault", "middle_name_ssi": "Elaine", "first_name_ssi": "Martha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Silver", "Eric Silver", "Darrell J Steffensmeier", "Jeremy Staff", "Daphne Hernandez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Silver, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Silver, Committee Chair", "Darrell J Steffensmeier, Committee Member", "Jeremy Staff, Committee Member", "Daphne Hernandez, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["reciprocal effects", "delinquency", "parenting", "social control", "social bonds"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The nano-composite nature of vanadium oxide thin films used for infrared microbolometers", "id": "11683", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "647", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current generation of portable, un-cooled infrared imaging devices utilizes thin-film materials with large thermal coefficients of resistivity.

Films in the range of interest for a microbolometer, i.e. 1 \u00d7 10^-3 to 10 Ohm cm, contain the face-centered cubic (FCC) VOx (0.8 < x < 1.3) phase.  Films with larger resistivity were found to be amorphous. Stoichiometry measurements via Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy place many of the nano-crystalline films outside of the FCC VOx phase field according to the bulk phase diagram.  Electron diffraction in the transmission electron microscope confirmed the presence of a secondary oxygen-rich amorphous vanadium oxide phase.  The oxygen-rich amorphous phase explains the discrepancy between the observed oxygen content, which is outside of the FCC VOx phase field, and the presence of FCC VOx, which is limited to a maximum oxygen content of x = 1.3.  \nThe resulting microstructure can be described as a nano-composite material composed of a low resistivity crystalline phase embedded in a high resistivity amorphous matrix.  A mechanism has been proposed wherein the nano-composite structure of the films results from film growth in alternating oxygen deficient and oxygen rich regions in the chamber.  While in the oxygen deficient region the nano-crystalline phase grows preferentially, and while in the oxygen-rich region the amorphous phase grows preferentially.  The resulting microstructure is a mixture of the amorphous and nano-crystalline phases, both of which can be controlled by altering the sputtering geometry.  A general mixing rule was used to simulate the observed transport.  The resulting electrical properties vary from equivalent circuits of resistors in parallel to resistors in series.  The observed data can only be represented by a structure between the two extreme cases, suggesting that neither a percolative network nor isolated grains are desired for application in microbolometers.  This work also suggests that the use of vanadium oxide is not specifically necessary, and nano-composites of other conductors and insulators could result in materials with large negative thermal coefficients of resistivity suitable for use in un-cooled infrared microbolometers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [643], "author_name_tesi": "Gauntt, Bryan Douglas", "last_name_ssi": "Gauntt", "middle_name_ssi": "Douglas", "first_name_ssi": "Bryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Elizabeth Dickey", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Susan\ufffdTrolier\ufffdMcKinstry", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Elizabeth Dickey, Dissertation Advisor", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Chair", "Susan\ufffdTrolier\ufffdMcKinstry, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vanadium oxide", "thin films", "nano-composites", "microbolometer", "infrared detection", "transmission electron microscopy", "microstructure"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Effectiveness of Renewable Portfolio Standards in Reducing Carbon Emissions in the US Electricity Sector ", "id": "16394", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7289", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Do renewable portfolio standards (RPS) \u2013 a state level policy that requires utility companies to include a minimum percentage of renewable or \u201calternative\u201d electricity \u2013 lower CO2 emissions?  A major goal of RPS is to reduce carbon emissions, but to our knowledge no prior study quantifies this impact. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how RPS policy affects carbon emissions and how this impact varies with RPS characteristics.  \n\nWe develop a panel dataset integrating state-level annual data on RPS levels, CO2 emissions, electricity generation, electricity market restructuring, electricity price, fuel prices, and demographic characteristics. The final dataset consists of annual state level data for 48 states comprising from 1997 to 2010. Among 48 states considered in the study, 22 states have mandatory RPS yearly goals in effect by 2010.\nWe use a reduced form econometric analysis with state fixed variables and time fixed effects to study the impacts of RPS yearly targets on carbon emissions. In addition, we address the possible selection problem of state\u2019s decision to adopt and design its RPS policy with the help of three-part Heckit model. The first stage of the Heckit model is the probit selection equation and the second stage is the linear regression with the RPS yearly targets as the dependent variable. From this second-stage, we calculate the linear prediction of RPS yearly targets by restricting observations to non-zero RPS yearly target variable. We use this linear prediction in the main structural equation instead of the actual RPS yearly targets data to find the effect of RPS on CO2 per MWh.\n\nThe ordinary least squares results show that RPS yearly targets are statistically significant in reducing CO2 per MWh \u2013 a ten percentage point increase in RPS yearly mandates improves carbon efficiency by at least 10 percent. While the OLS results show that RPS yearly targets are statistically significant in reducing CO2 per MWh, the regression results of the base model after considering selection problem fail to find the significance of RPS yearly targets in affecting carbon emission efficiency. The closer analysis suggests that the state\u2019s decision to adopt and design its RPS policy is influenced by factors such as neighboring states\u2019 RPS status, shares of fossil-fired generation, and electricity price. These results suggest that state-level RPS policies do not show any effect in reducing carbon emissions after taking account of the selection problem. This study\u2019s findings do not claim that RPS is not effective in reducing CO2 per MWh, rather we conclude that that the underlying characteristics of states enacting RPS policies have more to do with the apparent success of RPS in reducing CO2 per MWh.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7267], "author_name_tesi": "Gautam, Suman ", "last_name_ssi": "Gautam", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suman", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["R J Briggs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["R J Briggs, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Renewable Portfolio Standards", "Carbon Emissions", "Selection bias"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on Empirical Analysis of United States Electricity Markets \n", "id": "23698", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10385", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this Dissertation, three independent studies analyze the impact of recent changes in both supply and demand sides of the U.S. electricity sector. Below is a brief description of three essays. \n\nI. Coal Plant\u2019s Response to Renewable Portfolio Standards\nRenewable Portfolio standards require load-serving entities to purchase a given percentage of their electricity sales from eligible renewable energy technologies. This study analyzes the impact of RPS on the coal utilization by coal plants of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland (PJM) electricity market. We develop a panel dataset of 259 unique PJM coal-fired utility plants\u2019 integrating their fuel purchases with state-level RPS energy mandates, electricity prices, and fuel prices from 2001 to 2011, covering both pre-RPS and post-RPS era. Since selection of RPS policies may be non-random, we employ a two-step Heckit model to control for states\u2019 decision to adopt an RPS and choose yearly RPS levels. The results show that a percentage point increase in state\u2019s yearly energy target increases the average plant\u2019s coal purchase by 45 thousand tons. These results are approximately consistent across selection-corrected models. The analysis showing the positive impact of RPS yearly targets on PJM coal plants\u2019 coal purchases suggests a few things. There are fewer coal plants operating at the margin. Moreover, RPS yearly energy targets are fairly low at present; they are scheduled to increase considerably in coming years. Renewable Portfolio Standards may decrease the amount of fuel utilized by coal plants when RPS mandates increase in future. \n\nII. Residential Customers Response to Critical Peak Events of Electricity: Green Mountain Power Experience\nDemand response (DR) programs, usually through peak pricing and incentive-based approaches, can encourage customers to reduce or shift consumption during peak periods.  This benefits utilities by lowering short-run generation costs and reducing the need for some long-run peak-driven investments.  This paper analyzes the impact of Vermont\u2019s Green Mountain Power\u2019s (GMP) emergency DR programs on residential customers\u2019 electricity consumption during a two-year pilot study program in 2012\u20132013. The 3,735 single-home residents of Central Vermont area were separated into six treatment groups and two control groups resulting into 26 million hourly load observations during the period of the study. Our analysis shows that incentive-based demand response programs have statistically significant impacts on reducing peak load.  Specifically, CPR rates reduced peak load usage 6% to 7.7% and CPP rates reduced peak load between 6.8% and 10.3% during critical peak events.  Moreover, on average, IHD-equipped participants\u2019 monthly energy consumption was 2.0% to 5.3% lower than the monthly energy usage of non-IHD customers. However, none of the CP rate and IHD treatments induced a persistent response across multiple critical events and none of the treatment groups exhibited a consistent response to critical peak events. Based on our evaluation of GMP\u2019s DR programs during 2012 and 2013, neither critical peak pricing nor rebates are themselves sufficient to substitute for new capacity to meet resource adequacy requirements.\n\nIII. Analysis of Load and Price patterns in the U.S. Electricity Sector\nThe study analyzes hourly electricity loads and marginal costs of electric entities with of extreme value theory (EVT), a concept widely used in the financial sector. For each year\u2019s hourly data of balancing authorities and utilities, we fit generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution and estimate the parameters of the distribution with an aim of comparing how these parameters have changed over time and market regions. We also account for the time dependencies, seasonalities, and near-time clustering present in the electricity markets \u2013 both for electricity load and prices \u2013 with the help of autoregressive conditional hetereskedastic models. The results show that the distributions of hourly load and lambda values are fat tailed. Hourly lambda values have more extreme values generating fatter tails than hourly electricity load. We also show that extreme tail quantiles estimated with the GEV parameters at different percentile levels are comparable with the percentiles of actual observations. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10052], "author_name_tesi": "Gautam, Suman ", "last_name_ssi": "Gautam", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack", "Seth Adam Blumsack", "Jonathan P Mathews", "Zhen Lei", "Robert D Weaver", "Luis F Ayala H"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack, Dissertation Advisor", "Seth Adam Blumsack, Committee Chair", "Jonathan P Mathews, Committee Member", "Zhen Lei, Committee Member", "Robert D Weaver, Committee Member", "Luis F Ayala H, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electricity Markets", "RPS", "Coal Plants", "Selection Bias", "demand response", "RCT Design", "extreme value theory", "AR/GARCH Models"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Time Allocation in Projects under Uncertainty: A Robust Optimization Approach\n\n", "id": "8499", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "499", "abstract_tesi": "Traditional models of project management have laid emphasis on scheduling of operations to meet deadlines.

Different theoretical approaches to this problem exist. The current Superpave low-temperature binder grading system is based on the measurement of stiffness and strength. This method was developed during the SHRP program and allowed significant progress in the prediction of low-temperature binder performance. However, further improvements are required, especially to better describe the low-temperature behavior of modified asphalt binders.\nThe use of fracture mechanics principles is a potential alternative to the current Superpave approach. Attempts have been made to apply this method to characterize the fracture properties of asphalt binders at low temperature. Researchers always assumed binders to be linear elastic. The results obtained from these studies were encouraging and concluded that fracture mechanics was a useful tool to describe binders at low temperature and leads to a different ranking of binder performance as compared to the Superpave grading system.\nThis study was to verify and determine the limits of the applicability of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) to asphalt binder. Alternative, fracture mechanics-based approaches were considered to account for non-linear behavior. These methods imply the laboratory determination of critical fracture parameters: linear stress intensity or fracture toughness KIC, plastic energy rate JIC, and time-dependent energy rate JVC. The measurement of KIC was found to be straightforward using existing laboratory tools. To obtain JIC and JVC values, more tests and data analysis are required.\nLoading curves obtained from fracture testing of nine binders were analyzed using the different fracture mechanics approaches. Superpave critical temperatures were also determined for all binders. Binder characterization was completed with the dynamic thermo-mechanical determination of their glass transition temperature, Tg.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8198], "author_name_tesi": "Gauthier, Gilles Gerard", "last_name_ssi": "Gauthier", "middle_name_ssi": "Gerard", "first_name_ssi": "Gilles", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A Anderson", "Peggy Ann Johnson", "Mansour Solaimanian", "Shelley Marie Stoffels"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David A Anderson, Thesis Advisor", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Thesis Advisor", "Mansour Solaimanian, Thesis Advisor", "Shelley Marie Stoffels, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["asphalt fracture properties"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Variation in Pisiform Growth-Plate Morphology", "id": "14867lmg311", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14867", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The pisiform is unique among carpal bones because it is the only one to form a secondary center of ossification and growth plate, a configuration that is present across nearly all mammalian lineages. The human pisiform has undergone major morphological changes including the lost of its growth plate and an ossification center. What is typically a rod-shaped bone in many mammalian species is more akin to a pea shape in our species. This drastic change in development and morphology has a number of implications for humans, however the functional consequences of pisiform growth plate loss are still not understood. \nThe pisiform is severely underrepresented in most skeletal literature, despite its relative importance. Unique human pisiform morphology is often correlated to locomotor behaviors or tool use, although direct associations between carpal morphology and specific behaviors have yet to be established. To understand the developmental history of the pisiform, it is imperative to look beyond the scope of mammals. Investigation of reptilian and amphibious species reveal a complicated and non-linear developmental history of the pisiform.\nEvolutionary research frequently relies on a diverse number of species to act as proxy for the subject of interest. In the context of development, it is beneficial to compare species across multiple taxa with similar skeletal morphology to identify similarities or differences in development trajectories. In a remarkable case of parallel evolution, the family Xenarthra, comprised of sloths, armadillos, and anteaters contains several species who share morphological similarities with extant hominoids. This includes a reduced pisiform in each species of extant sloths. Our research indicates that the giant anteater pisiform develops along a typical mammal trajectory with the secondary center of ossification and a growth plate. The two-toed and three-toed sloth pisiform does not indicate any secondary center in ontogeny, leading us to conclude that the growth plate has additionally been lost in these species. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15877], "author_name_tesi": "Gavazzi, Lia Michelle", "last_name_ssi": "Gavazzi", "middle_name_ssi": "Michelle", "first_name_ssi": "Lia", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy Michael Ryan", "Philip Reno"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy Michael Ryan, Thesis Advisor", "Philip Reno, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["pisiform", "growth plate", "evolution and development", "xenarthran", "lorisine", "forelimb", "autopod"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Development of an Artificial Neural Network for Pressure and Rate Transient Analysis of Horizontal Wells Completed in Dry, Wet and Condensate Gas Reservoirs of Naturally Fractured Formations", "id": "22590", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10252", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In order to meet the increasing demand for natural gas, it has become important to increase production.

In the literature some researchers are reporting 1.6 to 3.8 million concussions occurring in sports (Langlois, 2006), mTBI accounts for 80% of all reported traumatic brain injuries (Ruff, 2011).  With these alarming statistics and an increasing number of athletes suffering a concussion there has been an increased emphasis for sports medicine practitioners to properly diagnose and treat those recovering from brain injury so that they may return safely to school, sports or work.  Current clinical tools available to practitioners give them the ability to assess functional recovery in clinical measures of personality change; patient self reported symptom scales; functional cognitive domains (computer based neuropsychological batteries) and clinical balance measures.  These current methods of clinical measurement, diagnosis and return to play protocols have remained largely unchanged for the past 20 years.  In addition, there is some controversy into the application of these clinical measures within repeated measure testing as improvement does not necessarily reflect post-traumatic recovery but may instead reflect practice or \u201cceiling effects\u201d of measurement.  Therefore, diagnostic platforms that measure structural physiologic recovery must be implemented to assist the clinician in the \u2018Return to Play\u2019 process for athletic participation.

The pickling process inhibits microorganism growth by reducing product pH with organic acids, as well as the addition of salt to the product being pickled. Food items are suspended in a brine solution containing an organic acid, such as citric, lactic or acetic (vinegar) acid and combined with salt, spices and other preservatives, such as potassium sorbate. The majority of pickled foods undergo what is known as a hot fill process, where the brine solution is heated before being introduced to the food item. When the hot brine is applied to pre-cooked, ready-to-eat (RTE) meat sausages, the brine solution can change from clear to cloudy, becoming turbid and unappealing to consumers. To avoid these quality defects, pickled sausage manufacturers may use a cold fill pickling process. Cold fill pickling utilizes a room-temperature brine instead of a heated pickling solution and does not cause the aforementioned quality defects. \nSince very little is known about the safety of the cold fill pickling processes, a series of separate experiments was performed using a brine solution (5% acetic acid and 5% salt at ~22-23\u00b0C) to pickle pre-cooked, RTE beef and pork smoked sausages inoculated with various spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. In two separate experiments, spoilage microorganisms consisting of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Lactobacillus curvatus and L. sakei); yeasts (Debaryomyces hansenii and Candida zeylanoides); molds (Penicillium nalgiovense and Cladosporium cladosporioides) and pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella Typhimurium, S. Senftenberg, S. Montevideo, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) were inoculated onto RTE sausages prior to pickling. Microbial populations were evaluated initially (day 0) and up to 28 days after pickling and storage at room temperature. Other parameters, such as pH of the sausage, pH of the brine, water activity of the sausages, and percent salt of both the sausage and the brine, were measured over time.\nResults demonstrated that all microorganisms experienced a significant (p\u22640.05) reduction within the first 24 hours of pickling. LAB populations were reduced ca. 6.58 log10 CFU/g in 7 days, while yeasts were reduced ca. 3.89 log10 CFU/g in 48 hours and molds were reduced ca. 4.09 log10 CFU/g in 24 hours. Pathogenic bacteria were reduced ca. 6.80 log10 CFU/g in 72 hours when plated on non-selective media and >6.33 log10 CFU/g when plated on selective media. Likewise, pH of sausages decreased significantly (p\u22640.05) throughout the length of the study. No significant differences were observed for water activity (p=0.2062; p=0.1291), or % salt of the sausages (p=0.0640; p=0.1445) or brine (p=0.1046; p=0.3180) for all experiments. \nIt was concluded from the observed data that the cold fill pickling process is capable of inhibiting and destroying contamination from both spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms within 24 hours after initial pickling. Parameters, such as the diameter of the sausages, casing type, and brine concentration were chosen in order to implement a worst case scenario. These results suggest that processors may experience an even more effective inhibition of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms by using a higher concentrations of salt or acetic acid, pickle smaller diameter sausages or use natural or skinless casings, which will result in a faster penetration of the brine into the sausages and decrease in product pH. Results of these studies may provide scientific validation to manufacturers that cold fill pickled sausages in order to meet requirements for their HACCP systems and for regulatory compliance with the USDA-FSIS. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11365], "author_name_tesi": "Gaydos, Nelson Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Gaydos", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Nelson", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Alexander Campbell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Alexander Campbell, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["pickled sausage", "cold fill", "spoilage", "pathogens"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "a multidimensional model of individual functioning in middle adolescence: Exploring patterns of functioning, gender differences, and links to outcomes in young adulthood", "id": "23729", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10886", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding multiple aspects of individual functioning among adolescents, across positive and negative attributes, remains a national and public health concern. Middle adolescence provides a unique period for examining a multidimensional model of individual functioning as these youth are still navigating the biological, physical, cognitive, emotional and social transitions accompanying adolescence (Wigfield, Byrnes, & Eccles, 2006); and how they navigate these changes can have lasting effects on individual development. \nTherefore, this dissertation sought to examine the implications of a multidimensional model of individual functioning for middle adolescents. This objective was addressed via: 1) identifying subgroups of youth who could be distinguished given their patterning of positive and negative aspects of psychological, cognitive and behavioral functioning; 2) examining whether boys and girls were disproportionately classified into identified patterns of functioning; and, 3) investigating the longitudinal predictive association of patterns of individual functioning for young adult social and health status outcomes. \nInformation on several aspects of individual functioning at middle adolescence obtained from a nationally representative sample of youth aged 14 \u2013 16 (N = 3,295). A person-centered methodological approach was used to classify adolescents into homogenous subgroups given their level of functioning on eleven variables representing positive and negative aspects of behavioral, cognitive and psychological functioning. This sample was followed into emerging and young adulthood (ages 19- 26) and their social and health status (lifetime educational attainment, adult criminal arrests and convictions, and past-year substance use related social problems) was assessed. Patterns of functioning during adolescence were associated with social and health status in young adulthood. \nThe findings of this dissertation demonstrate how middle adolescents could be classified into distinct subgroups characterizing healthy and less healthy functioning. Five groups were identified: \u201cWell Adjusted\u201d, \u201cAggressive Youth\u201d, \u201cHigh Risk Youth\u201d, \u201cSubstance Users\u201d and \u201cLow Positive Affect\u201d. As hypothesized, the identified patterns illustrated that adolescents could exhibit multiple configurations of effective and less effective functioning across psychological, cognitive and behavioral domains. In addition, results from this dissertation illuminate individual differences in experiences and functioning during adolescence differentially predicts educational attainment, criminal arrests and substance use related social problems in young adulthood. This latter finding supports the notion of potential multifinality and equifinality in individual functioning  (Cicchetti & Blender, 2006; Cicchetti & Rogosch, 1996); in particular the findings show how 1) multiple patterns of functioning are predictive of substance use and social problems in young adulthood and 2) High Risk Youth were at risk for all these outcomes reflecting social and health status in young adulthood. \nFuture investigations are needed to further understand the importance of 1) positive and negative aspects of functioning, 2) the inclusion of other domains (e.g., social-emotional functioning) within the individual and, 3) to examine stability and change in patterns of individual functioning for from adolescence into young adulthood.

One of these is ozone\u2019s presence high in the earth\u2019s atmosphere that forms a barrier around the earth that protects human health, plant life and aquatic ecosystems from the harmful rays of the sun.  Another is ozone\u2019s infamous connection to smog and the detrimental impact smog has on public health.  Still another is the use of ozone as a disinfecting agent against water-borne microorganisms in drinking water.  It is this association that forms the basis for this research.\n\nOver the past several decades, the use of ozone has emerged in the bottled water manufacturing industry as the method of choice for disinfecting the bottle rinse water, product water, the bottle and the associated bottling equipment.  It does this efficiently and effectively then quickly decomposes to oxygen without leaving an after taste or odor.\n\nHowever, while ozone is working as a disinfectant, it is also off-gassing from the ozonated rinse water and product water into the workplace atmosphere.  It is at this point in the production of bottled water that the workers operating the bottle filling equipment may be exposed to ozone gas at potentially harmful airborne concentrations.  \n\nThis research paper summarizes the air sampling methodology that was employed to measure airborne ozone in an active bottled water manufacturing plant for the purpose of characterizing the airborne ozone concentrations.  The statistical analysis performed for this research identified several variables that have the ability to influence the airborne ozone concentrations:  \n1)\tThe level of ozone in the rinse water used to clean bottles prior to filling,\n2)\tProduction of ozonated water products versus spring water products, \n3)\tSize of the bottles being filled, especially when filled with ozonated product water, and \n4)\tThe number of air handling units operating in the work area. \n\nStatistical analysis also revealed that there are specific production scenarios, including filling larger bottles with ozonated product, for which the mean airborne ozone concentration can temporarily exceed relevant occupational exposure limits such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 8-hour PEL-TWA of 0.1 ppm, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) 8-hour TLV-TWA (moderate work) of 0.05 ppm, and the OSHA 15-minute short term exposure limit (STEL) of 0.3 ppm.  Although short-term concentrations for these scenarios ranged from 0.0516 - 0.1486 ppm, personal air sampling results for equipment operators in this work setting indicate concentrations were below the OSHA 12-hour adjusted TWA exposure limit of 0.067 ppm.\n\nExamination of the ozone concentrations measured at the two sampling points where operators spend most of their time, and for the time period over which three AHUs were operating,  showed that data were distributed normally with a mean of 0.052 ppm and standard deviation of 0.020 ppm.  Further, the distribution indicates that approximately 80% of the measured concentrations were below the OSHA 12-hour adjusted TWA exposure limit of 0.067 ppm.\n\nUnderstanding how production variables influence airborne ozone concentration and the measures such as room ventilation that can be taken to control exposures in the workplace atmosphere to below established exposure limits will help ensure a safe and healthy work environment for the operators of the bottle filling equipment.\n\nIt is important to note that the results of this research are site-specific and may not be reflective of the bottled water industry (or other industries utilizing ozone as a disinfectant in their processes) in general.  However, the knowledge and understanding gained from this research, with regard to how ozone behaves in an industrial setting, should be potentially useful to other bottled water manufacturing facilities or industries dependent on ozone in its processes when it comes to controlling this airborne contaminant. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8148], "author_name_tesi": "Gazza, James ", "last_name_ssi": "Gazza", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Arthur Groves"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Arthur Groves, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ozone", "bottled water manufacturing facility", "workplace", "occupational exposure"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Observers' Privacy Concerns about Wearable Cameras", "id": "28890", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12454", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recently, wearable cameras and glass-style augmented reality devices such as Narrative Clip and Google Glass have entered the market and attracted much attention from both industry and academia. These devices are designed to be extremely portable and convenient for the user to capture a log of his or her daily life; they also have significant computing functionality and can be connected to the Internet at any time. However, because of the portability and invisibility characteristics of wearable cameras, not only the end-users but also the observers, become important stakeholders whose feelings of privacy may also be affected by the use of these devices. Therefore, questions are increasingly asked about potential privacy threats and ethical issues of these devices including what content will be captured, who will use this information, and how this information will be used in future.\nIn this study, we address the observers\u2019 privacy concerns about wearable cameras as they might be used and experienced in different scenarios by combining qualitative and quantitative research. We first conducted four focus group interviews to explore the observers\u2019 general perceptions and concerns. Drawing from the feedback received in these sessions, we developed and fielded an online survey (N=400) to investigate observers\u2019 attitude, reaction, dimensions of privacy concern and concern about diverse type of information in nine different scenarios. We found that these concerns and reactions varied across scenarios, because of differences in the activity locations, actions, purposes and degree of observer control. We also found that some observer characteristics were related to their reported privacy concerns, including gender, age group, technology use history and media exposure to privacy invasion news.\nWe hope this study can expand the research area, and provide insights for both companies who wish to develop commercialized wearable devices and for researchers who seek to contribute future design and research studies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11808], "author_name_tesi": "Ge, Jun ", "last_name_ssi": "Ge", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jun", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Beth Rosson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Beth Rosson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["privacy", "wearable technology", "recording technology", "scenario-based design", "survey", "user experience"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Bayesian analysis of small groups in crowds", "id": "10944", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6578", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Crowd analysis is of increasing interest.

Adversaries exploit such program flaws to launch code-injection and code-reuse attacks. Code-injection attacks execute instructions that are injected by an adversary at runtime while code-reuse attacks redirect the execution to existing code of her choice. Both attacks can lead to severe security breaches because they often enable arbitrary code execution. To prevent adversaries from exploiting such vulnerabilities, researchers have proposed mitigation techinques such as data execution prevention (DEP), which prohibits execution over data memory hence injected code, and control-flow integrity (CFI), which limits adversaries\u2019 choices when reusing existing code. Despite the effectiveness of these defenses, they can be circumvented by a compromised operating system kernel, which has full privileges over the running system and is capable of negating the deployed defenses. In this dissertation, we explore solutions to protecting an entire software system with both DEP and CFI, which we refer as execution integrity. We take three steps to approach this goal. First, we propose a lightweight system to enforce DEP for the operating system kernel from an isolated computation environment. We mediate the kernel\u2019s memory management operations and ensure they always comply with a set of general principles for lifetime code integrity. Second, we demonstrate a systematic approach to enforce fine-grained CFI for the operating system kernel comprehensively and efficiently. We find that fine-grained CFI can be enforced as efficiently as (or even outperform) comparable coarse-grained CFI. Third, we examine the effectiveness of applying recent hardware mechanisms that log complete control-flow traces to enforce CFI system-wide. We construct an online CFI enforcement system that is capable of enforcing various types of CFI policies over all running, unmodified user-space applications. We intensively optimize the implementation to maximize the performance using the current hardware, and study alternative hardware logging schemes for further performance improvements. The dissertation shows that execution integrity can be enforced efficiently, flexibly and comprehensively, thus is practical to mitigate memory corruption attacks for the whole software system.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13060], "author_name_tesi": "Ge, Xinyang ", "last_name_ssi": "Ge", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xinyang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Trent Jaeger", "Trent Jaeger", "Anand Sivasubramaniam", "Gang Tan", "Peng Liu", "Danfeng Zhang", "Mathias Payer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Trent Jaeger, Dissertation Advisor", "Trent Jaeger, Committee Chair", "Anand Sivasubramaniam, Committee Member", "Gang Tan, Committee Member", "Peng Liu, Outside Member", "Danfeng Zhang, Committee Member", "Mathias Payer, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Security", "Operating System"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Scaffolding Students' Problem-Solving Processes on an Ill-Structured Task Using Question Prompts and Peer Interactions", "id": "5867", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6668", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<!doctype html public \"-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en\">\n<html>\n<head>\n   <meta name=\"Author\" content=\"Xun Ge\">\n   <meta name=\"GENERATOR\" content=\"Mozilla/4.7 [en]C-CCK-MCD EBM-Compaq  (Win95;

Few studies have evaluated the effects of pistachios on CVD risk factors and they have not evaluated dose-response relationships or lipid-lowering mechanisms. Nutrition studies with a translational research approach integrate clinical nutrition and molecular biology, allowing for the investigation of clinical responses and underlying cellular mechanisms. The present study utilized a translational research approach to comprehensively evaluate the effects of pistachios on CVD. We employed a randomized crossover controlled-feeding study to evaluate the effects of two doses of pistachios, added to a lower-fat diet, on lipids and lipoproteins, apolipoprotein-defined lipoprotein subclasses, and plasma fatty acids. To investigate mechanisms of action, we measured serum cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), indices of plasma stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity (SCD), and gene expression in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, non-HDL-C, apoB, and apoB/apoA-I decreased after both pistachio diets; and triacylglycerol and plasma SCD activity decreased after the 3.0 ounce pistachio diet (P < 0.05). Pistachios elicited a dose-dependent lowering of TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and non-HDL-C/HDL-C (P < 0.01). We evaluated the effects of pistachios on expression of genes related to inflammation and lipid metabolism (TNF\u00e1, IL-1\u00e2, IL-6, ICAM, VCAM, CETP, and LCAT) in PBMCs. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between diet-induced change in CETP expression and change in serum CETP and plasma lipids/lipoproteins. The pistachio-rich diets significantly decreased IL-1\u00e2 expression compared to baseline (P < 0.05). Change in CETP expression in PBMCs predicted change in LDL-C, NONHDL-C, TC/HDL-C, and NONHDL-C/HDL-C in individuals who were diet-responsive with regards to serum CETP.

Radar systems are capable of processing returns from targets through barriers where optical and thermal systems can fail.  This thesis describes techniques for detecting and localizing targets through barriers.  There is also a desire to minimize the size and complexity of the radar systems.  This is because these radar systems are usually operated in hostile and harsh conditions.  This need to reduce size and complexity leads to difficulties in localization and detection because cross range resolution can be a function of both aperture size and number of elements.  These pitfalls can be overcome by well thought out imaging scenarios and signal processing techniques.  By utilizing multiple views via a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar configuration, data can be fused to create a clearer image about what is going on behind the barrier.  This thesis addresses this technique as well as different mitigation techniques, such as a singular value decomposition of wavelet transform method to improve localization and detection of targets.  A stepped frequency radar system was also utilized to detect moving targets through walls using Doppler shifts.  Together, these techniques demonstrate methods that show a reduction in size and complexity of traditional through-wall radar systems while still providing accurate detection and localization.

These revisions require states to carry out mitigation in a watershed context, prioritizing mitigation site design and placement by overall watershed need.  In addition, states must establish monitoring programs and measureable performance standards for mitigation wetlands.  The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PDEP) is currently working to revise its wetlands program to meet the stipulations of the new Mitigation Rule.  The goal of this research was to provide baseline data and a scientifically defensible basis for the proposed changes to PDEP\u2019s wetlands program, as well as to assist in mitigation prioritization schemes by exploring the relationship between landscape metrics and wetland functional capacity indices.  \nIn Pennsylvania, a Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) Approach involving 222 reference wetlands is being used to assess mitigation wetland performance.  The HGM process involves classification of wetlands based on hydrogeomorphic factors, development of a set of reference wetlands and the development of functional capacity indices, and can be applied to mitigation wetlands. \nFor this study, 72 mitigation wetlands were sampled.  These sites were randomly selected by the PDEP and included mitigation wetlands from three categories \u2013 Pennsylvania Wetland Replacement Program (PWRP) sites, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) mitigation banks and permit required compensatory mitigation sites.  Mitigation wetlands were intensively sampled with the same Level 3 methodology used in initial reference wetland sampling, and include sampling of microtopography, nested vegetation (herbaceous, shrub and tree) plots and soil at the 5 and 20 cm depths.  In addition, a habitat suitability index (HSI) is scored for 10 wetland dependent species and a stressor checklist is completed, providing a qualitative assessment of the potential for activities in the surrounding uplands to influence the wetland.  Field data, along with GIS computed variables were used to derive the scores of 10 HGM functional capacity indices for all mitigation wetland sites. \nOverall, mitigation sites displayed lower potential to perform a variety of characteristic wetland functions than reference sites.  It appears that mitigation wetlands are not providing high functioning replacements for natural wetland impacts.  Depressions show the greatest discrepancy, with all functional capacity indices scoring significantly lower than reference sites.  Fringing sites showed the least amount of difference from reference sites, with few statistically significant differences observed between mitigation and reference functional capacity index scores.  Mitigation site size, age and type were not found to be significant factors in functional capacity index scores.  The lack of significant results observed for some HGM classes, such as mainstem floodplain and slope, was likely the result of small sample sizes.  \nIn order to assess the relationship between land use and wetland function in Pennsylvania, and ideally identify disturbance thresholds for individual wetland functions or classes, a variety of landscape pattern metrics were compiled.  A landscape classification system known as Landtype Association (LTA) mapping was used so that analysis could be conducted at the small watershed scale.  Both linear regression and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis were conducted to determine relationships between metrics and functional capacity index scores in a 1 km-radius circle surrounding the site as well as within the gamma LTA (gLTA) unit containing the wetland.  Sites were analyzed by HGM wetland class and gLTA unit subtype.\nAlthough reference wetlands span a gradient of disturbance, mitigation wetlands were found to occur in significantly more disturbed landscape settings than reference wetlands.  Mitigation wetlands also frequently displayed atypical response of functional capacity indices to landscape disturbance metrics compared to their reference counterparts.  The strongest relationship between landscape pattern metrics and wetland functional capacity indices was observed at the small watershed scale in both linear regression and CART analysis. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4577], "author_name_tesi": "Gebo, Naomi Austin", "last_name_ssi": "Gebo", "middle_name_ssi": "Austin", "first_name_ssi": "Naomi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert P Brooks", "Robert P Brooks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert P Brooks, Thesis Advisor", "Robert P Brooks, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["landscape disturbance", "wetland mitigation", "hydrogeomorphic", "landtype association", "CART"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "TWO ESSAYS IN CHILD NUTRITIONAL STATUS AND URBAN POVERTY DYNAMICS IN ETHIOPIA\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "6487", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6324", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The thesis consists of two essays. In these essays, I try to address two of the most challenging development issues in Ethiopia, poverty and malnutrition. The foci of the two essays are interrelated but will be examined separately.  The title of the first essay is \u201cThe Role of Maternal Education in Child Nutritional Status and Child Health-Seeking Behavior of Households in Ethiopia: Do Family and Community Matter?\u201d The data used in this study come from two nationally representative cross-sectional sample surveys conducted by the Central Statistical Authority of Ethiopia: (i) The 1995/96 Household Income, Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HICES), and (ii) The 1995/96 Welfare Monitoring Survey (WMS). \nIn this essay I investigate three indicators of child nutrition and health using the following outcome variables: (i) child nutritional status (measured by child\u2019s height for age); (ii) child health-seeking behavior of households; (iii) the determinants of child illness; and (iv) the determinants of immunization for children 12-59 months old.\n The main results of this study indicate that age of the child, child illness, parental education, household income and distance to primary school are strong predictors of child nutritional status in Ethiopia. Nonetheless, the strong positive effect of mother\u2019s education on child height appears to be limited to post-primary level of education. The results from this study suggest that although the independent effect of maternal employment (working outside the home) is not a statistically significant determinant, it is negatively related to child nutritional status.  When location of residence (urban vs. rural) is not controlled for, the results indicate that the children whose homes used water from protected sources (tap water) have better height-for-age relative to children whose homes used water from unprotected sources.  In addition, the use of pit latrine or toilet for safe disposal of feces is not associated with better nutritional status.\nThe empirical analysis uses household consumption expenditure (proxy for household income), both as an observed variable and in instrumented form to purge measurement error and transitory fluctuations from the variable. The results reveal significant association of child nutritional status and health to household income. Except for the illness outcome variable, income is a strong and significant determinant of child height-for-age, immunization and treatment-seeking behavior of households in Ethiopia.\n The results suggest that child health-seeking behavior is strongly affected by household expenditure, distance to the nearest health facility, living in a rural area, parental education, and the mother\u2019s and child\u2019s ages. With respect to mother\u2019s age, children of older mothers are less likely to go for treatment when they are ill, and have less chance of being ill too. In addition, education of the male head of the household is also a significant predictor of child health-seeking behavior. With regard to child immunization and illness the estimates from the probit models indicate mother\u2019s education is strongly associated with increased chance of immunization and reduced chance of child illness. \nOverall none of the models predicts the presence of a gender difference with respect to child nutritional status and health-seeking behavior. This result is in tandem with most of the findings in sub-Saharan Africa. Household expenditure is a strong and significant determinant of child nutritional status, immunization and treatment seeking-behavior of households.  Among community-level correlates, the distance to primary school is a significant predictor of child height-for-age. \nThe results from multilevel analysis indicate the presence of unobserved heterogeneity across families and across communities with respect to child nutritional outcomes. The intra-community correlation ranges from 19.1 per cent in the null model to 13.4 per cent in the full model, showing that membership in a particular family and a particular community is a major determinant of child nutritional outcomes. \nIn summary, the results from both the classical models (OLS and 2SLS) and the multilevel analysis are similar in terms of the sign of the explanatory variables and statistical significance in the models. Factors such as child age and illness, mother\u2019s and adult male household head\u2019s education (in particular post-primary education), income and location of residence (living in rural area) are important in explaining child nutritional status behavior of households in Ethiopia. \nThe title of the second essay is \u201cPoverty Dynamics in Urban Ethiopia.\u201d Poverty is the key cause of most social problems. Understanding the nature, characteristics and dynamics of poverty can help policymakers to target vulnerable groups more effectively. The year 1994 marked the beginning of an IMF/World Bank-assisted structural adjustment program in Ethiopia. The central questions that this essay address are: What factors account for the pattern of long-term poverty? That is, which household demographic variables emerge as determinants of chronic poverty? How important are household characteristics in determining the chance of moving out of poverty and the risk of falling into poverty? I investigate these research questions using data from a three-wave panel survey of households conducted in 1994, 1995 and 1997 in seven urban centers in Ethiopia.\n\tThe poverty incidence, P0, obtained by anchoring the poverty line to the national poverty line of Birr 89.59 (at 1995 prices), indicates that 41.3 per cent of the urban population lived below the poverty line in 1994. In 1995, the incidence increased to 46.6 per cent of the sampled population. In 1997, the population below the poverty line declined to 43.6 per cent. The ranking of the distributions in order to examine whether one distribution has more or less poor than the other over a range of poverty lines (poverty dominance test) indicates that there was an unambiguous worsening of the poverty gap in 1995 in the lower and upper tails of the distributions compared to the distributions in 1994 and 1997. \n\tThe proportion of all poor households that are chronically poor is 37 per cent, while the transient poor account for 26 per cent. The average income and the relative variability (using the coefficient of variation) indicate that the non-poor households have about four times as high consumption expenditure as the chronic poor, while the transient poor households have about two and a half times as high consumption expenditure as the chronic poor.\nResults from multivariate analyses show that education and health status of the household head, family structure, household size and female headship are significant predictors of chronic poverty.  A household head with chronic health problem significantly increases the chance of the household being chronically poor. However, the significant effect of health status of the head vanishes once education is included in the model. The results indicate that having a larger household size increases the chance of being chronically poor. \nThe transition matrices of consumption expenditure reflect the movements of households between two consecutive survey rounds in relation to the poverty line. All the transition matrices indicate that a large proportion of households in both the poorest and the richest cells did not change their position across surveys. This shows that most of the movements took place in the middle of the positions. The findings indicate that a large proportion of the poor were stuck in poverty.\nWith respect to exit from poverty, education is a strong predictor of moving out of poverty. For instance, the probability of moving out of poverty for those with secondary and above education is around 26 percentage points higher compared to those with no education. Family structure is also a significant determinant of moving out of poverty (rather hindering moving out of poverty). The results from the multivariate analyses provide evidence that households with 4 or more children have less chance of moving out of poverty. For instance, households with more than 5 children have about a 21 percentage point lower chance of moving out of poverty compared to those households with no child.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6324], "author_name_tesi": "Gebreselassie, Tesfayi ", "last_name_ssi": "Gebreselassie", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tesfayi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Special", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Shapiro", "Leif Jensen", "Dr Suet Ling Pong", "David Gerard Abler", "Barbara White Pennypacker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Shapiro, Committee Chair", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "Dr Suet Ling Pong, Committee Member", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Barbara White Pennypacker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Maternal education; Child health; Multilevel Analy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "UNDERSTANDING THE MEAN DIFFERENCES IN EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN BULLY SITUATION STATUS (PERPETRATOR, TARGET, AND BYSTANDER) ", "id": "5h73pw048", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12655", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tBullying is a school and social epidemic.

Hence, the latter purpose supports the former.  Discussion of a conceptual framework forms the first part of the study, centered on reviewing other relatively recent geographical studies of national statistics, particularly those that have attempted to apply and extend concepts from poststructuralist theorizing on governmentality.  The second part of the analysis draws on the first and involves empirical analyses primarily of three statistical projects, all of which include statistics about Scottish farming conditions.  One development is the Statistical Account of Scotland, conducted between 1790 and 1798, and significant as the first-ever geographically organized statistical survey of the modern nation.  Examined next is a sequence of national agricultural surveys performed in the mid-1850s, these surveys being the first specifically about Scottish farming.  The third development encompasses the consolidation of state data systems, focusing on the agricultural censuses conducted since 1866.  More recent data systems have included those required in relation to the workings of European Community\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy.  These three developments are first analyzed individually, each providing a perspective on the spatial politics of statistical observation and their connections to knowledge and regulation.  Finally, continuities and changes over the three developments are assessed and then discussed in relation to current data developments.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [568], "author_name_tesi": "Geddes, Alistair ", "last_name_ssi": "Geddes", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alistair", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Ann Brewer", "Deryck William Holdsworth", "James P Mc Carthy", "Leif Jensen", "Roger Michael Downs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Ann Brewer, Committee Chair", "Deryck William Holdsworth, Committee Member", "James P Mc Carthy, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "Roger Michael Downs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Statistics", "Spatial Politics", "Scotland", "Geography", "Governmentality", "Censuses", "Farming"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE GUSTATORY INSULAR THALAMOCORTICAL TRACT IS NECESSARY FOR ACQUISITION AND RETENTION OF DRUG-INDUCED REWARD COMPARISONS, BUT NOT LICL-INDUCED TASTE AVERSION\n\n\n", "id": "9564", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5185", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-01-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation systematic tested conditioned taste suppression (CTS) of a taste stimulus when repeatedly paired with morphine, cocaine, sucrose, or LiCl in male Sprague-Dawley rats with discrete lesions of the taste thalamus and/or insular primary gustatory cortex (GC). To begin addressing these ideas, we utilized stereotaxic-guided, ibotenic-acid lesions of the GC, or bilateral GCTx, in order to determine the role of the GC in CTS of a taste stimulus when contingently paired with morphine, cocaine, the emetic LiCl, and a known reinforcer such as sucrose (Chapters 2 and 3).

In Chapter 4, rats with asymmetric THCx lesions were tested under drug contrast acquisition, retention, and LiCl-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA). In Chapter 5, taste-drug induced CTSs were subsequently tested in na\u00efve rats with THCx lesions under cocaine self-administration and cue-induced instrumental responding for morphine in the runway.

To address the problem of finite-amplitude noise propagation, a hybrid time-frequency domain model has been developed to numerically solve the generalized Mendousse-Burgers equation, which is a parabolic model equation that includes effects of quadratic\nnonlinearity, atmospheric absorption and dispersion, and geometrical spreading. The algorithm has been compared against analytical theory and numerical issues have been discussed. Three sets of experimental data have been used to evaluate the model: model-scale laboratory jet data, field data using a large loudspeaker,\nand static engine run-up measurements of the F/A-22 Raptor. Comparison of linearly- and nonlinearly-predicted spectra demonstrates that nonlinearity does, in fact, impact the noise propagation in all three sets of data.

Seen from this perspective, firms achieve sustainability by dissociation. Using an unbalanced panel of diversified firms from 1992 to 2010, I test whether negative sustainability ratings are related to divestitures, and whether the strength of this relationship is moderated by the extent to which firms are targeted by shareholder activists, and whether or not firms engage in sustainability reporting. Drawing on my analysis, I discuss implications for our understanding of organizational boundaries, as well as divestitures research, categorization theory, and sustainability research.

This inner wood is high in lignin and heavily cross-linked, making it low in accessible nutrients, including carbohydrates and nitrogen.  How this or any other insect is able to grow and develop in living woody tissue is largely unknown but likely requires specific enzymes and biochemical pathways.  While insects are not thought to have the ability to fully degrade lignocellulose through endogenous enzymes, microbes present in the gut of insects assist in this process.  To better understand this relationship, the gut microbial community of this insect was investigated in detail through multiple populations of the insect on different hosts, as well as over different insect developmental stages.  A. glabripennis harbors a broad diversity of bacteria in its gut, some of which likely produce cellulases, xylanases and enzymes able to degrade aromatic compounds, as well as microbes capable of nitrogen fixation.  Some of these bacteria are passed during oviposition from the adult, while others are environmentally derived.  Also, a fungal species in the Fusarium solani species complex is associated with the gut of this insect.  This strain was consistently found in the gut upon examination of several host tree species and different populations of A. glabripennis from different locations.  While not a typical wood-rot fungus, this species does produce hydrolases and may have some ability to degrade lignin, but the details of these processes are not known.  Lignin degradation in A. glabripennis, as well as the Pacific dampwood termite Zootermopsis angusticollis was demonstrated using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) thermochemolysis/GC/MS.  Side-chain oxidation, demethylation, and ring hydroxylation were recorded as wood passed through the guts of these insects.  This is the first definitive report of lignin degradation by insects.  Overall, this research lays the foundation for understanding lignocellulose degradation and gut microbial ecology in A. glabripennis with future studies planned to explore the meta-genome, transcriptome, and proteome of this insect. Potential applications include novel targets for controlling this pest and prospecting for novel biochemical processes and microbes that can be utilized in industrial processes, including cellulosic ethanol production.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5678], "author_name_tesi": "Geib, Scott Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Geib", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kelli Hoover", "Ming Tien", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster", "Gary Felton", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kelli Hoover, Committee Chair", "Ming Tien, Committee Chair", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster, Committee Member", "Gary Felton, Committee Member", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Anoplophora glabripennis", "lignocellulose", "gut microbes", "Asian longhorned beetle"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Measuring mindful parenting through systematic observation: The development and psychometric testing of the Mindful Parenting Observational Scales (MPOS)", "id": "15224", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7636", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Gaps exist in current approaches to measurement within the developing field of mindfulness in parenting.

This study analyzed DVD-recorded interaction data from 50 mother-youth pairs in Pennsylvania and Iowa who were selected from the top and bottom tails of a larger distribution (N=979) of self-reported interpersonal mindfulness in parenting.  Percentage agreements and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to calculate inter-rater reliability, and hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine the unique contribution of the MPOS to explaining youth outcome variance.  Reliability analyses indicated that the two observers involved in this study scored within one scale point of each other at least 90% of the time on 15 of 18 MPOS rating scales, and that ICCs for all scales ranged from .53-.99.  Tests of incremental validity demonstrated that the MPOS was associated with variance in youth outcomes above and beyond that explained by a standard observational measure of parenting and a self-report measure of mindful parenting.  Specifically, mothers rated higher in mindful parenting had youth with better peer pressure resistance skills, fewer externalizing problems, and a lower rate of initiating use of a variety of illicit substances.  Higher mindful parenting was inversely related to internalizing symptoms, so that mothers who demonstrated behavior reflective of mindful parenting had youth who reported more depression and anxiety symptoms.

One method is to increase the pole count, which increases the generator back-emf without also increasing the I2R losses, thereby increasing both torque density and conversion efficiency.    One machine topology that has a high effective pole count is a hybrid \u201cstepper\u201d machine.  However, the large self inductance of these machines decreases their power factor and hence the maximum power that can be delivered to a load.  This effect can be cancelled by the addition of capacitors in series with the stepper windings.  A circuit was designed and implemented to automatically vary the series capacitance over the entire speed range investigated.  The addition of the series capacitors improved the power output of the stepper machine by up to 700%.  At low rotor speeds, with the addition of series capacitance, the power output of the hybrid \u201cstepper\u201d was more than 200% that of a similarly sized PMDC brushed motor.  \n\nFinally, in this thesis a hybrid lumped parameter / finite element model was used to investigate the impact of number, shape and size of the rotor and stator teeth on machine performance.

In this thesis it was shown that the cogging and ripple torque can be dramatically reduced.  These findings confirm that high-pole-count topologies, and specifically the hybrid stepper configuration, are an attractive choice for energy harvesting applications. \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5330], "author_name_tesi": "Geiger, Richard T.", "last_name_ssi": "Geiger", "middle_name_ssi": "T.", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Heath Hofmann", "Heath Hofmann", "George A Lesieutre", "John Douglas Mitchell", "Mary I Frecker", "James Kenneth Breakall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Heath Hofmann, Dissertation Advisor", "Heath Hofmann, Committee Chair", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member", "John Douglas Mitchell, Committee Member", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Member", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy harvesting", "stepper motor", "high pole count"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Crustal deformation and volcanism at active plate boundaries", "id": "22550", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10401", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Most of Earth\u2019s volcanoes are located near active tectonic plate boundaries, where the\ntectonic plates move relative to each other resulting in deformation. Likewise, subsurface\nmagma movement and pressure changes in magmatic systems can cause measurable deformation of the Earth\u2019s surface. The study of the shape of Earth and therefore studies of surface deformation is called geodesy. Modern geodetic techniques allow precise measurements (~1 mm accuracy) of deformation of tectonic and magmatic systems. Because of the spatial correlation between tectonic boundaries and volcanism, the tectonic and volcanic deformation signals can become intertwined. Thus it is often important to study both tectonic and volcanic deformation processes simultaneously, when one is trying to study one of the systems individually.\n\nIn this thesis, I present research on crustal deformation and magmatic processes at active plate boundaries. The study areas cover divergent and transform plate boundaries in south Iceland and convergent and transform plate boundaries in Central America, specifically Nicaragua and El Salvador. The study is composed of four main chapters: two of the chapters focus on the magma plumbing system of Hekla volcano, Iceland and the plate boundary in south Iceland; one chapter focuses on shallow controls of explosive volcanism at Telica volcano, Nicaragua; and the fourth chapter focuses on co- and postseismic deformation from a Mw = 7.3 earthquake which occurred offshore El Salvador in 2012.\n\nHekla volcano is located at the intersection of a transform zone and a rift zone in Iceland and thus is affected by a combination of shear and extensional strains, in addition to co-seismic and co-rifting deformation. The inter-eruptive deformation signal from Hekla is subtle, as observed by a decade (2000-2010) of GPS data in south Iceland. A simultaneous inversion of this data for parameters describing the geometry and source characteristics of the magma chamber at Hekla, and geometry and secular rates across the plate boundary segments, reveals a deep magma chamber under Hekla and gives a geodetic estimate of the current location of the North-America Eurasian plate boundary in south Iceland. Different geometries were tested for Hekla\u2019s magma chamber: spherical, horizontally elongated ellipsoidal, and pipe-like magma chambers. The data could not reliably distinguish the actual geometry; however, all three models indicate magma\naccumulation near the Moho (~20-25 km) under Hekla.\n\nThe February \u2013 March 2000 eruption of Hekla gave another opportunity to image the magmatic system. In Chapter 5, I used co-eruptive GPS and InSAR displacements, borehole strain, and tilt measurements to jointly invert for co-eruptive deformation associated with the 2000 eruption and found a depth of approximately 20 km for the magma chamber, in accordance with my previous results.\n\nTelica is a highly seismically active volcano in Nicaragua. The seismicity is mostly of shallow (<2 km deep) origin, and shows a high variability in terms of the number of seismic events per time unit. The highest rates exceed one earthquake per minute averaged over 24 hours, but overall trends in seismic activity, as observed since 1993, do not have an obvious correlation with eruptive activity. This variability causes difficulties for hazard monitoring of Telica. Telica erupted in a small (VEI 2) explosive eruption in 2011. Eruptions of this style and size seem to occur on decadal time scales at Telica. In Chapter 3, I used an extensive multidisciplinary data set consisting of seismic and GPS data, multivariate ash analysis, SO2 measurements, fumarole temperatures, and visual observations, to show that the eruption was essentially an amagmatic eruption of hydrothermally altered materials from the conduit, and that short-term sealing of hydrothermal pathways led to temporary pressure build-up, resulting in the explosions. No significant crustal deformation was detected before or during the eruption, in accordance with low (<2 km) plume heights and small (<10^5 m^3) eruptive volumes. The primary signal observed in the 10-site continuous GPS geodetic network on and near\nTelica is shear on the Caribbean plate \u2013 fore-arc plate boundary, which our measurements show crosses Telica. Thus, like at Hekla volcano, Iceland, it is important for volcano geodesy to consider the plate boundary deformation within volcanic arcs in geodetic studies of volcanoes.\n\nThe August 27, 2012 Mw = 7.3 earthquake offshore El Salvador was the largest event to rupture this segment of the subduction interface for at least 95 years. The earthquake ruptured shallow (<20 km depth) parts of the subduction zone. Co-seismic deformation, as observed on land, was less than 2 cm, and was exceeded by post-seismic deformation within the first year after the earthquake, signifying low coupling on the subduction zone offshore El Salvador and Nicaragua.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10066], "author_name_tesi": "Geirsson, Halldor ", "last_name_ssi": "Geirsson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Halldor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Christopher Lafemina", "Peter Christopher Lafemina", "Kevin Patrick Furlong", "Charles James Ammon", "Barry Voight", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Christopher Lafemina, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter Christopher Lafemina, Committee Chair", "Kevin Patrick Furlong, Committee Member", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Barry Voight, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["crustal deformation", "GPS", "magma movements", "eruption", "volcanoes", "earthquakes", "hydrothermal systems", "fault mechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DIMENSIONAL CAPABILITIES OF POWDER-BASED MICROCOMPONENTS\nFABRICATED BY UTILIZING FILLED PHOTORESITS\n", "id": "11617", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3542", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Experiments were performed in order to determine and quantify the effects of processing conditions on micro components created with filled photoresist. This process combines standard photolithographic procedures with that of standard powder metallurgy process. This technique offers two major benefits; the first being lithographic sized features in the 1-5 &#956;m range because of the photolithographic portion of the process, and the second is the ability to use virtually any metal alloy to form components which is attributed to the powder metallurgy portion of the process. The filled photoresist process consists of filling a photosensitive polymer material, such as Micro Chem\u2019s Su-8 negative photoresist, with powder metal (stainless steel 316L). This mixture is then applied to a ceramic substrate through a spin coating process. The filled photoresist is then exposed to ultra violet light through a mask of desired geometries. The filled photoresist that is exposed to the ultra violet light through the mask becomes cross-linked, which enables it to stay affixed to the substrate. During the development step the non cross-linked filled photoresist is removed from the substrate leaving behind the micro components. The micro components are then debinded in air to remove the photoresist and lightly sinter the metal powder particles. Finally the micro components are sintered in hydrogen to densify. The effects of solids loading and powder particle size on dimensional variability were investigated. The effect of sintering temperatures on density and shrinkage was also evaluated.\nDimensional variability was measured at two points during the processing steps. The micro components were measured after forming and after sintering. Six sigma precision was found to range  from .0305 mm to .0524 mm depending on which dimension was measured. Based on studies the components displayed a slightly high dimensional variability. This variability was attributed to the inability to create high enough solids loading slurries of filled photoresist. It was shown that solids loading had a definite effect on dimensional variability of both green and sintered components as well as an effect on feature size. Shrinkage was also characterized and was found to be isotropic. This ruled out sintering as a source for additional dimensional variation.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3523], "author_name_tesi": "Geist, Kevin Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Geist", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Francis Heaney Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Francis Heaney Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["micro components", "filled photoresist", "powder metal"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "MEMBRANE ASYMMETRY IN APOPTOTIC CELLS, SIGNALS ASSOCIATED WITH PHAGOCYTOSIS AND THEIR IMPACT ON HIV TRANSCRIPTION\n", "id": "6921", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "753", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-11-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Transbilayer membrane phospholipid asymmetry is the defining feature between healthy viable cells and their apoptotic counterparts.  Healthy cells maintain all their phosphatidylserine (PS) and a large proportion of their phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.  Loss of asymmetry and exposure of PS on the cell surface targets apoptotic cells for destruction by macrophages.  An aminophospholipid translocase is responsible for maintaining this asymmetry.  Since all cells maintain this asymmetric distribution, all cells must have a plasma membrane aminophospholipid translocase; however, the protein responsible for this activity has never been identified.  Subfamily IV P-type ATPases comprise amphipathic transporters whose members have yet undetermined function.  If a type IV P-type ATPase were the plasma membrane aminophospholipid translocase, it should be expressed in all cells. \nUsing RT-PCR to measure gene expression, I demonstrate that multiple subfamily IV P-type ATPase members are simultaneously expressed in a single mammalian cell type.  Of the ten genes analyzed, 1c, 1d, 2a, 2b, 5c, 6f, 6g and 6h were expressed in J774 cells, NIH 3T3 cells, and PC12 cells, suggesting a more general or housekeeping role for these genes; however, these genes also stand as candidates for the plasma membrane aminophospholipid translocase.  1a was expressed in J774 cells and PC12 cells and not in the NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that 1a may have a specialized function in these cells.\nPS expression on the surface of apoptotic cells is involved in their removal from tissue in order to maintain overall homeostasis.  The engagement of phagocytic receptors by ligands such as PS found on the apoptotic cell surface results in the activation of signaling cascades that facilitate engulfment.  Macrophages and CD4+ T cells are the primary targets of HIV infection; however, unlike HIV infected macrophages which are invulnerable to the cytopathic effects of HIV, infected CD4+ T cells as well as uninfected bystander T cells undergo apoptosis.  Consequently, these infected apoptotic cells as well as the HIV virions that are released from them have external PS.  I examined how PS associated with virions and apoptotic cells influences HIV replication.  Using annexin V and PS vesicles to mask, or compete with virus-associated PS, respectively, I show that PS inhibits HIV infection at a step prior to integration but following the generation of early reverse transcription products such as strong stop DNA.  These observations suggest that PS initiated signals participate in HIV infection.  Moreover, apoptotic cells inhibited HIV transcription in macrophages that have an established infection.  This ability of apoptotic cells to suppress transcription was independent of PS, signifying that signals triggered following the interaction between an undetermined recognition ligand on the apoptotic cell surface and phagocytic receptor on the macrophage surface might affect HIV infection of monocytic cells.  Furthermore, Elmo, a key signaling molecule that is associated with phagocytosis inhibited HIV transcription in infected macrophages, demonstrating that signaling events associated with phagocytosis of apoptotic cells participate in the establishment of HIV infection and provirus transcription.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [746], "author_name_tesi": "Gekonge, Bethsebah Nyankomba", "last_name_ssi": "Gekonge", "middle_name_ssi": "Nyankomba", "first_name_ssi": "Bethsebah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Robert Allen Schlegel", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Pamela Hankey Giblin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Chair", "Robert Allen Schlegel, Committee Chair", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MACROPHAGE", "PHOSPHATIDYLSERINE", "APOPTOSIS", "PHAGOCYTOSIS", "HIV"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Pronominal and Spatio-Temporal Deixis in Contemporary Spanish Political Discourse: A Corpus-based Pragmatic Analysis", "id": "6383", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2730", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\nABSTRACT\nThe research reported in this study investigates deixis in contemporary Spanish political discourse. In particular, it focuses on the pronominal and spatio-temporal aspects of deixis and establishes a comparison with a corpus of everyday talk. Although the behavior of pronouns has received a substantial amount of attention in the Anglo-American scholarly literature, the present project represents a significant contribution to the field in Spanish. This dissertation studies in depth pronominal forms (such as yo/ nosotros/ usted, etc.), professional terms of address (su se\u00f1or\u00eda, se\u00f1or diputado), and spatio-temporal deixis (aqu\u00ed, hoy, en esta tribuna, etc.), in order to highlight the differences between political discourse in the parliament and everyday talk. Methodologically, this project draws from different paradigms. While its general framework is discourse analytic, it provides a pragmatic interpretation of the data, taking into account the linguistic and extralinguistic contexts of the speeches. It also takes from corpus linguistics in that it highlights the quantitative differences between two large corpora (political discourse and everyday talk).\nThe results suggest that several factors affect language in the parliamentary setting beyond the lexical level. Immediacy, iconicity, and the confrontational character of the interaction between members of the parliament, for instance, are aspects to be considered when analyzing the language in this particular setting. This dissertation highlights the need for a deeper understanding of political discourse beyond the lexical level.

Plasma IgG increased with increasing colostrum IgG concentration and decreased with greater bacterial content of colostrum. To assess the effect of colostrum heat treatment on immune response, bull calves in experiment 3 received subcutaneous injections of ovalbumin at 14 and 35 days of age. Blood samples were collected 0, 4, 8, and 12 h after each injection and daily for the subsequent 10 d for cytokine and IgG analysis. Plasma IL1B concentration was reduced and calf growth pattern was altered in calves fed heat-treated colostrum.

Mycologists have studied its spore dispersal mechanism, phototropism, and its possible control using biocontrol agents and different types of mulch. Virtually no research has been done, however, on the systematics, population structure, and chemical control of artillery fungi. Therefore, the goal was to elucidate the systematics of Sphaerobolus species using both molecular and morphological data, to obtain information about the biogeography of different species in the genus, and to investigate the effectiveness of various fungicides as candidates for control. \nPhylogenetic analyses of artillery fungi (Sphaerobolus spp.) isolates (n=26) were conducted to identify species boundaries in the genus Sphaerobolus. Multiple gene genealogies inferred from maximum likelihood, Bayesian and maximum-parsimony analyses of sequence data from individual loci (mtSSU, ITS, EF 1-a, and LSU) and a combined dataset (mtSSU, ITS, EF 1-a) concordantly indicate the existence of three deeply divergent lineages in the genus Sphaerobolus, each representing a phylogenetic species. These three phylogenetic species correspond to two known species: Sphaerobolus iowensis (n=12) and Sphaerobolus stellatus (n=10), and a newly discovered species, provisionally named Sphaerobolus ingoldii prov. sp. nov. (n=4). This latter species is going to be described in a separate publication. Suprageneric phylogenetic analyses of the mtSSU and LSU datasets containing representatives of related genera of the gomphoid-phalloid clade of homobasidiomycetes suggested the monophyly of the genus Sphaerobolus and that S. ingoldii prov. sp. nov. likely is more closely related to S. stellatus than to S. iowensis.\nMacro- and micro-morphological analyses of colony and basidiocarp characters confirmed that these three phylogenetic species correspond to two known species: S. iowensis and S. stellatus, and Sphaerobolus ingoldii prov. sp. nov. Species can be distinguished based on colony morphology and growth rate on agar media, and the composition and morphology of cells within the gleba. \nDespite the considerable amount of DNA polymorhism found in all species, nested clade analyses of S. iowensis and S. stellatus indicated little phylogeographic structure in either species. A very likely explanation is the extensive dispersal, due to the dual coprophilous and lignicolous ecology of Sphaerobolus species, that provides many possible dispersal scenarios over great geographic distances. However, statistically significant genotype-geography associations were detected in one clade of each species, suggesting restricted gene flow due to isolation by distance for some isolates.\nThe inhibitory effect of 14 fungicides, 13 of which were known to be effective against the basidiomycete Agaricus, was tested at two concentrations (5 and 20 ppm) on the in vitro growth of three species of artillery fungi: S. iowensis, S. stellatus, and Sphaerobolus ingoldii prov. sp. nov. Opus\u00ae, Topsin M 70WP\u00ae, triphenyltin acetate, Difolatan\u00ae, and Terraguard 50W\u00ae were the most effective inhibitors of growth for all three Sphaerobolus species; reduction in growth was directly related to fungicide concentration. Five fungicides showed varying results, depending on fungal species and fungicide concentration. Four fungicides showed no significant inhibition on these artillery fungi. Although this preliminary study provided interesting results, potential fungicides must be tested in the field and registered by E.P.A. before recommendations can be made to homeowners who want to minimize adverse effects of artillery fungi.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2715], "author_name_tesi": "Geml, J\u00f3zsef ", "last_name_ssi": "Geml", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "J\u00f3zsef", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Michael Geiser", "Donald Durwood Davis", "Daniel J Royse", "Elwin Lynn Stewart", "S Blair Hedges"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Michael Geiser, Committee Chair", "Donald Durwood Davis, Committee Chair", "Daniel J Royse, Committee Member", "Elwin Lynn Stewart, Committee Member", "S Blair Hedges, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["evolution", "mycology", "phylogenetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "ATP Release and Purinergic Mechanotransduction in Bone Cells", "id": "6532", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1351", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-02-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Osteoporosis is a disease of the skeleton that is characterized by fragile bones, which increases the risk of skeletal fracture. According to the latest report from the Surgeon General of the United States, 10 million Americans over the age of 50 have osteoporosis, and 34 million are at risk [1]. Osteoporosis causes 1.5 million skeletal fractures per year at an annual cost of $12.2\u201317.9 billion per year [2]. As the population continues to age [3], this annual expenditure will surely rise as well. Consequently, osteoporosis prevention is at the forefront of orthopaedic research. One method to prevent osteoporosis is to increase the formation of new bone while preventing the resorption of older bone. A wealth of reports have demonstrated that mechanical loads can regulate skeletal architecture by increasing the activity of bone-forming osteoblasts and inhibiting the activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. This would strengthen the skeleton and thereby reduce the risk of osteoporosis. What continues to perplex orthopaedic investigators are the cellular mechanisms whereby external mechanical forces are perceived by cells of the osteoblastic lineage and transduced into an anabolic response (i.e., formation of new bone by osteoblasts). Movement of pericellular fluid, or fluid flow, induced by mechanical loads appears to be the most likely localized signal perceived by osteoblasts and osteocytes. The application of fluid flow to these cell lineages induces a rapid, yet transient increase in cytosolic calcium (Ca2+i) that requires both calcium entry into the cell and calcium release from cytoplasmic stores [4]; changes in Ca2+i are implicated in the regulation of a multitude of cellular responses ranging from acute (such as kinase activation [5]) to trophic (i.e., proliferation [6-8]). One signaling molecule that is able to induce both calcium entry and calcium release in osteogenic cells is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which can activate both ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y receptors [9]. Indeed, the importance of P2 receptors in the calcium response of osteoblasts to fluid flow was recently demonstrated by You et al. [10]. However, the mechanism(s) whereby cytosolic ATP is released from an osteoblast or osteocyte in response to fluid flow has not been described. The overall aims of this thesis were to address how ATP is released from osteoblasts and osteocytes and to further elucidate the importance of P2 receptor activation by ATP in bone cell mechanotransduction.\nWe first examined whether osteoblasts, as the cells directly responsible for the formation of new bone, release ATP in response to fluid flow. Using a steady, laminar flow system with a flow rate that induced a shear rate of 12 dynes/cm2, we found that conditioned media from osteoblasts exposed to fluid flow for 5 minutes contained approximately 10-fold more ATP than did conditioned media from static osteoblasts (59.8+15.7 vs 6.2+1.8 nM). We next used a Harvard pump one-pass system, which perfused fresh media across the osteoblasts, to examine the time course of ATP release in response to fluid flow. We found that fluid flow induced a rapid release of ATP within one minute of the onset of flow that returned to pre-flow levels with prolonged fluid flow. That ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, increased ATP release in static osteoblasts not exposed to fluid flow, suggested that changes in Ca2+i regulated ATP release. Because the L-type VSCC (Cav1.2) and the MSCC have been implicated in the Ca2+i response to mechanical load, we hypothesized that these channels may be involved in flow-induced ATP release. We found that inhibition of the L-type VSCC with nifedipine or verapamil significantly inhibited flow-induced ATP release, whereas inhibition of the MSCC had no effect on ATP release. Inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) or hemichannel activation with either 18&#61537;-glycyrrhetinic acid or 18&#61538;-glycyrrhetinic acid failed to inhibit flow-induced ATP release, suggesting that neither GJIC nor hemichannels are involved in osteoblastic ATP release. Immunolocalization of cytosolic ATP revealed punctate, granular stores of ATP, possibly within cytosolic vesicles. As exocytosis of such ATP-filled vesicles has been implicated in endothelial cells exposed to fluid flow, we examined the effect of pharmacologic antagonists of vesicle formation, release, and fusion on flow-induced ATP release. Inhibition of each of these exocytotic steps significantly attenuated flow-induced ATP release. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that ATP is localized within vesicles in osteoblasts, and that fluid flow promotes vesicle exocytosis through a mechanism requiring calcium entry through the Cav1.2 calcium channel. Wherein load-induced osteogenesis requires prostaglandin synthesis, we demonstrated that activation of P2 purinoceptors by ATP mediates prostaglandin E2 release. \nHaving reported that fluid flow induces ATP secretion that regulates PGE2 release, we sought to refine the signaling between P2 receptor activation and PGE2 release. Flow-induced PGE2 synthesis has been shown to be due solely to cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is itself induced in response to flow. Further, we have previously demonstrated that maximal COX-2 induction in response to flow requires the activation and translocation of the transcription factor NF-&#61547;B. As such, we sought whether the effect of purinoceptor activation on PGE2 release involved NF-&#61547;B activation and translocation. Wherein fluid flow for 1 hour at a shear stress of 12 dynes/cm2 induced robust nuclear staining for the p65 subunit of NF-&#61547;B, osteoblasts flowed in the presence of an ATPase, apyrase, demonstrated cytosolic NF-&#61547;B localization. Similarly, flow-induced degradation of I&#61547;B&#61537; was impaired in the presence of apyrase, suggesting that purinoceptor activation occurs proximal to I&#61547;B&#61537; phosphorylation. Intriguingly, pharmacologic inhibition of the P2X7R also demonstrated impaired I&#61547;B&#61537; degradation, implicating this purinoceptor in flow-induced NF-&#61547;B translocation.\nAlthough many investigators examine the effect of fluid flow on osteoblast mechanotransduction, there is disagreement whether osteoblasts in vivo experience magnitudes of fluid flow used in vitro. As such, we chose to confirm our results using osteocytes which, because of their localization in lacunae and canaliculi in vivo, are speculated to be the primary mechanosensor in bone. As with osteoblasts, the conditioned media from osteocytes exposed to fluid flow contained significantly higher levels of ATP than did the conditioned media from static osteocytes. In contrast to osteoblasts, however, osteocytic ATP release was inhibited in the presence of 18&#61537;-glycyrrhetinic acid, suggesting that either GJIC or connexon hemichannels were responsible for this effect. Because of the culture conditions used, GJIC was physically impaired and these results instead implicate connexon hemichannels. Using the uptake of fluorescent dyes as a marker for hemichannel activation, we reported that fluid flow increased hemichannel activity in MLO-Y4 osteocytes, but not in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Pharmacologic inhibition of protein kinase C inhibited both dye uptake and ATP release in response to flow, strengthening the hypothesis that flow-induced ATP release occurs via connexon hemichannels. The addition of siRNA directed against connexin43 similarly impaired both dye uptake and ATP release, suggesting that hemichannels formed by Cx43 are the primary mechanism for flow-induced ATP release in MLO-Y4 osteocytes. Given the surprisingly different mechanism for ATP release between osteoblasts and osteocytes, we speculated whether purinoceptor activation differentially mediated PGE2 release among the two cell types. As with osteoblasts, the addition of ATP to static osteocytes significantly increased PGE2 release, suggesting that, despite being released by two different mechanisms, ATP activates P2 purinoceptors in both osteoblasts and osteocytes to increase PGE2 release.\nIn summary, these data suggest that mechanical load can directly regulate skeletal architecture by increasing the release of a local factor (ATP) that directly affects osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and indirectly through a mechanism involving increased prostaglandin synthesis and release.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1340], "author_name_tesi": "Genetos, Damian C.", "last_name_ssi": "Genetos", "middle_name_ssi": "C.", "first_name_ssi": "Damian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Donahue", "Randall L Duncan", "Blaise Peterson", "David A Antonetti", "Shao Cong Sun", "Neil Sharkey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Donahue, Committee Chair", "Randall L Duncan, Committee Member", "Blaise Peterson, Committee Member", "David A Antonetti, Committee Member", "Shao Cong Sun, Committee Member", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bone", "osteoblast", "osteocyte", "ATP", "hemichannel", "prostaglandin", "mechanical loading", "fluid flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A QUASI-POLAR LOCAL OCCUPANCY GRID APPROACH FOR VISION-BASED OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE", "id": "9k41zd48h", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12985", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The motivation behind the research described in this thesis is simplifying the process of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) navigation through an obstacle field: typical methods follow a two step process of map generation followed by trajectory computation; the method proposed here directly computes the likelihood that a given path is collision-free. Trajectory generation simply consists of selecting the path that is likely to be free over the longest distance. While the approach described here is independent of the choice of sensor, this thesis focuses on vision- based obstacle avoidance.\n\nThis thesis proposes a quasi-polar (turn rate-time) local occupancy grid approach for obstacle avoidance. It uses GPS and inertial navigation combined with a vision system to map sensor data directly onto dynamically feasible paths, so that path planning consists simply of selecting the path with lowest likelihood of collision.\n\nThis approach brings many new challenges besides the usual challenges posed by vision-based obstacle mapping (i.e. noisy vision measurements and highly non-linear governing equations of system lead to significant uncertainties). First, the mapping problem is not performed in the traditional Cartesian or polar coordinate frame. Second, the motion update is difficult since the cells in the quasi-polar map have different shapes and size. The boundary of grid cells can be straight lines or arcs, hence classical image processing methods cannot be used for the motion update.\n\nThese challenges are addressed by: (1) inverse sensor models that map directly onto the quasi-polar grid; (2) a numerical approach for motion updates.\n\nThree exteroceptive sensor models (wide field monocular vision, pushbroom stereo, and pushbroom stereo combined with wide field monocular) are presented in this context. Two path selectors considering the occupied probability differently are created.

With resistance of malaria mosquitoes to insecticides growing in recent years, olfactory-based surveillance and attract- and-kill strategies are becoming more important for integrated vector management, which can be used in the fight against the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, and its principal vectors, mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles. My thesis research focused on using behavioral and neurophysiological techniques to study the olfactory responses of Anopheles stephensi adults, following fungal and malaria infection. I used electroantennogram (EAG), electropalpogram (EPG) and single sensillum recordings (SSR) to study the changes in the responsiveness to odor cues of neurons in the peripheral olfactory system of mosquitoes following fungal and malaria infections. I correlated these changes in neuronal responsiveness with alterations in the host-seeking behavior of adult females that I observed, using both Y-tube olfactometer and wind tunnel behavioral assays. I also investigated the attraction of mosquitoes to spores of entomopathogenic and non-entomopathogenic fungi using olfactometer bioassays. The attraction of female An. stephensi to caterpillars of two moth species that were infected or not infected with fungi, and the possible attraction-related role of CO2 emitted by these caterpillars, was also a part of my investigation into the attraction of An. stephensi to fungal spores.\n   In chapter 1, I report the results of my studies on the effects of fungal infection on the responsiveness of the olfactory sensory neurons of An. stephensi females to mammalian host odors, using EAGs, EPGs and SSRs. I also report the results of behavioral bioassays that I conducted in the wind tunnel to study the effects of Beauveria bassiana fungal infection on females\u2019 upwind flight host-seeking behavior. The results of these studies (George et al. 2011, Malaria Journal 10:219) showed that fungal infection reduces the responsiveness of female An. stephensi to host odor cues, both behaviorally and neuronally. Exposure to B. bassiana caused significant mortality and reduced the propensity of mosquitoes to respond and fly to a host-related stimulus. Infection of females with a different fungal pathogen, Metarhizium acridum spores induced a similar decline in feeding propensity, albeit more slowly than B. bassiana infection. Reduced upwind flight host-seeking responses following fungal infection was positively correlated with the reduced olfactory receptor neuron responsiveness, measured by both EAGs and EPGs. Single cell recordings from neurons in the capitate peg sensilla of the maxillary palps confirmed that fungal-infected, behavioral non-responders exhibited significantly reduced sensitivity of neurons tuned specifically to the known attraction-related mammalian host odor, 1-octen-3-ol. This was the first study that correlated fungal-induced reductions in mosquito host-seeking behavior with a decline in olfactory receptor neuron sensitivity.\n   In chapter 2, I report the results of behavioral experiments that I performed using a Y-tube olfactometer, in which I investigated the attraction of An. stephensi females to the spores of the fungi, B. bassiana and M. anisopliae. These two entomopathogenic species are under development to be used in residual sprays applied to the interiors of human dwellings for control of Anopheline mosquito species for malaria vector control. My results show that 75-80 % of the females are attracted to fungal spores and they are more strongly attracted to the Beauveria and Metarhizium spores than they are to the spores of other species of fungi. Further experiments using B. bassiana-infected caterpillars of two moth species showed that infected caterpillars are more effective in attracting An. stephensi females than uninfected ones. My results also indicate that females landing on sporulating cadavers of caterpillars infected with B. bassiana become infected and die within 3-4 days after contact with the larvae covered with the spores. Volatile collections from dried fungal spores showed that they emit many volatile compounds at very low rates, but that some of these have been shown to be attractive to mosquitoes from other genera, including Aedes and Culex species. This is the first report of mosquito attraction to fungal spores, and it suggests that there is promise in developing the technique of applying fungal spores to surfaces as a biopesticide for malaria vector control.       \n   In chapter 3, I report the results of experiments I performed using olfactometer assays to investigate the attraction of female An. stephensi to fourth instar larvae of the moth species, Manduca sexta and Heliothis subflexa. As part of this effort to study the degree of attraction of mosquitoes towards uninfected caterpillars, and some of the possible stimuli involved, I measured the amount of CO2 produced by these larvae using a respirometer. Also, using large-scale cage assays I also measured the possible benefits of caterpillar feeding by female An. stephensi in terms of their increased longevity. Olfactometer assays using live and dead caterpillars of H. subflexa and M. sexta show that female An. stephensi are significantly attracted to caterpillars, feed on them, and survive significantly longer than females provided with no food whatsoever. The attraction of females to caterpillars is positively correlated with the emission levels of carbon dioxide from caterpillars. This part of my study suggests that caterpillar-feeding by An. stephensi, and perhaps other Anopheline species, might be occurring in nature, and the frequency of such feeding needs to be examined in the field. Such feeding could possibly be a mechanism by which fungal infection is spread in insects. \n   In chapter 4, I report the results of my experiments in which I performed EPG recordings to investigate the degree to which olfactory neuron responsiveness of female An. stephensi changes during infection with the malaria parasite, Plasmodium yoelii, over the course of its life cycle within the mosquito. My results show that there are significant changes in olfactory receptor neuron sensitivity to odorants that are correlated with the different stages of malaria parasite development. The EPGs of infected mosquitoes are significantly lower than those of uninfected individuals during the oocyst (non-transmissible) stage of P. yoelii infection, whereas they are significantly higher during the sporozoite (transmissible) stage. This is the first report of shifts in mosquito peripheral olfactory neuron responsiveness caused by a malaria parasite. It suggests that Plasmodium yoelii, and perhaps other species of Plasmodium parasites, are able to \u201cmanipulate\u201d the olfaction-related host-seeking system of their mosquito host to improve their transmission success. Such olfactory modulations during different stages of Plasmodium infection might play a significant role in the process of malaria transmission to humans, and understanding these shifts in olfaction as they relate to mosquito behavior may possibly contribute to better monitoring and control strategies against these pernicious disease vectors. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7572], "author_name_tesi": "George, Justin ", "last_name_ssi": "George", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Charles Baker", "Thomas Charles Baker", "Matthew Brian Thomas", "James Lewis Frazier", "James Harold Marden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Charles Baker, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Charles Baker, Committee Chair", "Matthew Brian Thomas, Committee Member", "James Lewis Frazier, Committee Member", "James Harold Marden, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Anopheles stephensi", "Malaria", "Fungal biopesticides", "Electrophysiology", "olfaction", "Electropalpogram"]}]
