It begins with a description of pertinent aspects of maritime culture: specifically, the ubiquitous adoption of false identities by common seamen, officers, and merchants, both in public and in private services.  After establishing this context, the project investigates the ways in which individual men had their professed identities, be they true or false, accepted or rejected by other men; and it explains the hierarchies of status which added weight to the claims of some men over others (such as that of officers over that of men from the forecastle).  This dissertation also examines American sailors\u2019 relationship with landed society.  Although sailors consciously differentiated themselves from \u201clandlubbers\u201d they also shared many of the same concerns, beliefs, and assumptions\u2014such as a conviction that a healthy community was founded on the well ordered sentiments of its members.  These shared understandings allowed sailors, despite their idiosyncrasies, to serve as symbols of the American national community.  Seamen did not accept this role passively; instead, they used it to articulate their own understanding of American nationality.  Through their songs and their writings, they argued that the genius of the American nation lay in the interrelationships of its male members.  Unlike men of other nations, sailors contended, American men joined together voluntarily in pursuit of the commonweal and the protection of individual members.  The last chapter of the dissertation shows how sailors strove to embody the ideals of American national identity to which they subscribed, and depicts the self-destructive consequences that sometimes resulted from that attempt.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1305], "author_name_tesi": "Hicks, Dan ", "last_name_ssi": "Hicks", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Pencak", "Carla Mulford", "Daniel Chapin Beaver", "Amy S Greenberg", "Sally Mcmurry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Pencak, Committee Chair", "Carla Mulford, Committee Member", "Daniel Chapin Beaver, Committee Member", "Amy S Greenberg, Committee Member", "Sally Mcmurry, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["War of 1812", "American National Identity", "American Early Republic", "U.S. Navy", "Dartmoor Prison", "Prisoners of War", "Masculinity", "Gender", "Maritime Culture", "Atlantic World", "Sailors' Songs"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Marriage Benefit in Health and Survival: A Life Table Analysis\n\n", "id": "10584", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4273", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although the association between marriage, health, and mortality at the individual level has been widely studied in the United States, less is known about marital status differences in population level indicators such as life expectancy, survival, and Active Life Expectancy (ALE), i.e. the number of years one can expect to spend free of major functional limitations.  Population level information provides essential demographic descriptions of how life chances are patterned by marital status.  ALE in particular has the advantage of examining health and mortality concurrently as opposed to separately as in many previous studies.  In the last century, fundamental shifts in family and health systems produced trends such as retreat from marriage, increasing marital instability, higher life expectancies, and increases in chronic disease and functional limitations in the oldest part of the population.  These trends underscore the importance of a continual examination of the relationship between marriage, health and mortality at the population level.\n\tThis dissertation uses a life table approach to examine the population level consequences of marriage on health and survival by gender, age, and race.  I analyze data from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), a nationally-representative study of persons age 50 and older which began in 1992 and are followed up until 2006.  Overall, results indicate that marriage is an important social institution for population health.  The benefits of marriage are apparent in higher life expectancies and survival proportions.  Although initial health status plays a significant role, married persons have lower prevalence of functional limitations and higher ALE.  Experiencing marital dissolution in old age lowers life expectancy and survival while experiencing remarriage transition improves life expectancy and survival.  Findings also show age, sex and race differences in the marriage benefits in life expectancy and survival.  Men gain more from marriage than women.  Nevertheless, women also clearly benefit from marriage, lose from marital dissolution, and gain from remarriage.  Marriage benefits tend to decrease with age for men and accumulate with age for women.  There are similar benefits of marriage for Black and White men.  However, the survival benefit of marriage is higher among Black than White women.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4247], "author_name_tesi": "Hidajat, Mira M.", "last_name_ssi": "Hidajat", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Mira", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Hardy", "Melissa Hardy", "Mark Hayward", "Valarie Elizabeth King", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook", "Linda Ann Wray", "Robert Schoen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Hardy, Dissertation Advisor", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Chair", "Mark Hayward, Committee Chair", "Valarie Elizabeth King, Committee Member", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Committee Member", "Linda Ann Wray, Committee Member", "Robert Schoen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["life table", "marriage", "health", "mortality"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Killing the Father, Killing the Children: Dialogues on Political Violence between Mexican History, Novel and Film (1959-2013)", "id": "26556", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11539", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Political violence has been present in pre- and post-revolutionary Mexico.

The intent was to examine whether counselors are prone to racially biased clinical judgments and, if so, under which clinical conditions. The first hypothesis was that racial bias would be most evident under diagnostic conditions that were ambiguous and when the race of the counselor and the race of the client in a clinical vignette were dissimilar; racial bias was defined as overpathologizing clients through low prognostic functioning ratings and high ratings of the client\u2019s severity. It was further hypothesized that underpathologization bias, defined as higher prognostic functioning and lower ratings of the client\u2019s severity, would be most likely evidenced by multiculturally sensitive participants rating racially dissimilar clients; in other words, participants would overcompensate so as to avoid the possibility that they would be perceived as racially biased. Towards this end, clinical vignettes were given to a sample of 66 graduate students and professionals within counseling psychology to examine the influences of reported client race, clarity of diagnostic condition, participants\u2019 levels of prejudice, and counselor-client racial similarity on participants\u2019 clinical judgments. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to test the interactions of participants\u2019 levels of prejudice and the racial similarity of diagnostic conditions on prognostic and severity ratings. An analysis of variance was also conducted to evaluate the effects of diagnostic clarity and racial similarity on participants\u2019 ratings of the clinical vignette\u2019s severity. The results of the study did not support the hypotheses. Regression analyses revealed that there were no significant increases or decreases in ratings of diagnostic severity and prognosis as a result of racial similarity, diagnostic clarity, and participants\u2019 levels of prejudice.

Although synthetic biomaterials have great potential, 80% of bone grafts are dependent upon donor material in the form of autografts or allografts. Should a synthetic bone graft be developed whose grafting efficacy matches that of autografts, the current gold standard, then the dependence on donor materials can be eliminated. Current synthetic grafts lack a crucial property of an ideal bone graft: osteoinduction, or the ability to induce stem cell differentiation down an osteoblastic lineage. Through the use of nanofiber surface modifications, it is hoped that synthetic grafts can become innately osteoinductive and replace other grafting technologies. \n\nAn empirical approach was used to develop nanofibers with diameters ranging from <100 nm to >1 \u03bcm. This range of diameters would permit the testing of a theory first proposed by Vogel et al.: that the curvature induced by the cell membrane bending around a small nanofiber will promote the adhesion of arfaptin, a GTPase binding vesicle trafficking protein, which will then release Rac1, a GTPase associated with focal adhesion turnover, lamellipodial extension, and proliferation. Electrospinning resulted in the formation of three distinct nanofiber groups 80\u00b140 nm, 270\u00b153 nm, and 1,048\u00b1353 nm. Immunostaining of MC3T3 cells adherent to these fibers and a control surface revealed that active Rac1 localizes along the smallest nanofibers but not the control or larger fibers. Quantitative G-LISA results on POR1 siRNA treated cells showed that small nanofibers do lead to elevated levels of active Rac1, but that these levels were enabled by POR1, not inhibited by it. The results suggest that POR1 binds active Rac1 and acts as a competitive inhibitor of GTPase-activating protein (GAP), thus decreasing the rate at which Rac1 is inactivated.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8459], "author_name_tesi": "Higgins, Andrew Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Higgins", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Justin Lee Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Justin Lee Brown, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanofiber", "Rac1", "arfaptin", "curvature sensing"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Influence of Practitioner Research on Teacher Candidates' Beliefs ", "id": "14637meh5238", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14637", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT \n\tThis phenomenological study investigates the ways in which practitioner inquiry influences preservice teachers\u2019 beliefs about teaching and learning.

The goal of this study is to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the social support process by investigating the manner in which personal, relational, and contextual qualities influence the production and reception of different social support messages. \nAs a starting point, Chapter 1 defines some of the key concepts in this dissertation. Namely, social support is introduced and reasons are established for its continued study. The remainder of this chapter discusses computer-mediated communication as a distinct communication channel with implications for the study and process of social support. \nChapter 2 provides a more detailed conceptualization and review of research on social support with a concentration on verbal person-centeredness. Verbal person-centered (VPC) messages exist within a theoretical hierarchy that describes message features that are likely to produce more or less beneficial supportive outcomes. This dissertation concentrates on the three main levels of the VPC hierarchy: low person-centered, medium person-centered, and highly person-centered messages. Given their pervasiveness in published research, this chapter also examines sex differences in the provision and reception of social support messages.\nIn Chapter 3, computer-mediated communication (CMC) is considered as a novel channel for the enactment of comforting interactions. This chapter reviews the research that has been conducted related to social support online and makes predictions about how social support is expected to unfold in CMC given the assumptions of several theories of mediated interpersonal communication. This chapter also describes a preference for online social interaction as an individual difference thought to influence people\u2019s experiences of interpersonal CMC. Consistent with the research, theory, and variables reviewed to this point, hypotheses specify the influence of personal, relational, and contextual variables on support providers\u2019, receivers\u2019, and third party observers\u2019 impressions of supportive interactions. \nChapter 4 describes an experiment designed to test the influence of several moderating variables on people\u2019s perceptions of supportive interactions. This chapter begins by describing the procedures, participants, and research design of this experiment. This project involved randomly assigning male and female participants to dyads that engaged in conversations about a personal stressor experienced by one of the participants. One participant identified a personally distressing topic to talk about, and the other participant was designated the support provider. Support providers were trained to provide one of the three main levels of person-centered support. Participants then enacted a conversation via an online or face-to-face channel. Research participants completed Internet-based surveys before and after their interactions to measure a number of personal qualities and perceptions of their conversations. Finally, this chapter summarizes the self-reported and rated variables used to test the hypotheses proposed in Chapter 3. \nThe results of this study are described in Chapter 5. Results provide support for the hyperpersonal perspective of mediated interaction because participants were able to create effective interactions online. I also observed gender differences in message production and reception. Men assigned to the highly person-centered condition experienced the greatest benefit from conducting their supportive interactions online, such that they perceived greater communicative efficacy producing comforting messages online than face-to-face. In contrast, a preference for online social interaction exerted little influence on people\u2019s perceptions of supportive interactions.\nFinally, Chapter 6 reviews the results presented in Chapter 5 and articulates the implications of this study for a theory of verbal person-centered social support and the continued study of social support in mediated contexts. Limitations of this study and benefits of using an experimental research design to study verbal person-centered social support are also discussed. The chapter concludes by proposing some directions for future research in the study of social support across face-to-face and CMC communication channels. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [44], "author_name_tesi": "High, Andrew Charles ", "last_name_ssi": "High", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles ", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Denise Haunani Solomon", "Denise Haunani Solomon", "James Dillard", "Jon F Nussbaum", "Dr Chip Gerfen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Denise Haunani Solomon, Dissertation Advisor", "Denise Haunani Solomon, Committee Chair", "James Dillard, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member", "Dr Chip Gerfen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gender differences", "computer-mediated communication", "Social support", "comfort", "Hyperpersonal perspective"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Measuring Knowledge of Mathematical Functions: Validity of Scores and Profiles of Participants", "id": "9830", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3437", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Knowledge of mathematical functions is expected of university students.

These instruments were intended to measure knowledge of functions in an efficient and effective manner such that deficits of knowledge could be clearly determined, along with clear directions for improving that knowledge. \n As an essential correlate with knowledge, beliefs about mathematics were also measured, using the Conceptions of Mathematics Scale (Crawford et al., 1998b) and a modified Teachers Epistemic Beliefs Instrument (Hennessey, 2007).\nThe instruments were administered to 640 undergraduate students. The scores on the instruments were submitted to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses in order to ascertain the structure of the scores; then profiles were established through latent class analysis. The instruments did not measure knowledge as expected. Instead the results indicate that mathematical knowledge of functions must be understood through the lens of representations, specifically their overall format of visual or symbolic representations. The beliefs measures did not substantially add to understanding of student proficiency in mathematics. Four profiles were identified, based primarily on total scores. The profiles provided a possible theory for acquisition of knowledge of functions.

In the first case we present a modeling framework for 1D fragmentation in brittle rods, in which the distribution of fragments is written explicitly in terms of the probability of breaks along the length of the rod. This work is motivated by the experimental observation of several preferred lengths in the fragment distribution of shattered brittle rods after dynamic buckling. Our approach allows for non-constant spatial breaking probabilities, which can lead to preferred fragment sizes. The resulting relation is shown to qualitatively match experimentally observed fragment distributions, as well as some other commonly reported distributions such as a power law with a cutoff.\n\nWe also present experimental observations of the trajectories and average velocities of solid spheres falling through a curtain of rising bubbles in water. For the quiescent case (no bubbles), the Reynolds numbers are on the order of 1,000, and the average terminal velocity is determined by the form (inertial) drag. The main effect of the introduction of bubbles is to slow down the spheres. In some regimes (smaller or lighter spheres), there is an added random lateral motion to the sphere paths.\nIn this way, a solid sphere sinking in a bubbly fluid and a solid sphere falling through a crowded bed of rigid obstacles (in air) share two common traits: the settling speed is slowed by the obstructions, and the sphere exhibits random lateral motion.

Yet, research suggesting viable methods to evaluate preparation programs is sparse. This limited research base suggests that effectiveness is determined by both external reviewers (i.e., accrediting agencies) and internal evaluators (i.e., faculty within a preparation program). Both external and internal reviewers rely on much the same data, commonly using methods of surveys, interviews, examinations, portfolios, and to a lesser extent, observations individually or in combination to determine program effectiveness. As there are benefits to using each method, there are a multitude of limitations. For instance, all measures are summative in nature indicating that they provide an overall picture of the program and its teacher candidates at a given point in time, often at the program\u2019s end. Additionally, measures such as examinations focus primarily on content knowledge and do not assess application of pedagogical skills. Given these limitations, teacher educators may find it difficult to identify gaps in the program or teacher candidates who are having difficulty developing necessary skills.\n\nTo address these limitations, an assessment system based on principles of curriculum-based measurement was created to assess teacher candidates\u2019 application skills. In curriculum-based measurement, alternate forms of probes (i.e., quizzes) are administered repeatedly to monitor the students\u2019 progress over time. In this study, 20 undergraduate special education teacher candidates enrolled in a large eastern university were evaluated on one strand of the teacher preparation curriculum, defining and measuring behavior, using a series of 4 application probes plus a post-test measure. Results indicated that probes were internally consistent, and alternate forms of the probes were equivalent. In terms of validity, probes were not able to predict overall course grades, but were able to predict performance on the post-test. Additionally, when using the post-test data as the outcome measure, probes were able to discriminate among high, medium, and low performers.

The Like-Envelope Recombination (LER) algorithm was developed as a post-decomposition tool that can be used to pull similar signal components back together in an effort to create simple signals that directly correlate to some physical aspect of the system in question. The basis of the LER algorithm is the idea that signal components that are generated by the same source will have similar amplitude structures. This algorithm has largely been a success, but still requires manual intervention to complete the recombination process for more complex signals. This thesis details the specifics of both the EMD and the LER algorithms and provides examples and references for the algorithms and how they might be applied. It is found that, when used appropriately, the EMD/LER algorithm combination can be a successful tool for research and teaching purposes. However, due to a high complexity level, these algorithms remain impractical for real-time analysis application.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10582], "author_name_tesi": "Hildebrandt, Timothy John", "last_name_ssi": "Hildebrandt", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Carl Swanson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Carl Swanson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Empirical Mode Decomposition", "Intrinsic Mode Functions", "Signal Recombination", "Signal Processing", "Signal Decomposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Hydrogen sulfide production in manure storages on Pennsylvania dairy farms using gypsum bedding", "id": "28854", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11044", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recycled gypsum products can provide a cost-effective bedding alternative for dairy producers. Manufacturers report reduced odors, moisture and bacteria in the stall environment when compared to traditional bedding and agronomic benefits upon land application of stored manure. Gypsum, calcium sulfate (CaSO4\u00b72H2O), provides a sulfate source that can be converted to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) under anaerobic manure storage conditions. Agitation of stored manure promotes release of volatile gases including potentially concentrated plumes of H2S. Incidents have been reported anecdotally linking human and cattle injury and death to dangerous levels of H2S emission released from manure storages containing gypsum-based bedding.  But not all farms using gypsum bedding have experienced problems.  This study was undertaken to determine if gypsum bedding was contributing to elevated H2S concentrations during manure agitation and, if so, what biophysical factors or management practices contribute to unsafe conditions.\nObservations at 19 farms from three dairy manure categories were compared: (1) traditional, organic bedding; (2) gypsum-based bedding, and (3) gypsum-based bedding with a commercial product added to the manure that reportedly reduces H2S emissions. Portable meters placed around the perimeter of dairy manure storages recorded H2S concentrations every minute prior to and during agitation events during fall and spring hauling seasons. Manure samples from just below the surface crust and at the bottom of the storage were collected prior to agitation with a third sample collected from the mixed manure. A detailed farm characterization documented manure storage design parameters, manure handling practices and inputs to the manure storage facility.\nResults show that manure storage agitation at farms that use gypsum in bedding produced H2S concentrations that were considered immediately dangerous to life and health (above 100 ppm). Increasing gypsum use significantly increase cumulative H2S concentrations (P-value <0.0001).  Farms that used an amendment exhibited lower H2S concentrations yielding a trend line having an R-squared value of 0.86.  However the lower cumulative H2S concentrations were not significantly attributed to the manure additive (P-value=0.725).  More data could strengthen this trend and prove statistical significance.  Manure analyses support gypsum increases total sulfur content and lowers phosphorus source coefficient (PSC) values.  Data did not support the claim that gypsum use promotes nitrogen retention or reduced somatic cell counts.\nA statistical model did not pinpoint farm practices or environmental conditions that significantly affect H2S production and release from storage. However, empirical observations indicated low H2S concentrations from storages when manure was transferred from temporary pits before ending up in the final stage of storage.  Wind direction also appeared to affect H2S concentrations near the manure storage during agitation.  With wind blowing into a structure proximate to the manure storage, H2S concentrations were observed to increase due to the structure inhibiting dissipation.\nAn emissions model was developed that predicted cumulative H2S concentrations after 60 min of agitation to within approximately 15% of measured H2S concentrations.  Dangerous levels of H2S were predicted during periods immediately following calm wind conditions (<1.1 km h-1) at locations where physical structures inhibited dispersal of H2S plumes.  \nThis work quantitatively documents the potentially dangerous levels of H2S release during agitation of outdoor manure storage structures containing gypsum.  Greater awareness of the risks to human and animal health is needed in the dairy industry.  Future work includes developing solutions to reduce H2S emissions so that the use of gypsum bedding can continue to benefit the dairy industry without creating hazardous environments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10620], "author_name_tesi": "Hile, Michael Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Hile", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eileen Eilzabeth Fabian", "Eileen Eilzabeth Fabian", "Herschel Adams Elliott", "Clarence Alan Rotz", "Ray B.

The first study explores the influence of sexual selection on vocalizations in nonhuman anthropoids. Recordings of 1451 vocalizations from 40 species were measured for vocal fundamental frequency (F0), the acoustic correlate of pitch. Data on mating system, habitat, and male and female body size were collected for these species. Controlling for body size sexual dimorphism, we found that males had relatively lower F0 compared to females in polygynous species than in monogamous species, indicating that sexual selection favors lower F0 among anthropoids.  \n\nThe second study focuses on men\u2019s vocal, facial, and body masculinity in order to evaluate the relative influence of individual traits on mating success and the mechanisms, form, and direction of these sexual selective pressures. We ascertained men's dominance and attractiveness from male and female acquaintances. On a large American university campus, 63 men from two social fraternities provided anthropometric measurements, facial photographs, voice recordings, and reported mating success (number of sexual partners). These men assessed each other's dominance, and 72 women from two socially affiliated sororities assessed the men's attractiveness. We measured facial masculinity from inter-landmark distances and vocal masculinity from acoustic parameters. We additionally obtained facial and vocal attractiveness and dominance ratings from unfamiliar observers. Results indicate that dominance and the traits associated with it predict men's mating success, but attractiveness and the traits associated with it do not. \n\nThe final study concerns relationships between the human voice and fluctuating asymmetry (FA), a putative biomarker for genetic quality. We explored these relationships in three samples representing both US university participants (Study 1: n=91 males; Study 2: n=151 males and 233 females) and Tanzanian hunter-gatherer participants (Study 3: n=51 males and 64 females). Voice recordings were collected and rated for attractiveness, and measures of FA were computed from two- and three-dimensional facial images, as well as finger lengths. Only among Study 2 females did we observe the previously-documented negative relationship between vocal attractiveness and FA as measured from two-dimensional facial imagery. No relationship was found between vocal attractiveness and three-dimensional FA. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9365], "author_name_tesi": "Hill, Alexander Kirkland", "last_name_ssi": "Hill", "middle_name_ssi": "Kirkland", "first_name_ssi": "Alexander", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Andrew Puts", "David Andrew Puts", "Mark Shriver", "Nina G Jablonski", "Daniel J Weiss", "Drew Rendall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Andrew Puts, Dissertation Advisor", "David Andrew Puts, Committee Chair", "Mark Shriver, Committee Member", "Nina G Jablonski, Committee Member", "Daniel J Weiss, Committee Member", "Drew Rendall, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sexual selection", "Vocalization", "Anthropoids", "Evolutionary psychology; Fluctuating asymmetry"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Complex Formation and Protein Interaction in the Cellulose Synthesis Complex of Arabidopsis", "id": "29535", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12537", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "All plant cells are encapsulated by cell walls, which serve multiple roles in plant growth, strength, and protection.

For this to be effective and useful upon graduation, students must be able to function in a way similar to experts in that field\u2014merely learning subject content is insufficient. Thus it is desirable to investigate how experts think and operate in the real world. How do professionals view content knowledge of the field? What meaningful connections do they perceive among this information? How do they apply this structural knowledge to actual procedures and problem solving? And how does an investigator determine this in order to inform the instructional design of an educational program? \n\nTo discover the mental process behind expert performance, cognitive and procedural techniques can be applied to produce mental models, which are internal conceptual and operational representations of a subject or system developed over time and experience. Cognitive maps can be generated that reveal how individuals structure their knowledge of a subject, showing meaningful connections among terms and concepts. These maps can then be compared to actual performance of a problem or task, analyzing how they approach a task and what they are thinking throughout the process. The literature supports the conclusion that experts think and behave quite differently from novices; therefore a great deal of study has been performed analyzing and comparing the mental models of experts and novices in a variety of disciplines. The purpose of this study was to compare the mental models of professional recording engineers in the music industry with seniors enrolled in a music recording degree program at a four-year college. The results were intended primarily to inform the instructional design and implementation of the program as well as to provide recommendations that can be applied to other similar educational programs. \n\nEliciting structural knowledge of recording engineering concepts involved the application of the card sort procedure. Participants sorted a list of 20 terms and concepts into piles that indicated how they thought they related to each other. This data was then used to produce visual cognitive maps through multidimensional scaling statistical techniques. Procedural knowledge was analyzed by having participants think aloud as they completed tasks using Digidesign\u2019s industry standard Pro Tools recording software. Operational and thought patterns were then derived through analysis and comparison from both sets of data. \n\nAs expected, the expert engineers possessed a more refined, highly structured knowledge of the field that enabled them to figure out various tasks even if they were inexperienced with the specific software used in the study. Differences between individual work experiences and personalities also led to variations in how they perceived recording systems and procedural situations. Student performance varied in terms of structural accuracy and ability to accomplish the tasks, but overall indicated a largely coherent mental model of how recording systems operate. One of the chief problems was the software itself; most often participants were clear on what they needed to do, but those with less experience with the Pro Tools system had difficulties understanding the fairly cryptic interface design. The few poor performers also suffered from inadequate mental models of how to solve the problem, compounding their lack of knowledge of the software. Recommendations are provided for designing similar instructional programs.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [768], "author_name_tesi": "Hill, Barry R", "last_name_ssi": "Hill", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Barry", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Susan Land", "Dr Brian Smith", "Peggy Noel Van Meter", "Priya Sharma"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Susan Land, Committee Chair", "Dr Brian Smith, Committee Member", "Peggy Noel Van Meter, Committee Member", "Priya Sharma, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multidimensional scaling", "card sort", "mental model", "expert-novice", "instructional design", "structural knowledge"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The role of peptide YY in energy homeostasis", "id": "17542", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8382", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary purpose of this dissertation is to understand the physiological role of peptide YY (PYY) in response to both acute and chronic changes in energy balance and body weight in women.  The specific goals of this dissertation are to characterize the diurnal rhythm of PYY with regard to acute dietary energy intake and explore its role in energy balance, to determine if the proposed opposing actions of ghrelin and PYY at the hypothalamus could be related to their patterns in the peripheral circulation both prior and subsequent to diet- and exercise-induced weight loss, and to determine whether low-energy dense diets might facilitate weight loss through actions on circulating concentrations of ghrelin and PYY.  Study 1 was designed to characterize features of the diurnal rhythm of PYY and to explore the role of PYY in energy balance in normal weight premenopausal women. We demonstrated that PYY displays a meal-driven diurnal rhythm and is correlated to resting metabolic rate, a major contributor to energy expenditure. Thus, PYY varies in accordance with energy content and RMR, supporting a role for PYY in energy balance modulation.  Study 2 was designed to determine if the proposed opposing actions of ghrelin and PYY at the hypothalamus could be related to their patterns in the peripheral circulation during a period of weight stability in non-exercising, normal weight premenopausal women.  We demonstrated that circulating concentrations of PYY were inversely associated with ghrelin over an entire 24 hour period. We concluded that these data provide evidence that PYY may contribute to the modulation of the secretion of ghrelin in normal weight, premenopausal women over a 24 hour period which supports similar inferences from experimental studies in animals and humans.  The purpose of Study 3 was designed to determine if diet- and exercise-induced weight loss would alter the 24-hour profile of total circulating PYY and to determine if the association between 24-hour circulating concentrations of PYY and ghrelin observed during a period of weight stability (study 2) will be altered subsequent to a period of diet- and exercise-induced weight loss in normal weight, premenopausal women. We demonstrated that no change occurred in the 24-hour profile of total circulating PYY subsequent to diet- and exercise-induced weight loss and that the association observed at baseline between ghrelin and PYY (Study 2) was weakened subsequent to diet- and exercise-induced weight loss where circulating concentrations of ghrelin increased despite administration of exactly the same calorie and macronutrient content of meals during the 24-hour analyses. We also created a variable to illustrate an index of hormonal exposure in an attempt to demonstrate the potential predominance of ghrelin over PYY in the circulation in response to weight loss. To accomplish this, we calculated the ghrelin/PYY ratio over 24 hours at baseline and the post intervention time points. The lunch ghrelin/PYY mean was significantly higher at post intervention and trends toward significant increases were observed in the dinner and nocturnal ghrelin/PYY means demonstrating that the time frame during which uncoupling of the ghrelin and PYY profiles occurred was mainly throughout the lunch to dinner time period. This uncoupling may represent periods during which there is a predominance of ghrelin over PYY in the circulation subsequent to weight loss which may promote weight regain. The purpose of Study 4 was to determine whether low-energy dense diets might facilitate weight loss through actions on circulating concentrations of ghrelin and PYY, independent of the influence of psychosocial measures of dietary restraint, disinhibition, and tendency toward hunger in overweight and obese women.  We demonstrated that reductions in dietary energy density may promote weight maintenance after a period of weight loss by opposing increases in ghrelin in response to an energy deficit that can lead to weight regain, as well as by promoting increases in circulating concentrations of the satiety hormone PYY. Overall, ghrelin and PYY are likely important factors involved in the response to, as well as the modulation of body weight regulation in women.  As well, ghrelin and PYY may modulate on another during a period of weight stability, but that association may be altered in a state of energy imbalance where the 24-hour profile of ghrelin, but not PYY is elevated. Lastly, low energy dense diets may impact circulating concentrations of ghrelin and PYY in such a manner as to promote satiety and prevent weight re-gain subsequent to a period of weight loss.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8298], "author_name_tesi": "Hill, Brenna Renee", "last_name_ssi": "Hill", "middle_name_ssi": "Renee", "first_name_ssi": "Brenna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy Williams", "Mary Jane De Souza", "Barbara Jean Rolls", "Michael Henry Green"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy Williams, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Jane De Souza, Committee Member", "Barbara Jean Rolls, Committee Member", "Michael Henry Green, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["peptide YY", "premenopausal women", "energy balance"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Evolution and Development of Temporal Bone Pneumatization in Hominids\n", "id": "8886", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "917", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project investigates ontogenetic and evolutionary changes in temporal bone pneumatization, the process leading to air-filled cavities in adult temporal bones.  Important conclusions regarding hominid phylogeny have included temporal bone pneumatization as a phylogenetic, or species-specific, marker.  Despite its previous inclusion in evolutionary analyses, a number of questions remain concerning the evolutionary and developmental changes in hominid temporal bone pneumatization, as well as the developmental and functional basis for observed variation in pneumatization.  This study includes three sets of analyses aimed at determining whether temporal bone pneumatization is an appropriate and informative marker for evolutionary change.  First, ontogenetic changes in temporal bone pneumatization in modern humans were investigated.  Second, comparative analysis of adult morphology of temporal bone pneumatization in five extant primate species was completed.  Third, evolutionary changes in temporal bone pneumatization in both living and fossil Homininae species were analyzed.  For the first and second studies, bone volume fractions, anisotropy, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, surface area and volume were measured in high resolution x-ray computed tomography scans acquired from adult primates and a cross-sectional ontogenetic series of humans.  The third study was achieved using medical resolution scans previously acquired from fossil species, extant African apes, and modern humans.  \n\tChanges in the extent of pneumatization over evolutionary and ontogenetic time are accompanied by changes in the bony material analyzed here.  A number of species-specific and age-specific differences in temporal bone pneumatization were noted.  The species-specific changes did not correspond to known evolutionary or morphological affinities among the species in the study.  Analyses of the ontogenetic changes in pneumatization show that temporal bone pneumatization is a dynamic process that is influenced by epigenetic factors.  Correct inclusion of a character in phylogenetic analyses requires that the character show consistent morphological differences among species that are minimally influenced by epigenetic factors.  These results suggest that temporal bone pneumatization is not appropriate for inclusion in phylogenetic analyses, since the morphology of temporal bone pneumatization demonstrates patterning, either stochastic or of unknown origin, across species and age groups.   \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [909], "author_name_tesi": "Hill, Cheryl Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Hill", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Cheryl", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Therese Richtsmeier", "Alan Walker", "Timothy Michael Ryan", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss", "Carol V Gay"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Therese Richtsmeier, Committee Chair", "Alan Walker, Committee Member", "Timothy Michael Ryan, Committee Member", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Committee Member", "Carol V Gay, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["computed tomography", "pneumatization", "temporal bone", "human", "African apes"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Population Ecology of Grassland Sparrows on Reclaimed Surface Mine Grasslands in Pennsylvania", "id": "15671", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7928", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Grassland sparrow populations have experienced substantial declines across their range, and reclaimed surface mine grasslands have been recognized for their importance to grassland sparrow populations. The influence of vegetation structure on the probability of nest survival for grassland bird species has received considerable attention. There is some evidence that the mere presence of woody vegetation results in decreased survival rates, but these results are correlative in nature. Increasingly, individuals and institutions have called for the removal of woody vegetation from grasslands to promote grassland sparrow populations. To understand how woody vegetation and landscape components affect grassland sparrow ecology on reclaimed surface mine grasslands I implement two research projects. \nFor the first research project, I monitored grasshopper (Ammodramus savannarum) and Henslow\u2019s (A. henslowii) sparrow population dynamics over a three-year period (2009-2011) across eight 20.2 ha plots of surface mine grasslands with various amounts of scattered woody vegetation coverage (~5-36%) in Pennsylvania. Using a before-after-control-design for pairs (BACIP), woody vegetation was removed from treatment plots following the first breeding season. I monitored daily nest survival (DNS), interspecific brood parasitism rates, fledgling production and calculated changes in apparent survivorship, juvenile return rates, and population growth rates in response to woody vegetation removal. Following woody vegetation removal the DNS of 216 nests was unaffected by either the density of woody vegetation around a nest, distance to closest shrub, or shrub coverage percent for either species. I recorded no incidences of interspecific brood parasitism by brown cowbirds (Molothrus ater). Grasshopper and Henslow\u2019s sparrow DNS probabilities (mean \u00b1 SE; 0.952 \u00b1 0.001, 95% CI: 0.950 \u2013 0.955), regardless of treatment or control plot status, were at least as high as other studies have previously reported. Fledgling production from successful nests, however, declined slightly (95% CI: -0.046 \u2013 -0.002, per unit change on the logit scale) as woody vegetation coverage increased across plots. My results suggest that the presence of woody vegetation on reclaimed surface mines does not necessarily equate to poor nesting habitat for grasshopper and Henslow\u2019s sparrows, and that both species successfully nest and produce young in habitats with greater amounts of woody vegetation than has previously been considered. The grasshopper sparrow apparent survival rate did not differ between control and treatment plots (all years and plots \u03d5 = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.34 \u2013 0.52). Henslow\u2019s sparrow populations, however, experienced a three-fold decrease in apparent survivorship following woody vegetation removal compared to Henslow\u2019s sparrow populations on control plots (\u03d5 = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02 \u2013 0.35, and \u03d5 = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.12 \u2013 0.43, respectively). The overall grasshopper sparrow population size across treatment plots increased by 14% (\u03bb = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.14 \u2013 1.16) from 2009-2011 while the overall population on control plots declined (\u03bb = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.82 \u2013 0.85). Henslow\u2019s sparrow populations declined more rapidly on treatment plots compared to control plots over the same time period (\u03bb = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.65 \u2013 0.70, and \u03bb = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.85 \u2013 0.89, respectively). Henslow\u2019s sparrow population size for any given plot and year was 0.12 (95% CI: -0.09 \u2013 0.33) the size of the grasshopper population on that plot. I observed low juvenile annual return rates for Henslow\u2019s and grasshopper sparrows (3.7% and 1.8%, respectively) across all plots. My results suggest that removal of woody vegetation from surface mine grasslands has a positive and immediate effect on grasshopper sparrow populations and no positive effect on Henslow\u2019s sparrow populations at least during the two years following woody vegetation removal. \nIn the second research project I used unpublished data from 2002 and newly-collected data from 2011 to estimate how grasshopper and Henslow\u2019s sparrow densities and surface mine vegetation have changed during those 9 years. I visited 61 surface mine grasslands in 2011; twenty-three of those had been previously visited in 2002. Vegetation changed very little over those 9 years, but woody vegetation increased by 2.6 fold, and grasshopper and Henslow\u2019s sparrows declined by approximately 13% and 7% per year, respectively. Grasshopper sparrows were 2.41 times more likely to occupy a grassland than Henslow\u2019s sparrows, and both species were more likely to occupy large and simply-shaped grasslands with low perimeter-to-area ratios and with few woody shrubs that were dominated by grass cover. My results suggest that without management that reclaimed surface mine grasslands are ephemeral habitats, but that low densities of both species occur on small grasslands (\u226413 ha) and on grasslands with extensive woody vegetation coverage (up to one woody shrub per 16.5 m^2). Forecasted declines in Appalachian coal production over the next several decades will likely result in a 50% reduction of newly-created reclaimed surface mine grassland. Populations of grasshopper and Henslow\u2019s sparrows in Pennsylvania will likely continue to decline as they become concentrated on these small, isolated and woody grasslands.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7847], "author_name_tesi": "Hill, Jason Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Hill", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach", "Robert Brooks", "Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Tyler Wagner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Brooks, Committee Member", "Tracy Lee Langkilde, Committee Member", "Tyler Wagner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ammodramus", "before-after-control-impact-design", "occupancy", "mark-recapture", "robust-design"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "High Precision Surface Control of Flexible Space Reflectors", "id": "11748", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2969", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Flexible reflectors are used for a number of applications in space, including resource monitoring, weather analysis, hazard assessment, reconnaissance, and imaging.  With the rapid advances in deployable membrane and mesh antenna technologies, the feasibility of developing large, lightweight reflectors has greatly improved, though high-precision surface control is needed in order to achieve the required surface accuracy.  The purpose of this research is to advance the state of the art by implementing high-precision surface control on a flexible reflector using PVDF actuators, as well as introducing methods to overcome real world problems that can develop when implementing this technology.  \nA reflector/actuator system is modeled such that the model can be quickly modified in order to accommodate different actuator locations.  Experimental results show that while the analytical reflector model is generally correct, due to idiosyncrasies in the reflector it should not be used for online control.  Therefore, a methodology is proposed for online system identification for use with an online control law.  \nUsing the PVDF actuators, surface control is executed using a least squares control law, where photogrammetry is used to determine the out-of-plane displacement at designated points on the surface.  When the surface cannot be fully covered with actuators, optimal placement of the available actuators must be considered.  First, when focusing solely on the constraint on the number of possible actuators, optimal placement of the actuators is found using a genetic algorithm.  A constraint on how many independent power supplies are available is added.  A new method to determine the optimal grouping of actuators to power supplies is derived, called the En Masse Elimination (EME) method.  This method can determine the global optimal solution without having to exhaustively search every possible grouping combination.  A number of improvements to the EME method are given which increase the speed of the algorithm as well as enable the EME algorithm to be used online during dynamically changing error conditions.  \nFinally, the EME method is experimentally validated using a single pinned-pinned beam.  Using a beam rather than a reflector reduces the complexity of the problem while still showing the functionality of the EME algorithm.  Experimental data show that the EME algorithm is able to quickly and accurately find the global optimal actuator grouping.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2961], "author_name_tesi": "Hill, Jeffrey Ray", "last_name_ssi": "Hill", "middle_name_ssi": "Ray", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Kon Well Wang", "Dr Kon Well Wang", "Christopher Rahn", "George A Lesieutre", "Mary I Frecker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Kon Well Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Kon Well Wang, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Chair", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gossamer", "control", "En Masse Elimination", "modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Arabidopsis Cellulose Synthesis: A Complex Greater than the Sum of its Parts", "id": "25050", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11001", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In higher plants, cellulose biosynthesis is catalyzed by a large, plasma membrane-localized cellulose synthesis complex (CSC), visualized as a hexameric rosette structure.

The overall goal of this thesis was to determine whether these two rock types impart distinct biogeochemical properties to soils and plants. The effects of rock type (lithology) on soil gas concentration, nutrient concentration and nutrient limitation were studied in the Ridge and Valley province of central Pennsylvania. To increase understanding of lithological controls on soil gases (Chapter 1), we monitored the depth distribution of soil CO2 and O2 concentrations in central Pennsylvania in two watersheds on different lithologies.  We deployed gas monitoring instrumentation on two catena transects that included four topographical positions, one located on sandstone and the other on shale. As expected, with increasing soil depth O2 concentrations decreased while pCO2 increased. CO2 and O2 concentrations varied more with topographical position than with lithology, as the valley floor positions in both catenas had the highest pCO2 for a given depth. Both manual sampling from gas access tubes throughout the soil profile and continuous sampling by buried sensors documented these patterns. Adjacent forests underlain by shale and sandstone lithologies are prevalent throughout the Appalachian Mountains and may have differences in nutrient concentrations and limitation due to the lithologies and subsequent weathering. Nutrient limitation in temperate forest ecosystems often regulates plant productivity, and contemporary conceptual models emphasize nitrogen (N) as the main limiting nutrient. However, with increased global fossil fuel emissions and subsequent deposition of nitrogen, this assumption may not hold. In ecosystems that are receiving high N inputs, the availability of phosphorus (P) and cations, such as calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), may become a key determinant of plant growth. In many conceptual models, plant-soil interactions are depicted; however, lithology is often not incorporated. We use five sites located on shale lithology and five of sandstone lithology to investigate nutrient pools in the mineral soil and the foliage of two tree species (Chapter 2). Our results show that shale and sandstone weather to form different nutrient availability signatures, with higher availability of most rock-derived nutrients on shale. However, extractable P and inorganic N concentrations were higher in the sandstone-derived soils.  Furthermore, trees grown on the sandstone sites had higher foliar P concentrations and lower P resorption at senescence.  These results suggest that relative to shale, soils developing on sandstone ridges have more P available in soil and less P limitation to plants, despite lower P concentrations in the underlying rock.  We hypothesize that higher P availability on sandstone ridges is not from in situ weathering of sandstone, but rather, a possible result of periglacial loess deposits. In conclusion, our studies showed that 1) lower landscape positions have more soil CO2 and could have higher carbonic acid weathering than other landscape positions and 2) sandstone-derived soils have greater concentrations of extractable N and P, which may be the result of higher deposition inputs (in the case of N) or historical loess (in the case of P), than the cation rich shale.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13803], "author_name_tesi": "Hill, Lillian Z", "last_name_ssi": "Hill", "middle_name_ssi": "Z", "first_name_ssi": "Lillian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye", "Roman Alexander Dibiase", "David Eissenstat", "Patrick Joseph Drohan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye, Thesis Advisor", "Roman Alexander Dibiase, Committee Member", "David Eissenstat, Committee Member", "Patrick Joseph Drohan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lithology", "Nutrient Cycles", "Critical Zone", "Soil Gas", "Soil Properties", "Temperate Forest"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Computational Investigation of Gear Windage", "id": "11387", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4171", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A CFD method has been developed for application to gear windage aerodynamics.

Interventions targeting acute cognitive decline in this population are largely unexplored, and moderators of intervention effectiveness have yet to be determined.\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether personality moderated cognition-focused intervention outcomes in individuals at high risk for cognitive decline: those with dementia and delirium. \n\nMethods: This study utilized a portion (n=71) of the sample participating in a randomized repeated measures clinical trial, Recreational Stimulation for Elders as a Vehicle to Resolve Delirium Superimposed on Dementia (RESERVE-DSD). Subjects with dementia and concurrent delirium were recruited upon admission to one of seven Pennsylvania nursing homes with post-acute services for rehabilitation following hospitalization; all diagnoses were adjudicated by an expert panel. The control group received routine nursing care and prescribed therapies as typically delivered for their particular health condition. In addition to usual care, subjects randomized to the treatment group received 30 minutes of cognitive stimulation daily for up to 30 days. The intervention consisted of personally tailored, mentally challenging recreational activities that incrementally increased in difficulty. Baseline measures included demographic characteristics, ApoE \u03b54 status, Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire, the Modified Blessed Dementia Rating Scale, and the NEO\u2122 Personality Inventory-3. Measures of delirium, attention, orientation, memory, and executive function were taken daily for both groups. Engagement in the intervention was measured by the time spent on task (up to 30 minutes) as well as the level of participation. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the moderating effects of the five personality traits on the four cognitive outcomes, as well as main effects on engagement outcomes among the treatment group. \n\nResults: Significant moderating effects of personality traits were found with regard to two cognitive outcomes: agreeableness moderated the memory outcome and extraversion moderated the executive function outcome. Individuals with higher agreeableness were more likely to have improved memory outcomes, and those with lower extraversion more likely to have improved executive function outcomes, as a result of the cognition-focused intervention. Lower openness, higher agreeableness, and lower conscientiousness were associated with greater engagement in the intervention.\n\nConclusion: Personality traits are known to influence a wide variety of health and treatment outcomes, and their role in cognition-focused interventions for individuals with dementia and delirium is in line with these findings. The consideration of personality in further development and testing of these interventions will provide for clarification and characterization of these effects.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8670], "author_name_tesi": "Hill, Nikki Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Hill", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Nikki", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ann Marie Kolanowski", "Donna Marie Fick", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli", "Rita Jablonski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ann Marie Kolanowski, Committee Chair", "Donna Marie Fick, Committee Member", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Committee Member", "Rita Jablonski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dementia", "delirium", "personality", "moderators", "cognitive interventions"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "WORKING FORESTS WITHIN CONSERVATION EASEMENTS:\nIMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND CROSS-BOUNDARY COOPERATION\n\n", "id": "12490", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5149", "abstract_tesi": "Pennsylvania, like many Eastern states, faces unique challenges in retaining its working forest. Total population has changed relatively little in recent years, but a recent study at Penn State University found the state has at least 600,000 private forests owners who hold nearly 12 million acres of forest, an increase of 11 percent over previous contemporary estimates. The average tenure for these ownerships is nine years and as a result of changing ownerships and frequent parcelization, the potential to retain working forests, or meet landowner objectives, is threatened. Developing approaches to help private forest landowners cooperate across boundaries in watershed neighborhoods, sustain working forests, and improve forest management and conservation at the landscape level is important and challenging.\n\tSixteen interviews with private forest landowners who have conserved their properties with easements were conducted to evaluate the working forest reservations and restrictions within the conservation agreements and the owners' motivations for using this type of land protection. Focus groups and facilitated discussions were conducted with private forest landowners to assess their willingness to cooperate in watershed neighborhoods for working forest management goals and conservation easements. A literature review of Pennsylvania's land conservation laws was conducted to discover regulatory tools already in existence that may be used to encourage cross-boundary cooperation.\n\tThe conclusions from this study suggest that while encouraging landowner cooperation on a landscape level may be a lofty goal, there are potential mechanisms to begin the conversations and encourage conservation. Helping landowners recognize their shared values is important for future communication and cooperation, and lays the foundation for future cooperative efforts. Pennsylvania's Agriculture Security Area law has been used to help conserve agricultural properties. Forest properties qualify under some provisions of this program. Establishment of forested Agriculture Security Areas may be one method of bringing together property owners on a landscape level to begin the conservation conversation. \t\t\t\t\t\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5121], "author_name_tesi": "Hill, Richard David", "last_name_ssi": "Hill", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Allyson Muth", "Barbara Muth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Allyson Muth, Thesis Advisor", "Barbara Muth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cross-boundary cooperation", "conservation easement", "Working forests"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Chemistry of Subcritical Water Reactions of a Hardwood Derived Lignin and Lignin Model Compounds with Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide\n\n\n\n", "id": "12418", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3962", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<p>Biofuels, like cellulosic ethanol, may only be cost effective if the lignin byproduct is upgraded to value-added products. However, lignin\u2019s inherent aromatic structure and interunit crosslinkages hinder effective conversion. High temperature H<sub>2</sub>O is considered for lignin conversion, because H<sub>2</sub>O exhibits unusual properties at higher temperatures (particularly at its supercritical point of 374\u00b0C and 3205 psi) including a decreased ion product and a decreased static dielectric constant (similar to those of polar organic solvents at room temperature) such that there is a high solubility for organic compounds, like lignin. Much of the research concerning lignin and supercritical H<sub>2</sub>O has focused on further decomposition to gases (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>) where nearly no char formation is expected in the presence of a catalyst. However, the conditions required for supercritical H<sub>2</sub>O are difficult to maintain, catalysts can be expensive, and gases are not favorable to the current liquid fuel infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Reactions using Organosolv lignin, subcritical H<sub>2</sub>O (365\u00b0C) and various industrial gases (N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, CO, and CO<sub>2</sub> at an initial pressure of 500 psi) for 30 min. were examined to determine both lignin\u2019s potential to generate value-added products (e.g., monomer compounds and methanol) and the role (if any) of the H<sub>2</sub>O and the gases during the reactions. The behavior of H<sub>2</sub>O at reaction temperature and pressure is expected to be similar to the behavior of supercritical H<sub>2</sub>O without the need to maintain supercritical conditions. Different characterization techniques were used for the products collected including primarily GC/FID-TCD of the evolved gases, GC/MS analysis of the organic liquids, solid phase microextraction analysis of the water, and solid state <sup>13</sup>C-NMR analysis of the residues. The reactor pressure at temperature was shown to influence the reactivity of the H<sub>2</sub>O and lignin, and the highest conversions (&#8776;54-62%) were obtained when adding a gas. However, the collected solids from the CO reactions appeared to be the most reacted (i.e., the most changed from the unreacted lignin) according to solid state <sup>13</sup>C-NMR analysis, and the widest variety of products (methoxy-substituted phenolic compounds) were obtained when using CO according to GC/MS analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, reactions with CO were completed that varied the initial reaction pressure (300, 500 and 800 psi) in order to elucidate the effects of CO pressure. Similar conversion (&#8776;54-58%) and DCM-soluble liquid product yields (&#8776;53-62%) were obtained for the different pressure reactions, but the reactions with an initial pressure of 500 psi had the greatest change in aromaticity from the unreacted lignin. Additional reactions between Organosolv lignin and H<sub>2</sub>O with CO (initial pressure of 500 psi) were conducted where the reaction time was varied (15, 30 and 60 min.) to determine the effect of reaction time. Longer reaction time (60 min.) appeared to inhibit conversion to low molecular weight compounds (i.e., conversion and DCM-soluble yields were lower at &#8776;53% and &#8776;28%, respectively). Solid state <sup>13</sup>C-NMR of collected residues also showed that there are losses in carbons representative of both guaiacyl and syringyl components as reaction time increases, which may indicate that methoxy groups are being cleaved or the products are reacting with each other (i.e., repolymerization) to form high molecular weight compounds as reaction time is increased.</p>\n\n<p>The role of H<sub>2</sub>O and the gases during the baseline reactions and the expanded CO reactions is not intuitive based on the results, so reactions with lignin model compounds (i.e., aromatic aldehydes represented by vanillin and syringaldehyde, aromatic ketones represented by acetovanillone and acetosyringone, and aromatic ethers represented by dibenzyl ether and 2-phenethyl phenyl ether) were completed to study this. From these results, the suggested reaction pathway of Organosolv lignin reactions in subcritical H<sub>2</sub>O with and without added pressure is: 1) cleavage of ethers (via hydrolysis) to form smaller methoxy-substituted phenolic monomers with aldehyde- or ketone-substituents representative of lignin monomers; 2) cleavage of the methoxy-, aldehyde- and/or ketone-substituents to form primarily methoxy-substituted phenolic monomers; 3) rearrangement of these phenolic monomers due to the enhanced pressure at reaction temperature; 4) formation of oligomers due to interaction amongst the methoxy-substituted phenolic monomers, which is also due to the enhanced pressure at reaction temperature; and 5) repolymerization of the monomers and oligomers to form high molecular weight compounds (i.e., longer reactions times or different pressures seemed to enhance these reactions). Under these conditions, depolymerization seems to be the dominant reaction pathway versus repolymerization.</p>\n\n<p>Reactions with lignin and H<sub>2</sub>O at 365\u00b0C have not been previously reported nor has the reaction chemistry for lignin depolymerization at these conditions been established. The results with lignin (or lignin model compounds), subcritical H<sub>2</sub>O and CO also show that the desired product slate can be modified with different pressure and time conditions. In particular, increasing reaction time (from 15 to 60 min.) caused lignin conversion to decrease, and the products appeared to be reacting with each other. However, the longer reaction time also showed that more methanol is generated (along with more solids).</p>\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3934], "author_name_tesi": "Hill Bembenic, Meredith A", "last_name_ssi": "Hill Bembenic", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Meredith", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Caroline Elaine Clifford", "Caroline Elaine Clifford", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Nicole Robitaille Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Caroline Elaine Clifford, Dissertation Advisor", "Caroline Elaine Clifford, Committee Chair", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member", "Nicole Robitaille Brown, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lignin ether cleavage", "lignin model compounds", "lignin depolymerization", "cellulosic ethanol", "subcritical water reactions with lignin", "high temperature water reactions with lignin"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "An Examination of Leadership Beliefs and Leadership Self-Identity: Constructs, Correlates, and Outcomes\n", "id": "6836", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4659", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The way we think about ourselves as leaders and what we believe leadership to be are important guides of subsequent thoughts and actions in the leadership domain.

While there are many factors that may be said to influence this persistence rate, the important factors within instructional systems designers\u2019 control are the ways technology is used in a course design and the ways in which it is applied to augment the distance learning environment to enhance the ultimate learning outcomes of students in a given online program. This study examines the relationship between student factors influenced by technology in two online distance learning programs providing professional military education to military officers and civilian equivalents in the United States Army and the United States Air Force.  I gathered data for 3,074 students enrolled in the Army War College program and for 63,638 students enrolled in the Air Command and Staff College program.  A document analysis of the past ten year\u2019s attrition data and student surveys was conducted to search for patterns in attrition behavior to establish if a relationship exists between student perceptions of technology in the course design and attrition.  This study tests the hypothesis that a student\u2019s classification as a digital native or digital immigrant (Prensky, 2001a) influences perceptions of educational technology and their attrition from a program of study.  While prior research in this area has sought to define these categories and the expected behaviors of each of the respective groups, this study seeks to better understand how a combination of factors rather than just age may define one\u2019s status and influence attrition in this online distance learning environment. The implications are relevant to the design of online instructional systems capable of engaging and educating future generations of military officers to ensure the readiness of the military forces to meet their assigned missions and are likely to be applicable to online students outside of the military.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4187], "author_name_tesi": "Hills, Michael K", "last_name_ssi": "Hills", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernard James Jansen", "Bernard James Jansen", "Andrea H Tapia", "Brian Harold Cameron", "Priya Sharma"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernard James Jansen, Dissertation Advisor", "Bernard James Jansen, Committee Chair", "Andrea H Tapia, Committee Member", "Brian Harold Cameron, Committee Member", "Priya Sharma, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Attrition", "Distance Learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Effects of Dairy Products on Blood Pressure, Endothelial Function, Lipids and Lipoproteins, and Intracellular Ion Dynamics in Caucasian Adults with Stage 1 Hypertension\n\n\n", "id": "6778", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3414", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Background:  Hypertension (> 140/90 mm Hg) is responsible for more deaths than any other risk factor for CVD and is predicted to become the leading cause of death and disability worldwide by 2020.  It is a common and powerful independent predisposing factor for development of coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and heart failure.  Approximately 65 million Americans (29%) are at increased risk for morbidity and premature death due to elevated blood pressure.  Diet and lifestyle modification are the first lines of defense against hypertension; yet, the optimal diet to maximize blood pressure-lowering is uncertain due to limited and conflicting studies.  The high prevalence of hypertension, its powerful impact on the incidence of CVD, and the potential impact of control justify high priority efforts to detect and treat elevated blood pressure.  Evidence suggests that dietary patterns that include increased calcium and dairy consumption may lower blood pressure or limit its rate of increase with age, however, findings from these studies demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in the blood pressure response to increased calcium.  \n\nObjective:  The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of dairy products in blood pressure regulation via favorable alterations in intracellular ion balance, hemodynamics, hormone systems, lipids and lipoproteins, and endothelial function.  \n\nDesign:  Using a randomized, 3-period, cross-over design, 23 volunteers (16 male and 7 female) with stage 1 hypertension were fed in random order three experimental diets for 5 weeks each: an average American diet (AAD) serving as a control diet, a diet high in fruits and vegetables but low in dairy (F&V), and a diet similar to the F&V diet but rich in dairy products (D-F&V).  All three experimental diets were compositionally matched for sodium (3500 mg), protein (18% kcal), monounsaturated fat (14% kcal), and dietary cholesterol (300 mg) content.  The AAD was low in fruits, vegetables, and dairy foods and contained 36% of kcal as total fat, 15% of kcal as saturated fat, 7% of kcal as polyunsaturated fat, 46% of kcal as carbohydrate and 10.5 g dietary fiber.  The design of the F&V and D-F&V diets was compositionally similar but differed from the AAD with respect to macronutrients (total fat 30% kcal, saturated fat 7% kcal, polyunsaturated fat 9% kcal, and carbohydrate 52% kcal, and dietary fiber 27 g).  In addition, the amount and kind of fruits and vegetables were identical across these two experimental diets.  To specifically test the effects of dairy, the D-F&V diet provided 3.4 servings/d of dairy products compared with 0.4 servings/d in the F&V and AAD diets.  The D-F&V diet was higher in calcium (1200 mg), potassium (4600 mg), magnesium (420 mg) and phosphorus (1700 mg) compared with the F&V and AAD diets.  The calcium content of the F&V and AAD diets was matched (400 mg), but the F&V diet vs. the AAD was higher in potassium (3900 vs. 1750 mg), magnesium (370 vs. 190 mg), and phosphorus (1300 vs. 1150 mg).  This innovative diet design allowed us to examine whether a diet rich in dairy products could reduce blood pressure in adults with essential hypertension to a greater extent than a diet high in fruits and vegetables but low in dairy foods and a diet typical of the American diet.  At the end of each diet period, blood pressure, lipids and lipoproteins, calcium regulatory and renin-angiotensin systems, erythrocyte cations, intraplatelet free ionic calcium mobilization, cell adhesion molecules, and endothelial function were measured.  \n\nResults:  Compared to the low calcium AAD and F&V diets, the D-F&V diet significantly lowered intraerythrocyte calcium by ~4.4% (p < 0.0007) and significantly increased intraerythrocyte magnesium by ~17.4% (p < 0.004).  The ratio of intraerythrocyte calcium to magnesium also was significantly lower on the D-F&V compared with the F&V and AAD diets (p < 0.0002).  Intraerythrocyte sodium tended to be lower on the D-F&V diet vs. the F&V diet (p < 0.06) and intraerythrocyte potassium was unaffected by diet type.  The diet-related changes (i.e. experimental diet \u2013 AAD control diet) in RBC Ca were negatively correlated with age (r = -0.52, p = 0.0406) and positively correlated with BMI  (r = 0.50, p = 0.0508).  \n\tThe D-F&V diet also lowered the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (p = 0.0004) by 19.0% compared to the F&V diet and by 28.4% compared to the AAD.  The levels of serum calcium and the other calcium-regulating hormones, PTH and calcitonin, did not change across diets.  Intraerythrocyte calcium was significantly correlated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (r = 0.51, p = 0.0229), suggesting that intracellular calcium was reduced via suppression of this hormone.  \n\tAngiotensin II levels were 42.6% lower on the D-F&V diet compared with the AAD (p < 0.0044).  Angiotensin II levels on the F&V diet were intermediary and not significantly different from either the D-F&V diet (p = 0.1855) or the AAD diet (p = 0.2422).  However, measures of renin activity and ACE activity did not significantly differ between diets.  \nFlow mediated dilation of the brachial artery was similar across all three experimental diets.  However, the D-F&V diet produced a significantly larger basal arterial diameter than the F&V (p = 0.05) and control (p = 0.0042) diets.  Similarly, the largest peak diameter followed the D-F&V diet, which was 6.7% greater than the control diet (p = 0.0232).  Furthermore, the changes in intraerythrocyte magnesium were positively correlated with the changes in FMD (D-F&V r = 0.35, p = 0.1788; F&V r = 0.68, p = 0.0018), such that participants with the greatest increase in RBC Mg exhibited the greatest improvements in FMD.  \nThe D-F&V diet reduced VCAM-1 by about 18-19% compared with the F&V diet (p < 0.0541) and the AAD diet (p < 0.0543).  Compared with the AAD diet, ICAM-1 was significantly reduced (~6.7%) by both the D-F&V (p < 0.0550) and F&V diets (p < 0.0571).  E-selectin was significantly reduced following the D-F&V diet vs. the control diet (p = 0.0036) and marginally reduced vs. the F&V diet (p = 0.0677).  P-selectin followed a similar pattern, with the D-F&V diet eliciting the lowest levels (D-F&V vs. AAD, p = 0.017; D-F&V vs. F&V, p = 0.1393). \n       The D-F&V and F&V diets elicited significantly greater reductions in total and LDL cholesterol than AAD (p\u2019s < 0.05); the magnitude of the decreases (-6% and 4%, respectively) was comparable in these two lower saturated fat diets.  There was a main effect of diet for the change in HDL cholesterol (p = 0.0049); both the D-F&V and F&V diets lowered HDL cholesterol by approximately 5.7% compared with the AAD.  The ratios of LDL:HDL cholesterol and Total:HDL cholesterol remained unchanged.  Triglycerides were reduced by each diet, however; only the changes from screening following the AAD were significant (p = 0.0432), probably due to the higher fat content of the AAD diet.  \n\tIn the complete sample (n=23), all three experimental diets significantly decreased systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure compared to screening (SBP: -7.0%, -8.7%, -8.5%; DBP: -5.7%, -7.7%, -7.6% for ADD, F&V, and D-F&V diets, respectively, p < 0.0004).  Furthermore, the F&V and D-F&V diets elicited significantly greater decreases in SBP and DBP compared to the AAD (p < 0.05); however, the two intervention diets did not differ.  Although not measured at screening, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and stroke volume were similar across the three experimental diets.  Diet-related changes in intraerythrocyte calcium were positively correlated with changes in DBP (D-F&V r = 0.55, p = 0.0259; F&V r = 0.46, p = 0.0539).  Changes in SBP were also positively associated with changes in intraerythrocyte calcium, but the correlations were nonsignificant (D-F&V r = 0.37, p = 0.1593; F&V r = 0.35, p = 0.1558).\n\tBecause changes in intracellular calcium are postulated to influence blood pressure regulation, a post hoc analysis was conducted to determine possible treatment effects based on each subject\u2019s diet-related change in intraerythrocyte calcium.  Subgroup analysis (n=18) revealed that only subjects who responded to the dairy-rich diet by significantly reducing intracellular calcium, termed the (Ca)i Change group, exhibited significantly greater decreases in DBP on the D-F&V (-13.7 \u00b1 3.4) compared with the AAD (-8.1 \u00b1 3.4, p < 0.0001) and the F&V diet (-10.1 \u00b1 3.4, p = 0.0135).  The magnitude of the change in DBP on the F&V diet was also significantly greater than the control diet (p = 0.0181).  Furthermore, the subjects in the (Ca)i Change group had significantly lower DBP while on the D-F&V diet compared with their counterparts (p = 0.03).  SBP followed a similar pattern.  In the (Ca)i Change group, the D-F&V diet elicited a significantly greater reduction in SBP compared with the AAD (-18.6 \u00b1 3.9 vs. -13.7 \u00b1 3.9, p < 0.0141).  The change in SBP on the F&V diet was intermediary and did not differ from the other two diets.  Levels of DBP and SBP were similar across all three diets in subjects who did not exhibit substantial reductions in intraerythrocyte calcium.  \n\tIn 16 subjects, arginine vasopressin-stimulated increases in cytosolic free ionic calcium in platelets after each diet period were measured.  On all three diets, arginine vasopressin induced a rapid elevation in intracellular free Ca2+ that was significantly different from the baseline level (p < 0.0001).  After this initial rise, Ca2+ incrementally declined until returning to baseline levels after about 120 seconds post-stimulation.  In addition, the peak change in intracellular free Ca2+ was significantly higher following the AAD (492 \u00b1 45%) vs. the F&V diet (352 \u00b1 44%, p = 0.0159) and the D-F&V diet  (372 \u00b1 47%, p = 0.0469).\n \nCorrelations existed between several study variables following the control AAD.  As previously reported, age was correlated with SBP (r = 0.62, p = 0.0028) and FMD (r = -0.47, p = 0.0309).  Intraerythrocyte calcium also was positively associated with age (r = 0.49, p = 0.0274), 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (r = 0.51, p = 0.0229), total peripheral resistance (r = 0.58, p = 0.0077), and SBP (r = 0.58, p = 0.0075) and negatively associated with cardiac output (r = -0.49, p = 0.0267).  RBC Na was positively associated DBP (r = 0.70, p = 0.0006), while RBC K was negatively associated with DBP (r = -0.46, p = 0.0407).  The ratio of 24-h Na urinary to urinary Ca was marginally associated with SBP (r = -0.24, p = 0.0610) and MAP (r = -0.38, p < 0.0930), such that as the ratio increased the levels of SBP and MAP decreased.  The relationship between urinary Na:Ca and SBP became significant when the correlation was adjusted for age (r = -0.45, p < 0.0471).  \tAs expected, there was a strong inverse association between total peripheral resistance and cardiac output (r = -0.89, p < 0.0001) and SBP was positively correlated with total peripheral resistance (r = 0.51, p = 0.0170) and negatively correlated with cardiac output (r = -.048, p = 0.0274).  In addition, renin activity and angiotensin II were directly related (r = 0.43, p = 0.0506).\n\nConclusion:  The results of the present study confirm that a low fat diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products reduces blood pressure in Caucasian stage 1 hypertensive adults.  Of particular interest, the addition of three servings of dairy foods to a diet already high in fruits and vegetables and low in total and saturated fat enhances the blood pressuring lowering response in some types of hypertension.  Furthermore, our results suggest that the addition of dairy foods may alter vascular tone, via suppression of angiotensin II or normalization of intracellular ion balance; however, due to the small sample size, caution is warranted in forming generalized conclusions.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3402], "author_name_tesi": "Hilpert, Kirsten Fay", "last_name_ssi": "Hilpert", "middle_name_ssi": "Fay", "first_name_ssi": "Kirsten", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Sheila Grace West", "Rebecca L Corwin", "John Edgar Smith", "Michael B Zemel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Chair", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Chair", "Rebecca L Corwin, Committee Member", "John Edgar Smith, Committee Member", "Michael B Zemel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dairy", "hypertension", "nutrition", "endothelial function", "milk", "lipids"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A SOLID-STATE HEAT PUMP USING ELECTROCALORIC CERAMIC ELEMENTS\n\n", "id": "9402", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4130", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The thermoacoustic cycle is a robust thermodynamic cycle that can be generalized\nto describe and develop an all-solid-state heat pump using generic caloric elements.\nFerroelectric barium strontium titanate (BST) and relaxor lead magnesium niobate - lead titanate (PMN-PT) are two candidate materials for the caloric elements using the electrocaloric effect.

Additionally, these unique polymers required the development of novel reaction methods or the investigation of new phosphazene chemistry to achieve their synthesis.  Chapter 1 lays out some of the basic principles and fundamentals of polymer chemistry.  A historical overview of phosphazenes is also included along with an indepth look at the chemistry of polyphosphazenes and how they relate to advanced materials for power generation and biomedical applications.\nChapter 2 investigates the use of iodinated polyphosphazenes as x-ray opaque materials.  Single-substituent polymers with 4-iodophenoxy or 4-iodophenylanaline ethyl ester units as the only side groups were prepared. Although a single-substitutent polymer with 3,5-diiodotyrosine ethyl ester groups was difficult to synthesize, probably because of steric hindrance, mixed-substituent polymers that contained the non-iodinated ethyl esters of glycyine, alanine, or phenylalanine plus a corresponding iodinated substituent, could be synthesized.  Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy was used to follow the substitution of side groups onto the phosphazene back bone and judge the ratio of substituents.  Heterophase studies of the hydrolysis of iodo-amino acid/non-iodinated amino acid side group species in deionized water at 37 \u00baC followed a bulk hydrolysis profile, with the rates dependent on the structure of the side groups.  The effectiveness of these polymers as X-ray opaque materials was examined by the use of the poly(organophosphazenes) and conventional organic polymers as filters for copper K&#945; or rhenium-tungsten-molybdenum radiation.  The phosphazene polymers that contained iodine in the side groups were opaque to X-rays, whereas the conventional organic polymers were essentially transparent to the same radiation.\nChapter 3 details the initial investigation into 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine ethyl ester and dopamine substituted polyphosphazenes that could be applied to a number of applications.  L-DOPAEE was acetonide protected to prevent crosslinking reactions by the catechole functionality.  Cyclic small molecule studies and macromolecular substitution reactions on the linear high polymer were conducted with the protected L-DOPA.  After isolation of the substituted phosphazene, the acetonide protecting group was removed in acidic conditions.  Attempts to acetonide protect dopamine by the same method as L-DOPA yielded 6,7-dihydroxy-1,1-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolinium (DTTQ) by an acid catalyzed Pictet-Spengler reaction.  DTTQ was utilized in chlorine substitution reactions at both the trimer and polymer levels.  Weather it was obtained as a single substituent or glycine, alanine, or phenylalanine ethyl ester cosubstituted polymer, the hydrolytic stability of DTTQ polyphosphazenes was evaluated.  As a result or oxidative instability or coordinated hydrochloric acid, the DTTQ substituted phosphazenes readily hydrolyzed when exposed to deionized water.  Continuing studies into protection of the dopamine catechol have elucidated a viable method for the synthesis of amino-linked dopamine polymers.\nChapter 4 describes a method for the synthesis of phosphazenes with quaternary amine complexes as potential antibacterial agents.  Replacement reactions of pyridine alkoxides and chlorophosphazenes were first attempted at the small molecule level to study the reactivities of pyridine alkoxides.  The formation of an insoluble product indicated the participation of pyridine alkoxides in macromolecular substitution, but a co-substituent was necessary for the formation of a soluble product.  In order to obtain a soluble product at the polymer level, a typical two-step addition, side group exchange reactions between poly[(trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene] and 4-pyridine propoxide, and a three-step addition were attempted.  Only the three-step addition where the solubilizing co-substituent is added first and last yielded soluble pyridine propoxy polymers.  Pyridine methoxy substituted polymers were noted to be more soluble than their pyridine propoxy analogues and a homosubstituted pyridine methoxy polyphosphazene was obtained.  Quaternization of the pyridine nitrogen was possible when an excess amount of 1-bromohexane was added to the reaction.  Anti-bacterial studies with low polymer loadings (<900 &#956;g/mL) did not show any therapeutic activity.  Higher loadings (&#8805; 1500 &#956;g/mL) should be evaluated during future studies.\nChapter 5 evaluates the potential for functionalization of polyphosphazenes by \u201cclick\u201d chemistry with the intent of forming pendent 1-H-[1,2,3]-triazoles.  Alkynoxides were co-substituted on the cyclic trimer with trifluoroethoxide as a proof of concept.  The co-substitution was translated to the high polymer with both methoxyethoxyethoxide and trifluoroethoxide.  Two different methods of \u201cclick\u201d chemistry were utilized.  The first method was the use of triphenylmethyl azide as an activated species and subsequent deprotection of the trityl-protected triazole.  A second method utilized TMS-azide which directly produces the 1-H-[1,2,3]-triazole in relatively high yield.  This method has prospective utility in the production of proton-conducting membranes, metal coordination chemistry, and many other areas.\nChapter 6 examines the hydrophobicity and reactivity of a phosphazene system with engineered branches of well defined length occurring at precise intervals along the polyphosphazene backbone.  Poly[(hexachlorophosphazo)tetrachlorophosphazene] was synthesized by the thermal ring opening polymerization of its monomer which is prepared by the treatment of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene with ammonia followed by phosphorous (V) chloride.  The polymer was treated with trifluoroethoxide and the hydrophobicity of fiber mats obtained by electrospinning were evaluated.  The increased fluorine loading found in this polymer does not give an enhancement of the hydrophobic character when compared to linear trifluoroethoxy substituted polyphosphazenes.  Cyclo-linear phosphazene polymers were synthesized from phosphazo precursors by adapting methods developed for the living cationic polymerization.  Polymers contained 27, 2, or 1 P=N unit between each ring in the structure. Phosphazene-organic hybrid polymers were also prepared from the phosphazophosphazene cyclic monomer and were connected by reacting with a diamine.  Molecuar weight analysis of these cyclo-linear polymers show that with optimization, it may be possible to obtain high molecular weight species.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4022], "author_name_tesi": "Hindenlang, Mark David", "last_name_ssi": "Hindenlang", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock", "Harry R Allcock", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Alan James Benesi", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock, Dissertation Advisor", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Alan James Benesi, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["proton conducting", "radio opaque", "biocompatible", "Polyphosphazene"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF COVER CROPS AS INSECTARY PLANTS ON INSECT NATURAL ENEMIES AND THEIR POTENTIAL FOR CONSERVATION BIOLOGICAL CONTROL", "id": "14726jxh557", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14726", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Agronomic cropping systems are often highly disturbed, lacking alternative resources for natural enemies critical for suppressing pests.

However, natural enemies exhibit preferences toward specific flowering plants. Furthermore, different plant species may provide different resources. Therefore diverse insectary mixtures may be deliberately designed to more effectively support targeted natural enemies.  I established buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum, and cowpea, Vigna unguiculata, in monocultures and mixtures adjacent to corn, Zea mays, to test the effects of insectary provisioning on the natural enemy community, predator dispersal between cover and cash crops, and potential for pest suppression.

The 2011 Monitoring the Future survey (MTF) found that half of the adolescents in a nationwide study had tried an illicit drug by the time they finished high school. Recent studies report higher rates of alcohol and other illicit drug use among rural adolescents when compared to urban counterparts and rural adolescents remain an understudied portion of the population (Mink, Moore, Johnson, Probst, & Martin, 2005; Spoth, Goldberg, Neppl, Trudeau, & Ramisetty-Mikler, 2001; Zollinger, Saywell, Overgaard, Przybylski, & Dutta-Bergman, 2006). Scholars have called for further investigation into the experiences of rural adolescents and the extent to which social processes, such as the role of social support, can help reduce drug use among rural youth. Based on interviews with 113 rural adolescents, this study identified and described the sources and functions of social support messages rural adolescents report receiving within the context of substance use and analyzes their appraisals of those messages. Results indicate that parents, adult experts, and siblings were the most common sources of social support for rural adolescents. Functions of support include emotional, esteem, informational, instrumental, and network support. Informational, instrumental, and emotional support were the most frequently provided functions, while esteem and network support messages were much less common. In terms of emotional support, adolescents gave a positive appraisal to messages from parents that conveyed care and to messages from individuals who had been through similar experiences. Messages providing informational support, the most frequently provided function, were appraised positively when the advice was provided by a source who modeled that behavior, as well as when the advice was provided by a source that was able to base the message on a similar previous experience. Participants noted that siblings were particularly adept at providing advice that was based on previous, shared experiences to which the adolescents could easily relate. In terms of instrumental support, rural adolescents valued messages provided by friends and siblings when intervening during a substance offer, either advocating for them or physically threatening the source of the offer. Messages that provided alternatives to substance use also received a positive appraisal. This was particularly true for adolescents who had a history of substance use.

Traffic signal timings are directly related to the delay vehicles experience at signalized intersections. Typically, traffic engineers select signal timings to minimize the total delay experienced by vehicles at the entire intersection. At first glance, this is a fairly reasonable thing to do\u2014minimizing the total delay at the intersection reduces the negative impacts imparted onto cars. However, there are many other possible objectives to consider when selecting signal timings at a signalized intersection. An engineer may wish to consider the approach or movement delay separately and assign a weight of importance to each. For example, one approach may experience heavy bus traffic, and thus its delay might need to be weighted more heavily to reduce the total delay experienced by all passengers served by the intersection. Or, by increasing the delay of one approach by a small amount, the delay of another approach may decrease by a large amount thus providing a more equitable distribution of delay at the intersection. These and other cases are generally not considered under current signal timing standard practice. Even when they are, no methodology exists to incorporate multiple objectives into signal timing optimization.\n\nIn light of this, the goal of this research is to develop methods that traffic engineers can use to optimize signal timings while considering multiple, potentially competing, objectives. The methods proposed rely on the application of a well-known multi-objective optimization (MOO) genetic algorithm, NSGA-II, to obtain a set of signal timings that consider multiple objectives that may be relevant when selecting signal timings. The set of possible signal timings obtained by the MOO represents a Pareto frontier that defines the optimal tradeoffs that exist between the unique objectives. The research applies relatively new MOO visualization techniques to easily explore the tradeoffs between objectives that exist within this Pareto frontier and proposes new techniques to identify and remove objectives that might not be necessary. Additionally, methods are proposed to select the best solution in the Pareto frontier based on how a user values each of the potentially competing objectives.

What is less known is how FCNs are contributing to the health and well-being of community-dwelling older adults in the support of successful aging? \nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to describe ways in which FCNs contribute to the health and well-being of older adults to successful aging as well as identify gaps in supportive health care to serve this growing population.\nMethods: To examine interventions provided by FCNs, with a specific focus on older adults, a secondary analysis of data from the Henry Ford Health System Faith Community Nursing/Health Ministries Documentation and Reporting System was conducted.  Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the distribution of interventions across age groups, and then data was filtered into two distinct age groupings, 0-65 years and 66 years and older, to focus on interventions specifically involving older adults. Data from the 66 years and older age group was then mapped to the multidimensional model of successful aging to reveal how FCNs contribute to the health and well-being of older adults. \nResults: Across all age groups, FCNs are promoting health. Large numbers of people are participating in education and support group activities. Nutrition education and healthy lifestyle support groups are two of the most frequently attended group activities. However, when examining group activities for older adults, there appears to be no specific education or support group focused on the 66 years and older age group. The spiritual aspect of care begins to emerge as a support group activity for all ages, and the unique specialty of Faith Community Nursing starts to become more evident in individual interventions. Here, individual intervention contacts with older adults more than double compared to the 0-65 age group, and the intervention of active listening becomes the primary focus. One of the unique features of Faith Community Nursing practice is lack of time constraints for interactions with clients as well as the spiritual aspect of care. When mapped to the model domains, a cluster of group and individual interventions do align with the multidimensional model of successful aging suggesting FCNs are contributing to the health and well-being of older adults.\nConclusion: Considering more than half of the clients seen by FCNs in this study were age 66 and older, there does not exist a clear delineation of education and support group activities specifically for older adults. Greater effort could be put forth in promoting physical and mental health for this age group as well as providing opportunities for social interaction exposure. This study informs and advances research in this specialty practice. It also highlights the contributions FCNs are making to promote health and prevent disease for all age groups. Findings from this study provide recommendations to simplify electronic documentation to improve precision for future analysis and the need for greater care coordination between FCNs and nurse navigators. Further research on the linkage between Faith Community Nursing interventions and outcomes for persons with chronic disease is needed.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12657], "author_name_tesi": "Hixson, Lina Beth", "last_name_ssi": "Hixson", "middle_name_ssi": "Beth", "first_name_ssi": "Lina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janice Lee Penrod", "Janice Lee Penrod", "Susan Jayne Loeb", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Jenny Trinitapoli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janice Lee Penrod, Dissertation Advisor", "Janice Lee Penrod, Committee Chair", "Susan Jayne Loeb, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Jenny Trinitapoli, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Faith Community Nursing", "Faith Community Nurse", "Successful Aging", "Older Adult", "Multidimensional Model", "Interventions"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION AND TAILORING OF THE MICROPOROUS LAYER|CATALYST LAYER INTERFACIAL STRUCTURE IN POLYMER ELECTROLYTE MEMBRANE FUEL CELLS\n\n\n", "id": "10808", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2008", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The interface between the micro porous layer (MPL) and the catalyst layer (CL) can have an impact on thermal, electrical and two-phase mass transport in a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC).

In this work, optical profilometry is used to characterize the MPL and CL surfaces at the sub-micron level scale to gain a better understanding of the surface morphology. Selected MPL and CL surfaces are sputtered with a thin layer of gold to enhance the surface reflectivity for improved data acquisition. The results show that, for the materials tested, the MPL surface has a relatively higher roughness than the CL surface, indicating the potential dominance of the MPL surface morphology on the local transport and interfacial contact across the MPL|CL interface. Another surface characteristic that can have a profound influence on multi-phase transport is the existence of deep cracks along the MPL and CL surfaces. \n\nIn the second part of this study, the MPL and CL surfaces are tailored via polishing for improved interface mating characteristics. Furthermore, hydrophilic micro-channels are integrated into diffusion media (DM) structure and the MPL surface is artificially cracked via laser ablation. The tailored samples are expected to reduce water accumulation inside the CL, GDL and the interfacial gaps between the MPL and the CL. Finally, behavior of liquid water inside the MPL cracks is investigated using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). ESEM observations suggest that liquid water removal from the CL could take place through the MPL cracks which are connected to preferential water pathways in the GDL. Canalization of the water condensed in the MPL pores towards the MPL cracks could also be influential on the water transport in the MPL.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1990], "author_name_tesi": "Hizir, Fahri Erinc", "last_name_ssi": "Hizir", "middle_name_ssi": "Erinc", "first_name_ssi": "Fahri", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clinton Matthew Mench", "Matthew M Mench", "Emin C Kumbur"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clinton Matthew Mench, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew M Mench, Thesis Advisor", "Emin C Kumbur, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer electrolyte fuel cell", "water management", "catalyst layer", "microporous layer", "interface", "characterization"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Rhetoric of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001: History, Economics, and Coercion\n", "id": "10059", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4174", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis undertakes a rhetorical examination of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB).

This thesis studies the language of the law itself, rhetorically analyzing the text of NCLB.  Although NCLB is the textual focus of this project, this examination of NCLB must draw on additional texts as they are necessary to contextualize the rhetoric of NCLB within a broader historical discourse on public education in the United States as well as within the contemporary cacophony of federal education policy.  Particular attention is paid to the rhetoric of authority operating in NCLB.  This thesis examines the ways in which NCLB justifies, executes, and enforces its authority through rhetoric, taking a chapter to address each.  This focus on authority connects the rhetorical components of NCLB with some of its social and institutional implications.  In order to do so, this thesis examines how: (1) the legal history of NCLB is mobilized as a justification for its authority, (2) NCLB executes its authority over education through the characterization of education as economic, and (3) NCLB enforcement its authority through coercion and depoliticization resulting in the first federally endorsed pedagogy.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4149], "author_name_tesi": "Hlavacik, Mark Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Hlavacik", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Walter Benson", "Thomas Walter Benson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Walter Benson, Thesis Advisor", "Thomas Walter Benson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["No Child Left Behind Act of 2001", "education policy", "Rhetoric", "coercion", "statutory rhetoric"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A Rhetorical History and Criticism of U.S. Education Policy, 1980-1994", "id": "20511", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9679", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates the rhetoric of blame in the public discourse of United States education policy. As the frequent object of reform since the mid-nineteenth century, public education in the United States has inspired a great deal of blame. Public education\u2019s blameworthy have included teachers, students, parents, administrators, and entire governments. Not even inanimate concepts like segregation, genetics, race, class, and progressivism have escaped the allegation of culpability. In the permanent reform that is U.S. education policy, blame is an expedient tool for rhetorical actors because it insinuates the need to change both policy and leadership. Blame is not only expedient for rhetorical actors; it is also invigorating for rhetorical exchange. Acts of blame rarely go unanswered and so blaming renews the cycle of policy reform by initiating a process of deliberation. Although blaming itself is often blamed for being simplistic or misguided, this dissertation sets out with the assumption that blame, like any rhetorical act, has use value and thus entails strategy. The profusion of blame in the public discourse of education policy during the 1980s and early 1990s provides both a guiding question (What is all of this blame doing here?) as well as an abundance of opportunities to plumb blame\u2019s rhetorical depths. This dissertation accounts for some of blame\u2019s functions as a deliberative strategy through the close analysis of four prominent acts of public blaming. Moreover, by reconstructing the recent history of blaming in U.S. education policy discourses, this dissertation recovers the rhetorical antecedents of \u201caccountability.\u201d", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9439], "author_name_tesi": "Hlavacik, Mark Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Hlavacik", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Walter Benson", "Jeremy Engels", "Rosa A Eberly", "Kirtley Hasketh Wilson", "Keith Gilyard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Walter Benson, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeremy Engels, Committee Member", "Rosa A Eberly, Committee Member", "Kirtley Hasketh Wilson, Committee Member", "Keith Gilyard, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rhetoric of Public Policy", "Education Policy", "Jonathan Kozol", "Milton Friedman", "A Nation at Risk", "Richard J.

The basic concept of beamed-energy propulsion is generating thrust by heating up propellant with outside beamed energy, either by laser or microwaves, instead of with the inner (chemical) energy of propellants in traditional propulsion systems. This method can provide higher theoretical specific impulse than traditional chemical propellants. Furthermore, the separation of the energy source from the vehicle can increase the payload mass fraction. \nIn this research, the proposed method to transform beamed energy of continuous-wave microwaves to thrust is by the focusing of beamed microwaves onto a supersonic nitrogen flow to generate a plasma that can absorb the microwave energy and heat the supersonic flow. The coupling between the plasma and supersonic nitrogen flow is to be experimentally investigated. A converging\u2013diverging (supersonic) nozzle with a parabolic diverging section and a thrust measurement platform, consisting of a non-friction slide stage and load cell, have been designed. To experimentally characterize the coupling of microwave energy to the flow, the supersonic portion of the nozzle is instrumented at six locations with six pressure transducers. The nozzle has an exit diameter of 5 cm to match the microwave beam diameter and is designed to produce an exit Mach number of 5 when expanded to ambient atmospheric pressure. The nozzle and the instruments for pressure and thrust measurements were assembled and tested with a nitrogen flow.\nTo gain understanding about the microwave coupling to the flow, quasi-one-dimensional numerical simulations of the compressible nozzle flow with area change and heat addition were conducted. The simulation allows one to easily vary the location of the heat addition to examine its effect on the expanding flow. In comparison to cold flow, a microwave heated flow results in a 19% increase in thrust, assuming 100% of the 100-kW microwave power is absorbed. The experimentally measured pressures for both heated and cold flow in the nozzle is compared to the numerically predicted values.

My specific goals were: 1) to examine the importance of root architectural plasticity for adaptation to low phosphorus environments, and 2) to examine the tradeoffs limiting root architectural plasticity to phosphorus availability, specifically drought and competition.  My research consisted of evaluating parent genotypes and recombinant inbred lines of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) having contrasting root architecture traits in three unique environments: 1) in a stratified water and phosphorus system in the greenhouse, 2) in the field at Zamorano, Honduras, and 3) in a theoretical economic modeling environment.  Genetic variation for root architectural plasticity was shown to exist in common bean.  Results from the greenhouse and field experiments showed that root architectural tradeoffs do exist for water and phosphorus acquisition in heterogeneous environments, where shallow rooted genotypes were better adapted to low phosphorus environments and deep rooted genotypes were better adapted to terminal drought environments.  Optimization modeling of an individual plant supported the experimental data.  Theoretical modeling of a population of plastic and nonplastic plants showed that both drought and competition can limit the adaptive advantage of plasticity.  More experimental work needs to be conducted examining the adaptive importance of root architectural plasticity, as well as the effect of root plasticity on interplant competition.  The overall outcome of this work will contribute to a greater understanding of the fundamental physiological mechanisms of environmental stress tolerance by crop plants.  Understanding the role of root architecture and its functional significance for environmental adaptation will aid in the development of bean genotypes that have greater productivity in low-input subsistence agricultural systems.  It will also result in the development of genotypes that have a greater resource acquisition efficiency, which will ultimately reduce the need for excessive, high-input agricultural practices, a leading cause of extensive soil and water quality degradation worldwide.

Silicon nanowire in situ p-type and n-type doping and thermal oxidation were first investigated as they are essential processes required for device integration.  The doping efficiency of phosphine, diborane and trimethylboron were studied using a global-back-gate four-point resistance test structure.  The results of the resistivity measured for different dopant to source gas flow ratios provide the conditions for the vapor-liquid-solid growth of axial modulation doped p- and n-type silicon nanowires segments needed for device engineering.  Investigation of silicon nanowire thermal oxidation shows that the nanowire oxide shell growth rate is significantly affected by stress due to its convex surface.  \nFabrication processes were developed for the integration of non-self-aligned top-gate field effect devices using uniformly-doped thermally-oxidized silicon nanowires that require lower gate voltage swing to turn the transistor on and off and have reduced hysteresis compared to global-back-gate devices.  Field effect properties of the top gate devices were investigated and show that carrier transport is impeded by the Schottky barrier source/drain contacts. The global back gate was used to electrostatically dope the exposed source/drain segements to enhance the carrier tunneling through the Schottky barrier and to increase the on-state current. In addition, because the top gate electric field does not affect the Schottky barrier source/drain region, the interface state density is extracted from inverse subthreshold slope, providing direct insight into this parameter that significantly affects the transport properties of nanowire field effect devices.  \nSynthesis and structural properties of in situ axially-doped n+-p--n+ silicon nanowires were then studied by integrating silicon nanowires with two heavily-doped end (source/drain) segments and a lightly-doped middle (body) segment.  This device structure overcomes the large Schottky-barrier-induced contact resistance and source/drain series resistance and achieves a higher on-to-off current ratio. Transmission electron microscopy and electrical measurements that separately evaluate the end and middle silicon nanowire segments indicate that a pure axial doping profile is achieved for the n+-p--n+ silicon nanowires without deleterious shell doping, which also indicates that the transistor switching of the axially-doped silicon nanowire is due to electron inversion of the p--body as opposed to the accumulation of p-type carriers.\nThe top-gate and wrap-around-gate n+-p--n+ field effect transistors have significantly higher on-state current and on-to-off state current ratio than the uniformly-doped nanowire field effect devices.  The effective electron mobility of the devices was estimated using a four-point top-gate structure that excludes source and drain contact resistance, and was found to follow the expected universal inversion layer mobility versus effective electric field trend.  The field effect properties of wrap-around-gate devices are less sensitive to global-back-gate bias and thus provide better electrostatic control of the nanowire channel.  \nExperiments on the synthesis of in situ axially-doped p+-n-p+ silicon nanowires were carried out using trimethylboron or diborane for the end-segment (source/drain) doping.  Initial electrical measurement data suggest that diborane may cause simultaneous thin film deposition over the middle segment during the growth of top segment, while an axial doping profile with minimal radial coating is possible using silicon nanowires doped with trimethylboron due to its higher thermal stability compared to diborane.  Because of the higher resistivity of the p+ silicon nanowires compared to the n+ nanowires, the on-state current measured from top-gate p+-n-p+ devices fabricated using trimethylboron-doped source/drain segments is an order lower than that of n+-p--n+ devices.  More studies should be conducted to improve in situ p-type doping during vapor-liquid-solid silicon nanowire synthesis to lower the resistivity of the p+ silicon nanowire source/drain segments.  \nPost-metallization annealing on thermally-oxidized Al metal top-gate n+-p--n+ silicon nanowire field effect devices was studied to reduce interface state density and to improve the subthreshold slope of the devices.  During the annealing process, the hydrogen that is released from the reduced hydroxyl group at the gate oxide and Al gate interface passivates the interface states.  It is found that excessive annealing causes significant gate sweep hysteresis and that this is likely due to trapped charge in the oxidized Al film.  By optimizing the annealing conditions, a nearly ideal subthreshold slope is achieved at room temperature, which is expected to improve the effective carrier mobility in the silicon nanowire field effect devices.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6287], "author_name_tesi": "Ho, Tsung ta ", "last_name_ssi": "Ho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tsung ta", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Jerzy Ruzyllo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Dissertation Advisor", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["VLS", "silicon nanowire", "MOSFET"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "AN EXPLORATION OF PEER COLLABORATION AND GROUP PROBLEM SOLVING PROCESS IN A COLLEGE PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING CLASSROOM", "id": "8351", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6580", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Problem-based learning (PBL) has had a significant impact across subjects and disciplines in educational practice since it was first introduced as an innovative medical education curriculum at McMaster University in 1969 (Boud & Feletii, 1997; Camp, 1996, Newman, 2006).

Also, the extent to which students engaged in the social negotiation of meaning was greatly influenced by the content of interpersonal conflicts, and how students interacted to resolve the conflicts. Moreover, the physical, logical and cultural constraints in the learning context caused different actions in the knowledge building activity.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6578], "author_name_tesi": "Ho, Wenyi ", "last_name_ssi": "Ho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenyi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan M Land", "Wei Fan Chen", "Jill L Lane", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan M Land, Committee Chair", "Wei Fan Chen, Committee Member", "Jill L Lane, Committee Member", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["problem-based learning", "collaboration", "problem solving", "instructional strategy"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "On Geodesics of Compact Riemannian Surfaces\n", "id": "10159", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6582", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is divided into two parts.

In this thesis, I argue that Shaw\u2019s rhetoric was not only a pragmatic effort to persuade audiences to support woman suffrage, but her speeches constitute a theory of gender that stipulated how women and men might share in the duties and responsibilities of a just society. Through a close reading of multiple speeches and archival material, I contend that Shaw recast the identities of homemaker, worker, and citizen. In the process, she made each of these identities into a public, social role that women were qualified to inhabit. Rather than deny or undermine the claim that women were nurturing, moral beings\u2014qualities that defined the \u201ccult of true womanhood\u201d and nineteenth-century domesticity\u2014Shaw embraced these characteristics as a rationale for why women\u2019s opportunities should be expanded beyond the privacy of the home. Suffrage existed at the center of this social and civic realignment. The right to vote as women was not an end for Shaw, but a means for achieving a balanced society where the distinct strengths and weaknesses of each gender\u2014males and females\u2014were managed in ways that furthered human progress. I argue that in constructing the \u201cmodern woman,\u201d Shaw simultaneously constructed a \u201cmodern\u201d society in which difference and equality could co-exist.

The research in the robotics field has focused mainly on integrating highly energy dense power sources with little thought applied to optimizing the efficiency of power converter designs and efficient energy management. There has been no effort to standardize the design of robot power systems through the use of a scalable power delivery architecture. The challenge lies in the development of the hardware and control algorithms for a scalable power delivery architecture which satisfies both the power and energy requirements of most unmanned ground vehicles. This thesis proposes a robotic power architecture which is easily scalable and facilitates the use of a wide variety of energy storage/generation devices, while focusing on the system control algorithm and its stability.

Fluid dynamics, especially wall shear stress, is a prime suspect of undesirable clotting.  The main goal of this thesis work is to extend the use of the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) for the wall shear rate estimation within a sac-type artificial heart.\nObjective: In this study, the work focuses on a 50cc Penn State Artificial Heart Ventricular Chamber.  The 50cc model has very recently been initiated by Hershey Medical Center for patients with small circulation volume capacity.  The objectives are, first, to develop the PIV technique for wall shear rate estimation, and, second, to investigate the flow dynamics within the 50cc chamber using the extended PIV technique.\nMethodologies and outcome: PIV has recently been used in artificial heart works and started to become a standard fluid experimentation in many applications.  It has the advantages of being non-invasive, quantitative, and field measurement.  However, very few investigators have attempted to estimate wall shear rate using PIV.  In the aspect of fluid mechanics, the problem with fluid-wall interface is difficult to solve: high gradient, three dimensionality, and small flow structures, etc.  Therefore, estimating wall shear rates from PIV results must be cautious.  Furthermore, there are also experimental difficulties for a near wall PIV measurement: image distortion, defocusing, low particle density, wall identification and vibration, and wall image noise.  We have developed two techniques to achieve accurate wall shear rate estimation.  The first technique is to use conventional PIV.  The technique does not require much more experimental and computational effort over standard processing and is very flexible to flow patterns and surface geometries, while providing wall shear-rate uncertainty within \u00b120% and a resolution of approximately 480 \u00ecm from the wall in our application.  The second technique increases the resolution to capture smaller flow structures.  Displacement vectors are obtained by a Particle Tracking Algorithm which requires large computational effort.  The technique is only limited to one dimensional displacement along a straight surface.  The results show improving resolution to approximately 70 \u00ecm from the wall with a wall shear-rate uncertainty of 10%.\nFor the artificial heart work, we studied the motion of the diaphragm in relation to flow patterns within the heart.  The study shows a close correlation between the diaphragm opening pattern and the flow structures within the chamber.  The global and local flow characteristics and wall shear rates within 50cc chamber were examined under the physiological operating condition.  We found the areas of clot depositions correspond to areas of low wall shear-rate along the bottom wall.  However, wall shear-rate distribution patterns on a wall within the artificial heart may require more measurement through the depth of the chamber as the result of 3D flow structure.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4977], "author_name_tesi": "Hochareon, Pramote ", "last_name_ssi": "Hochareon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pramote", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Tarbell", "Steven Deutsch", "Arnold Anthony Fontaine", "Conrad M Zapanta", "Kendra V Sharp"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Tarbell, Committee Chair", "Steven Deutsch, Committee Chair", "Arnold Anthony Fontaine, Committee Member", "Conrad M Zapanta, Committee Member", "Kendra V Sharp, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PIV", "fluid mechanic", "flow measurement", "artficial heart", "ventricular assist device", "biofluid"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Bidirectional Links between Self-Esteem and Weight Concerns in Adolescence and the Moderating Roles of Parent Responsiveness and Youth Gender", "id": "14684akh7", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14684", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Purpose: Weight concerns are common among adolescents and are associated with a range of negative psychological and physical health outcomes. Self-esteem is a correlate of weight concerns, yet little prospective research has been conducted to determine direction of this association over the course of adolescence, or whether this association differs by gender. Prior research also documents that parent responsiveness may act as a protective factor in the development of weight concerns. This study sought to clarify the role of self-esteem in the development of weight concerns in adolescence and investigate the potentially protective role of parental responsiveness. As the role of fathers in the development of weight concerns has been understudied, both mother and father responsiveness were examined. Methods: The sample was predominately Caucasian/European American and included 392 adolescents ages 11-18 (mean age at first measurement = 15 years; 49.5% female). Time lagged mixed effects models were used to examine the direction of within-person associations between self-esteem and weight concerns over a four-year period and to test mother and father responsiveness and youth gender as moderators in these associations. Results: Findings revealed bidirectional associations between self-esteem and weight concerns over the course of adolescence, and confirmed the moderating role of gender and father but not mother responsiveness in the prospective link between self-esteem and weight concerns such that father responsiveness buffered the effects of low self-esteem on weight concerns for girls but not boys. Only gender moderated the prospective link between weight concerns and self-esteem, such that increases in self-esteem predicted decreases in weight concerns for both boys and girls, but the magnitude of this effect was slightly greater for boys. Conclusions: Findings suggest that self-esteem and weight concerns are reciprocally related in adolescence and highlight the importance of examining interactions between family processes and individual characteristics to predict adolescent psychological adjustment.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15616], "author_name_tesi": "Hochgraf, Anna Katherine", "last_name_ssi": "Hochgraf", "middle_name_ssi": "Katherine", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan M.

Experiential learning theory that incorporated holistic approaches (cognitive, affective, spiritual, multiple intelligences, and inclusive education) provided the theoretical framework. The service-learning experience met community needs and classroom objectives in a managerial accounting class (introductory level cost accounting course required of all business students) particularly those that reflect higher levels of skills in the broad business, functional, and personal categories of the AICPA Core Competencies. Service-learning is an educational experience in an organized activity that meets community needs and class objectives.  It is course-based and credit-bearing, and it incorporates critical reflection on the experience to enhance knowledge, skills, and civic responsibility. A purposeful sample of twenty-eight students in an accounting class conducted research on the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program developed by the Internal Revenue Service. They conducted site research and select an appropriate site in which to provide the free tax assistance for low-to moderate-income taxpayers; designed and created a VITA website; developed advertising and training materials using a variety of media, found appropriate outlets for the advertising materials and distributed the media to the community; developed and implemented financial literacy training classes for the socio-economically marginalized people in our community; and developed and implemented recruitment sessions for VITA volunteers. Extensive qualitative data was collected from student journals, meeting minutes, Blackboard discussions, focus group interviews, and structured open-ended questionnaires; researcher field notes and journals; and community member feedback. The study provides strong evidence of the program implementation process and impact, guidance on ways to structure the instructional process, and intellectual skill development. It also provides substantial evidence of the student meaning making process as they reflected individually in journals and in collaboration with others. The study provides evidence of Magolda and King\u2019s (2004) \u201clearning partnerships model\u201d where more complex skills (i.e. critical thinking and problem solving) occur through the integration of dimensions that include the cognitive, intrapersonal, and relationship with others. The data provides rich and in-depth evidence of student development of passion and relevance in studying accounting as they turned a project into a \u201cmission\u201d to reflect their deep devotion and commitment to their community service. Understanding of managerial accounting was validated in examination scores that averaged ten points higher in this service-learning class than the control groups in two non-service-learning managerial accounting classes that the researcher taught during the same semester. Strong evidence is provided by this multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary service-learning experience of the development of AICPA Core Competencies enhanced by holistic approaches. These holistic approaches include evoking feelings and imagination using symbols, film, quotations, and open-ended questions in journals. Evidence of strong connections with others occurred as students developed the ability to listen more deeply to the multiple perspectives of the diverse population within their class and in the community.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1376], "author_name_tesi": "Hocking, Deborah Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Hocking", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Deborah", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Rhoda Joseph", "Kenneth Brian Cunningham", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Ian E Baptiste"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Chair", "Rhoda Joseph, Committee Member", "Kenneth Brian Cunningham, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Member", "Ian E Baptiste, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["holistic approaches to learning", "AICPA core competencies", "accounting education", "service learning", "experiential learning", "reflection"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Rigor for All?

This district case study of literacy teachers\u2019 decision-making is grounded in three bodies of literature: the literature on the unintended consequences of standards-based reform, the literature on tracking and detracking, and the conceptual literature on sense-making. This study uses qualitative methods to explore three related research questions: (1) How, if at all, did messages about the Common Core State Standards and equity shift from the national level to the district and teacher levels? (2) In the context of Common Core implementation and a standardized, Common Core-aligned curriculum, how are curriculum and instruction similar or different across curricular tracks? (3) In this district context, what factors shape teachers\u2019 decisions about curriculum and instruction (e.g., state and district level policies, teachers\u2019 beliefs)? Findings suggest that the dominant message about how the Common Core will create equity in this district is through instructional practices such as asking text-dependent questions, rather than through structural change. Findings also demonstrate that teachers receive mixed signals about the nature of student ability from Common Core implementation, testing policy, and curricular tracking. These mixed signals influence teachers' decisions about curriculum and instruction in ways that raise key questions about the potential of standards to ensure educational equity when standards are implemented in tracked school environments.

Colloidal nanochemistry has emerged as one of the most effective methods for generating high quality, monodisperse nanoparticles with diverse structural features and highly complex geometries.  These wet-chemical approaches offer an array of synthetic levers that can be used to tailor nanoparticles for targeted applications, and deliver solution-dispersible solids that are easily integrated onto device architectures.  Additionally, colloidal nanoparticles can be used as building blocks for constructing periodic superlattices and multicomponent hybrid nanoparticles, which offer unique properties that can support next-generation technologies.  \nAs the applications for colloidal nanoparticles continue to expand, the architectural and compositional requirements for these materials are becoming increasingly rigid.  Conventional colloidal methods are effective for generating diverse nanoparticle systems, but rely on complex nucleation and growth processes, which are often poorly understood and difficult to control in dynamic reaction environments.  For these reasons, there are a number of high profile nanoparticle targets that remain out of reach.  Accordingly, new approaches are needed that can circumvent these synthetic bottlenecks and narrow the growing disconnect between nano-design and synthetic capability.  In this dissertation, I present several colloidal strategies for engineering synthetically challenging nanomaterials using multistep reaction sequences that, in many ways, parallel the total-synthesis framework that organic chemists use to access complex molecules.  A variety of approaches are discussed, including nanoscale ion exchange transformations and seeded-growth protocol for constructing multicomponent hybrid nanoparticles.  \n\tFirst, I demonstrate that solution-mediated anion and cation exchange can be integrated into one multistep reaction sequence, which leads to a complete material transformation of a pre-synthesized nanotemplate.  Importantly, although the final product does not contain any of the original elements, the morphology is retained, effectively decoupling morphology and composition control.  Next, I demonstrate that both anion and cation sublattice features of preformed Cu2-xS nanocrystals can be retained during cation exchange with Co2+ and Mn2+, yielding wurtzite-type CoS and MnS polymorphs that are metastable in bulk systems.  This study was enabled by new cation exchange chemistry with previously unexplored 3d transition metal systems, and offers new guidelines for predictably targeting sublattice features in colloidal nanomaterials.  \nTo conclude the dissertation, I offer two studies investigating the seeded-growth synthesis of three-component Ag-Pt-Fe3O4 heterotrimer nanoparticles, which are generated by adding a Ag domain to preformed Pt-Fe3O4 heterodimers.  First, to gain access to the alternate Pt-Fe3O4-Ag configuration, I demonstrate that a thin iron oxide shell can be applied to the Pt surface of the Pt-Fe3O4 seeds, which acts as a solid-state protecting group that can direct Ag growth onto the Fe3O4 domain, producing the otherwise inaccessible Pt-Fe3O4-Ag architecture.  This strategy is inspired by similar techniques used in organic synthesis, and represents an important addition to the \u2018total synthesis toolbox\u2019 used to construct colloidal hybrid nanoparticles.  Finally, I offer an in-depth microscopic investigation that probes the chemoselective addition of Ag to Pt-Fe3O4 to form the Ag-Pt-Fe3O4 heterotrimer product.  This study reveals that Ag indiscriminately nucleates on both the Pt and Fe3O4 domains of the Pt-Fe3O4 seeds during the early stages of the reaction, followed by a surface-mediated coalescence of Ag onto the Pt domain to yield the Ag-Pt-Fe3O4 configuration.  The mechanistic insights gained in this work provide new design criteria for synthesizing multicomponent hybrid nanoparticle systems with targeted configurations.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12881], "author_name_tesi": "Hodges, James Manson", "last_name_ssi": "Hodges", "middle_name_ssi": "Manson", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond E.

Nonetheless, the liver contained most (~76%) of the whole-body VA mass, while extrahepatic, non-digestive organs together contained ~13%. White adipose tissue (WAT), which was nearly absent prior to P12, contained only ~1% of the total VA mass in the body. In VA-supplemented neonates, the mean total retinol concentrations in all organs were significantly greater than in control pups. However, this increase lasted only ~1 d in most extrahepatic tissues, with the exception of WAT, where the increase lasted for 18 d. The subsequent kinetic analysis of tracer data revealed that VA supplementation redirected the flow of CM-REs away from the peripheral and toward the central organs, such as the liver, lungs and brain. Vitamin A supplementation also resulted in a greater fractional release of RBP-ROH from the liver, which was acquired mainly by the peripheral tissues, but not retained efficiently. This was evidenced by the higher turnover of RBP-derived ROH, especially in the carcass (composed largely of bones and muscles), and a substantially greater recycling number of ROH between plasma and organs in the supplemented group compared to control group (541 vs. 5 times before irreversible disposal). The turnover rate of RBP-derived ROH in WAT and brain was not higher after supplementation suggesting a greater retention capacity for ROH in these organs. Furthermore, based on the trend observed in tracer levels of various organs, ROH stores in the liver were gradually transferred to other organs starting at 2 weeks after supplementation. Finally, the comparison of results from the VA and the VARA study demonstrated that supplementation with VARA increased the fractional uptake of CM-REs into the intestines, lungs and carcass to a greater extent than did supplementation with VA and attenuated the fractional turnover as well as the recycling number of ROH from 288 to 100 times before irreversible disposal. Nevertheless, the supplementation with VA resulted in a greater accumulation of ROH in the liver, which may become available to other organs during the course of development.\nConclusions: Vitamin A administered in a single, large dose during the first few days after birth to neonatal rats raised under VA-marginal conditions accumulates mainly in the liver. The extrahepatic organs in neonates store relatively little VA and the scarcity of adipose tissue may predispose them to a low VA status. Vitamin A present in the supplement is readily acquired by all organs, but recycles repeatedly back to plasma most likely due to high expression of the stimulated by retinoic acid 6 receptor in the extrahepatic organs in neonates, a bidirectional ROH transporter induced by VA during development. Presence of retinoic acid in the VA supplement improves ROH tissue retention and attenuates recycling, most likely due to the synergistic effect of VA and retinoic acid on the activity of lecithin-retinol acyltransferase, an enzyme responsible for ROH storage. Given the transient effect of large-dose VA supplementation on the extrahepatic tissue ROH contents in neonates, a more frequent, lower-dose supplementation, along with other nutrition interventions, may be necessary to maintain adequate VA levels in the rapidly developing neonatal organs.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13146], "author_name_tesi": "Hodges, Joanna Kalina", "last_name_ssi": "Hodges", "middle_name_ssi": "Kalina", "first_name_ssi": "Joanna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A.

By taking a longer view of the study of American food and by engaging with a wealth of sources, including cookbooks, restaurant menus, seed catalogs, agricultural periodicals and censuses, this project studies the development of tomato culture both before industrialization and through two distinct phases of industrialization within the tomato industry. Beginning with nineteenth century rural farmers and cooks, tomatoes emerged as a vital component of expanding the diversity of American cuisine, overcoming early resistance to this Central American vegetable. This expansive tomato culture continued in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as the canning industry and tomato production increased and influenced the emergence of a distinct geographically decentralized and economically diverse industry that overcame the seasonality of tomato consumption. The uses for tomatoes continued to expand as middle-class, elite, and immigrant consumers utilized increased production of fresh and minimally-processed canned whole tomatoes to diversify their diets. By the second half of the twentieth century, as technological innovations like the mechanical harvester led to consolidation and centralization of tomato production and processing, and the rise of prepared, heavily-processed, ready-to-eat meals discouraged culinary curiosity, tomato production and consumption became more standardized and homogenized. Yet, the tomato has also become a symbol for important counters to the dominance of this corporate culture, including farmers\u2019 markets and home gardening. This project seeks to highlight how the two phases of tomato industrialization differed from other foods. Contrary to the existing scholarship, this project suggests that industrialization often helped foster increased diversity in American food production and culinary culture but also points to the limits of the corporate model on shaping and standardizing American cuisine. Despite the growing power of centralized producers and processors of food to shape eating habits, tomato culture in America remains diverse and consumers utilize numerous avenues to challenge and influence commercial culture.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10342], "author_name_tesi": "Hoenig, John M", "last_name_ssi": "Hoenig", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Scott Cross", "Bryan Lee Mcdonald", "Tobias Heinrich Albert Brinkmann", "Deryck William Holdsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Scott Cross, Dissertation Advisor", "Bryan Lee Mcdonald, Committee Member", "Tobias Heinrich Albert Brinkmann, Committee Member", "Deryck William Holdsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Food History", "Tomatoes", "American History", "Agricultural History", "Consumer Culture"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Influence of Race/ethnicity and Political Identification Cues in News Stories on the Cognitive Processing of and Attitudes toward Political Candidates and Racial/ethnic Minority Groups", "id": "23839", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10963", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study explored the intersection of the cues of race/ethnicity and political party affiliation as they are presented in the news media and predict evaluations of political candidates.

It found that congruity theory is an appropriate theoretical mechanism for explaining individuals\u2019 intentions to vote for political candidates, where individuals\u2019 political party affiliation is the ideal moderating variable to consider. It also found that both a candidate\u2019s political party affiliation and race/ethnicity are salient in determining voting preferences and attitudes toward the candidate. Moreover, the discrepancies between cueing and priming are presented and distinctions are suggested in terms of implicit and explicit attitudinal responses to stimuli. Using HSM and congruity theory, this study\u2019s results indicated that cueing occurs when information is consciously consumed, which should be conceptualized and operationalized differently than priming, which occurs when information is unconsciously consumed. As part of this exploration, an HSM codebook for open-ended data was developed and is recommended for future use. This study also examined the perceptions of political candidates and potential voters affiliated with the Independent Party, an underexplored area of scholarship. It found Independent Party candidates are more implicitly preferred by individuals who range from moderate to liberal in terms of their political ideology, but can be explicitly preferred by more conservative individuals. Also, Independent Party voters showed no preference for Independent Party candidates. Finally, this study adds to the body of research examining the use of counterstereotypes in the media to promote pro-social attitudes by determining if presenting members of minority racial/ethnic groups in leadership positions can prompt the adoption of more positive implicit and explicit attitudes toward members of these groups.

While the effects of temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide are relatively well-understood, the effect of dust on crop yields has yet to be thoroughly investigated. This line of inquiry is warranted because many areas of the world with frequent dust storms and high dust loadings are often food insecure, and because wind erosion is prevalent in the High Plains of the United States, a major crop-producing area. Existing research suggests that the effect of dust on yields should be largely negative, but until now this has not been investigated on a regional scale. A major hindrance to understanding the effect of dust on crop yields is insufficient data and inadequate methods of analysis. In this dissertation, we developed data and analysis methods for three distinct projects to determine whether dust affects regional crop yields. In the first project, we validated the use of random forest, a machine learning technique, as a diagnostic crop model that can be used to assess the impact of individual climate predictors on yields. Because we motivated this research with food security concerns, we analyzed climate signals in the crop yield record of sub-Saharan Africa from 1962-2014. From this work, we determined that random forest could function as a statistical crop model, but the data quality and resolution inhibited the ability to detect the effect of dust on yields in this area of the world. In our second line of inquiry, we shifted the focus to the central region of the United States for its high quality and high resolution data, as well as its importance as a major crop-producing region of the world. Because these data had higher temporal resolution, we could explore individual phases of the growing season. We developed crop-specific algorithms to compute the planting date, establishment phase, critical window, and grain filling phase to investigate yield responses to phase-specific climate predictors. Using these data, the random forest identified distinct phase-specific responses for important climate predictors. Finally, we computed dust metrics from three different data sources and merged them with climate and yield data in the central region of the United States to estimate the impact of dust on yields. Over the entire central US region, we found that including dust as a predictor in each crop model did not improve yield predictions for the region as a whole. However, when crop models were applied to individual states, we found several instances in which dust weakly reduced yields. Although these state-specific results were encouraging, we presented them cautiously because the yield responses could be an artifact of either partitioning the data or a true yield response that is obscured when data was spatially aggregated. While the results were largely inconclusive, we have advanced the capabilities of statistical crop modeling, developed data sets that can be used to move the science forward, and revealed new questions that merit further research.

Existing literature has focused on the correlations between sea surface temperature anomalies on precipitation, but not on dust emission or deposition. This study first estimates the sensitivity of variables relating to dust emission and deposition to sea surface temperature patterns, and second, uses the estimated sensitivity to reconstruct the linear response of regional climate to historical sea surface temperature anomalies. We estimate the linear dependence of relevant model variables to anomalous sea surface temperature forcings in the National Center for Atmospheric Research\u2019s Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5.0). We then reconstruct the linear component of the atmospheric response to historical sea surface temperature anomalies to test the accuracy of the estimations and to highlight where sea surface temperature variability largely controls the variability of regional climate. Using this method we found that the dust sources responsible for most of the net global emissions are strongly sensitive to tropical sea surface temperature anomalies, particularly in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. We also found that the reconstructions of the annual dust emission anomalies in subtropical dust sources were able to capture the long-term trends, suggesting that these trends are likely a result of sea surface temperature anomalies. However, the reconstructions of dust concentration anomalies downwind of the North African dust sources were poor when compared with in situ observations, likely because the model tends to underestimate variability in dust concentrations at the deposition sites.

None of the NSPs sampled could explain all nutrient removal through direct uptake and storage by biomass.\nSubsequently, research was conducted estimating phosphorus and nitrogen inputs, outputs and storage in two greenhouse studies. Outputs consisted of nutrients contained in harvested biomass while nutrient storage compartments were defined as plant biomass and substrate.   Plant direct uptake proved insufficient to remove all nutrient inputs, and substrate type was significant in nutrient storage.  \nIn an experiment testing four substrates planted with Saururus cernuus and Iris versicolor, haydite/clay was the only substrate able to lower phosphorus levels of the mesocosm water to 0.01mg/l.  All substrate treatments reduced mesocosm water NO3 to target levels of 30 mg/l.  Iris produced significantly higher biomass than the lizards tail, and biomass was positively correlated with NO3 removal.\nA subsequent experiment testing the removal capabilities of treatments consisting of Canna x generalis and Iris versicolor planted in a substrate consisting of calcined clay and activated alumina, showed vegetated treatments removed more NO3 and P than the unvegetated control.  Canna x generalis produced higher biomass and removed more NO3 and P than Iris versicolor.  Again, biomass production and NO3 removal were highly correlated.

Previous interpretations have emphasized the Deuteronomistic character of this polemic. In contrast, this study moves beyond noting superficial similarities with Deut 17, Deut 28, and 2 Kgs 25. It analyzes how themes and language shared with Deuteronomistic literature actually function in the Jeremianic context and in what ways their Jeremianic usage diverges from Deut and DtrH and attests to the diversity of the Deuteronomistic schools. It then evaluates what practical role the theological rhetoric of Jeremiah played in the political, social, and economic landscape of the 6th century BCE.\n\nSituating Jer 42's prohibition within the literary context of Jer 37\u201344, this study identifies two distinctive stages of development for this narrative block: an early 6th century BCE pro- remnant core and a later 6th century BCE adaptation and expansion by members of the Babylonian golah. Despite shared material, there are important differences between Jer 37\u2013 44's representation of the period from the siege of Jerusalem through Gedaliah's tenure at Mizpah and DtrH's narration of these events in 2 Kgs 25, particularly regarding flight to Egypt and the viability of Judean communities in Egypt. Further, while the editors of both stages of Jer 37\u201344 appeal to Dtr rhetoric to support their views, they do so in different ways. In contrast to the pro-golah editors whose use of Dtr diction is very similar to DtrH, the pro- remnant core reshapes the language of Deuteronomy as a means of promoting submission to Babylon. In doing so, it presents views of conquest, exile, and Judah\u2019s relationship to foreign powers that do not easily align with Deuteronomy itself. Finally, this study argues that the pro-remnant core\u2019s appeal to the authority of Deuteronomy was necessary precisely because the opportunities available to foreigners in Egypt during this period made it such an attractive destination for refugees. Collaborators had a vested interest in maintaining stability under Babylonian rule because their status and property rights were tied to it.

Extant research typically focuses on collective bargaining from the perspective of a single class of employees and therefore cannot compare the trends across employee type. In contrast, I investigate the variation in influence of specific factors on union efforts by each of these three groups. Rooted in theories pertaining to resource dependency and organizational ecology, this study identifies factors that increase or decrease the success of an institution establishing an initial collective bargaining agreement. The research questions that lead the study are: Where are academic unions most prevalent in the United States? In which institutions and in what geographic regions do we see the most union representation? How has union presence changed over time? What environmental factors (i.e. political and economic) encourage or impede successful academic unionization? What organizational factors encourage or impede academic unionization?\n \nCollective bargaining agreements (CBAs) between the employer and the union are the culmination of a long process involving multiple steps. A group of employees must decide to form a union and must hold an election to formally organize. The employing institution must agree to bargain with the unit and then the bargaining process may take many months. This study focuses on the year an institution establishes an initial CBA with specific types of academic employees, tenure-track, non-tenure track faculty, and graduate students. The descriptive portion of the study illustrates the growth patterns of initial CBAs in the higher education sector in the years 1987 to 2010 and describes relevant variation in patterns based on Carnegie classification, two-year/four-year status, public/private status and geographic region. In the statistical portion of the study, I compare the usefulness of two statistical methods. While event history analysis is the preferred method to study the timing of event occurrence, this method works best when there is substantial change over time in the event of interest. I compare those results with the results of the more limited cross-sectional logistic regression. \n\nDescriptive results show that collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) for tenure-track faculty have shown relatively little change and CBAs for graduate students have increased markedly during the study period. Research/Doctoral institutions have shown the greatest increases in CBAs of all types, followed by Master\u2019s institutions and systems with multiple Carnegie classifications. Although collective bargaining efforts are more commonly thought to take place at 2-year institutions, I find that systems comprised of both 2- and 4-year institutions have a higher share of CBAs for non-tenure track (NTT) and tenure-track (TT) faculty. System-affiliated public institutions have experienced more growth in unionization than private systems and non-system institutions. Finally, regional differences in CBA activity appear to be dependent upon legal constraints established at the state level. There has been remarkable stability within most regions when looking at non-system institutions, however, CBAs at systems have grown significantly, especially in New England where CBAs for NTT faculty have increased by 41.6 percentage points. \n\nResults from the statistical portion of the study show that there may not be enough observations to produce statistically significant findings using event history analysis, although I do find that increases in the state unemployment rate increases the hazard of establishing a CBA for non-tenure track faculty. The logistic regression using 2010 data showed several significant variables, which vary based on employee type. Private institutions are less likely than their public counterparts to have established CBAs for NTT faculty or graduate students. The proportion of Democrats in the state legislature increases the odds of a non-system institution having established a CBA with NTT, but decrease the odds of having established a CBA for TT faculty, and have no effect for graduate students. Non-system institutions in Right-to-Work states are strongly less likely to have CBAs for NTT or TT faculty. Higher state unemployment rates significantly increase the odds of having established a CBA for NTT faculty but not for TT faculty or graduate students. Finally, the results suggest that higher numbers of full-time faculty per 100 FTE student do decrease the odds of having established a CBA for tenure-track faculty while higher numbers of staff per 100 FTE student decrease the odds of having established a CBA for non-tenure track faculty.

Current slip-rate estimates are either long-term estimates based on total offset of the system and bounds on the initiation of fault slip, or estimates that rely on undated alluvial deposits.  Using field surveys and high-resolution airborne LiDAR digital topography, I utilize displaced alluvial deposits at two localities, Happy Canyon and Manly Peak Canyon, to provide new slip-rate estimates along the PVFZ.  Chronologic control is provided by a newly developed chronosequence of soils in Panamint Valley, radiocarbon dating of lacustrine tufa associated with shoreline deposits, and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (10Be) dating of alluvial fan surfaces.  At Manly Peak Canyon, debris flow levees offset 26.5 \u00b1 3.8 m with a maximum surface age of 12.5 \u00b1 1.4 ka yield a minimum extension rate of 2.1 \u00b1 0.5 mm/yr.  At Happy Canyon, displaced alluvial markers demonstrate that slip along northeast-striking fault strands in the right-stepping portion of the fault zone is purely dip-slip with no lateral component.  Here, an alluvial fan complex cut by a series of normal faults with total extension of 56.0 \u00b1 10.3 m has surface age estimates from a calibrated soil chronofunction ranging from ~16 - 40 ka, yielding a minimum extension rate of 2.7 \u00b1 1.5 mm/yr.  Additionally, a 20.7 \u00b1 5.2 ka surface at Happy Canyon is cut by a fault scarp with 68.1 \u00b1 2.0 m of vertical offset, which yields a preliminary Late Pleistocene minimum throw rate of 3.3 \u00b1 0.7 mm/yr.  Results from this thesis provide the only two slip-rate estimates along the PVFZ with chronologic control, and reveal along-strike variations in horizontal displacement direction that appear coordinated with increased subsidence in the northern part of the valley.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6535], "author_name_tesi": "Hoffman, William Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Hoffman", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Eric Kirby", "Dr Eric Kirby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Eric Kirby, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Eric Kirby, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Panamint Valley", "slip rate", "faults", "eastern california", "cosmogenic radionuclides", "LiDAR"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Evidence of isometric function of the flexor hallucis longus and flexor digitorum longus during the stance phase of gait\n\n", "id": "12617", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1041", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The total force acting upon the forefoot during the push off phase of gait is approximately 120% of body weight, with the first and second rays of the foot being the most heavily loaded.  Flexor hallucis longus (FHL) and flexor digitorum longus (FDL) are multi-articular extrinsic foot muscles directly responsible for flexion of the rays of the foot, and have been shown to play a significant role in supporting the longitudinal arch and balancing forefoot loading.  These muscles are anatomic synergists and are active at similar times during the gait cycle, but exhibit dissimilar architectural properties such as mass, muscle fiber length, and physiologic cross sectional area.  Despite their importance in normal locomotion, there is little direct experimental evidence examining the function of these muscles in vivo or in situ.  To further investigate the function of the FHL and FDL during ambulation, eight cadaver lower extremities were loaded in the RDAS, a previously validated robotic simulator that re-creates the kinematics and muscle activity of the lower extremity during the stance phase of gait.  Simulations were performed with the toe flexor muscles under two distinct control strategies: force-feedback control (FC), where dynamic tendon forces were matched to instantaneous target forces derived from electromyography (EMG) of normal subjects; and isometric displacement control (IDC), where the myotendinous junction of the tendon was held in constant position over the entire stance phase of gait.  Distributions of plantar pressure were measured during the simulations to assess forefoot loading.  It was hypothesized that instantaneous FHL tendon forces under IDC would be similar to those estimated from EMG data, but FDL forces would not, based on architectural differences between the two muscles.  It was also hypothesized that simultaneous IDC (SIDC) of the toe flexor muscles would result in significantly higher tendon forces and forefoot loading compared to FC.  Excursions of the FHL and FDL under FC were small (7.18\u00b11.75, 6.32\u00b11.74 mm) relative to optimal muscle fiber length (52.7 mm, 44.6 mm).  Instantaneous tendon forces in both the FHL and FDL under IDC were not remarkably different than target forces derived from EMG data.  In addition, there were no differences in plantar pressure distributions between FC, IDC or SIDC conditions.  This study provides in situ experimental evidence of normal forefoot loading under isometric control of the extrinsic toe flexor muscles during stance, suggesting that the FHL and FDL function isometrically during stance phase in vivo, an efficient strategy that minimizes energy expenditure and reduces the complexity of their neural control.  These results are consistent with the long-standing hypothesis that multi-articular muscles function isometrically to redistribute segmental energy in a fashion that may not possible with mono-articular muscles.  The FHL and FDL might be controlled in vivo via a local length-servo mechanism such as the stretch reflex; whereby conditions such as peripheral neuropathies (e.g., spastic paresis), or other diseases in which the stretch reflex is impaired (e.g., diabetes) may disrupt normal function.  Similarly, any surgical intervention that affects myotendinous length or displacement, or alters the anatomy or geometry of the FHL and FDL might compromise efficient locomotion.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1031], "author_name_tesi": "Hofmann, Cory Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Hofmann", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Cory", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil Sharkey", "Neil Sharkey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neil Sharkey, Thesis Advisor", "Neil Sharkey, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cadaveric gait simulation", "flexor hallucis longus", "flexor digitorum longus", "muscle mechanics", "forefoot mechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "JC VIRUS SMALL T ANTIGEN BINDS RB FAMILY PROTEINS AND THE PHOSPHATASE PP2A AND IS REQUIRED FOR EFFICIENT VIRAL DNA REPLICATION ACTIVITY\n", "id": "9703", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "919", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "JC Virus (JCV) is a human polyomavirus which infects approximately 80% of the human population. Five tumor antigen or T proteins are produced from the early coding region of the viral genome; one precursor early mRNA is spliced to generate each of the five mature T protein mRNAs, which encode large Tumor Antigen (TAg), small tumor antigen (tAg), and the three T' proteins, T&#8242;135, T&#8242;136 and T&#8242;165.  TAg, the best studied of these, is the key viral protein in facilitating DNA replication and cellular manipulation leading to oncogenic transformation. TAg is capable of binding to many diverse cellular factors, including members of the Retinoblastoma family of tumor suppressor proteins and Hsc70 through its LXCXE and J domains, respectively, to influence cellular proliferation, as well as binding and inactivating p53 to circumvent apoptosis. The 3 T&#8242; proteins play roles in DNA replication and transformation; despite a high degree of sequence similarity to each other, they interact differentially with cellular proteins to modulate cellular proliferation and viral DNA replication. tAg is suspected to be important in host cell proliferation based on studies performed on the related SV40 tAg.\n  \tIn this study, I have generated a collection of DNA constructs which express different combinations of the JCV early proteins. These DNAs were used to analyze the effects of each combination of viral proteins on viral DNA replication and modulation of cellular signaling pathways. In particular, tAg\u2019s specific interactions with cellular proteins and its potential role in pathways affecting cellular proliferation were studied. To examine whether specific conserved amino acid residues contributed to tAg\u2019s functions, I constructed a series of DNAs encoding mutant tAg proteins. To create the first mutant tAg, a conserved proline residue at nucleotide 99 was altered to alanine (P99A); in the second mutant, a conserved cysteine 157, part of tAg\u2019s second LxCxE domain, was changed to alanine (C157A); in the third tAg mutant, histidine 42 in the J-domain was altered to glutamine (H42Q).  \ntAg was found to contribute to viral DNA replication. In contrast to studies which indicate that SV40 tAg is not required for replication of SV40 DNA, I observed no replication of JCV DNA in cells transfected with constructs that did not express tAg. Viral DNA constructs encoding mutant versions P99A or C157A of tAg exhibited decreased replication activity in permissive primary human fetal glial (PHFG) cells relative to a construct expressing wild type tAg. The defective phenotype was more pronounced in the P99A mutant. These data suggest that residues 99 and 157 of tAg facilitate tAg\u2019s contributions to viral DNA replication.\nI have extended a recently published finding that a tAg-GST fusion protein interacts in vitro with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a ubiquitous cellular protein responsible for dephosphorylation and regulation of many substrates. To determine whether this interaction takes place in vivo, I tested the ability of the P99A and C157A tAgs described above to interact with PP2A. Neither of these point mutations in tAg led to a detectable decrease in PP2A binding. Preliminary data suggests that expression of tAg increases the amount of phosphorylated Akt\u2014a kinase that plays a role in the PI3K-PP2A transduction pathway that influences cellular proliferation\u2014in 3T3 cells; this is predicted to occur through tAg-mediated alteration of PP2A activity. \nA 3T3 cell line which expresses tAg only, as well as cells which express T+/t+/T&#8242;+, T+/P99At+/T&#8242;+, or T+/C157At+/T&#8242;+, were used to examine interactions between tAg and the Rb family of proteins. These studies revealed that tAg interacts with both p130 and p107. The P99A and C157A mutations did not detectably alter the binding of tAg to either cellular protein. \nPhosphorylation of specific ser/thr sites regulates multiple functions of many proteins. tAg appears as multiple forms in protein extracts of dividing 3T3 cells subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blots; here I have determined that these bands represent tAg in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms.\nThe experiments performed here indicate that tAg interacts with PP2A, an important regulator of cell signal transduction pathways, and unlike SV40 tAg, binds Rb proteins and contributes substantially to viral DNA replication.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [911], "author_name_tesi": "Hofstetter, Catherine A.", "last_name_ssi": "Hofstetter", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Catherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dick Frisque", "Richard John Frisque", "Jean Elnora Brenchley", "David Scott Gilmour", "Biao He", "Kouacou Konan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dick Frisque, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Chair", "Jean Elnora Brenchley, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Biao He, Committee Member", "Kouacou Konan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PP2A", "small T antigen", "JC Virus", "viral DNA replication"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Compression of Baled Cellulosic Feedstocks\n", "id": "11913", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1630", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the next decade, a significant portion of the renewable fuels used in the United States will come from cellulosic feedstocks for biofuel production.   A large percentage of these cellulosic feedstocks will come from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops.  Currently, two of the largest obstacles when dealing with cellulosic feedstocks are transportation and storage efficiency.  Since they are not available year round, feedstocks for biofuel must be harvested when available and then transported and stored until needed for production.  Due to their low bulk density, cellulosic feedstocks are expensive to transport long distances, and require a large volume of storage space.  Biomass compression may offer an economically viable solution to these problems.\nBales of corn stover, indiangrass, switchgrass, and wheat straw were compressed to determine their compression behavior in baled form.  On average, the volume of all bales that were compressed was reduced by 67.4%.  The baled crops follow a nonlinear density vs. pressure relationship that can be accurately predicted using an exponential equation.  As loading speed increased, the energy, power, and specific energy required to compress the baled herbaceous biomass crops also increased.  However, since each crop behaved differently during compression, the speed interaction was dependent on type of crop.  To achieve a 60% reduction in bale volume at the slowest compression speed (2.54 mm/s), switchgrass required 15.6%, 61.7%, and 55.4% more energy than indiangrass, corn stover, and wheat straw, respectively.  There were no significant differences in power or specific energy required at the slowest speed (&#945; = 0.05).

Commonly installed negative pressure pit ventilation systems reduce the level of contaminant gases in the manure pit air space, but the negative pressure pit fans are usually too small to effectively ventilate a manure pit for safety purposes prior to and during human entry.  The preferred method for ventilating a manure pit for human entry is to use a positive pressure pit-safety fan that delivers fresh outside air into the manure pit air space at higher air exchange rates.  However, there may be cases where ventilating for a longer duration at lower air exchange rates may be desirable, such as when a pit has a slotted cover and there is an occupied animal living space located above.  In these cases, too high an air exchange rate in the pit can result in dangerous contaminant gas levels in a portion of the animal living space.  This has been one barrier to adoption of pit-safety ventilation practices.  It is not often convenient, or even possible, to relocate all of the animals because of the size of the herd and layout of the facility.  For these cases, it is desirable to determine the best combination of pit-safety fan locations and pit air exchange rates that will result in satisfactory air conditions for welfare of the animals above yet ventilate the pit in a reasonable length of time for human entry.  This research develops methodologies and protocols for evaluating barn air contamination hazards during positive pressure pit-safety ventilation and to demonstrate that manure pit ventilation configuration and fan capacity do influence the level of air contamination hazard in the barn.\n        Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas decay was measured at several locations inside a swine nursery room during manure pit and room ventilation.  A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the nursery room was developed, and transient simulations of pit-safety and room ventilation were performed.  Simulation results were compared to measured gas concentrations at 15 locations.  Results indicated that the simulated temporal gas concentrations at 8 of 15 locations agreed favorably (within validation criteria) after adjusting measured values for a first-order instrument response.\nA trend observed during analysis of CFD simulation results for a given pit and barn shape and ventilation configuration (the same pit-safety fan location and flow rate with the same barn ventilation rate) with different uniform initial manure pit H2S gas concentrations (C0) suggested that the ratio of concentration (C) at each time step during ventilation was equal to the ratio between the initial concentrations inside the manure pit.  It was determined that C/C0 scaling could be used to expand the results from one CFD simulation at one C0 value to a wide range of C0 values.  The maximum error when comparing simulated to estimated C/C0 values was \u00b1 2.5% for the global maximum H2S gas concentration over time.\n        Simulations were performed for a 12.20 m wide \u00d7 30.49 m long (40 ft wide \u00d7 100 ft long) barn located above a full-sized manure pit with a fully-slotted cover.  Tunnel ventilated and mechanically cross-ventilated barn configurations were studied to determine how manure pit-safety ventilation fan configuration (location and flow rate) affects the distribution of H2S gas in the barn airspace during a barn and manure pit-safety ventilation event.  Simulation results were analyzed to determine the affected area in the barn and the duration of time when the concentration of H2S gas was 50 ppm or greater, the maximum H2S concentration in the barn airspace, and how much time was required to reach safe H2S gas entry levels in the manure pit.  During pit-safety ventilation, the maximum concentration in portions of the airspace within both tunnel ventilated and mechanically cross-ventilated barns was equal to the initial manure pit H2S concentration, requiring animals and personnel to be evacuated from those zones when C0 \u2265 50 ppm.\n        The tunnel ventilated barn was divided lengthwise into five 6.10 m long \u00d7 12.20 m wide (20 ft long \u00d7 40 ft wide) quintiles for analysis.  For the tunnel ventilated barn simulated in this study, animals should always be evacuated from the quintile nearest the tunnel ventilation barn exhaust fans when C0 \u2265 50 ppm during pit-safety ventilation.  When C0 \u2265 200 ppm, the pit-safety fan location at the longitudinal and transverse centerline of the barn resulted in more contaminated area in the barn overall and in the three center barn quintiles than all other cases, making this the worst choice for pit-safety ventilation fan location for tunnel ventilated barns.  However, there were large contiguous clear areas in the three center barn quintiles for all other pit-safety fan locations and flow rates, including the case with no pit-safety fan, when the initial manure pit H2S concentration was 300 ppm or lower.  In general, pit-safety fan locations near the barn exhaust fans (counterflow locations) resulted in longer times to reach safe H2S gas entry levels inside the manure pit compared to the case with no pit-safety fan, and pit-safety fan locations near the barn air inlets (parallel flow locations) resulted in shorter times.  Parallel flow with the pit-safety fan located along the longitudinal centerline of the barn resulted in less overall contaminated area in the barn than all other cases as well as the case with no pit-safety fan.\n        The mechanically cross-ventilated barn was divided into five 2.44 m long \u00d7 30.49 m wide (8 ft long \u00d7 100 ft wide) quintiles for analysis.  For the mechanically cross-ventilated barn simulated in this study, animals should be evacuated from at least portions of the quintile nearest the barn exhaust fans and the two quintiles farthest from the barn exhaust fans when C0 \u2265 50 ppm during pit-safety ventilation.  However, there were large contiguous clear areas in the remaining two barn quintiles for all simulated cases when the initial manure pit H2S concentration was 200 ppm or lower.  All pit-safety fan locations and flow rates resulted in shorter times to reach safe H2S gas entry levels in the manure pit compared to the case with no pit-safety fan.\n        This work demonstrates the potential for evaluating alternative pit-safety ventilation configurations to reduce the need for animal evacuation from portions of barns located above positive pressure safety ventilated manure pits.  Parallel flow pit-safety fan locations were more effective for the tunnel ventilated barn, with more contamination near the barn exhaust fans and along the barn sidewalls.  In general, parallel flow pit-safety fan locations with higher flow rates resulted in shorter times to reach safe H2S gas entry levels in the manure pit, but increased contaminated area in the barn airspace.  Animals do not need to be removed from barns during pit-safety ventilation when the maximum initial H2S concentration inside the manure pit is less than 50 ppm.  The protocols developed for this study can be used by engineers when designing and evaluating manure pit-safety ventilation systems to reduce the risk of creating hazardous conditions inside the barn during pit-safety ventilation.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16231], "author_name_tesi": "Hofstetter, Daniel William", "last_name_ssi": "Hofstetter", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Virendra M.

Stimuli received at the cell surface and transduced to the nucleus can expect to be modified by any number of inputs in a highly context-dependent and cell-specific manner.  Nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#954;B) and transforming growth factor &#946;-1 (TGF&#946;-1) are not only critical factors mediating inflammation, but they also play a substantial role in cancer progression.  Therefore, understanding the intersection of these factors may shed light on inflammatory diseases and progression of cancer in skin.   However, little is known about how TGF&#946;-1 and NF&#954;B interact in keratinocytes, which rely heavily on both factors to maintain homeostasis.  These studies provide data in keratinocytes that suggest TGF&#946;-1 modulated NF&#954;B-dependent expression of proinflammatory cytokines, namely TNF&#945;.  Although results in these studies fail to show TGF&#946;-1-mediated activation of upstream molecules of the canonical NF&#954;B pathway or translocation of NF&#954;B, preliminary evidence reveals that TGF&#946;-1 activating kinase (TAK-1) may provide a molecular link between TGF&#946;-1 receptor activation and NF&#954;B transactivation.  In spite of the fact that upstream signaling events are only speculative and part of ongoing inquiry, results presented in this chapter support the hypothesis that TGF&#946;-1-mediated NF&#954;B transactivation of gene expression is Smad3-dependent.  Furthermore, TGF&#946;-1 potentiates NF&#954;B binding to consensus DNA sites, which putatively involves both the p50 and p65 subunit.  The biological relevance of TGF&#946;-1 and NF&#954;B crosstalk leading to expression of proinflammatory cytokines is also explored.  Preliminary evidence suggests that this pathway may have a role in TGF&#946;-1-mediated apoptosis, differentiation, and ras-mediated induction of NF&#954;B-dependent genes in keratinocytes.  These studies are the first to show an intersection between TGF&#946;-1 and NF&#954;B pathways, which may represent a mechanism by which TGF&#946;-1 \u2018tunes\u2019 or modulates NF&#954;B-dependent gene expression.\nThe biological relevance of TGF&#946;-1-mediated TNF&#945; was then explored in the context of ultraviolet radiation responsiveness, which elicits an inflammatory response involving the proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#945;.  Ultraviolet radiation, particularly the UVB wavelengths ranging from 280-320 nm, is a whole carcinogen capable of initiating and promoting squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), among other types of skin cancer, in both humans and laboratory rodents after repeated UVB exposure over time.  Responsiveness to UVB, specifically, has not been particularly well-characterized in keratinocytes.  Presently, the literature reflects more rigorous characterization of the UVC wavelengths in cell types that are typically not sun-exposed.  Furthermore, published studies using the mouse as a model to inquire into TGF&#946;-1-mediated UVB responsiveness are non-existent.  The present studies, performed in mouse and in primary keratinocytes isolated from mouse, demonstrate the intersection of TGF&#946;-1 and NF&#954;B in the context of UVB responsiveness.  Specifically, the hypothesis to be tested predicts that response to UVB will be partially dependent on TGF&#946;-1 signaling.  UVB treated mice and keratinocytes in culture demonstrated Smad3- and NF&#954;B-dependent expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#945; between 2-6 h post treatment and required an intact TGF&#946;-1 signaling pathway.  Furthermore, an acute decrement in Smad7 expression was observed initially, but restored to control levels by 6 h.  Smad7 repression also appears to be partially Smad3 dependent.

The tethered polymer chains were grafted from a mixed monolayer gradient by sequential exposure to difunctional oligomers of ethylene-oxide and ethylene.  The relative lengths of the two alternating oligomers were varied, which altered the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance within the polymer repeat unit, thereby allowing for tailoring the polymer\u2019s collapse transition in aqueous solution.  Contact angle measurements and dry topographic Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were utilized to confirm the existence of a well-defined grafting density gradient for the end-tethered polymers.  The temperature response of the tethered gradient was assessed using under-water AFM force-distance spectroscopy with a custom hydrophobic colloidal probe.  It was found that the adhesion between the probe and the temperature-responsive surface could be reversibly switched upon heating/cooling through the collapse/expansion of the tethered layer.  Regarding the impact of polymer grafting density on the temperature-induced collapse, it was found that both the magnitude and onset temperature of the adhesion switches are grafting density dependent.\n     Wettability experiments were conducted in the captive bubble configuration, as a function of temperature, and provided additional evidence that the temperature response of the smart surface could be systematically tuned by varying the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance across the tethered chain\u2019s backbone.  The contact angle results also helped to verify that the adhesion switches observed in the under-water AFM experiments were a manifestation of, primarily, the switching in interfacial surface tension between the tethered chains and water.  The collapse of the tethered layers occurs at similar temperatures as the cloud points of same-composition untethered chains in aqueous solution; however, the transitions for the tethered layers are broadened in temperature, which is consistent with the collapse of a planar layer being a cooperative conformational transition.    \n     Finally, to demonstrate the possible utility of the tunable temperature-responsive surfaces in biomedical applications, particularly in tissue engineering, the interactions between human serum albumin (HSA), a blood plasma protein, and the smart surface were investigated.  HSA was covalently grafted to a colloidal probe and it is demonstrated that the adhesion between the protein and the surface can be reversibly switched in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution via temperature variation.  At temperatures below the LCST collapse of the tethered layer, instances of polymer stretching, protein stretching and combined polymer/protein stretching are observed.  The origin of this behavior can be attributed to the formation of bridging segments, comprised of either polymer chains, protein molecules, or entangled chains and protein molecules, between the probe and the surface, which are stretched upon the retraction of the probe.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [977], "author_name_tesi": "Hogshead, Charles Gregory", "last_name_ssi": "Hogshead", "middle_name_ssi": "Gregory", "first_name_ssi": "Charles", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Evangelos Manias", "Evangelos Manias", "Paul C Painter", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Seong Han Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Evangelos Manias, Dissertation Advisor", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Chair", "Paul C Painter, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Seong Han Kim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["atomic force microscopy", "switchable adhesion", "grafting density gradient", "temperature-responsive", "tethered polymer", "human serum albumin"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Does the Bad Outweigh the Good?

Specifically, team member deviance and citizenship behavior were examined as both configural (aggregated via minimum, maximum, variance, mean) and shared (norms demonstrating within group agreement) properties in their relationship to team outcomes. By examining both constructs in the same study, the relative effects of citizenship and deviance could be explored. In addition, deviance was explored as a multidimensional construct at the team-level and found to have two dimensions: lack of effort and interpersonal deviance. \nResults from a study of 56 student teams provided evidence that team member deviance and team member citizenship behavior are distinct constructs. Lack of effort (mean, maximum, variance) was negatively related to team grades, but only citizenship behaviors operationalized as the lowest scorer in the team was related to task performance.  In contrast, citizenship behaviors (mean, maximum, minimum) demonstrated consistent positive relationships with both team satisfaction and viability, whereas team satisfaction was only found to relate to maximum lack of effort. Overall, team member deviance outweighed citizenship behavior as a predictor of task performance, but citizenship behavior outweighed deviance as a predictor of team satisfaction and viability. Citizenship norms were positively related and deviance norms were negatively related to team grade, team satisfaction and team viability.

Self-assembled monolayer (SAMs) of organic thiols on Au{111} are examined, with an emphasis on structure/function relationships, particularly those related to the interplay between molecular geometry and intermolecular forces and how this translates to the structure and properties of supramolecular assemblies.  The quadripartite SAM is composed of a substrate support, a 'head group' functionality that binds molecules to the substrate, a backbone that self-organizes with neighboring molecules, and a 'tail group' that dictates the chemistry of the interface.  Each of these components is altered in turn and exploited to test fundamental assumptions and to construct new classes of materials. \n\tThe tail group is first replaced with a bulky cage molecule, the adamantane diamondoid, which by design simplifies the supramolecular assembly.  The spherical cages generate distinct two-dimensional (2D) structures that determine the contribution of geometric factors to the structure and properties of an assembly.  Cage molecules of similar size, based on carborane frameworks, are examined in detail.  The different orientations of carboranethiol isomers' molecular dipole moments influence the properties of their assemblies, including the stability of SAMs and the coverage of carboranethiolates in competitive binding conditions. \n\tBuilding on the adamantane framework, the head group attachment atom is changed from sulfur to selenium, resulting in a complex, dynamic double lattice of 1-adamantaneselenolate on Au{111}.  There are two binding modes for selenols on gold: molecules at bridge sites have lower conductance than molecules at three-fold hollow sites.  The monolayer is dynamic, with molecules switching reversibly between the two site-dependent conductance states. \n\tOur approach to produce SAMs on technologically important substrates takes advantage of the many strategies previously developed for gold-thiol self-assembly.  Direct assembly of alkanethiols on germanium is impeded by the presence of the native germanium oxide.  Depositing SAMs from a mixture of water and ethanol provides an environment where both adsorbate and oxide are soluble and single-step self-assembly is enabled. \n\tDrawing from our work on the analysis of 2D assemblies, a SAM was designed that deposits on and controls the morphology of liquid-phase eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) nanoparticles.  Particle formation is directed by molecular self-assembly and assisted by sonication. As the bulk liquid alloy is ultrasonically dispersed, fast thiolate self assembly at the EGaIn interface protects the material against oxidation.  The ligand shell has been designed to include intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which induce surface strain, and assists cleavage of the alloy particles to the nanoscale.  \n\tFinally, the composition of a surface at the micro- and nanoscale is controlled by the chemical patterning of SAMs using microcontact printing.   The dynamic molecular ink concentration at a polymer stamp/substrate interface during long-duration patterning experiments is emphasized.  By exerting control over molecular flux, one can likewise control the molecular-scale order and the rate of molecular exchange of SAMs.  These techniques are extended to germanium, and used to achieve the first report of the direct chemical patterning of oxide-free germanium by submerged microcontact printing.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2903], "author_name_tesi": "Hohman , James Nathan", "last_name_ssi": "Hohman ", "middle_name_ssi": "Nathan", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss", "Paul S Weiss", "David Lawrence Allara", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Jun Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul S Weiss, Committee Chair", "David Lawrence Allara, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Jun Huang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["self-assembly", "nanoscience", "nanotechnology", "self-assembled monolayer", "nanoparticle", "supramolecular chemistry", "chemical patterning", "microcontact printing", "soft lithography"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "shrinkage characteristics of alkali activated fly ash-slag binders\n\n", "id": "23713", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10814", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Substituting ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with industrial waste such as blast furnace slag (BFS) or fly ash (FA) reduces the amount of CO2 released to the atmosphere by the cement industry. Alkali activated cement (AAC) is a promising new binder, that could serve as an alternative to OPC. Alkali-activated binders, based on slag and fly ash are two prevalent categories of AAC. These binders are composed of a precursor powder (e.g., FA, BFS) and an alkaline solution (activator) as the mixing liquid.\n\nDespite the fact that alkali activated fly ash (AAFA) has comparable or even higher strength than OPC, the curing temperature-dependent mechanical and microstructural properties of AAFA limit the commercial application of these materials. This study shows that adding a small amount of slag can rectify this problem. However, adding slag can lead to larger volumetric instability (i.e., shrinkage potential), causing durability issues in the new binders. This research studies the influence of three volumetric ratios of slag to fly ash (S/FA ratio= 0.1, 0.15 and 0.20) on shrinkage characteristics of alkali activated fly ash/slag blended binders (AAFAS). Three different types of shrinkage deformations, including: chemical, autogenous and drying shrinkage are evaluated in this study. In addition, the effect of activator pH (14.44 vs. 14.04) on early age deformation of blended S/FA binders with the three S/FA volumetric ratios is also studied. \n\nThe results of this study indicate that while addition of slag can significantly reduce the time of setting and enhance the compressive strength of blended binders, cured at ambient temperature; larger slag replacement leads to higher autogenous shrinkage. Nevertheless, it was also observed that the greater S/FA volumetric ratio led to the reduction in drying shrinkage of binary mortars and chemical shrinkage of the AAFAS pastes. Comparing the shrinkage measurement of two different pH values of the activators for a given S/FA volumetric ratios, it was found that the higher the pH of the activator, the lower drying and autogenous shrinkage; however the higher pH solution resulted in larger chemical shrinkage.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10423], "author_name_tesi": "Hojati, Maryam ", "last_name_ssi": "Hojati", "first_name_ssi": "Maryam", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aleksandra Z Radlinska"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aleksandra Z Radlinska, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["alkali-activated binary binder", "chemical shrinkage", "autogenous shrinkage", "drying shrinkage", "Slag-to-fly ash ratio", "setting time"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Shrinkage and Creep of Alkali-Activated Binders  ", "id": "14323mzh206", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14323", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Alkali-activated binders (AAB) are the cement-free binder which could serve as a promising alternative for OPC with significant environmental and durability benefits. AAB is formed through a chemical reaction between high-alkaline solution and alumino-silicate source material (mostly industrial by-products such as fly ash or blast furnace slag). In recent years, much research has been devoted to investigate engineering properties of this material. However, AAB has not yet been entered the mainstream concrete industry, in particular, due to uncertainties and challenges with respect to the durability characteristics of these new binders. One area of significance is any potential for crack growth caused by shrinkage or creep of this green binder. This research questions the shrinkage susceptibility of different AABs, the effective parameters that can influence the risk of shrinkage, and the time-dependent response (creep) of AABs under sustained compressive load.  \nIn the first part of this study, four different AABs were designed and their drying shrinkage at four different relative humidities (RHs) was studied. AAB pastes include an alkali-activated class F fly ash (AAFA), an alkali-activated slag (AAS) and two binary of different proportion of fly ash/slag mixtures. The initial porosity of AABs and control OPC are identical and their activating solutions were designed to result in a mortar with 28-day compressive strength of 30 MPa or larger. The results indicated that all AAB pastes cured at 23oC exhibited higher shrinkage compared to OPC paste and that shrinkage increased with the higher content of fly ash. However, the steam-cured AAFA paste had the coarsest pore size and the least shrinkage. On the other hand, AABs containing slag showed a finer pore structure, larger saturation level, lower stiffness, and higher time-dependent shrinkage compared to those of OPC. In addition, shrinkage trend of various AABs at different ambient RHs were not similar. Interestingly, for AABs rich in slag, the largest drying shrinkage was observed at 50% RH while the largest shrinkage of OPC and fly ash rich pastes was reported at the lowest RH (i.e., 30%RH). \nThe second part investigates the time-dependent deformation (creep) and the impact of elevated temperature on drying shrinkage of four AABs studied in the first part. The effect of curing-temperature on drying shrinkage of AAB pastes was evaluated by comparing the shrinkage of moist-cured versus steam-cured minibars at 50% relative humidity. The shrinkage results provided evidence that the steam curing stiffened the matrix of these binders and remarkably reduced the drying shrinkage. In addition, creep characteristic of four AAB mortars were also measured. It was noticed that the time-dependent response of slag rich AABs was higher than steam-cured fly ash mortar. This phenomenon is likely to explain why the slag rich binders shrunk more under continually internal stress induced by drying and exhibited greater time-dependent or viscous deformation. \nSince the results indicate that AAFA shows lower or comparable shrinkage compared to OPC, finally the last part of this research evaluates the shrinkage propensity of the steam-cured AAFA in more details. In this part, the impact of activating solution, RH and curing regime on drying shrinkage of AAFA were studied. The results provide evidence that the addition of dissolved silicate to alkaline solution plays an important role in the physical and mechanical properties of AAFA. Furthermore, heat-cured AAFA paste dried faster; and its shrinkage and mass change reached equilibrium more quickly compared to OPC ones. Similar to OPC, the highest drying shrinkage and mass loss of AAFA pastes took place at the lowest humidity (i.e. RH=30%) and there is a bilinear relationship between RH and shrinkage of AAFA. The experimental results indicate that a longer steam-curing duration can stabilize the microstructure of binders and reduce the shrinkage without any notable change in the mass loss of the binder.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15393], "author_name_tesi": "Hojati, Maryam ", "last_name_ssi": "Hojati", "first_name_ssi": "Maryam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aleksandra Radlinska", "Aleksandra Radlinska", "Farshad Rajabipour", "Ali M.

In order to carry out these network management tasks the topology must first be obtained, often using probing.

We consider two topics highly related to these problems; network inference required to obtain the topology when it is unknown and modeling cascading failures in interdependent networks as a network operation with full knowledge of the topology.\n\nIn this thesis we first present iTop, an algorithm for topology inference when complete information about a network's topology is not available.

Polyfurfuryl alcohol (PFA)-derived carbons fall under the category of porous, non-graphitizing carbons and have a tunable porosity and surface area.    These carbons have received significant attention due to their potential application in capacitors, fuel cell anodes and cathodes, as adsorbents and molecular sieves.  Their narrow pore size distribution provides adsorptive selectively which is based on size and shape. This limits the extent which those molecules can enter and diffuse through their porous network.  By incorporating metal nanoparticles into PFA prior to the pyrolysis, catalytically active metal sites can be made that are sheathed by a layer of microporous carbon.  The formation of active sites embedded within the porous surface can lead to selective catalysis with reactants that are able to diffuse through the pores.  Gas phase reactions had been conducted on such catalysts and a high selectivity was observed for planar, linear molecules.  Yet the use of these catalysts had not been expanded into liquid phase reactions due to pore size restrictions.  In order to explore the use of such shape selective catalysts for liquid phase hydrogenation reactions, a newly synthesized PFA-derived carbon was examined for use in liquid phase.  This forms the crux of this thesis. \nA literature survey is provided in Chapter 1. It details the synthesis and formation of PFA-derived carbons, their use as molecular sieves, and applications for these carbons. There is also a review of the synthesis of boron-doped carbon to be used as a support for dispersing metal for enhancing hydrogen exchange processes including adsorption and desorption. \nThe formation and characterization of selective PFA-derived carbon catalysts is presented in Chapter 2.  To form such catalysts, platinum nanoparticles were synthesized using the monomer, furfuryl alcohol, as the reducing agent.  Then the nanoparticle and monomer mixture was polymerized and cured to immobilize the nanoparticles within the polymeric solid prior to pyrolysis.  By altering the solvent used in polymerization, mesoporosity was created, or not, while microporosity was retained.  \nFurthermore, the catalytic activity and selectivity of these catalysts were extensively studied and analyzed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4.  Chapter 3 describes catalytic activity and selectivity of the experimental catalysts compared to a conventional catalyst for liquid phase hydrogenations.  Wholly microporous catalysts were not active, but those which were both microporous and mesoporous catalysts were.  The active catalysts were shown to be highly selective toward linear, planar molecules.  Chapter 4 applies mathematical models to describe the rate limitations of the catalysts as well as the effect of porosity on activity and selectivity.   \nIn Chapter 5 and Chapter 6, a boron substituted carbon, BCx, is described which was formed by chemical vapor deposition. This could be made either as a non-porous solid or as a thin layer on a high surface area silica aerogel.  Chapter 5 outlines the effects of synthesis parameters on the as-synthesized bulk material.  The chemical environment of boron in the material was thoroughly characterized and was found to be trigonal planar.  Chapter 6 explores the use of high area silica aerogel as a support onto which BCx may be deposited. Synthesis and characterization of this material was followed by experiments aimed at measuring its adsorptive properties for hydrogen.  \nChapter 7 concludes the work with suggestions on how to increase the activity of PFA-derived carbon catalysts while retaining selectivity.   Some of the suggestions, provided with preliminary data, display how mesoporosity and concentration of available active sites are the major factor in activity, while microporosity is the contributing factor in selectivity.  These three parameters are intertwined, and altering one correlates to changes in the others.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [731], "author_name_tesi": "Holbrook, Billy-Paul  Matthew", "last_name_ssi": "Holbrook", "middle_name_ssi": "Matthew", "first_name_ssi": "Billy-Paul ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Henry C Foley", "Henry C Foley", "Chunshan Song", "Ayusman Sen", "David Lawrence Allara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Henry C Foley, Dissertation Advisor", "Henry C Foley, Committee Chair", "Chunshan Song, Committee Chair", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member", "David Lawrence Allara, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["catalysis", "carbon"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "FOREGROUNDING NARRATIVITY IN WRIGHT/MARIANELLI PERIOD DRAMAS", "id": "15269ajh5696", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15269", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis will explore narrativity through leitmotivic technique and semiotic codes in Dario Marianelli\u2019s scores for three literary adaptations: Anna Karenina (dir.

Traditional period dramas\u2019 overwhelming preoccupation with the portrayal of literary themes (most notably, romantic love), forces filmmakers to gloss over character development and social commentary. With their often flat, poorly drawn characters, period dramas emphasize the progression of dramatic action rather than the realism of the characters\u2019 emotions and motivations.

The level of artifice they employ produces a self-reflective quality that continually develops and reexamines characters\u2019 inner workings. Wright and Marianelli remind viewers that they are not experiencing events, but rather a mediated narration. Wright\u2019s characteristic mannerisms (such as extended tracking shots, visual blending of the diegetic and non-diegetic) consistently reinforce an outside narrative presence, centering the experience of watching a film as opposed to being engrossed in its diegesis, and forcing viewers to assess their own perceptions of the characters and situations. Marianelli\u2019s use of self-referential music likewise draws attention to his mediation of the characters\u2019 identity.

Historical access to these technologies and services have often been prohibitively expensive, with terrestrial laser scanner costs exceeding six-figures and aerial campaigns costing tens-of-thousands of dollars, daily. This has limited their use in forestry to high-value, or short-rotation, species such as loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) across the American South and Eucalyptus in the tropics.

Small, modular LiDAR sensors from companies such as Velodyne LiDAR can now be had for $4,000 USD. The availability of these sensors is only the first step to integrating them into natural resource management solutions and tools. This study has focused on standardizing both the protocols by which a low-cost laser scanner can be deployed in the field, how those data are collected and processed, and an evaluation of the individual stem detection and diameter estimates produced from the dense point clouds. \n\tDeveloping free and open source software solutions, processes and schematics was central to the aim of this study. Chapter 2 provides extensive documentation of system requirements, set-up parameters, embedded computer systems and required software to successfully capture LiDAR data in a variety of configurations. Significant effort was put forth to create a modular LiDAR system that can be deployed both aerially, and terrestrially, with minimal downtime between configurations. To assess the capacity of the system, it was deployed in both static and mobile terrestrial configurations to collect plot-level data in forested stands. Data were captured, processed and compared to in-situ measures taken from 7.5 m plots at three site locations. \n\tEstimates of stem diameter, taper, branching structure, and height are central measures to evaluating both biomass and potential market value of individual trees. The traditionally required field work to assess both value and volume are time- and labor-intensive. Two algorithms were evaluated for their ability to detect individual stems and estimate their diameter in the collected point clouds (Chapter 3). The LAS2Rings and TreeLS algorithms use the Hough Transform to identify stem locations and RANSAC fitting to estimate diameter. The algorithms were both able to successfully produce stem locations and diameters. However, due to the small n, statistically significant conclusions could not be drawn when comparing the in-situ and cloud measures. Other limitations were observed throughout the study and potential solutions were addressed to better process and capture data (Chapter 4).\n\tThe technology presented and developed within this study shows considerable promise. Additional research is required to fully realize its potential as a widely adopted tool for natural resource land managers. This would include refinement of the capture methodology, optimization of the co-registration algorithms, and a substantial increase in in-situ measures for further statistical comparison. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16781], "author_name_tesi": "Holderman, Brennan Reese", "last_name_ssi": "Holderman", "middle_name_ssi": "Reese", "first_name_ssi": "Brennan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marc Eric Mcdill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marc Eric Mcdill, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["lidar"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Friends and Foes: The Influence of Status Homophily and Status Conflict in Boards of Directors on Director Exit and Firm Outcomes", "id": "18679", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8893", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the relationship between directors\u2019 status and firm outcomes in the context of newly public firms. Across two empirical essays I examine two relatively understudied aspects of status issues in the context of corporate boards: (1) the significance of status homophily in directors\u2019 decisions to continue serving on or exiting boards, and (2) the beneficial and detrimental effects of status homogeneity among directors serving on a board. \nIn the first essay, I extend research on status homophily that has largely studied its significance in the formation of associations by showing that status homophily is an important factor even for the continuation of associations. Specifically, I find that as pre-existing board prestige decreases, that is, as the level of status homophily experienced by incumbent directors decreases, high-status directors are more likely than non-high-status directors to discontinue their association with the firm and exit the board. Additionally, I find that directors\u2019 desires to influence firm outcomes makes it less likely that they would exit the firm when status homophily decreases. \nIn the second essay, I examine whether status homogeneity among directors on a board can have detrimental effects on firm outcomes including director exit, firm acquisition and firm performance, during the initial years following the firm\u2019s IPO. Contrary to prior research that posits that status homogeneity among members of a group can usher in unproductive conflict and competitive engagements resulting in negative group performance, I find that directors\u2019 status homogeneity is negatively related to director exit, is less likely to lead to firm acquisition and positively related to firm performance. However, the effects of status homogeneity have a negative relationship with the likelihood of director exit when the director is the chair of the audit committee and when CEOs are less powerful, and has a negative relationship with firm performance when tenure overlap among the directors is low and there is substantial expertise overlap among the directors.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8736], "author_name_tesi": "Holehonnur, Abhijith K", "last_name_ssi": "Holehonnur", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Abhijith", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Management - Business Adminstration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy Grant Pollock", "Donald C Hambrick", "Vilmos Fosnocht Misangyi", "Alok Kumar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy Grant Pollock, Dissertation Advisor", "Donald C Hambrick, Committee Member", "Vilmos Fosnocht Misangyi, Committee Member", "Alok Kumar, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Board of Directors", "IPO", "Status homophily", "Status conflict"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Flavor Oscillations With Sterile Neutrinos\nand In Dense Neutrino Environments", "id": "24799", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11022", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many experiments have provided evidence for neutrino flavor oscillations, and consequently that neutrinos are in fact massive which is not predicted by the Standard Model.  Many experiments have been built to constrain the parameters which determine flavor oscillations, and for only three flavors of neutrinos the mixing parameters are well known, aside from the CP violating phase for two mass hierarchies.  Most experimental data can be well explained by mixing between three flavors of neutrinos, however oscillation anomalies from several experiments, most notably from LSND (Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector) have suggested that there may be additional flavors of neutrinos beyond those in the Standard Model.  One of the focuses of this dissertation is the possibility of adding new flavors of right-handed neutrinos to the Standard Model to account for oscillation anomalies, and exploring the consequences of sterile neutrinos for other experiments.\n\nSensitivities to a particular model of sterile neutrinos at the future Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment will be determined, in which CP effects introduced by the sterile neutrinos play an important role.  It will be demonstrated how, by combining data from the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment along with data from Daya Bay and T2K, it is possible to provide evidence for or rule out this model of sterile neutrinos.\n\nA chi-squared analysis is used to determine the significance of measuring the effects of sterile neutrinos in IceCube; it will be shown that it may be possible to extract evidence for sterile neutrinos from high energy atmospheric neutrinos in IceCube.  Furthermore it will be demonstrated how measuring neutrino flavor ratios from astrophysical sources in IceCube can help to distinguish between the three flavor scenario and a beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenario involving sterile neutrinos.  Measuring astrophysical as well as atmospheric neutrinos can evince the existence of sterile neutrinos.\n\nDespite the fact that the mixing parameters for the three Standard Model neutrino flavors are well known, some implications of neutrino interactions for flavor oscillations are not well understood.  Neutrinos can interact with one another in a similar way to how neutrinos interact with normal matter.  Neutrino-neutrino forward scattering can lead to a flavor swap for the propagating neutrino, or the propagating neutrino can retain its original flavor.  These interactions contribute an effective potential to the Hamiltonian describing the flavor evolution which depends on a background neutrino density.  In normal matter the neutrino density is very low which allows for neutrino-neutrino interactions to be ignored, however these interactions can dominate over vacuum and normal matter interactions in very dense environments such as core-collapse supernovae and early universe scenarios.\n\nNeutrino-neutrino interactions give rise to terms quadratic in neutrino densities in the equations of motion, and can give rise to what is called collective oscillations resulting from interference with vacuum and normal matter effects.  The non-linearity has made the problem of solving for collective oscillations analytically intractable without simplifying assumptions, and has made this a problem relegated to supercomputer simulations.  This dissertation is concerned with analytic methods for solving the equations of motion for core-collapse neutrino propagation.  \n\nIt will be shown here that, by keeping only $\\nu\\nu$-interactions at initial distances outward from the supernova core, it is possible to solve the equations of motion by factorizing vacuum oscillations and the effects of $\\nu\\nu$-interactions.  Furthermore, it will be shown how using this factorization scheme it is possible to predict where flavor oscillations become unstable.  This is an important development because it can allow one to predict the neutrino flux in Earth experiments from core-collapse supernovae, while at the same time gaining an understanding of the underlying physics involved in complicated processes such as collective oscillations and the rapid growth of oscillations at medium range distances.

Similarly, various gate dielectrics and methods of deposition are investigated and a reproducible, robust technique for the deposition of thin, high-k gate dielectrics on epitaxial graphene is developed.  This technique utilizes high-k oxide seeds evaporated directly from a high-purity oxide source using electron beam physical vapor deposition as a seed layer for subsequent growth by atomic layer deposition.  Importantly, this method not only produces uniform, conformal, and robust gate dielectrics, but also leads to an improvement in the transport properties of the underlying graphene, which has been attributed to dielectric screening and a reduction of remote charged impurity scattering.

As the number of two-dimensional and layered material systems investigated increases, so too does the number of potential applications. Currently, there exist several fundamental questions as to the role these materials might play in future electronic applications. As an example, graphene has been suggested for use as the channel material in high frequency transistors due to its exceptionally high carrier mobility, but also as an interconnect for integrated circuits due to its excellent thermal properties and ability to support very high current densities.

Designers frequently focus on creating a design for a specific target market that does not include users with disabilities; however, recent studies have shown that creating designs for both people with and without disabilities is beneficial for ethical and financial reasons, and often results in an improved design for all. Therefore, human capability data can be used to create universal designs appropriate for the vast ranges of capabilities that exist in people with and without disabilities.

As condensed matter physicists, who are often more at home in the microscopic, our primary concerns have typically focused on ordered arrays of nano sized atoms or ordered arrays of micro sized dielectric scatterers. In either case, the arrays serve as diffraction gratings for electrons or photons, creating a rich medley of phenomena, including total destructive interference, which manifests itself as an electronic or photonic band gap, or impurity bands, where heterogeniety can lead to gap states with real wavevectors. In this dissertation we study the subtle interplay between order and disorder in photonic crystals and conventional solid state crystals. We exploit photonic crystal / electronic crystal similarities to derive interesting new results. We also focus on differences to construct novel computational techniques.\n\nIn Chapter 1 we introduce the concept of the photonic crystal in close analogy to the more familiar electronic crystal. We fully develop a photonic crystal master equation, suitable for calculating photonic band structures and related quantities in ordered photonic crystals. For disordered arrays of scattering centers we develop a master equation suitable for arbitrary configurations of arbitrary scattering centers.\n\nIn Chapter 2 we introduce an optimization algorithm that combines full photonic band structure calculations with perturbation theory to find the optimum photonic crystal for any predetermined photonic property. We perform a band gap maximization on two-dimensional square and triangular lattices, finding photonic crystals with complete band gaps at the lowest dielectric contrasts to date. We also find two previously undiscovered ultra-large band gap photonic crystals.\n\nIn Chapter 3 we study several novel photonic devices and fabrication techniques.

Sustained activation of the AHR resulting from exposure to the high affinity and metabolically resistant environmental pollutant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) causes a myriad of deleterious responses in humans and rodents.  The AHR is also physiologically involved in liver development and immune system homeostasis.  Therefore, obtaining a full mechanistic appreciation of AHR properties is imperative to understand how the AHR exerts its physiologic properties.  In its inactive form the AHR resides in the cytoplasm as a multi-protein complex consisting of one AHR molecule and a dimer of the 90 kDa heat shock protein (HSP90).  Additionally, the co-chaperone proteins p23 and the hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2 (XAP2) can be found in the unliganded receptor complex.  The research presented in this thesis investigates the regulation of AHR activity by XAP2 in cell culture as well as in transgenic mouse models.  Through studies in cell culture utilizing a point mutant form of the AHR that is unable to functionally interact with XAP2 it is demonstrated that XAP2 acts as a repressor of AHR transcriptional activity.  The absence of endogenous XAP2 binding to the mutant receptor results in higher transcriptional activity than the non-mutant AHR.  Therefore, it is concluded that XAP2 modulates AHR activity, but its presence in the mature unliganded AHR complex is not essential for the formation of a transcriptionally competent receptor.  XAP2 protein levels are low in liver compared to many other tissues.  This led to the hypothesis that XAP2 levels in the liver are not sufficient to maximally regulate AHR transcriptional activity.  Two lines of transgenic mice were generated that exhibited high, hepatocyte-specific expression of XAP2.  Gene expression experiments were performed in mice using a broad dose range of the AHR agonist beta- naphthoflavone.  Surprisingly, little difference in gene expression was observed between wild type and transgenic mouse lines.  It was determined that although the liver expression of XAP2 was much higher in transgenic as compared to wild type mice, no significant stoichiometric increase in XAP2 binding within the unliganded AHR complex occurred.  Consequently, it is concluded that the seemingly \u201clow\u201d levels of expressed XAP2 in liver are sufficient to maximally associate with AHR-HSP90 complexes and regulate AHR transcriptional activation.  Finally, preliminary experiments demonstrate that the carcinogenic diol epoxide forms of select polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are capable of interacting with the AHR.  They may utilize the AHR binding pocket to gain access to the nuclear DNA by way of receptor nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, whereby they can form potentially cancer-inducing DNA adducts.  These introductory experiments set a foundation for future analysis of the AHR\u2019s contribution to DNA damage resulting from exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [645], "author_name_tesi": "Hollingshead, Brett David", "last_name_ssi": "Hollingshead", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Brett", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary H Perdew", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Ming Tien", "Scott Trent Feldman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary H Perdew, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Scott Trent Feldman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aryl hydrocarbon receptor", "XAP2", "HSP90", "gene regulation", "chaperone proteins", "AIP"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Ligand Activation of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Beta Induces Terminal Differentiation and Attenuates Colon Cancer\n", "id": "7674", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2189", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the last decade, the physiological roles of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta (PPARbeta) have begun to emerge.  It is now known as a key regulator of a battery of genes involved a number of metabolic processes.  PPARbeta is highly expressed in epithelial tissues, and it has become clear that the receptor functions in the development of a number of epithelial cancers, including cancer of the colon.  The specific role of PPARbeta in colon cancer is uncertain, however, due to current inconsistencies in the literature.  While some evidence suggests that PPARbeta can potentiate colon cancer, a growing body of evidence suggests that PPARbeta can attenuate colon cancer.  In the present studies, the role of PPARbeta in the development of colon carcinogenesis was examined.  Using both genetic and chemical models, it was demonstrated that PPARbeta attenuates colon cancer.  Supporting these results, it was shown that PPARbeta mRNA expression is decreased in colon adenomas, consistent with a number of previous reports and in contrast to others.  Further studies using a PPARbeta-null mouse model and a highly specific PPARbeta ligand revealed that ligand activation inhibits the development of colon cancer in a dose-dependent manner, and this inhibition is due to induction of terminal differentiation in the colonocotyes, associated with the subsequent induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation.   On a molecular level, using quantitative realtime PCR and ChIP analyses, these studies showed that terminal differentiation induced by ligand activation of PPARbeta is a result of the direct transcriptional activation of a number of target genes including ADRP, FABP and cathepsin E, all markers of differentiation in the colon.  Through experiments in cell culture using three distinct colon cancer cell lines, these studies demonstrated that ligand activation of PPARbeta inhibits cell proliferation, and this inhibition is seen independent of the presence or absence of serum/growth factors.  Additional analyses in these cells determined that discrepancies in the literature are not a result of the structural differences between ligands, nor are they a result of the differences between in vivo and in vitro model systems.  To begin to further characterize the molecular changes underlying this PPARbeta-dependent attenuation of colon cancer, experiments were done using a PPARbeta ligand coupled with a known inhibitor of colon cancer, the COX2-inhibitor nimesulide.  These studies revealed that both ligand activation of PPARbeta and COX2 inhibition attenuate the development of colon cancer independently.  However, these two pathways (PPARbeta activation and COX2 inhibition) may work additively or synergistically to elicit an enhanced attenuation of colon cancer.  Finally, the studies performed here show that PPARbeta has an anti-inflammatory role in the colon, protecting from experimentally-induced colitis.  This role, however, appears to be independent of ligand activation, and further research must be performed to delineate the mechanisms of this anti-inflammatory function.  The ability of PPARbeta to be anti-inflammatory has strong implications in colon cancer, as it has been shown that attenuation of inflammation corelates well with attenuation of colon cancer.  Collectively, the experiments performed in these studies provide strong evidence that PPARbeta attenuates colon carcinogenesis through induction of terminal differentiation in colonocytes, with the subsequent induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation.  These works will help to clarify the current controversies in the literature and provide strong evidence that ligands for PPARbeta could aid in the treatment and/or prevention of colon cancer.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2170], "author_name_tesi": "Hollingshead, Holly Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Hollingshead", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Holly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Gary H Perdew", "Richard John Frisque", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "David John Vandenbergh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Chair", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PPAR", "colon cancer", "colon"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "USING &#948;2H AND &#948;18O TO DETERMINE THE FLOWPATHS AND TIMESCALES OF WATER AT THE SUSQUEHANNA SHALE HILLS CRITICAL ZONE OBSERVATORY\n", "id": "11904", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2049", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A stable isotope sampling network was implemented at the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory.  The objective was to determine the &#948;2H and &#948;18O signature in the catchment pools to determine the flowpaths and timescales of the hydrologic system.  The stable isotope network covers all phases of the hydrologic cycle, including precipitation sampled adaptively during precipitation events with an Eigenbrodt NSA-181/S wet-only collector (six-hour samples), soil water sampled weekly along four transects with 80 suction-cup lysimeters, groundwater sampled daily at two wells with ISCO automatic samplers and bi-weekly at 16 wells and stream water sampled daily with an ISCO automatic sampler.  The comprehensive sampling of the network was possible because of the DLT-100 liquid water stable isotope analyzer from Los Gatos Research, with a reproducibility of \u00b1 0.2%0 for &#948;18O, \u00b1 1.0%0 for &#948;D and the capability to run 30 samples per day.  The &#948;2H and &#948;18O data showed the dominance of cold season infiltration and recharge, with recharge specifically occurring over the period of late September \u2013 May.  The &#948;2H and &#948;18O record also showed that groundwater regularly flushed the deep soil water, and that groundwater is the major component of streamflow.  Preferential flowpaths in the soil during the cool or non-growing season was identified and is related to stream stormflow.  A piecewise constant model for flow, tracer concentration and age was based on the work of Duffy and Cusumano (1998) and Duffy (2010), and was unique in that it solved for transient flow.  The finding of the age model was that the mean age of the water in the catchment ranged between 4.5 \u2013 9 months.  The oldest ages occurred during the summer drought and the youngest ages occurred during times of maximum recharge over the winter.  This research was performed as part of the NSF-funded Critical Zone Observatory and the importance of this effort multi-investigator effort was essential to the success of this research.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2031], "author_name_tesi": "Holmes, George ", "last_name_ssi": "Holmes", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "George", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy", "Christopher J Duffy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy, Thesis Advisor", "Christopher J Duffy, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["flowpaths", "deuterium", "oxygen-18", "stable isotopes", "age"]}]
