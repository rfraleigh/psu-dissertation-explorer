This study supports these goals\nthrough analysis of moisture variability within the boundary layer, and examines the influence of horizontal convective rolls and mesoscale airmass boundaries on water vapor distribution as well as cloud development. This research verifies and\nextends the body of knowledge pertaining to water vapor variability near boundary layer structures using high-resolution multi-radar wind syntheses and Lagrangian objective analyses of thermodynamic variables.\nThe boundary layer on 15 June 2002 was measured during a time of rapid growth as evident in wind profiler and atmospheric sounding data. This growth is coincident with a relatively sudden development of clouds, suggesting that strong\nconvective mixing led to a rapid increase in boundary layer height as the inversion layer separating the mixed layer and the residual layer thinned, thereby allowing parcels ascending roll updrafts to reach saturation. Significant correlations between aircraft-measured vertical velocity and potential temperature are supportive\nof strong thermally induced mixing. A method for objectively analyzing the thermodynamic field through upstream/downstream advection of mobile\nmesonet, aircraft, and sounding data along radar-derived trajectories allows for three-dimensional study of moisture variability near horizontal convective rolls and a dryline. The analysis reveals a tendency for elongated bands of moist (dry) air to extend downwind of updraft (downdraft) cells. Furthermore, it is observed that intersections between the rolls and the dryline are areas of enhanced vertical motion,\nwhich thereby influence the finescale structure along the boundary. That is, the objectively analyzed moisture field reveals a steady eastward dryline propagation of ~2.5 m s-1, coincident with a broken, staircase-like pattern of reflectivity that appears to be dictated by roll intersections rather than by misocyclones, which\nhave been observed to create a similar pattern of vertical motion in other cases.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [774], "author_name_tesi": "Scarino, Benjamin Raymond", "last_name_ssi": "Scarino", "middle_name_ssi": "Raymond", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yvette Pamela Richardson", "Yvette Pamela Richardson", "Kenneth James Davis", "Paul Markowski", "Conrad Ziegler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yvette Pamela Richardson, Thesis Advisor", "Yvette Pamela Richardson, Thesis Advisor", "Kenneth James Davis, Thesis Advisor", "Paul Markowski, Thesis Advisor", "Conrad Ziegler, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["boundary layer", "dryline", "horizontal convective rolls", "numerical modeling", "parcel trajectories", "objective analysis", "Doppler-radar"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Phase Diagram of The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect", "id": "5965", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6450", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The composite fermion theory is used to explore \nthe phase diagram of the fractional \nquantum Hall effect.

Children ranged in age from 36 \u2013 77 months.  Children\u2019s phonological production ability in English and Spanish was assessed using the Bilingual Phonological Assessment (BiPA; Miccio & Hammer, 2006).  Responses were transcribed and analyzed to determine Percentage of Consonants Correct-Revised (PCC-R; Shriberg, Austin, Lewis, McSweeney, & Wilson, 1997), Phonological Mean Length of Utterance (PMLU; Ingram, 2002) and Percent of Whole Word Proximity (PWP; Ingram, 2002).  Language abilities were assessed using the Picture Vocabulary and Story Recall subtests of the Woodcock-Mun&#771;oz Language Survey-Revised (Woodcock, Mun&#771;oz-Sandoval, Ruef, & Alvaradeo, 2005). Information regarding the children\u2019s exposure to and use of English and Spanish was collected by means of a parent survey.  Hierarchical regression analyses were employed to determine the degree to which language abilities, exposure to and use of each language, and phonological production proficiency in the other language were able to predict children\u2019s phonological production proficiency in English and Spanish.  \nResults:  A large portion of the variance in phonological production proficiency scores in English (R2 = .62 -.69) was predicted by the language the mothers used when speaking to their children, children\u2019s English vocabulary scores, and children\u2019s phonological production proficiency in Spanish.  Similarly, a sizable portion of the variance in Spanish phonological accuracy (R2 = .47 -.57) was predicted by the language the children used when speaking to their mothers, vocabulary scores in Spanish, and phonological production proficiency in English.  Results were similar across the three outcome measures in each language. \nConclusion:  The results of this study indicate that language use, vocabulary, and phonological production accuracy in the other language are significant factors in predicting bilingual children\u2019s phonological production proficiency in English and Spanish. These results suggest that phonological production ability in one language is highly predictive of ability in the other language, at least when the two languages of the bilingual child share similar phones and phonotactic patterns, as do Spanish and English. Results also suggest that it is important to collect information about bilingual children\u2019s home language usage and to assess other oral language abilities, particularly vocabulary, when attempting to determine the presence of a phonological disorder in bilingual Spanish-English speaking children.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5577], "author_name_tesi": "Scarpino, Shelley E.", "last_name_ssi": "Scarpino", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Shelley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Sciences and Disorders", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carol Anne Miller", "Carol Anne Miller", "Gordon William Blood", "Maya Misra", "Henry J Gerfen", "Carol Scheffner Hammer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carol Anne Miller, Dissertation Advisor", "Carol Anne Miller, Committee Chair", "Gordon William Blood, Committee Member", "Maya Misra, Committee Member", "Henry J Gerfen, Committee Member", "Carol Scheffner Hammer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spanish-English", "bilingual", "phonological production", "PMLU", "PCC"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Being and Becoming an Activist: School Counselors who Answer the Call for Social Justice with Regard to LGBTQ++ Students", "id": "w08929935", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13096", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This is a study of the activist identity trajectories and the experiences of four school counselors notably engaged in activism for LGBTQ++ students.

Some questions collected demographic information from the participants.  The remaining questions required asked choral conductors to reveal their understanding of voice and choral pedagogies, their usage of voice and choral pedagogies in the choral rehearsal, and their assessment on how choral singing affects solo voice technique and health.\nFour research questions were posed:  What are choral directors\u2019 perceptions regarding aspects of voice and choral pedagogy that are supported by vocal and choral pedagogues?  To what degree do most choral directors use solo vocal training techniques in choral rehearsals?  To what degree do choral conductors perceive that choral singing alters the solo singer\u2019s vocal technique and/or affects the solo singer\u2019s vocal health?  Do perceptions among choral conductors differ by educational preparation of the choral director (conducting degree, music education-voice concentrate, music education-non voice concentrate, voice performance degree, voice pedagogy degree, other degree)?\nResults indicated that a majority of choral conductors agreed with most consensus statements of vocal pedagogues regarding voice and choral pedagogies.  The majority of choral directors used solo vocal training techniques most of the time in their rehearsals.  The majority of choral conductors believed choral singing had no negative effect on solo singing technique or vocal health, and finally, no statistically significant differences were found among the four groups of educational preparation on any of the 11 techniques used in rehearsals.  In conclusion, results from this study suggest that choral conductors and voice teachers, who share no statistical difference in training, essentially share the same perspectives on vocal and choral pedagogy and strive to maintain good vocal health and technique by teaching the same principles of proper vocal production in voice lessons and the choral rehearsal.

Roughly half of stroke survivors regain some functional independence, but 15% to 30% are permanently disabled (Asplund et al., 1998). Contralateral hemiparesis, or weakness opposite to the damaged hemisphere, is the primary source of functional limitation in stroke patients. However, motor deficits are also present in the arm on the same side of, or ipsilesional to, the damaged hemisphere, which previously had been thought to be \u201cunaffected.\u201d Such deficits suggest that both contra- and ipsilateral hemispheres are involved in the control of unilateral movement, and our work in healthy subjects supports that the hemispheres may be specialized for controlling specific yet separate features of movement. In a series of three experiments, we tested whether ipsilesional motor deficits following stroke would be 1) different in patients with left and right hemisphere damage and 2) predictable based on our model of motor lateralization, which describes a left hemisphere specialization for coordination of limb and task dynamics, and a right hemisphere specialization for achieving steady-state positions through limb impedance. Specifically, we predicted that left but not right stroke patients would demonstrate impairment in mechanisms underlying the control of limb coordination, and that right but not left stroke patients would demonstrate impairment in impedance or position-based control mechanisms. We believe that this work is important not only for understanding the role of ipsilateral hemisphere in control of movement, but also for providing insight into why ipsilesional motor deficits can substantially impact functional performance of activities of daily living. The impact of such deficits is of particular concern for those stroke survivors who must use the ipsilesional arm as their primary controller due to severe contralesional hemiparesis.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6040], "author_name_tesi": "Schaefer, Sydney Yoshie", "last_name_ssi": "Schaefer", "middle_name_ssi": "Yoshie", "first_name_ssi": "Sydney", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert L Sainburg", "Mark Latash", "Jonathan T Mordkoff, Ph D", "Karl Maxim Newell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert L Sainburg, Committee Chair", "Mark Latash, Committee Member", "Jonathan T Mordkoff, Ph D, Committee Member", "Karl Maxim Newell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hemispheric specialization", "motor control"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Low-Temperature Chemical Synthesis of Intermetallic, Carbide, Borocarbide, and Carbonaceous Nanoparticles\n", "id": "12102", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6957", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nanoparticles can possess a wide variety of properties that make them capable of being utilized for advanced technological purposes.  In many instances, the reliable synthesis of nanoparticles with uniform size, shape, and composition is required to achieve their desired function.  Among the methods to produce nanoparticles, low-temperature solution based reactions have emerged as a reliable platform for the synthesis of nanoparticles with tailored size, shape, and composition.  In this dissertation, I describe my recent contributions to expanding the diversity of systems and nanostructures capable of being accessed using solution chemical methods.  \n\tTo start off, a conversion chemistry route to make M-Zn intermetallic nanocrystals is described.  The generality of this approach is shown by the ability to access PtZn, Ni-Zn, and five distinct Au-Zn intermetallic phases as nanocrystalline materials.  The Au-Zn materials represent the most intermetallic phases accessed within a single binary intermetallic system using solution methods to date.  Taking the Au-Zn method as a prototype, the possibility for shape preservation of the Au nanoparticle template during the conversion chemistry reaction is demonstrated.\n\tFollowing this, routes to the synthesis of nickel borocarbide and carbide are described.  The borocarbide is made using a nano-composite strategy, which utilizes borohydride anion (BH4-) for both reduction of the nickel precursor and as a source for boron.  The nickel carbide system is explored in detail and shown to form through a conversion chemistry route, and be capable of having a variety of carbon compositions that can be tuned through carefully modulated isothermal heating.  This evidence, along with logical reasoning, is used to help unify existing literature that has claimed separate phases (hcp-Ni and Ni3C) for materials that are likely members of solid solutions of carbon in nickel. \n\tFinally, we show how the metastability of carbon in nickel can be used to form high surface area hollow carbon shells at low-temperatures.  The C-shells are graphitic in nature, and show enhanced current generation, compared to controls, when used as catalyst supports for Pt during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).  Evidence is also presented for the unusually low-temperature production of boron-doped hollow carbon shells when using nickel borocarbide as a precursor material.  As a result of the electronic modification from the heteroatom doping, these shells could possess a variety of superior properties compared to pure carbon shells.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6954], "author_name_tesi": "Schaefer, Zachary Louis", "last_name_ssi": "Schaefer", "middle_name_ssi": "Louis", "first_name_ssi": "Zachary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "Harry R Allcock", "Benjamin James Lear", "Sridhar Komarneni"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Chair", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Boron-doped Carbons", "Carbides", "Carbonaceous Materials", "Oxygen Reduction Reaction", "Nanoparticle Synthesis", "High Surface Area Materials"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Tonal Ambiguity and Set Relationships in Liszt's Death Pieces\n", "id": "9731", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2891", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nThe late music of Franz Liszt is problematic for analysts.  One source of difficulty is Liszt\u2019s use of dissonance, which is often prolonged for long periods of time.  For example, the famous opening of Liszt\u2019s Faust Symphony (1857) enunciates the augmented triad for the entirety of the 22-measure introduction.  At a deeper level, the same augmented triad forms the key structure (Ab, C, E) of the first movement.   In La Lugubre Gondola I and II (henceforth LG1 and LG2), the augmented triad and the fully-diminished seventh chord are used as associative sonorities.    These two chords are especially enigmatic as they can each potentially have multiple roots due to their symmetrical properties.  Any of the pitches of the Ab-C-E chord, for example, can serve as its root, and, when used as the root of a dominant chord, can lead to three separate tonics (Db, F, and A).  The same applies to the fully-diminished seventh chord. In previous repertoires the fully-diminished seventh chord and the augmented triad function as unstable sonorities in need of resolution.   One of Liszt\u2019s signal achievements is that he treats these sonorities as contextually stable. \nIndeed, acoustically dissonant sonorities in Liszt\u2019s late music are often left unresolved, sometimes never achieving a tonic resolution throughout the entire work (which, I feel, heightens its association with death).  This is especially puzzling because Liszt\u2019s music often alludes to keys without, what David Carson Berry calls, \u201ckey confirmations.\u201d   These confirmations are further problematised when one considers Zdenek Skoumal\u2019s idea of \u201candrogynous harmony,\u201d whereby the augmented chord can potentially function as a tonic substitute or as a dominant chord, depending on the context.  \nNot only is Liszt\u2019s late music problematic for musicians today, but it was also nearly incomprehensible for his late 19th-century audience. A newspaper article published in 1860 with the signature of Brahms went so far as to protest Liszt\u2019s new music.   During the last two decades of his life, his lifelong friendship with Wagner became strained, and he experienced the death of many friends and family members, causing his music to become dark and morose; his depression is certainly audible.  In a letter to Princess Carolyne, Liszt discusses LG1: \u201cI doubt that it will obtain any success at concerts \u2013 in view of its sad, somber character, scarcely mitigated by a few dreaming shadows.  The public demands other things.\u201d  Despite these reactions, Liszt would continue to compose experimental music.    \nCurrent research has shed some light onto these analytical issues, but there is still much work that needs to be done.  One important tool in analyzing music, post-tonal or tonal, is the idea of prolongation.  In his seminal 1987 study, Joseph N. Straus lays out four conditions for prolongation.  He applies them to post-tonal music in order to demonstrate that prolongation cannot exist in this style; it can only occur, he argues, in tonal music.  The conditions are as follows:\n\n\n1)\tA consistent, pitch-defined basis for determining relative structural weight.\n2)\tA consistent hierarchy of consonant sonorities.\n3)\tA consistent set of relationships between tones of lesser and greater \tstructural weight.\n4)\tA clear distinction between the vertical and horizontal dimensions. \nGiven these conditions, one may wonder if any dissonance can be prolonged.  Indeed, Straus\u2019 conditions are consistent with the principles of Schenkerian theory where dissonance is always in the service of prolonging a conceptually prior consonance.  But many theorists disagree.  Robert Morgan, Fred Lerdahl, and Steve Larson have written important articles using concepts such as network models, chord distance algorithms, attraction algorithms, and other mathematical applications to demonstrate the possibilities of dissonant prolongation.  Howard Cinnamon, on the other hand, uses an approach based on voice leading. He postulates that LGI can be viewed as an example of dissonant prolongation through equal subdivision of the octave, in which a linear descent in the bass, composes out the augmented triad.   While all sides of the argument are well thought out and interesting, I agree more with Morgan and Cinnamon in that dissonance, in fact, can be prolonged, and I will use my voice-leading graphs to support my conclusion.\nThis leads back to the question of Schenkerian analysis.  Given that the late music of Franz Liszt is at the borderlands between tonality and atonality (according to James Baker, Liszt achieves atonality in the work Richard Wagner \u2013 Venezia, henceforth RW-Venezia), can one analyze Liszt\u2019s music using principles of Schenkerian theory?     Among other things, Schenkerian analysis requires structural dominants and tonics to support stepwise melodic descents through either a third, fifth, or octave span. How can such linear descents be supported in works like LGI, where structural dominants and/or tonics are often absent and the melodic descents are not always clear?  While it may seem contradictory to use Schenkerian analysis (which assumes functional tonality and a consonant outer-voice framework) to analyze works that are extremely dissonant and tonally ambiguous, I have found that by adapting Schenkerian principles to these works, I am able to uncover underlying voice-leading structures that, I believe, display convincing interpretations regarding their respective tonalities.           \nUpon analyzing LG1, LG2, RW-Venezia, and Am Grabe Richard Wagners (henceforth AGRW), it is apparent that many similar musical characteristics link the works together.  Besides the topic of death and dates of completion, the pieces are linked melodically, harmonically, programmatically, and symbolically through the use of specific keys.  The ordered sets that are formed are LG1/LG2 and RW-Venezia/AGRW.  I will also compare the first and last pieces of each set for similar characteristics.\nTo tackle these analytical interests, I propose to study four late piano pieces by Liszt, all dealing with the topic of Wagner\u2019s death.  Chapter 1 is an introduction to the terminology used throughout this thesis.  Chapter 2 individually studies the tonality and form of each of the four death pieces: LG1, LG2, RW-Venezia and AGRW.  Chapter 3 examines set relations among the four pieces.  The overall goal of this thesis is to provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the four death pieces and explain how they are musically and extra musically related to one another.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2885], "author_name_tesi": "Schaeffer, Jeffrey ", "last_name_ssi": "Schaeffer", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Music Theory and History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Eric Mc Kee", "Maureen Ann Carr", "Taylor Aitken Greer", "Eric John Mckee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Eric Mc Kee, Thesis Advisor", "Maureen Ann Carr, Thesis Advisor", "Taylor Aitken Greer, Thesis Advisor", "Eric John Mckee, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["am grabe richard wagners", "la lugubre gondola", "death", "tonal ambiguity", "Liszt", "wagner", "richard wagner-venezia"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SELF-EMPLOYMENT INCOME AND U.S. MIGRATION NETWORKS: IS THERE A RELATIONSHIP?\n", "id": "11832", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3762", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Self-employment has been an important driver of economic growth throughout the United States in preceding decades.  Even though there are a greater number of self-employed within the economy, it has become relatively less profitable to own a business when compared to paid employment.  Domestic migration, or the movement of population from one county to another within the United States, is another strong force that is shaping population change and regional economic development.  Researchers have examined how domestic migration influences economic growth; however, no one has examined how it may relate to self-employment income success within the U.S.  I draw upon inferences from migration, entrepreneurship, and social network theories to develop a model to test the relationship between domestic migration and self-employment income growth.  Using migration flow data from 3,047 U.S. counties for the years 1995-2000, I find that high volumes of migration per capita from a county are not related to self-employment income growth from 2000 to 2007, although there is an inverse relationship between large inflows and growth.  When including a variable that measures the diversity of a county\u2019s migration network (entropy), I find that the expansiveness of a network is positively associated with self-employment returns, especially within the most rural of counties.  The diversity of migration networks is a more important determinant of entrepreneurs\u2019 success throughout the U.S. when compared strictly to the volume of migration flows.  These findings have important implications for regional economic development, especially for rural areas that are experiencing large outmigration flows.  If the migration network flowing out of or into rural areas is diverse, the self-employed are more likely to ear n more than if the migration network is more homogeneous.

PAL activity has been linked to increases in phenolics, but the role of DS has been neglected.  In the context of induced phenolics, few studies have examined DS or its coordinate regulation with PAL.  We hypothesized that the regulation of this \u201ccore\u201d pathway, from DS to PAL, is conserved across species and that regulation of DS has a direct effect on phenolic production.  We also proposed that alternative substrate pools (such as quinic acid) could uncouple the regulation of DS activity and phenolic production. Two phylogenetically divergent species were chosen for study: tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and hybrid poplar (Populus nigra X P. deltoides). We examined their patterns of DS and PAL activity and phenolic production when challenged with insect and simulated herbivory (jasmonic acid, a wound signal; JA) under different light environments.  We found that DS and PAL were not coordinately regulated in either tobacco or poplar.  Regardless of light level, induction of DS was the rate-determining component in JA increased phenolic production in tobacco.  PAL activity and photosynthesis were also related to phenolic production in low light in tobacco, but DS was still the rate-determining component.  However, PAL activity was the rate-determining component in JA increased phenolic production for hybrid poplar, regardless of light level, and DS activity was not related to increases in phenolic production.  We also found that translocated sucrose, shikimic acid, and quinic acid from source locations were all able to supply JA-increased phenolic production in hybrid poplar sink tissues, but this ability was constrained by light level.  Our results help clarify the regulation of plant investment in phenolics by providing a mechanistic explanation for carbon allocation patterns.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6344], "author_name_tesi": "Schaeffer, Toni Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Schaeffer", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Toni", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Charles Schultz", "Gary Felton", "John Edward Carlson", "Surinder Chopra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Charles Schultz, Committee Chair", "Gary Felton, Committee Member", "John Edward Carlson, Committee Member", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PAL", "DAHP synthase", "quinic acid", "shikimate pathway", "condensed tannins", "phenolic glycosides", "chlorogenic acid", "phenolics", "tobacco", "Nicotiana", "poplar", "Populus"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Neuroscience-inspired computational systems for speech recognition under noisy conditions", "id": "25082", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11121", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Humans routinely recognize speech in challenging acoustic environments with background music, engine sounds, competing talkers, and other acoustic noise.  However, today's automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems perform poorly in such  environments.  In this dissertation, I present novel methods for ASR designed to approach human-level performance by emulating the brain's processing of sounds.  I exploit recent advances in auditory neuroscience to compute neuron-based representations of speech, and design novel methods for decoding these representations to produce word transcriptions.  \n\nI begin by considering speech representations modeled on the spectrotemporal receptive fields of auditory neurons.  These representations can be tuned to optimize a variety of objective functions, which characterize the response properties of a neural population.  I propose an objective function that explicitly optimizes the noise invariance of the neural responses, and find that it gives improved performance on an ASR task in noise compared to other objectives.  The method as a whole, however, fails to significantly close the performance gap with humans.  \n\nI next consider speech representations that make use of spiking model neurons.  The neurons in this method are feature detectors that selectively respond to spectrotemporal patterns within short time windows in speech.  I consider a number of methods for training the response properties of the neurons.  In particular, I present a method using linear support vector machines (SVMs) and show that this method produces spikes that are robust to additive noise.  I compute the spectrotemporal receptive fields of the neurons for comparison with previous physiological results.  \n\nTo decode the spike-based speech representations, I propose two methods designed to work on isolated word recordings.  The first method uses a classical ASR technique based on the hidden Markov model.  The second method is a novel template-based recognition scheme that takes advantage of the neural representation's invariance in noise.  The scheme centers on a speech similarity measure based on the longest common subsequence between spike sequences.  The combined encoding and decoding scheme outperforms a benchmark system in extremely noisy acoustic conditions.  \n\nFinally, I consider methods for decoding spike representations of continuous speech.  To help guide the alignment of templates to words, I design a syllable detection scheme that robustly marks the locations of syllabic nuclei.  The scheme combines SVM-based training with a peak selection algorithm designed to improve noise tolerance.  By incorporating syllable information into the ASR system, I obtain strong recognition results in noisy conditions, although the performance in noiseless conditions is below the state of the art.  \n\nThe work presented here constitutes a novel approach to the problem of ASR that can be applied in the many challenging acoustic environments in which we use computer technologies today.  The proposed spike-based processing methods can potentially be exploited in efficient hardware implementations and could significantly reduce the computational costs of ASR.  The work also provides a framework for understanding the advantages of spike-based acoustic coding in the human brain.

Since Ailanthus was introduced into North America in 1784, the proliferation of this botanical pest has continued unchecked and Ailanthus is now found in nearly all 50 states of the USA. The need for a natural control of tree-of-heaven is of utmost importance, but the tree has few pests. However we recently observed several stands of Ailanthus that were wilting and declining in south-central Pennsylvania. Isolations revealed that two species of Verticillium, V. albo-atrum and V. dahliae, were associated with the disease. Inoculations of Ailanthus potted seedlings in the greenhouse, and canopy trees in the field, showed that both species were pathogenic on Ailanthus, but that V. albo-atrum was much more virulent and aggressive. It is now known that Verticillium albo-atrum is the primary pathogen causing extensive wilt of the invasive tree species Ailanthus in south-central Pennsylvania. The potential for using V. albo-atrum as a biocontrol agent is discussed. \n     Inoculation studies in both the greenhouse and field showed that Ailanthus was extremely susceptible, but that the host range did not extend to northern red oak, chestnut oak, red maple, sugar maple, yellow-poplar, and white ash were not susceptible hosts. However, striped maple exhibited wilt symptoms following inoculation, and V. albo-atrum was isolated from one wilted striped maple in the field. Ailanthus trees inoculated with V. albo-atrum died within the same growing season. In contrast, some Ailanthus trees inoculated with V. dahliae survived fro 2 or more seasons. Soil persistence as melanized hyphal resting structures may not play a significant role in the survival of the pathogen in south-central Pennsylvania, due to the highly acidic forest soils, which are unfavorable for persistence of V. albo-atrum in the soil. The pathogen likely survives within infected leaves on the forest floor, or possibly symptomless carriers.\n     Survival can occur within overwintering infected Ailanthus trees, on fallen Ailanthus leaves, or in soil, and possibly in symptomless hosts. Primary inoculum, in the form of germinating resting structures or conidia, is formed in spring, and inoculation takes place at time of leaf emergence. Dissemination may involve wind disseminated leaflets, seed transmission, and/or ambrosial beetle transmission. Dissemination by root grafts needs to be studied. Ailanthus altissima roots are predisposed to V. albo-atrum by wounding. During colonization, phenols are deposited in outer xylem parenchyma within one week of inoculation indicating that initial fungus colonization is circumferential.  Colonization then proceeds both upward (rapidly) and downward (slowly) until host mortality occurs. In the field, rate of spread from tree to tree is rapid. Since 2000, approximately 10,000 Ailanthus trees have died in southern Pennsylvania from Verticillium wilt, likely mainly due to V. albo-atrum. \n     During the early 1980s, Ailanthus invaded an oak-dominated forest that had been logged and subsequently dominated stand openings, encompassing nearly 40% of stand basal area. In 2000 the stand was attacked by V. albo-atrum from an unknown source. By summer 2007, the pathogen had killed more than 7000 canopy Ailanthus trees in that stand. In severely affected parts of the stand, the entire overstory component of Ailanthus was removed and approximately half of the understory Ailanthus seedlings or sprouts were killed. Following decline of Ailanthus, the canopy composition is beginning to revert to a native state, as residual trees left from the salvage harvest expanded their crowns and young red maple and black birch trees are recruited into the overstory. The large openings caused by dying Ailanthus were filled by seedlings of red maple, sweet birch, and striped maple.\n      In conclusion, we determined the causal agents of Verticillium wilt of the invasive Ailanthus tree in southern Pennsylvania to be caused by V. albo-atrum and V. dahliae. Of these, V. albo-atrum is far more virulent and aggressive on both seedlings and canopy trees of Ailanthus. Within the forest, dissemination of Verticillium likely involves windblown leaves, seeds, and ambrosial beetles. Host range is very limited. Verticillium albo-atrum did not require wounded roots to incite disease on Ailanthus seedlings, though root wounding did accelerate symptom development. In naturally infected dense stands of Ailanthus, V. albo-atrum is moving rapidly, and is drastically altering forest composition, indicating a high potential for use in biocontrol applications.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4173], "author_name_tesi": "Schall, Mark  Jacob", "last_name_ssi": "Schall", "middle_name_ssi": "Jacob", "first_name_ssi": "Mark ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Durwood Davis", "Donald Durwood Davis", "Gary William Moorman", "David Michael Geiser", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco", "Dennis R Decoteau", "James C Sellmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Durwood Davis, Dissertation Advisor", "Donald Durwood Davis, Committee Chair", "Gary William Moorman, Committee Member", "David Michael Geiser, Committee Member", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco, Committee Member", "Dennis R Decoteau, Committee Member", "James C Sellmer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ailanthus altissima", "Verticillium wilt", "Verticillium albo-atrum", "Verticillium albo-atrum", "tree-of-heaven", "invasive plant disease"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Comparative Bioenergetics of Two Lake Trout Morphotypes", "id": "18506", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8768", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) are deep water apex predators native to North America that inhabit glacially formed lakes, including the Laurentian Great Lakes.  Lake trout populations in the Great Lakes are recovering from overfishing, sea lamprey parasitism, and poor water quality conditions that occurred during the 19th and 20th centuries, in addition to present day stressors (e.g., invasive species, climate change, etc.).  Current stocking and management strategies aim to produce self-sustaining and viable populations.  Management is complicated, however, by the presence of multiple body forms (i.e., morphotypes) of lake trout which differ in habitat utilization, prey consumption, lipid storage, and spawning preferences.  Bioenergetics models are useful management tools that relate fish physiology to habitat usage (e.g., prey consumed or growth predictions at a given temperature).  However, there is currently only a single bioenergetics model developed for one lake trout morphotype (lean), and this model failed to incorporate temperatures outside lake trout\u2019s preferred range.  To investigate potential morphotype differences and develop bioenergetics models with broader temperature applications, I completed consumption and respiration experiments on two actively stocked lake trout morphotypes, lean and humper, across a wide range of temperatures (4-22\u00b0C) and size classes (5-100g).  Bayesian estimation was used during model development to propagate uncertainty through to final growth predictions.  Morphotype differences were minimal, but when present, were temperature and weight dependent.  Basal respiration did not differ among the morphotypes at any temperature or size class tested.  Growth and consumption differences were subtle and not consistent across size ranges tested.  Management scenarios investigated (e.g., predicted growth at an average temperature of 11.7\u00b0C and 14.4\u00b0C over a 30 day period) demonstrated no differences in growth between the two morphotypes utilizing temperatures presently found in the Great Lakes.  Yet, management decisions should not be based on energetics alone as other factors including available habitat, prey resources, and competition should also be considered.  Managers should consider the characteristics of both the population structure and habitat conditions when developing recommendations for management of lake trout morphotypes.

These stressors can have effects at multiple levels of biological organization, from cellular to ecosystem-level impacts. Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) are an important socioeconomic and ecological species of conservation interest throughout the United States including in the Susquehanna River Basin, Pennsylvania. Within the past 10-15 years, there have been concerns about the overall health of smallmouth bass in the Susquehanna River Basin, which has manifested itself in declines in the abundance of adult fish, mortality events of young fish, evidence of endocrine disruption, and clinical signs of disease. Potential contributing factors include bacterial and viral pathogens, parasites, degraded water quality conditions, and contaminants. \nElucidating which potential contributing factors are important is complicated by the fact that the Susquehanna River Basin is comprised of river-tributary networks that vary in habitat type, habitat quality, and therefore the potential for exposure to different stressors. In riverine systems, there is a large amount of variability in how much a smallmouth bass might move over its lifespan, with some evidence for long range movements. Therefore, understanding the movement ecology and gene flow of smallmouth bass will directly help efforts to identify and understand ecological drivers of smallmouth bass populations, and is necessary to help inform management decisions (e.g., fishing regulations), the design of ecological field studies, and conservation of management units. In addition, despite the fact that declines in smallmouth bass catch rates have been noted, trends in relative abundance have not been quantified or put within a regional context to see if observed patterns in the Susquehanna River differ from other large river systems in the mid-Atlantic region that also support smallmouth bass fisheries. I evaluated population trends, individual fish movement, and population genetic structure of smallmouth bass in Chapters 1-3. Chapter 4 looks specifically at a potential stressor of smallmouth bass by focusing on the disease dynamics of a myxozoan parasite infecting juvenile smallmouth bass. This parasite has been found across the Susquehanna River Basin, but how its prevalence varies across the landscape and is influenced by anthropogenic land use practices is not understood.\nIn Chapter 1 of my dissertation, I evaluated trends in adult smallmouth bass catch per effort data (CPE) from the Susquehanna River Basin and compared trends to out of basin sites both within and outside the state of Pennsylvania. Dynamic linear models, as opposed to traditional linear models, permitted investigation of short term non-monotonic changes in fish CPE, which is important in order to detect short-term perturbations and nonlinear responses of populations to stressors. When compared with other rivers, the Susquehanna River Basin had the largest magnitude and probability of decline in smallmouth bass CPE. The declines began in the late 1990s prior to the first documentation of disease, but the general patterns of decline and trend towards recovery at the end of the study was not consistent across the Susquehanna River Basin. This chapter provided a foundational level of understanding on smallmouth bass CPE temporal dynamics in the study system over important time periods relevant to ongoing disease and mortality events. \nChapters 2 and 3 examine population genetics and spatial movement ecology of adult smallmouth bass in the system. Both chapters were largely motivated by observations of adult smallmouth bass using both river and tributary habitats across the Susquehanna River Basin. This led to questions regarding whether fish utilizing tributaries and rivers were separate ecological and genetic groups. In Chapter 2, population genetics structure of smallmouth bass was evaluated across 24 sites (both river and tributary sites) in the Susquehanna River Basin and compared to one out of basin site. Using twelve polymorphic microsatellite loci, limited genetic differentiation (overall mean pairwise FST  = 0.012) and lack of population structure (k  = 3 admixed population clusters) was found across the Susquehanna River Basin. Chapter 2 provided important information for the future conservation of smallmouth bass including the fact that there was little genetic support for the use of separate management units within this system. \nChapter 2 quantified gene flow across a large spatial extent; however, there was still uncertainty about finer-scale seasonal movement dynamics of smallmouth bass. Understanding how individual smallmouth bass were using rivers and tributaries could help inform the mechanisms contributing to genetic similarity across the basin. Knowledge of the movement of smallmouth bass in the system could also be important for understanding the range of stressors fish could be exposed to, especially if river and tributary habitats are both utilized. To evaluate the spatial movement ecology of smallmouth bass in the Susquehanna River Basin, I completed a radio-telemetry study in connected river-tributary habitat in the Susquehanna River Basin. I evaluated movement dynamics and river-tributary usage as well as investigated environmental drivers (i.e., temperature and flow) of fish movement. In general, fish movement was variable with some fish moving large distances (n = 76 fish, average = 27.2 \u00b1 25.9 km, range = 0.2 to 118 km). Movement between rivers and tributaries was common. Using a generalized additive mixed model, I found varied seasonal effects of temperature and flow on fish movement. These findings indicate the importance for maintaining fish movement corridors for smallmouth bass, including connectivity between river and tributaries. Additionally, long distance movement supports the possibility for gene flow and lack of genetic differentiation demonstrated in Chapter 2.\nChapter 4 focuses on the prevalence of a myxozoan parasite infecting juvenile smallmouth bass. This research investigated temporal and spatial factors, including land use, that were hypothesized to influence parasite prevalence. For this chapter, I used a hierarchical logistic regression model to evaluate spatial and temporal variability in myxozoan parasite prevalence across four years and at 31 sites. There was little temporal variability in myxozoan prevalence (posterior mean annual prevalence ranged from 0.42-0.55); however, prevalence varied substantially among sites (posterior mean site-level prevalence ranged from 0.08-0.82). Myxozoan prevalence had a negative relationship with urban land use and a positive relationship with agricultural land use. The effects of both urban and agricultural land use were stronger at the local scale when compared to the accumulated catchment scale. The relationship between prevalence and land use indicates that land use practices could be mediating parasite-host relationship, including invertebrate host density and parasite abundance, and contributing to infection rates in smallmouth bass. This chapter provided insight into land use relationships that may be important for myxozoan parasites in the Susquehanna River Basin.\nMy dissertation research crosses multiple sub-disciplines of ecology to provide valuable information that can be used to help understand smallmouth bass ecology, health, and can inform management of this important fishery. For example, fishing regulations, which extend a half mile into tributaries in sections of the Susquehanna River Basin, may need to consider larger distances of protection into tributaries given smallmouth bass movement in the system. Additionally, smallmouth bass movement across a large area could indicate exposure to stressors across a larger gradient. Land use impacts may differ at local and watershed scales as demonstrated for the myxozoan parasite investigated. Thus, in the context of fish health, future research efforts should integrate finer-scale information with large-scale habitat conditions and processes and consider the potential for cross-scale interactions. \n\tIn a larger context, it is important to consider why we as humans care about smallmouth bass health. The fish health issues observed in the Susquehanna River is more than a smallmouth bass problem. Smallmouth bass may be more sensitive to specific stressors than other organisms, but there could also be larger human health and ecosystem implications. The Susquehanna River provides drinking water to millions of inhabitants located along the river and also major cities outside of the basin. The Susquehanna River Basin is also part of the larger Chesapeake Bay Watershed and provides around half of the freshwater to the bay. The Susquehanna River also provides an important role in ecosystem functioning and a source for recreating across the region. Recent impairment of portions of the river for coliform bacteria and fish consumption advisories by Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection have led to concerns not only for the health of smallmouth bass, but also for the overall impact the health of the river could have on humans. Understanding smallmouth bass ecology, an important indicator of ecosystem health, could provide a better understanding of the health of the river and therefore the health of the many people and economies that depend on this valuable resource.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16240], "author_name_tesi": "Schall, Megan Victoria", "last_name_ssi": "Schall", "middle_name_ssi": "Victoria", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tyler Wagner", "Tyler Wagner", "Vicki S.

When Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3), members of a family of intracellular effector proteins, are phosphorylated, they bind to Smad4 and that protein complex enters the nucleus where they induce the expression of a number of proteins (procollagen and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) being examples). Gap junctional intercellular communications (GJIC) between fibroblasts requires the coupling of hemichannel structures, the connexon, which is made up of six connexin 43 (Cx43) proteins located on the surface of adjacent cells.  The transport of Cx43 from its site of synthesis to the plasma membrane can involve direct attachment to cytoskeleton microtubules.  The Cx43-microtubule binding site is shared with Smad2/3.  The attachment of Cx43 to microtubules releases Smad2/3 into the cytosol compartment, where it can participate in Smad signaling pathway.  However, if Smad2/3 are retained on microtubules, the Smad signaling pathway is disrupted preventing their dissociation into the cytosol pool making them unavailable for phosphorylation, binding to Smad4 and entering the nucleus, interfering with TGF\u00e21 promotion of procollagen and TIMP-1 synthesis.  The tubulin binding motif (TBM), located within C-terminus of Cx43, is the specific tubulin binding sequence for Cx43 to microtubules.  The binding of TBM peptide to microtubules obstructs the binding of Cx43 and the release of Smad2/3 into the cytosol compartment of the fibroblast. The inclusion of TBM peptide with cultured human dermal fibroblasts showed a change in the localization of Smad2/3 from the cytosol and nuclear compartments to the insoluble microsomal compartment, where microtubules accumulate. The competitive binding of TBM peptide to microtubules reduced the synthesis of procollagen and TIMP-1.  In addition, there was a reduction in GJIC between fibroblasts treated with TMB peptide compared to saline treated control cells.  The failure to bind Cx43 and the release of Smad2/3 from microtubules both inhibited the synthesis of proteins involved in fibrosis and GJIC.  The binding of Cx43 to microtubules and the release of Smad2/3 demonstrated a relationship between GJIC and Smad signaling pathway.  The possibility exists that controlling GJIC by limiting Cx43 accumulation at the plasma membrane may be a novel approach for the control of fibrosis.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [983], "author_name_tesi": "Schank, Christopher Harry", "last_name_ssi": "Schank", "middle_name_ssi": "Harry", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin", "H Paul Ehrlich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor", "H Paul Ehrlich, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Smad", "connexin 43", "type III collagen", "TIMP-1"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Analysis of Biomimetic Block Copolymer Membranes Used for Protein Incorporation", "id": "14465abs254", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14465", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Integral membrane proteins carry out a vast range of transport, catalytic, signaling, and other functions with high reactivity and specificity.  These proteins and synthetic mimics thereof are now widely studied for applications relevant to chemical engineers, such as membrane separations, catalysis, and sensors.  These proteins\u2019 structural stability depends on a network of hydrogen bonds maintained in the amphiphilic environment provided by the cell membrane but disrupted in solution.  Thus, to apply these proteins in medicine and industry, we must design and optimize biomimetic membranes \u2013 self assembled amphiphilic structures that serve as matrices to mimic the cell membrane and stabilize integral membrane proteins.  Amphiphilic block copolymers recapitulate the self-assembled microstructures formed by lipids and surfactants used to stabilize membrane proteins, but have greater mechanical and chemical stability than these small amphiphiles.  Further, membrane properties relevant to protein incorporation, such as thickness and hydrophobicity, can be adjusted by changing the degree of polymerization and monomer identities, making block copolymers an excellent material for biomimetic membrane design.\n\tThe goal of my dissertation research was to better understand biomimetic membranes\u2019 structure, synthesis, and interactions with proteins.  The introduction provides a brief overview of biomimetic membranes, including the block copolymer membrane properties, membrane synthesis, and the interactions between the protein and matrix that can be tailored to optimize protein incorporation and stability.  The first chapter describes time-resolved small-angle neutron scattering experiments used to examine the mechanism of membrane self-assembly via detergent dialysis.  We show that mixed detergent/polymer micelle fragmentation and fusion control the rate of polymer exchange, and thus the formation of mixed polymer/protein/detergent aggregates that form membranes as detergent is removed.  In the second chapter, we use molecular dynamics simulations to examine the nanoscale structure of biomimetic membranes formed from poly(1,2-butadiene)-poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(ethyl ethylene)-poly(ethylene oxide).  These simulations allow us to examine membrane thickness and hydration, two properties relevant to protein incorporation.  The third chapter examines whether we could synthesize biomimetic membranes from mass-produced Pluronic block copolymers.  We show that a mixture of two such polymers, L121 and F127, can assemble into porous vesicles, so that they can be used for separations and as catalytic microreactors.  The fourth chapter examines interactions that lead to bacterial membrane fusion by the cationic antimicrobial peptide from Moringa oleifera.  This work provides a control for future work to examine the interactions between biomimetic membranes and incorporated proteins using coarse-grained molecular dynamics.  Finally, the appendices provide supporting information for each chapter, as well as a report on the design requirements for high-pressure reverse osmosis, a potential application for biomimetic membranes. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15807], "author_name_tesi": "Schantz, Allen Benjamin", "last_name_ssi": "Schantz", "middle_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "first_name_ssi": "Allen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Manish Kumar", "Manish Kumar", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Scott Thomas Milner", "Robert John Hickey III"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Manish Kumar, Dissertation Advisor", "Manish Kumar, Committee Chair", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Scott Thomas Milner, Committee Member", "Robert John Hickey III, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biomimetic membranes", "membrane proteins", "molecular dynamics", "neutron scattering", "reverse osmosis", "detergent dialysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Ethnography of Adolescent Literacy: Sociocultural Understandings of Literacies, Places, Materials, and Social Relationships", "id": "17481", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8474", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Literacy, an ideologically rooted social practice, has been researched as reading and writing word-based language; however, literacy and literacies continue to be highly contested.

Therefore, researchers have begun to study the role of household time allocations on diet quality.

In this study, the key step of the cycle, H2 gas evolution via oxidation of CuCl(s) dissolved in high concentrated HCl(aq), was experimentally investigated.  The research covered in this study was carried out in three phases. In the first phase, the electrolysis parameters and system performance were studied by linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at ambient temperature. A thermodynamic model previously developed for speciation of the CuCl\u2013CuCl2\u2013HCl aqueous solutions was used to speculate on the effects of reagent concentration, flow rate, and temperature on electrolysis kinetics. The main conclusions from this phase were a close correspondence of the hydrogen production rate to Faraday\u2019s law of electrolysis indicated, a current efficiency of about 0.98, while the voltage efficiency was estimated at 0.80 at 0.5 V and 0.1 A\u2022cm-2. A current density of 0.08 A\u2022cm-2 was observed at 0.7 V, using 0.26 mol CuCl(s) in 3 mol\u2022L-1 HCl at a flow rate of approximately 30 mL\u2022min-1 for both solutions. In the second phase, the electrolyzer was upgraded to address the inefficiencies and limitations identified in the previous system setup. After a control test, the electrolyzer was ran using a new type of double layer Nafion 117 membrane to test MEA durability. The enhanced MEA durability allowed the system to operate at 80 \u00baC for an extended period of time with continuous anolyte cycling and regeneration. The system was observed over a period of 100 hours to test the effects of long term operation on the electrolyzer. Linear polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to monitor the electrolyzer performance over time and hydrogen production was monitored to evaluate the current efficiency. A current density of 0.16 A\u2022cm-2 was observed at 0.7 V, using 2 mol CuCl(s) in 7 mol\u2022L-1 HCl(aq) at a flow rate of approximately 59 mL\u2022min-1 for both solutions.

This occurs when STEM personnel and non-STEM personnel have difficulty expressing their ideas efficiently.  The most frequent example of this is the expressing of a new technology or idea as a monetary value. This research focuses on bridging that gap by developing an economic model that adapts to different processes and compares technology by assessing the value each technology adds to the process. This is achieved by an economic value study for the major equipment of a process carried out in the desired process industry. This dissertation focuses on exploring battery powered alternatives to diesel powered underground load haul dump (LHD) equipment. The economic model developed for this project provides corporate investors and, in turn, its consumer base with an added net value to the process for each alternative. Corporate customers and audience being; plant and operations managers, corporate operations and technology, engineering and reliability decisions makers. The project was divided into four chapters, each of which consist of an accepted or submitted peer reviewed journal publication. \nThe first chapter involved determining the current default equipment used in the process in combination with the replacement technology. All the data that could be obtained for the equipment and process was gathered and, with appropriate assumptions for missing or incomplete data, used to initiate development of the model used to compare the technologies. The lead acid battery is most commonly used for battery powered mining equipment. Two battery chemistries, lithium-ion and Sodium Metal Halide (NaMX), were selected as the replacement technology using six criteria for cell performance; safety, environmental footprint, life span, degradation, scalability and toughness. Initial calculations were conducted to determine approximate battery cost, volume and weight. \nThe second chapter, involved process flow diagram creation and investigation of the equipment and each step of the process. Key performance indicators were calculated using operational mine data and were also used to find out the main factors that impact the economic value of each technology. Analysis of the performance data led to the understanding of the distribution of uptime and downtime for each vehicle. Understanding each issue that added more downtime for both electric and diesel powered LHDs allowed for the estimation of uptime and downtime for battery powered LHDs. \nThe third chapter finalized the value model used to convert technical details of the technology to a single economic value. Wear characteristics and life time of both the current and replacement technology were calculated using the same data set used in the second chapter  added to the existing input parameters. The parameters were used in numerical models to determine the value each technology contributed to the process. Assessments focused on both profit and cost only analysis for a more in depth comparison of each technology\u2019s value. A stability analysis was performed to address the variability of the input parameters. This was used to develop a range of conditions in which each technology was superior.  \nThe fourth chapter expanded the value model, exploring new parameters and their effect of the value of the new technology. A parameter, focusing on the reduction of energy costs due to reductions in ventilation requirements, was added to determine the effect reduced energy costs had on the value battery LHDs. Multiple battery chemistries were analyzed not only compared to diesel but each other to determine the technology that would add the most value to an underground hard rock mine. The model was improved to allow for sensitivity model to be run by computer allowing for orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy. The parameters are adjusted for inflation each year, however the revenue and costs remains the same for each year. There would be significant reduction in the variation in the input parameters over a 10-year span than a 35-year span; therefore the model duration was shortened to the span of a lifetime of an LHD, or 10 years.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11681], "author_name_tesi": "Schatz, Richard S", "last_name_ssi": "Schatz", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Antonio Nieto", "Serguei Lvov", "Jeremy Michael Gernand", "Antonios Armaou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Antonio Nieto, Dissertation Advisor", "Serguei Lvov, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeremy Michael Gernand, Committee Member", "Antonios Armaou, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Underground mining", "Alternative power sources", "Economic analysis", "Sensitivity Analysis", "Incremental Analysis", "Lifetime Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Parenting Cognitive Development:  The Institutional Effects of Mass Education on the Social Construction of Parenting and Childhood\n", "id": "6458", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4547", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A pivotal idea in this dissertation is that prevailing notions of childhood have changed over time in the U.S. Specifically, I show that changes have occurred in parent behaviors regarding cognitive development of their young children and argue that the growing trend in the parenting of cognitive development in young children in the latter half of the 20th century was largely attributable to the institutionalization of mass schooling. This dissertation examines parenting cognitive development from 1951 to 2001 in five ways. First, I compare and contrast three strains of relevant theoretical work from Peter Berger, John Meyer and Phillip Aries. Second I review several relevant literatures: 1) the sociological literature on changes in parenting in the U.S. during the 20th century; 2) the research literature on changes in the U.S. during the 20th century in expert literature to parents on cognitive development of children; 3) the research literature on parental involvement in schooling; and 4) the demographic literature on family trends in the 20th century. Next, I present analyses of parent behavior from Patterns of Childrearing 1951-52, the Detroit Area Study 1963, and the National Household Education Surveys 1991 and 2001 to show the changes in parent behaviors around the cognitive development of their children in the U.S. in the 50 year span from 1951 to 2001. Fourth, I demonstrate the changing impact of household income and mothers\u2019 education as evidence of the overall influence of mass education on norms and behaviors of parents. Finally, I describe the normative nature of parenting cognitive development by the beginning of the 21st century using the National Household Education Survey 1991, 1993, 1996, 1999, and 2001 and speculate on its implications for the sociologies of parenting and education, as well as a neo-institutional analysis of schooling. In addition, I contrast my institutional argument with a demographic one. The results show parents increasingly spent more time engaging in activities related to cognitive development over the second half of the 20th century so that by 1991 it was normative behavior but continued to increase in the following decade. In addition, mothers\u2019 education became an increasingly better predictor of parenting cognitive development over the latter half of the 20th century however, in the last decade of the 20th century the effects of mothers\u2019 education on parenting cognitive development declined and the trends began to converge as further evidence of parenting cognitive development as normative behavior.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4515], "author_name_tesi": "Schaub, Maryellen ", "last_name_ssi": "Schaub", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Maryellen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John David Mccarthy", "Sean Reardon", "Roger Kent Finke", "John Kramer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John David Mccarthy, Committee Chair", "Sean Reardon, Committee Member", "Roger Kent Finke, Committee Member", "John Kramer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Childhood", "Parenting", "Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Trophic Factors Produced by Differentiating Mesenchymal Stem Cells Play a Role in Progenitor Cell Recruitment and Differentiation\n\n", "id": "17568", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8604", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The mechanisms by which mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play a role in tissue repair and regeneration are not clearly understood.

In this study, the capacity for differentiating human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to induce both differentiation, and migration of endogenous pre-osteoblastic cells was investigated in vitro. In addition, the osteoblastic markers exhibited by these MSCs following differentiation, were examined and related to their degree of differentiation at each time-point. Predicted paracrine factors, such as VEGF, were identified and related to their roles in migration and differentiation. It was found that conditioned medium harvested from day 7 of differentiating osteoblasts shows the most significant enhancement of migration (44.6 microns) and differentiation of exogenous MSCs. Furthermore, it was also predicted that VEGF plays a key role in the migration of exogenous MSCs, as well as BMP-2 in the differentiation of exogenous cells. Therefore, in these experiments, we provide evidence that differentiating human MSCs produce factors, which create a microenvironment, leading to the recruitment, differentiation and proliferation of surrounding cells.

The fact that simple borate glasses have rather high thermal expansion and low chemical durability attests to the unique influence of boron oxide additions upon the properties of silicate glasses. However, the impact of boron oxide additions upon surface properties of multicomponent borosilicates such as adsorption and reactivity is not yet well understood. In particular, the presence of multiple coordination states for boron is expected to introduce adsorption sites with different acidic or basic behavior, but their existence is yet unproven. To investigate these effects, multicomponent sodium aluminosilicate glasses have been prepared with varying sodium and boron concentrations and drawn into moderately high-surface-area continuous filament fibers. \nA relatively new technique, boron K-edge Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy is applied to study the local boron coordination at fracture and melt-derived fiber surfaces of these glasses. This structural information is combined with surface compositional information by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) to characterize the local atomic structure of boron at the as-formed glass surface. Finally, this information is used to interpret the adsorptivity of these as-formed and leached surfaces toward short-chain alcohol molecules through a new Inverse Gas Chromatography - Temperature Programmed Desorption (IGC-TPD) experiment. The results clearly show that boron additions to alkali-free glass surfaces introduce a unique adsorption site which is not present on boron-free glass surfaces and is easily removed by leaching in acidic solutions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5086], "author_name_tesi": "Schaut, Robert A", "last_name_ssi": "Schaut", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carlo G Pantano", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Karl Todd Mueller", "James Hansell Adair", "Victor Alexandrovich Bakaev"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carlo G Pantano, Committee Chair", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Victor Alexandrovich Bakaev, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NEXAFS", "XPS", "TPD-IGC", "Boron", "Glass", "Surfaces", "XANES", "coordination", "adsorption", "composition"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The El Gigante Rock Shelter, Honduras\n", "id": "8083", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6168", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThe site of El Gigante, La Paz, Honduras is unique in Central America for its very well preserved organic remains and lengthy archaeological sequence.  Preliminary analyses of the ceramics, lithics, botanical and faunal material are presented in a cultural sequence beginning at 9,480 B.C.  The botanical remains recovered from the site are inventoried and several species are subjected to preliminary morphometric analyses in order to characterize the assemblage, and assess changes in plant phenotypes through time.  The operation of \"directional\" (artificial) selection is evident at the site for several species, including avocado (Persea americana), squash (Cucurbita sp., cf. C. pepo), and bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria).  While varieties of squashes may have been cultivated in the Archaic, clearly domesticated maize and beans appear to have been introduced in the Formative.  However, stratigraphic disconformities in the period of c. 5,000 \u2013 2,000 B.C., may bias this conclusion.  From early in the sequence, botanical diversity is high, despite changing subsistence specialization and generalization evident in other artifact assemblages.  Many undomesticated species are utilized prehistorically and are not lost from the diet despite the intensification of field-based food production of domesticated species.  An emphasis is placed on suites of plants, both wild and domesticated, annual and perennial, whose use is integrated through time El Gigante.  Together these subsistence systems afforded flexible, energetically efficient and risk minimizing choices to prehistoric foragers.  Low level food production is evident as early as the Archaic period.  Tree crops were one focus of subsistence practices.  The augmentation and management of perennials is inferred from their consistency and prominence in the archaeological record.  However, there is also evidence for the use of annual grasses during this time.

The specific goals of this dissertation were to understand if PYY and ghrelin are involved in the long-term regulation of body weight in normal weight premenopausal healthy women (Study 1), to understand if alterations in PYY and ghrelin are related to reproductive function in premenopausal healthy women (Study 2 and 4), and to determine if college-aged women with different eating behavioral phenotypes, i.e., high vs normal dietary restraint, differ with respect to circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones during and following a test meal (Study 3).  Study 1 was designed to examine changes in fasting PYY and ghrelin in non-obese premenopausal women following an exercise and diet program with and without weight loss. We demonstrated that exercising women who lost weight increased ghrelin concentrations.  Study 2 was designed to examine if elevations in 24 hour circulating ghrelin concentrations following a ~3 month exercise and diet program associated with diet- and exercise-induced weight loss are associated with a decrease in luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility in premenopausal women.  We demonstrated that elevated ghrelin concentrations were associated with the suppression of LH pulsatility in premenopausal women.  The purpose of Study 3 was to determine if college-aged women with different eating behavioral phenotypes, i.e., high vs normal dietary restraint, differ with respect to circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones during and following a test meal.  We demonstrated that PYY3-36 concentrations were suppressed in the women with high dietary restraint compared to the women with normal dietary restraint, indicating low PYY3-36 concentrations following a test meal may be indicative of a blunted appetite reduction after a meal and, over time, lead to an increased risk of weight gain. The purpose of Study 4 was to determine if ghrelin and PYY are associated with the recovery of menses in women with exercise associated menstrual cycle disturbances (EAMD).  We demonstrated that women with EAMD who experienced menstrual recovery experience significant decreases in fasting ghrelin concentrations compared to women with EAMD who did not resume menses.  We speculate that decreases in ghrelin may be necessary, likely in conjunction with changes in other metabolic hormones, for exercising women with EAMD, to recover menstrual function.   Overall, ghrelin is likely an important signal involved the regulation of the hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis in premenopausal women, while PYY is related to eating behavior phenotypes after a meal.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7048], "author_name_tesi": "Scheid, Jennifer L", "last_name_ssi": "Scheid", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Jane De Souza", "Nancy Williams", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Leann L Birch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Jane De Souza, Dissertation Advisor", "Nancy Williams, Committee Member", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Member", "Leann L Birch, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Peptide YY", "Ghrelin", "Reproductive Function", "Exercising Women"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Pressure Tuning of Pnicogen Chalcogenide Thermoelectrics", "id": "6322", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6343", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The thought of a cooling device or power generator with no moving parts seems almost a part of science fiction.

We have been studying the subcellular targeting of the Gag protein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), one of the first simple retroviruses identified. The Gag protein directs assembly at the plasma membrane and incorporates the viral genome through association with a cis-acting packaging element in the viral RNA. Although functional domains within Gag that mediate the assembly process have been well defined, the activity of these motifs has not been well correlated with the trafficking of Gag throughout the cell during assembly. \n\n\nWe have identified distinct subcellular targeting motifs within the Rous sarcoma virus Gag protein that may influence the retroviral assembly pathway. Within the Gag membrane-binding domain, we have identified an alpha helix that is crucial for plasma membrane targeting of Gag. When this helix is deleted, the Gag protein accumulates at intracellular membranes. Yet membrane affinity is not diminished, indicating that membrane binding and plasma membrane targeting of the RSV Gag polyprotein are genetically separable.\n\n\nWe have also identified both a nuclear targeting signal within the N-terminal MA domain of Gag and a nuclear export signal (NES) within the p10 domain. Expression of dominant-negative nuclear pore proteins redistributes the Gag protein from a cytoplasmic and plasma membrane localization to an almost exclusively nuclear localization, confirming that Gag both enters and exits the nucleus. We have further identified the soluble receptor that mediates the cytoplasmic localization of Gag; treatment of virus-expressing cells with leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of the CRM-1 export pathway results in sequestration of the Gag protein within the nucleus. Single amino-acid substitutions within a leucine-rich cluster in the p10 domain of Gag result in accumulation of the protein within the nucleus, confirming the localization of the Gag NES within the p10 region. Interestingly, we find that the NES sequence is highly conserved among avian retroviruses; when naturally occurring variations within this sequence are recreated in the RSV Gag protein, NES function is retained, while artificial substitutions predicted to retain NES function do not. \n\n\nWe have sought to identify additional cellular proteins that influence the import and export of Gag from the nucleus by employing the powerful genetic system developed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression of Gag linked to a tandem GFP reporter reveals a localization to the cytoplasm of yeast cells with an accumulation in the nucleus not seen at steady-state in avian cells. Not only is the dwell time between the nucleus and cytoplasm altered, but the nuclear export pathway is perturbed as well; yeast cells do not show an enhanced accumulation of Gag proteins within the nucleus following leptomycin B treatment, suggesting that the Crm1 pathway may not be the predominant export pathway utilized by Gag in yeast cells. \n\n\nTo further investigate the role of Gag nuclear trafficking in retroviral replication, we have studied the replication of viruses containing mutations in the Gag NES. These mutant Gag proteins are able to direct the budding of virions which contain the normal complement of viral polyproteins and the proper amount of viral genomic RNA. However, the virions that are produced show profound morphological defects, including amorphous and heterogeneously shaped particles, and viral cores that are elongated or granular in appearance. Despite these substantial morphological defects, the particles are able to enter new cells and undergo reverse transcription, producing 2-LTR circles, hallmarks of entry of the synthesized DNA genome into the nucleus. Although the particles are able to complete reverse transcription, they are non-infectious. Nuclear transport of Gag is therefore crucial not only for the efficient production of viral particles at the plasma membrane, but also for the establishment of a productive infection. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3908], "author_name_tesi": "Scheifele, Lisa Z", "last_name_ssi": "Scheifele", "middle_name_ssi": "Z", "first_name_ssi": "Lisa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leslie Joan Parent", "Rebecca C Craven", "James E Hopper", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "Michael Verderame"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Chair", "Rebecca C Craven, Committee Member", "James E Hopper, Committee Member", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Member", "Michael Verderame, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["retrovirus", "Gag", "nucelar transport", "Crm1"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Microbiological Comparison of Poultry Products Obtained From Farmers' Markets and Supermarkets in Pennsylvania\n", "id": "15223", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7517", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract:\nThe popularity of farmers\u2019 markets in the United States (U. S.) continues to rise, with an increase from 1,755 in 1994 to 7,175 in 2011.  Although farmers\u2019 markets represent a minimal portion of the agricultural market, farmers\u2019 markets have become a significant source of food products for many Americans.  Potentially hazardous foods, such as milk, meat, and poultry are popular items sold at farmers\u2019 markets and require specific processing and handling to ensure the safety of the product.   Meat and poultry items make up a large portion of potentially hazardous foods sold at farmers\u2019 markets, but only meat products (beef, lamb, pork) are required by federal law to be processed in a USDA-inspected facility.  Poultry however, can be grown and processed by individual farmers under exemption status afforded to farmers by the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA).  Currently, little to no data have demonstrated the microbiological profile of poultry (chicken or turkey) sold at farmers\u2019 markets and/or compared the findings to conventionally-processed, organic and non-organic poultry sold in supermarkets.  Additionally, no study has explored the processing practices, as well as the knowledge and attitudes of poultry vendors in food safety, poultry processing, and regulatory requirements.  The purpose of this study was to determine the presence/absence of foodborne pathogens, as well as hygiene indicators, in fresh or frozen whole chicken purchased at farmers\u2019 market and conventionally-processed, organic and non-organic chicken sold in supermarkets.  A needs assessment was conducted to evaluate general practices and food safety knowledge and attitudes of poultry vendors at farmers\u2019 markets throughout Pennsylvania.\nWhole chicken carcasses from farmers\u2019 markets and supermarkets throughout Pennsylvania were obtained and transported back to the Penn State Muscle Foods Laboratory at 4oC until further analysis.  Each chicken carcass was rinsed and levels of aerobic plate counts (APC), generic E. coli, and total coliforms were measured.  Resulting rinses also were evaluated for presence/absence of Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. following standard culture and confirmation methods.  Results demonstrated that 28% (28/100) and 90% (90/100) of whole chicken from farmers\u2019 markets, 20% (10/50) and 28% (14/50) of conventionally-processed organic, and 8.0% (4/50) and 52% (26/50) of non-organic chicken, were positive for Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. respectively.  Additionally, among the 90% of Campylobacter spp. positive farmers\u2019 market whole chicken, 67% of rinses were enumerable, with a mean count of 1.6 log10 CFU/ml.  \nThe needs assessment survey consisted of a 32-question, paper-based survey that was administered to poultry vendors at their respective farmers\u2019 markets during market hours.  The needs assessment consisted of four sections which assessed the processing methods, knowledge, attitudes, and demographics of poultry vendors at farmers\u2019 markets in the areas of poultry processing, food safety, and regulation.  The results highlighted that 52% (11/21) of vendors slaughtered and processed their own poultry, while 48% (10/21) had their poultry processed at a separate farm or facility.  Among those vendors who knew of their processing conditions, 33% (7/21) processed their poultry outside, 38% (8/21) processed their poultry inside a fixed or dedicated processing area, while the remainder either used a combination of both, or did not know.  The majority of vendors appeared to have a good understanding of correct temperature control of poultry during processing.  However, more than 50% (11/21) incorrectly answered questions related to pathogens and cross-contamination during processing.   Additionally, the attitudinal section revealed that 100% (21/21) of vendors agreed that their poultry was safe and 95% (20/21) of vendors believed their poultry products to be safer than poultry sold in retail supermarkets.  70% (14/20) of vendors recognized that antimicrobial sprays and washes can reduce pathogens on poultry.  Interestingly, 25% (5/20) agreed that additional food safety interventions were needed and 33% (7/21) utilized an antimicrobial spray or wash on their poultry before packaging.   \nThese data suggest that whole chicken purchased from farmers\u2019 markets in Pennsylvania were more likely to be contaminated with Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp., as compared to conventionally-processed poultry sold at supermarkets.  The results revealed critical vendor practices and identified important vendor knowledge gaps and attitudes on food safety and poultry processing, while also highlighting the need for training and educational materials for poultry vendors.  The data obtained from the vendor needs assessment surveys will aid in the development of future farmers\u2019 market research, as well as generating recommendations, guidelines, fact sheets, and outreach material on food safety issues for vendors selling meat and poultry products at farmers\u2019 markets.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7455], "author_name_tesi": "Scheinberg, Joshua Adam", "last_name_ssi": "Scheinberg", "middle_name_ssi": "Adam", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Catherine Nettles Cutter", "Stephanie Doores", "Rama B Radhakrishna", "Chitrita Debroy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Catherine Nettles Cutter, Thesis Advisor", "Stephanie Doores, Thesis Advisor", "Rama B Radhakrishna, Thesis Advisor", "Chitrita Debroy, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Farmers' markets", "salmonella", "campylobacter", "pathogen prevalence", "poultry", "needs assessment", "vendors", "survey", "pennsylvania"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A Comprehensive Food Safety Assessment of Farmers' Markets in Pennsylvania", "id": "27673", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12202", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since the colonial era, farmers in the U. S. have utilized a constantly changing system of markets to barter, sell, and distribute their farmed goods to the local populace.  Today, farmers\u2019 markets have replaced old-world style markets providing more than just local produce.  Since the late 1970\u2019s, farmers\u2019 markets in the U. S. have experienced an exponential growth with over 8,200 farmers\u2019 markets operating in the U. S. today. As farmers\u2019 markets have increased in size, scope, and complexity in the kinds of foods sold at these venues, so has the potential food\nsafety risks.  Today, farmers\u2019 markets provide thousands of farmers in Pennsylvania and hundreds of thousands in the U. S. an economic opportunity to sell their agricultural products outside of the conventional commercial markets, while also allowing them control during harvesting, processing, packaging, transportation, and final sale of their products, from farm to fork.  While the economic and social impacts of farmers\u2019 markets are no doubt important and positive, previous observational, survey, and microbiological research of farmers\u2019 markets in various regions of North American have revealed that in many cases, farmers\u2019 market vendors can lack important knowledge and experience in food safety practices and behaviors.  These studies have also observed vendors performing high-risk retail food safety behaviors, and identified the presence of both hygiene indicator and pathogenic bacteria on select produce, meat, and dairy products.  Throughout the past decade, numerous outbreaks and recalls associated with farmers\u2019 market sold food products also have been reported, further highlighting the food safety implications of farmers\u2019 markets.  While these incidents have yet to cause mass public illness or capture national media attention, there is a great potential for a single food safety incident to jeopardize the farmers\u2019 market movement, toppling a billion dollar industry, endangering the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of farmers\u2019 in the U. S., and causing illnesses and potential deaths of consumers.  To date, several studies have evaluated specific elements of farmers\u2019 market food safety, such as consumer preferences and vendor behaviors, however no one study has used multiple research tools to identify food safety gaps in the same setting.  Training programs for farmers\u2019 market vendors also have been developed, however, current available programs may not be focused specifically on food safety, may not be validated scientifically, and content may not be based on actual farmers\u2019 market vendor needs.  To date, no current training program has been developed to address the specific and unique needs of Pennsylvanian farmers\u2019 markets and vendors.  Therefore the purpose of this study is to assess the unique food safety issues related to farmers\u2019 markets and vendors in Pennsylvania through a comprehensive food safety needs assessment, and based on the results, develop and pilot-test a new customized food safety training program for farmers\u2019 market vendors in Pennsylvania.  The comprehensive food safety assessment was accomplished using five tools: 1) the use of direct concealed observations of farmers\u2019 market vendors in the retail setting; 2) farmers\u2019 market vendor exploratory, knowledge and attitudinal surveys; 3) Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture inspector observational surveys; 4) market manager structured group interviews; and 5) microbiological sampling and analysis of produce, beef, and pork products obtained from Pennsylvania farmers\u2019 markets.  An overall comparison and compilation of results from each research tool identified key risk factors and gaps in food safety knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.  Specifically, the microbiological assessment demonstrated that a proportion of select produce and meat obtained from farmers\u2019 markets in Pennsylvania was of questionable microbiological quality, due to the presence of fecal coliforms, E. coli, and Listeria spp.  Further analysis also suggested that E. coli isolated from meat and produce had unique phylotypic properties and few isolates exhibited potential pathogenic properties.  Results of the observational and survey portions of the assessment revealed that a lack of knowledge and improper behaviors performed by vendors related to hand washing, glove use, thermometer use, packaging use, and cross-contamination, were important risk factors which could be addressed through education and training.  Based on those results, it was determined that food safety training for farmers\u2019 market vendors in Pennsylvania could address food safety knowledge and behavior gaps, potentially leading to safer foods sold at farmers\u2019 markets.  Guided by the preferences collected from vendor surveys, the FDA Food Code, and applicable Pennsylvania food safety regulations, a training program consisting of a comprehensive food safety resource guide and associated interactive 3-hour PowerPoint presentation was developed and piloted in several cities across Pennsylvania.  Using a pre- and post-test knowledge and attitudinal assessment, it was determined that the piloted training program produced significant increases in knowledge and positive changes in attitudes among vendor participants.  The overall results of this study demonstrated that a customized, in-person training program, specifically designed to address gaps identified through a comprehensive needs assessment, is an effective strategy for improving the food safety knowledge and changing the attitudes of farmers\u2019 market vendors in Pennsylvania.  Future use of this training program in Pennsylvania and in neighboring states, could serve to further support and sustain the current farmers\u2019 market movement in the U. S., while ensuring public safety and the success of individual vendors.    \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11595], "author_name_tesi": "Scheinberg, Joshua Adam", "last_name_ssi": "Scheinberg", "middle_name_ssi": "Adam", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Catherine Nettles Cutter", "Rama B Radhakrishna", "Edward G Dudley", "Luke F Laborde", "Stephanie Doores", "Jonathan Alexander Campbell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Catherine Nettles Cutter, Committee Chair", "Rama B Radhakrishna, Committee Member", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member", "Luke F Laborde, Committee Member", "Stephanie Doores, Committee Member", "Jonathan Alexander Campbell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Farmers' markets", "needs assessment", "E. coli", "retail food safety", "concealed observations", "food safety training"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Beyond the Congregation: Christian Nonprofits in the United States\n\n", "id": "8425", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1114", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The unit of analysis in the organizational study of religion has primarily been congregations and denominations.  However, a population of organizations with a religious mission or identity has developed that exists outside of these traditional structures.  Many of these organizations have more resources than many denominations, but have received little attention theoretically or empirically.  The following chapters rely on original data for over 1,900 hundred of the largest Christian nonprofits based in the United States.  Drawing upon theory in the study of organizations, social movements and religion I address three underlying research questions. \n\nFirst, when and why did these organizations rise?  While adjectives such as \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cproliferating\u201d are often used when talking about religious non-profit organizations, little empirical research has explored these questions.  Chapter 2 explores the historical roots and contemporary growth of the Christian nonprofit population.  \n\nSecond, what is the role of Christian nonprofits within American religion? Are Christian nonprofits competing with or cooperation with congregations and denominations, and how does the presence of Christian nonprofits help us understand changes within those more traditional religious organizations?  Chapter 2 examines the often ambivalent relationship between churches, denominations, and Christian nonprofits.  Chapter 5 looks at how the often ambiguous line between church and parachurch is reflected in how the IRS distinguishes churches from nonprofits.  More specifically, what are the different roles or activities being filled within the Christian nonprofit population?  Chapter 3 explores the nine primary activity sectors within the Christian nonprofit population.  \n\nThird, how are these national religious non-profits run?

Evaluation was conducted behaviorally, and by using event-related potentials (ERPs), to provide insights into the real-time processing of grammatical gender information among L2 learners. This study also assesses the impact of cognate status on the online processing of grammatical gender violations. Finally, the study explores the role that individual differences in proficiency may play in the processing of grammatical gender. \nPrevious research has shown that late L2 learners can acquire grammatical gender (Gillon Dowens, Guo, Guo, Barber, & Carreiras, 2011; Morgan-Short, Sanz, Steinhauer, & Ullman, 2010) and use it predictively (Hopp, 2013), once they are highly accurate in grammatical gender assignment, i.e., the ability to assign the correct gender to individual nouns. Other research has shown that training results in improvements to learners\u2019 sensitivity to L2 morphosyntactic violations (Batterink & Neville, 2013), and grammatical gender violations more specifically (Lemh\u00f6fer, Schriefers, & Hanique, 2010; Morgan-Short, Finger, Grey, & Ullman, 2012; Morgan-Short et al., 2010). Prior studies using ERP methodology have also shown that L2 proficiency often modulates the type of online processing that learners engage in (e.g., Foucart & Frenck-Mestre, 2011; Tanner, Inoue, & Osterhout, 2014). Novel to the present study is the combination of training a group of less proficient learners (intermediate) and comparing them to a group of more proficient learners (advanced) and a group of native speakers. Previous research has either trained a group of L2 learners and monitored online processing over the course of learning (e.g., Batterink & Neville, 2013; Lemh\u00f6fer et al., 2010; Morgan-Short et al., 2012; Morgan-Short et al., 2010; White, Genesee, & Steinhauer, 2012) or tested learners at different L2 proficiency levels using a cross-sectional design (e.g., Ojima, Nakata, & Kakigi, 2005). By employing both a training study and cross-sectional comparisons across proficiency levels, the experimental method in this study allows for a more nuanced understanding of the developmental trajectory of the acquisition of L2 grammatical gender. Furthermore, previous research has demonstrated cognate facilitation effects at both the level of processing individual words in isolation (e.g., Midgley, Holcomb, & Grainger, 2011) and at the sentence level, when such words are embedded in a larger context (see Lauro & Schwartz, 2017, for review). However, it is unknown how cognates influence L2 morphosyntactic processing. In order to assess whether cognates might facilitate the online processing of gender violations, this study also examined how learners at different proficiency levels process grammatical gender for cognate versus noncognate nouns.\nIn order to address the questions of how L2 learners process grammatical gender violations online and how training, cognate status, and proficiency modulate processing, this study looked at two groups of L1 English- L2 German learners (intermediate and advanced) and L1 German speakers. Experiment 1, involving intermediate L2 German learners, consisted of two sessions, seven days apart. In session 1, participants\u2019 sensitivity to grammatical gender violations was assessed via an ERP task in which participants read sentences containing grammatical versus ungrammatical gender-marked determiners (e.g., Wo ist der.MASC /*das.NEUT AnkerMASC in diesem Bild? \u201cWhere is the anchor in this picture?\u201d). Additionally, half of the target nouns were cognates (e.g., Anker \u201cAnchor\u201d), meaning they shared form and meaning in English and German, and half were noncognates (e.g., Tasse \u201ccup\u201d). The participants were then trained on the nouns and their grammatical gender in an explicit training task. One week later, they were tested on the nouns, re-trained and then they completed a second ERP task. The behavioral results indicated that cognates facilitated noun naming during the training and behavioral recall tasks, but not gender naming accuracy. ERP responses in session 1 revealed no overall sensitivity to grammatical gender violations. However, correlational analyses revealed that responses to gender violations with cognate nouns varied according to L2 proficiency, with less-proficient L2 learners exhibiting a more negative N400-like response to violation sentences and more-proficient L2 learners exhibiting a more positive P600-like response. In session 2, after training, the behavioral results showed the same pattern as session 1.  The ERP responses revealed an overall sensitivity to grammatical gender violations, but these results were not modulated by L2 proficiency. Qualitative and quantitative differences in the ERP signatures for cognates and noncognates were present, with participants exhibiting an N400 and a frontal positivity in response to gender violations with cognate nouns but only a late frontal positivity in response to gender violations with noncognate nouns. That the overall ERP responses to gender violations increased from session 1 to session 2, and that these ERP response patterns were no longer modulated by L2 proficiency, provide evidence that training reduced initial proficiency-based differences and increased participants\u2019 sensitivity to grammatical gender information during real-time language comprehension. \nIn Experiment 2, advanced L2 learners\u2019 and L1 German speakers\u2019 sensitivity to grammatical gender violations was assessed via the same ERP task used in Experiment 1. Following the ERP task, participants completed the same behavioral noun and gender naming recall task that the intermediate L2 learners completed in session 2 of Experiment 1. The behavioral results for the advanced L2 learners showed no cognate facilitation effects in either noun or gender naming accuracy. The ERP responses revealed that the advanced L2 learners were sensitive to gender violations with noncognates, but less so with cognates, in that they exhibited a centralized positivity in response to gender violations with noncognate nouns and only a descriptive frontal positivity in response to gender violations with cognate nouns. The native speakers showed no cognate facilitation effects in the behavioral task. In the ERP task they showed sensitivity to gender violations for cognates and noncognates, exhibiting a P600 effect in response to gender violations with both cognates and noncognates. These results provide evidence that advanced L2 learners are sensitive grammatical gender violations in the absence of training, yet unlike the native speakers, their pattern of ERP responses remains different for cognates and noncognates, suggesting that the online processing of grammatical gender continues to be modulated by cognate status, even among more advanced L2 learners.\nThe present study demonstrates that proficiency has a significant impact on whether L2 learners are sensitive to grammatical gender violations and how they process grammatical gender in real time. With respect to proficiency and training, this study presents data from a continuum of proficiency levels, demonstrating that learners\u2019 sensitivity to grammatical gender violations increases with increased L2 proficiency. It also reveals the large degree of variability in L2 learners\u2019 processing of grammatical gender violations, especially at lower proficiency levels.  With respect to cognates, although the facilitation in noun learning and recall did not extend to the acquisition of grammatical gender, the different ERP responses to grammatical gender violations for cognates versus noncognates in both L2 learners groups indicate that facilitated cognate recall does affect the online processing of gender violations. This is a likely result of facilitated lexical retrieval freeing up cognitive resources to retrieve and use morphosyntactic properties of the noun during online processing.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study highlight ways in which L2 learners\u2019 difficulties with grammatical gender stem, at least in part, from how they allocate finite processing resources during online processing, rather than an inability to process grammatical gender per se. Strengthening L2 gender representations through training facilitates access to grammatical gender information, which in turn leads L2 learners to successfully process grammatical gender information\u2014exhibiting sensitivities to grammatical gender violations\u2014during real-time language processing. This dissertation highlights the importance of identifying ways in which explicit training can facilitate the acquisition of grammatical structures known to be difficult for L2 learners, and the need for researchers to more carefully consider the ways in which L2 proficiency impacts the real-time processing of such structures during L2 comprehension.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15231], "author_name_tesi": "Schempp, Patricia Lynne", "last_name_ssi": "Schempp", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynne", "first_name_ssi": "Patricia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carrie Neal Jackson", "Carrie Neal Jackson", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Michael Travis Putnam", "Adriana Van Hell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carrie Neal Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "Carrie Neal Jackson, Committee Chair", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member", "Michael Travis Putnam, Committee Member", "Adriana Van Hell, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["German", "Grammatical Gender", "ERP", "L2 Learners", "Cognate Status", "Second Language Acquistion", "SLA", "L2", "Cognate", "Gender", "Psycholinguistics", "Cognitive Psychology", "Linguistics", "Language Learning", "Bilingual", "Bilingualism"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Deterrence Effects of Sec Enforcement Actions", "id": "15397", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7555", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This paper examines whether SEC enforcement activity against an entity serves as a deterrent against aggressive reporting among peer firms not involved in the SEC enforcement action.

If caught at early stages, metastasis can often be localized, confined, and treated.  However, if time for progression of metastasis has occurred, it spreads to bone and surrounding tissues, and quickly metastasizes throughout the body.  Breast cancer, in particular is among the most common to preferentially metastasize to bone, with about 73% of those affected developing bone metastasis as a result of breast cancer.  However, at this point we do not fully understand why breast cancer cells preferentially metastasize to bone, and through what exact mechanism this occurs.\n     Studies have been previously conducted utilizing human breast cancer cells extracted from metastatic mammary tumors as a model.  These human studies investigated the connexin and cadherin expression profiles, as well as the metastatic characteristics of migration and adhesion.  Studies have also demonstrated that it is possible to inject human cells into a mouse model if the model is in an immunocompromised state.  However, the utilization of transgenic models, such as Cx43 deficient mice, presents a problem to this scenario because these models are not from an immunodeficient background.  Therefore, it is important to develop an in vivo murine model of breast cancer metastasis to bone.  However, in order to employ a murine model, it is critical to know the connexin and cadherin expression profiles in mice.  The results of the murine studies are very different from those found in human models and, in many ways, actually present opposite results.  It is important to consider this when working with mice as a model for breast cancer.\n     At the initiation of this experiment, it was hypothesized that breast cancer cell lines express different connexin and cadherin expression profiles relative to normal breast epithelial cells.  To test this hypothesis the connexin and cadherin expression profiles of murine breast cancer cells (4T1.2 cells) and normal breast epithelial cells (NMuMg cells) were characterized through Western blot and RT-PCR analyses.  The results of these experiments supported the hypothesis that murine breast cancer cells (4T1.2) possess a different connexin expression profile than normal murine breast epithelial cells (NMuMG).  Regarding connexin 43, though both 4T1.2 and NMuMG cells show slight expression of this gene in comparison to the positive control (MLO-Y4), the 4T1.2 cell line expressed it by almost a 50% greater amount than the NMuMG cell line.  Regarding connexin 32, NMuMG cells moderately expressed Cx32 in comparison to the positive control (Mouse Liver cells), while the 4T1.2 cell line does not express this protein.  Regarding, connexin 26, 4T1.2 cells display a greater expression than the NMuMG cell line, but neither cell line displays statistically significant expression of Cx26.  The results of these experiments revealed that murine breast cancer cells displayed a different cadherin expression profile relative to normal breast epithelial cells.  Regarding, E-Cadherin, the 4T1.2 cell line had an abundance of this protein, but little was detected in the NMuMG cell line.  In fact, the 4T1.2 cell line expressed E-Cadherin 2.5 times more than the NMuMG cell line.  Regarding, N-Cadherin, the 4T1.2 cell line exhibited great expression of N-Cadherin, while NMuMG showed only trace amounts of expression.  Regarding OB-Cadherin, neither the 4T1.2 cell line nor the NMuMG cell line showed expression of this cadherin.\n     It was also hypothesized that murine breast cancer cells would display greater levels of migration and adhesion than normal murine breast epithelial cells.  To test this hypothesis, the migration and adhesion in both of these cell types were quantified.  The results of these experiments showed murine breast cancer cells displayed increased levels of adhesion in comparison to normal murine epithelial cells.  Regarding adhesion, the NMuMG cell line displayed statistically significant higher levels of adhesion and over three times more adhesion than the 4T1.2 cell line.  The results from the migration assays revealed that murine breast cancer cells exhibit greater levels of migration than normal mouse epithelial cells.  In conclusion, murine breast cancer cells display decreased levels of adhesion and significantly increased levels of migration relative to normal murine breast epithelial cells.  These findings support previous human and murine studies on the metastatic properties of adhesion and migration.\n     Over the last fifteen years, survival rates among breast cancer patients have steadily increased due to major gains in our understanding of this disease.  However, future advances will require a better understanding of the genetics and biology of human breast cancer, which will assist with development of new preventative and therapeutic strategies.  Scientific findings must be tested in a setting in which potential clinical responsiveness can be assessed.  This requires better in vitro and in vivo models as well as an understanding of the similarities and differences in expression and metastatic behavior between animal models and human models.  This study focused on understanding the characteristics of an established murine breast cancer cell line and a normal murine epithelial cell line through which a highly effective in vivo model can be developed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5230], "author_name_tesi": "Schenk, Rachelle Lois", "last_name_ssi": "Schenk", "middle_name_ssi": "Lois", "first_name_ssi": "Rachelle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin", "Henry Joseph Donahue"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Henry Joseph Donahue, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["breast cancer", "metastasis", "bone", "4T1.2", "NMuMG", "cadherins", "connexins", "connexin 43", "connexin 32", "connexin 26", "E-cadherin", "N-cadherin", "OB-cadherin"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Achieving ph control through Stoichiometrically balanced media in Algal photobioreactors", "id": "16194", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7301", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High-density culturing methods and better operational strategies are needed to improve reactor productivities for algae-based biofuels at the commercial scale. Typical laboratory culture conditions for microalgae are nitrate-based media with elevated CO2 gas supplementation such that the bicarbonate equilibrium mitigates the pH rise associated with nitrate consumption and additional pH control is not necessary. However, improving yield of CO2 utilization is important to the economic success at the commercial scale, making it desirable to reduce gaseous CO2 levels, which requires alternate culturing strategies to the nitrate/high CO2 approach. Ammonium alone is rarely used in algae media due to a \u2018toxic\u2019 drop in culture pH from metabolism, but represents a unique approach to both media design and pH control when coupled with growth on nitrate.\nRelying on stoichiometric theory for photoautotrophic growth, a mixed nitrogen source at 36%N-NH4+/64%N-NO3- is anticipated to minimize the resulting proton imbalance from nitrogen metabolism such that growth can be sustained to higher densities in microalgae cultures. However, the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were shown to preferentially utilize ammonium when both ammonium and nitrate were provided in the medium. When ammonium-nitrogen was only 9% of the total nitrogen in the initial medium, the resulting proton imbalance from selective ammonium utilization caused the pH to drop too low to sustain further growth. However, providing incremental additions of ammonium in the presence of nitrate enabled growth to concentrations as high as 5 gDW/L on 0.3 gN/L, demonstrating that a fed-batch nitrogen strategy is necessary to balance the culture pH. \nAlthough air-grown cultures demonstrated larger pH swings than observed on elevated CO2 due to reduced bicarbonate buffering, the pH remained more balanced on a mixed nitrogen source than with the use of either ammonium or nitrate alone. Given a biological demand that exceeded the CO2 transfer rate, carbon-limited Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cultures indicated a lack of pH control as the culture did not respond to ammonium addition. Subsequent studies will focus on understanding whether the lack of control with the media-based approach was an immediate result of carbon limitation or the cessation of growth at high pH when nitrogen would no longer be metabolized as the current experimental design makes this interpretation difficult. Although hard to achieve a lower pH during carbon-limitation, the addition of more ammonium prior to carbon limitation is expected to drive down the pH (well below 9) such that the confounding effects of carbon limitation and high pH on reactor dynamics will become distinguishable. However, it is anticipated that pH-balanced growth during carbon limitation can be achieved using a feed-forward strategy by considering both nitrogen metabolism and CO2 transport, equilibrium and uptake kinetics within an adaptive control model to maintain the pH below 9 and avoid inhibitory pH levels.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7277], "author_name_tesi": "Scherholz, Megerle L", "last_name_ssi": "Scherholz", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Megerle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis", "Andrew Zydney", "Esther Winter Gomez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Zydney, Thesis Advisor", "Esther Winter Gomez, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["pH control", "algae", "nitrogen", "photobioreactor", "bicarbonate buffering", "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii", "Chlorella vulgaris"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Photophysics of Anthracene and Bianthryl as Indicators of Nanoscale Structural Effects in Room Temperature Ionic Liquids", "id": "19795", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9457", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThe possible effects bulk structure in Room Temperature Ionic Liquids (RTILs) on the photochemistry and spectroscopic behavior of molecular solutes were investigated in relation to chemical reactions in ionic liquids.

I use a case study of the Gewandhaus Orchestra in Leipzig, Germany, during the tenure of conductor Kurt Masur between 1970 and 1989 to argue that a symphony orchestra and its leader are able to build a space that, with Foucault, I call a heterotopia where a dialogue about political issues is permitted. \nI demonstrate that there are four pillars of the heterotopia Gewandhaus: they are Kurt Masur as the artistic head and conductor of the Gewandhaus and its orchestra, Gustav Mahler as an example of how music was used to inspire a dialogue about social issues, the architecture of the concert hall under the leadership of head architect Rudolf Skoda as the determiner of the actual space of the heterotopia, and the ceiling painting by Sighard Gille that reflected and supported the heterotopia of the Gewandhaus in the fine arts.\nThe ideals of Masur inside the concert hall found reflection and support in the building and its art works. All four pillars represent the demand for open dialogue about social issues, equality, and educated participation of citizens in social matters, a critical evaluation of political guidelines, an orientation toward internationality, and the fostering of a sense of community.

Individuals with diverticula have diverticulosis, a condition which is usually asymptomatic. However, in 4-25% of individuals with diverticulosis, inflammation of the diverticula results in diverticulitis. Acute diverticulitis is commonly treated with empiric antibiotics and increased dietary fiber. Despite the high prevalence of disease in the United States, the pathophysiology of diverticulitis is largely unknown. Previous data suggests that the immune system may play a role in diverticulitis pathogenesis. A key function of the intestinal immune system is to discriminate pathogens from commensal microorganisms. Microbial dysbiosis contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease; however, whether the microbiome is also involved in diverticulitis pathogenesis is unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that deregulation of the innate immune system contributes to diverticulitis pathogenesis by promoting a dysbiotic microbial ecosystem. \n\tTo test this hypothesis, we used RNA-seq, an unbiased and genome-wide approach, to globally survey the intestinal transcriptome of full-thickness sigmoid colon tissue collected adjacent to areas chronically affected by diverticulitis compared to controls.

Expanding on these findings, we identified an increased number of macrophages expressing the scavenger receptor CD163L1 in diverticulitis tissues. In diverticulitis patients, CD163L1+ macrophages localized at the sub-epithelium and co-expressed the chemokine CXCL10. Furthermore, heightened serum CXCL10 was found in diverticulitis patients relative to controls. As the intestinal microbiome influences immune homeostasis, bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS sequencing was performed from chronically diseased tissue and adjacent tissue in diverticulitis patients. We found distinct microbial interactions segregated chronically diseased tissue from adjacent tissue within the same colonic segments.\nThe findings from this dissertation propose that deregulation of the innate immune response to an altered microbial ecosystem results in chronic inflammation and the development of diverticulitis. There are currently no prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers or targeted therapeutic options for diverticulitis; thus this work may help drive development of such targets within molecular pathways of disease relevance.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15628], "author_name_tesi": "Schieffer, Kathleen Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Schieffer", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Walter Alex Koltun", "Walter Alex Koltun", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher", "Gregory Steven Yochum", "Regina Lamendella", "Matam Vijay Kumar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Walter Alex Koltun, Dissertation Advisor", "Walter Alex Koltun, Committee Chair", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Committee Member", "Gregory Steven Yochum, Committee Member", "Regina Lamendella, Outside Member", "Matam Vijay Kumar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["RNA-seq", "Microbiome", "Diverticular disease", "Immune system", "16S rRNA"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "INSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL ACTORS' RELATIVE INFLUENCE ACROSS THE U.S. FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY", "id": "14405els233", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14405", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation asks a fundamental question common to all bureaucratic institutions: how much relative political influence do political actors have over its inner-workings?

This model not only reduces administrative costs, but enables companies to shift their physical infrastructure to  virtualized environments like cloud computing platforms.  However, with this move to remotely administered services come serious risks.  Since users no longer control the systems they rely upon, they must assume they were correctly configured to protect their sensitive data.  As history has demonstrated, even the most well funded companies are prone to compromises, which may lead to the loss of countless confidential customer records.  If the world is to continue adopting this computing model, then a greater emphasis must be placed on building verifiable systems that customers can inspect.   \n\nIn this dissertation, we explore the design challenges in building verification  frameworks that overcome the limitations of current verification techniques for detecting unsafe and compromised systems.  Existing approaches leverage trusted computing hardware like the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to securely record and attest to integrity-relevant events occurring on the proving system.  However, these approaches are insufficient for verifying today's high performance and highly connected environments.  First, we developed the Root of Trust for Installation, a method for bootstrapping trust in virtual machine (VM) hosts that form the basis of many cloud offerings.  Second, we designed a remote integrity verifier to address many of the difficulties that attestation-only verification causes.  Using this Integrity Verification Proxy, we are able to verify heterogeneous integrity requirements at the proving system without the delay and complexity of traditional integrity measurement.   Finally, we incorporated our research into the Cloud Verifier, a framework for verifying the integrity of instances hosted on clouds.  This permits cloud administrators, customers, and external clients to verify integrity criteria without having to directly inspect the configuration of the entire platform.  Our proof-of-concept implementation and evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of building a verifiable, yet functional cloud platform.  While this work represents only a starting point, we believe it will lead to a greater understand of how today's online services can be designed in a more transparent way.

Marsh moved away from the specificity of his 1930s works and populated his transit settings with solitary female passengers with similar features, poses, and expressions.

One of the problems with genetic research on a trait as complicated as substance use is that multiple genes are likely to play a role, but each with a very small effect. Polygenic risk scores potentially help with this problem by analyzing the role of multiple genes as a set to substance abuse. Three polygenic risk scores were created to test markers within 19 genes that are differentially expressed in the Striatal direct and indirect pathways, which have been shown to play a crucial role in reward learning and addiction-related behaviors (Lobo et al., 2011). A polygenic risk score was created for 79 SNPs spanning all 19 genes that make up these two pathways together, as well as for the 39 and 40 SNPs that make up the two pathways individually. Of the three polygenic risk scores that were created, the score created for just the indirect Striatopallidal pathway was the only score variable to return significant results (p-value: 0.0289). This indicates that an individual possessing risk alleles within this pathway is at a greater risk of developing or exhibiting smoking-related behaviors such as smoking initiation or progressing to addiction, than an individual who does not possess these risk alleles.

The virus has evolved to hijack host machinery and signals to facilitate its entry, expression, assembly and release.  Which T cell specific signals regulate what specific steps of the viral life cycle are still being discovered.  Understanding how these cellular factors are critical for HIV replication will provide insights into viral pathogenesis.  Though HIV has evolved to manipulate the intracellular environment of its host, the virus needs to first gain entry into the cell.  To do this, HIV must overcome a cellular barrier, the cytoskeleton.  Not only is viral entry dependent on dynamic cytoskeleton changes, so is the egress of viral particles.  Despite the obvious need for HIV to traverse and interact with the cytoskeleton, how these events are regulated in the context of HIV infection is still not appreciated.   Thus, the purpose of this thesis was to examine T cell specific signals which were both involved in T cell activation, and the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics, to identify potential key check points in HIV replication, in particular entry and egress.\nThe Tec family tyrosine kinase, IL-2 inducing tyrosine kinase (ITK), is an important amplifier of T cells signals which emanate from TCR/antigen-presenting cell interactions.  In addition to its role in T cell activation, ITK regulates actin cytoskeleton changes. ITK activates Vav-1, a guanine exchange factor, which in turn regulates GTPases Rac, Rho, and Cdc42, resulting in F-actin polarization.  \nWe investigated the role of ITK in HIV replication using several different strategies such as siRNA depletion of ITK, chemical inhibition of ITK, and the expression of several ITK mutants.  Our data suggest that inhibition of ITK blocks HIV infection by affecting multiple steps of HIV replication.   The loss of ITK function resulted in marked reductions in intracellular p24 levels upon HIV infection.  Loss of ITK function after the establishment of HIV infection decreased viral spread within the culture.  Chemical inhibition of ITK partially blocked HIV viral entry, which correlated with decreased actin polarization to gp120.  ITK is required for efficient HIV transcription.  Over-expression of ITK results in increased HIV transcription along with increased release of virus-like particles.   ITK requires its Pleckstrin homology and Src homology 2 domains for regulating VLP formation whereas its kinase domain is dispensable.    \nFurther investigation of the role of ITK in viral particle assembly and release provided evidence of colocalization between ITK and Gag at the plasma membrane in a distinct punctate staining pattern.   ITK co-staining with Gag was altered when ITK activation was inhibited.  However, we have not detected a direct physical interaction between these molecules.    \nThese findings indicate that the Tec family tyrosine kinase, ITK, enhances HIV replication.  ITK expression is necessary for efficient HIV entry, transcription, and viral release.  In addition these data indicate that kinase-dependent and independent activities of ITK influence HIV replication.  Understanding the interplay between T cell signals and HIV, will provide more insight into mechanisms that regulate HIV and identify new therapeutic strategies to aid in the fight against HIV.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2063], "author_name_tesi": "Schiralli, Gillian  M.

The effects of these additive materials and concentrations on the propellant properties, including burning rate, density and thermal decomposition were observed. A lab-scale procedure was established to produce the propellant material in the form of solid strands, which allowed for control of sample composition and testing. Propellant samples were characterized using optical strand burning measurements, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).\nIt is shown that 0.50wt% GOb exhibits statistically significant increase (approximately 1.19 times) in linear burning rate compared to the control double-base propellant with no additive. Normalizing the linear burning rate data by density for a mass burning rate revealed that 0.50wt% and 1.00wt% rGO exhibit statistically significant increase (approximately 1.11 and 1.14 time, respectively) in gas production compared to the control. The 0.75wt% and 1.00wt% graphite propellant mixtures exhibit statistically significant decrease (approximately 0.89 and 0.87 times, respectively) in the rate of gas production compared to the control.

Evaluation of the TGA data does indicate that 0.50wt% rGO exhibit enhanced thermal decomposition and heat release compared to the baseline propellant. \nGraphene oxide, at a concentration of 0.50wt%, consistently exhibits enhancements to the combustion behavior of the base propellant.

For this ideal and this variety of liberalism would seem to have the potential to give rise to unhappy social consequences\u2014in particular, the inability of many in our age to experience their lives as meaningful. The second is a concern about even the most promising contemporary attempts to confront the ideal of individualism and the variety of liberalism that appeals to this ideal in their potential to give rise to unhappy social consequences, which, I argue, find one of their best representatives in the communitarian critique of liberalism in general and in Charles Taylor\u2019s critique as it is developed in his The Ethics of Authenticity in specific. For even these attempts would seem not to propose solutions that could prevent these consequences from arising\u2014in particular, the inability of many in our age to experience their lives as meaningful.

Thus, in the first half of the present work, I attempt to thematize the first concern through a reconsideration especially of Taylor\u2019s critique as it is developed in The Ethics of Authenticity and especially in relation to Rawls\u2019 liberalism as it is developed in A Theory of Justice (although Michael Sandel\u2019s critique as it is developed in Liberalism and the Limits of Justice, Rawls\u2019 liberalism as it is developed in Political Liberalism, and Will Kymlicka\u2019s liberalism as it is developed in Liberalism, Community, and Culture are also discussed at length). And, in the second half of the present work, I attempt to thematize the second concern through a reconsideration of Taylor\u2019s critique as it is developed in The Ethics of Authenticity with reference to Hegel\u2019s thought as it is developed in his Phenomenology of Spirit. Ultimately, I suggest that Taylor\u2019s critique might be able to propose solutions that could prevent what he calls \u201ca loss of meaning\u201d from arising if his method of critique and concept of recognition were more strictly Hegelian and I suggest what one such solution might be.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4362], "author_name_tesi": "Schleeter, Michael Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Schleeter", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Schmidt", "Dennis Schmidt", "John Philip Christman", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Daniel Joseph Conway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Schmidt, Dissertation Advisor", "Dennis Schmidt, Committee Chair", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi, Committee Member", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member", "Daniel Joseph Conway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hegel", "liberalism", "communitarianism"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "WOMEN\u2019S ATTEMPTS TO APPEASE MASCULINITY AND AVOID PUNISHMENT THROUGH SELF-SEXUALIZING APPEASEMENT STRATEGIES\n", "id": "10732", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3343", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Men often respond to feelings of masculinity threats with aggression.

This literature is constructed by a wide range of authors, including academics, foreign policy and defense establishment officials, and sometimes environmentalists. Though this literature is constructed in different ways, it usually either refers to a fairly direct link between environmental change and violent conflict at various scales, or that, as a consequence, environmental issues ought to be treated as issues of national security, or both.\n\tThe development of this literature is often hailed as a re-introduction of nature into geopolitics, and an academic and policy discourse enabled by a lightened defense burden at the end of the Cold War. Critics often suggest that it was a shifting of the constitutive \u2018other\u2019 from the Soviet Union to the environment, in part to justify exorbitant defense budgets. While the latter argument is more accurate, I use theories of intertextuality outlined by Julia Kristeva, and theories of semiotics outlined by Roland Barthes, in order to show a deeper discursive history of the idea of environmental security. These serve as valuable tools to analyze and draw together a wide range of texts, including WWI era literature advocating military \u2018preparedness,\u2019 early Cold-War U.S. geopolitical documents, and neo-Malthusian texts stretching from the first half of the 20th century (and some beyond) in order to show how they inform and constrain more current environmental security literature.\n\tThis analysis challenges the \u2018newness\u2019 of environmental security and argues that it is highly informed by naturalist epistemologies in the social sciences throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. I also argue that the Cold War \u2018othering\u2019 of the Soviet Union was also informed by discourses of nature, both in the sense that the spread of Soviet communism was seen as enabled partly by population-resource imbalances in the developing world, and also in the sense that \u2018containment\u2019 doctrine was understood as a form of \u2018quarantine\u2019 of an allegedly parasitic \u2018other.\u2019 Rather than being a new set of policies, I argue that environmental security is an extension of post-war developmentalism and sustainable development discourse, with the difference being only a slightly more direct rhetorical linking of environment and security. Using these theoretical tools to find common discursive themes throughout a broad range of literature both enables a genealogical history of environmental security in order to better theorize its development, and helps show the relevance of discourses of environment, security and environmental security to real, lived experiences of environmental insecurity.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3468], "author_name_tesi": "Schlosser, Kolson L", "last_name_ssi": "Schlosser", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Kolson", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Mc Carthy", "Lakshman S Yapa", "Lorraine Dowler", "Nancy A Tuana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Mc Carthy, Committee Chair", "Lakshman S Yapa, Committee Member", "Lorraine Dowler, Committee Member", "Nancy A Tuana, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Critical Geopolitics", "Environmental Security", "Intertextuality"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Tomboys and Sissies?

Although relationships between gender schema and sport participation have been examined previously, this study took the unique approach of also investigating consciousness of gender stigmas.  A mixed method approach was employed in which quantitative data were obtained from self-administered questionnaires and qualitative data were collected from one-on-one interviews.  \nDespite efforts to encourage gender equality across many social domains, perceptions of gender and \u201cappropriate\u201d behavior and participation according to sex persist.  Among the most notable are social prescriptions in sport, where masculine characteristics such as competition and aggression are definitive.  Arguably, children as young as those explored in this study have yet to develop a gender identity, and should therefore be immune to social influences pertaining to gender.  At the outset, this population was chosen so as to provide a foundation on which to build a longitudinal study in which the same population would be investigated as their gender identities became more salient throughout adolescence.  \nHowever, results from the quantitative and qualitative data indicated that children of this age group are aware of gender typed sports, and curb their participation accordingly.  This was found to be particularly true for boys, who are socially expected to demonstrate masculine qualities.  Behavior to the contrary results in a stigma of being too feminine or \u201cgirlie,\u201d a detail that became clear in the qualitative component of the study.  Girls on the other hand, although aware that boys\u2019 sports exist, did not experience the same limitation in their participation.  \nFor the most part, research investigating gender and sports to date has concentrated on the constraints and limitations afforded girls and women.  Yet, the findings of this study suggest that boys and men may in fact experience greater restriction in their participation options than girls and women.  Suggestions for future research include investigating these relationships among an older population, such as the longitudinal study discussed previously using the same sample, and to put some research effort into exploring the social pressures and limitations to which boys and men are exposed in regard to their sport participation.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1462], "author_name_tesi": "Schmalz, Dorothy L.", "last_name_ssi": "Schmalz", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Dorothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Leisure Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Linda L Caldwell", "Frank B Guadagnolo", "Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Elizabeth C Pinel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Chair", "Linda L Caldwell, Committee Member", "Frank B Guadagnolo, Committee Member", "Robert Scott Kretchmar, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Pinel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stereotypes", "gender", "sport", "children"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Genomic, physiological, and chemical analysis of the impacts of environmental stressors on honey bee (apis mellifera L.)workers and queens.", "id": "16477", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8298", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) populations are experiencing worldwide declines, averaging over 30% mortality each winter. In the US alone, honey bees account for over $11 billion in pollination services. Honey bees are exposed to numerous stressors that are contributing to the decline of honey bee health including pesticides, pathogens, parasites, malnutrition, environment, and management practices. The presence of these stressors and their potentially synergistic interactions can have large implications for the survival of honey bee colonies. There is only a limited understanding regarding the impacts of nutritional and pesticide stress on the behavior and physiology of individual bees, which may impact communication systems and thereby the organization of the colony. In this dissertation, I explore impacts of pesticide exposure and nutrition on honey bee queen and worker gene expression, physiology, and chemical communication. \nFirst, I examined the impact of coumaphos (organophosphate) and fluvalinate (pyrethroid), common in-hive miticides used for Varroa mite control, on the queen pheromone production and queen-worker pheromone-mediated communication. My analysis revealed that pesticide exposure had a minor impact. Next, I examined the impact of feeding single source (almond) and multisource (wildflower) pollen on colony growth, juvenile hormone (JH) endocrine pathways, protein levels, queen chemistry, and queen-worker pheromone-mediated communication. I found no impacts of pollen source on colony growth, endocrine pathways, protein levels, or queen-worker interactions. However queens fed wildflower pollen had significantly increased homovanillyl alcohol (HVA, queen pheromone component) content of the queen mandibular glands. It is uncertain what contribution increased levels of HVA is having on the colony; however previous findings have linked HVA with learning and the prevention of aversive behaviors in young workers. Lastly, I conducted a whole-genome microarray study to investigate the impact of coumaphos and fluvalinate on the genomic phenotype and physiology of workers. My analysis revealed a significant change in expression patterns in response to pesticide exposure, including the upregulation of several detoxification genes. Furthermore, pesticide exposure significantly impacted expression of genes associated with behavioral maturation. Subsequent analysis on JH pathways (known to impact behavioral maturation) revealed no change in circulating levels of JH, although I found a significant decrease in the JH precursor methyl farnesoate (MF) in response to pesticide exposure, but the role of MF is unclear. Furthermore, pesticide exposure significantly altered expression of genes associated with honey and pollen consumption. Subsequent nutritional bioassays and molecular analysis found that bees fed pollen had had a significant upregulation of genes whose expression was upregulated by pesticide exposure. Additionally, pollen was found to increase survival when challenged with pesticides compared to bees fed only sucrose. These research findings strengthen our understanding of pesticide and nutritional stress on honey bee health and impact current honey bee management practices. Our understanding of the physiological and behavioral mechanisms of pollen consumption and pesticide exposure will aid in our preservation of further declines in the honey bee population. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8213], "author_name_tesi": "Schmehl, Daniel Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Schmehl", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "James Lewis Frazier", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "Christina M Grozinger", "Christopher Albert Mullin", "Tracy Lee Langkilde"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "James Lewis Frazier, Dissertation Advisor", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Committee Chair", "Christina M Grozinger, Committee Member", "Christopher Albert Mullin, Committee Member", "Tracy Lee Langkilde, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["honey bee", "pesticide", "nutrition"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Transformative Learning Around Issues of Language and Culture Among ESL Teachers\n", "id": "21177", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9717", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the significant teaching and learning experiences of ESL teachers around the issues of culture and language.

Two attacks are proposed: (1) by strengthening public password sets with the known algorithm, which increases the percentage of recovered passwords by a factor of 2-5, and (2) by a brute-force attack on the initial passwords and space of possible changes, recovering all passwords produced when a sufficiently weak initial password was suggested.

To reduce the need for costly inspections and maintenance procedures, vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques have been developed over the past several decades to non-destructively evaluate the relative health of structural systems.\n     In this research, aluminum plate structures with progressively increasing levels of damage were studied using scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) measurements and a thirteen point finite differencing formulation derived by Daley (2005) to compute structural intensities and identify structural damage.  In the finite difference formulation, surface velocities were used along with spatial derivative approximations to the (thin) plate moments and forces to estimate structural intensity shear, bending and twisting components.  Several healthy and damaged plate structures were tested using point vibration sources and dissipative sinks.  The structure (vibration) sources and sinks were identified using the computed Structural Intensity (SI) fields and the vector field divergence of these SI fields.  The progressively increasing damage was identified in terms of how the damage was manifested in changes to the SI vector field magnitudes, directions, and the SI vector field divergence.  To evaluate potential advantages of using SI-based sensing techniques in damage detection applications, the manifestation of damage in SI-fields was compared to the performance of several traditional vibration-based health monitoring techniques applied to the same experimentally measured data.\n     SI-based health monitoring techniques showed the greatest sensitivity to open-crack damage at frequencies where the corresponding SI vector field was perpendicular to the orientation of the open-crack.  The maximum increase in SI magnitude measured during experimentation was 600%, and the maximum measured change in SI phase during experimentation was 150\u00b0 (a value of 0.83 when normalized to a 0 to 1 scale where a value of 1 represents a phase shift of 180\u00b0).  In comparison, the maximum magnitude increase experienced by traditional vibration-based damage detection techniques was 300%, and the largest change experienced by traditional techniques that were based on a normalized scale was 0.62.  This demonstrates the increased sensitivity of SI-based sensing when compared with traditional vibration-based health monitoring techniques.  In addition, SI-based sensing techniques demonstrated the ability to localize open-crack damage to areas comparable in size to the open-crack damage.  Traditional vibration-based techniques were only able to identify damage in a general area surrounding the open-crack damage, demonstrating another advantage of SI-based sensing in damage detection applications.\n     During experimentation, several key observations were made.  First, frequencies with energy flow perpendicular to open-crack damage were more sensitive to open-crack damage than frequencies with energy flow parallel to open-crack damage.  In addition, areas of low energy circulation provided results that were not as repeatable as high energy areas, as SI phase angles varied up to 100\u00b0 in these low energy areas.  For these reasons, it is important to have a full understanding of SI fields on structures to avoid false damage assessments in future damage detection applications.  Finally, ambient temperature shifts and structural damage caused shifts in resonance frequencies throughout experimentation, making measurement of SI at on-resonance frequencies difficult.  As a result, use of off-resonance frequencies between well separated modes is recommended for future SI-based damage detection applications.  For real-time application of SI-based sensing techniques in future damage detection applications, use of Surface Structural Intensity (SSI) sensors, which estimate SSI at discrete points on structures, is recommended.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6538], "author_name_tesi": "Schmidt, Walter Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Schmidt", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Walter", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Clarke Conlon", "Stephen Clarke Conlon", "Edward C Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Clarke Conlon, Thesis Advisor", "Stephen Clarke Conlon, Thesis Advisor", "Edward C Smith, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["aerospace engineering", "damage detection", "structural intensity"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Advanced Thermal Barrier Coating Materials and Design Architectures for Improved Durability", "id": "13306mps5098", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "13306", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are implemented in gas turbine engines to protect the engine components from the harsh combustion environment.

Therefore, novel coating design architectures were created to enhance the durability of TBCs containing GZO or similar analytes via Electron Beam \u2013 Physical Vapor Deposition (EB-PVD), Air Plasma Spray (APS), and a novel hybrid technique, Plasma Spray \u2013 Physical Vapor Deposition (PS-PVD).  The coatings were characterized in terms of microstructure and crystalline phase via scanning electron micrscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), optical profilometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED).  Image analysis was performed on the microscopy data while whole pattern fitting was employed for the XRD data to examine phase fractions, lattice parameters, crystallite sizes, and mirostrain.  Sin2(\u03c8) residual stress scans were also performed on select samples to examine the stress state after deposition and heat treatments.  Finally, the coatings were tested in terms of thermal conductivity via high heat flux laser technique or laser flash technique, erosion via a custom built erosion rig, and thermal stability via heat treatments and post analysis.  \nThe first approach involved utilizing electron beam \u2013 physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) to create a layered design architecture composed of alternating layers of the advanced GZO material and a toughening phase, t\u2019 Low-k (ZrO2 \u2013 2Y2O3 \u2013 1Gd2O3 \u2013 1Yb2O3 mol%), which enhances the durability by resisting fracture.  Nanolayering the two materials with individual layer thicknesses on the order of 200 nm resulted in 72% of the maximum possible reduction in the erosion rate.  At the same time, the best multilayer coating thermal conductivity was reduced by up to 24% compared to the state-of-the-art YSZ coating in the as deposited state.  Thermal conductivity stability also improved, as the nanolayers exhibited a small 7% increase in thermal conductivity over the 20 hour duration of the 1316 \u00b0C test, whereas the state-of-the-art YSZ coating increased by 52%.  Overall, the nanolayer concept represents a factor of 3 reduction in the erosion rate compared to pure GZO, while maintaining a factor of 2 reduction in thermal conductivity over YSZ.  This would potentially enable a thermal gradient of twice that of YSZ (500 \u00b0C), or operation at 1500 \u00b0C while still maintaining the same temperature of the substrate.\nThe second design architecture approach involved utilizing air plasma spray (APS) to create a composite design architecture composed of primary cubic phase zirconia materials which exhibit higher temperature phase stability, low thermal conductivity, but poor toughness, and a toughening secondary phase which exhibits high toughness.  The primary phases were either cubic Low-k (ZrO2 \u2013 6Y2O3 \u2013 2Gd2O3 \u2013 2Yb2O3 mol%) or NZO (ZrO2 \u2013 25Nd2O3 \u2013 5Y2O3 \u2013 5Yb2O3 mol%), while the toughening phase was again t\u2019 Low-k.  The best performing cubic Low-k composites reduced the erosion rate by 67% of the maximum possible reduction.  Meanwhile, thermal conductivity of the best cubic Low-k composite was reduced by 24% compared to that of pure YSZ, and very close to the value for pure cubic Low-k, indicating the second phase has minimal impact on the thermal conductivity.  The reduction in erosion rate did not linearly correlate to the weight fraction of the toughening phase, therefore, mixing rules were applied to describe the degree of parallel and series behavior.  It was found that a Halpin-Tsai mixing rule could enable quantification of the composite behavior, and therefore the efficiency of the toughening of the secondary phases via the \u03be scaling factor, where \u03be=0 indicates pure series behavior, and \u03be=inifinity (or a large number such as 100) indicates pure parallel behavior.  A \u03be value of 0.5 was found for the cubic Low-k composites, indicating some parallel (ideal) behavior was occurring, but that there was significant room for improvement.  The NZO \u2013 t\u2019 Low-k composites were deposited with a tailored, horizontally aligned, composite microstructure as it was hypothesized that this microstructure would enhance the toughening response of the t\u2019 Low-k phase.  For the NZO composites, the erosion rate was reduced by 79% with respect to the pure NZO compared to the pure t\u2019 Low-k.  This correlated to a factor of 3 reduction in the erosion rate and \u03be values of 1 \u2013 3 confirmed the hypothesis that a tailored design architecture such as an aligned microstructure could improve the toughening response.  The thermal conductivity of the best NZO composite coating was reduced by 55% compared to pure YSZ, again indicating minimal impact of the secondary phase.\nPlasma spray \u2013 physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) was utilized to deposit coatings in a pseudo-columnar design architecture, with the hypothesis that the hybrid PS-PVD process could combine beneficial aspects of both APS and EB-PVD.  YSZ coatings were first deposited to determine an ideal processing window for in-depth studies of process-structure-property relations for the t\u2019 Low-k material.  It was found that YSZ coatings deposited by this process yield the t\u2019 structure and often times incorporate metastable reduced zirconia phases due to a high oxygen deficiency.  Thermal conductivity of the PS-PVD YSZ coatings after ten hours of testing ranged from a maximum of 2.10 W/m-K to a minimum of 1.05 W/m-K.  For comparison, EB-PVD and APS YSZ coatings yielded values of 2.10 W/m-K and 1.47 W/m-K after ten hours of testing at 1316 \u00b0C, confirming the PS-PVD process can tailor coatings from EB-PVD-like to APS-like behavior.  A strong trend was observed between increasing deposition rates, and decreasing thermal conductivities.  Erosion trends suggested increasing erosion rates with increasing gas flow and amperage, while erosion approached a minima at 6.4 g/min feed rates.  Study of the YSZ material indicated the ideal processing range would utilize amperages of 1600 A \u2013 1800 A (with 1800 A being the upper limit of the system), gas flows of 80 NLPM \u2013 120 NLPM, and feed rates from 2.6 g/min to 10.6 g/min, which would yield conditions with high deposition rates for low thermal conductivity, as well as conditions for low erosion rates.  For the PS-PVD t\u2019 Low-k coatings, the erosion rate varied nearly an order of magnitude, with the highest erosion rate at 0.500 g/kg, less than the APS t\u2019 Low-k studied previously (0.948 g/kg), and the lowest erosion rate at 0.068 g/kg, a significant reduction over the EB-PVD t\u2019 Low-k studied previously (0.118 g/kg).  Erosion trends similar to the YSZ were observed for the t\u2019 Low-k coatings, where increasing gas flow yielded high erosion rates while a minima was approached at intermediate feed rates.  The erosion mechanism was investigated via post-erosion cross sectional SEM and appears to be similar to that of EB-PVD, however, it is hypothesized that the large columns of the PS-PVD process require more energy to fracture and generally possess larger intercolumnar gaps which prevent crack propagation from one column into neighboring columns.  This enables potentially lower erosion rates for the PS-PVD pseudo-columnar microstructures.  It was found that if the intercolumnar spacing becomes too large, the porous region around the column erodes quickly, exposing column tips which rapidly erode and yield high erosion rates similar to APS.\nFinally, this work compared coatings composed of YSZ, t\u2019 Low-k, and the advanced GZO material, all deposited via EB-PVD, APS, and PS-PVD and tested in terms of the erosion durability and thermal conductivity, while quantitatively assessing the crystallography and morphological features.  This provided the first direct comparison of the performance of coatings deposited by the various techniques for each of the material systems.  In terms of processing, the EB-PVD processing conditions were modified to increase the coating porosity in an effort to improve future thermal cycling results.  The PS-PVD conditions were chosen from the t\u2019 Low-k experiments to yield low erosion rates similar to EB-PVD and thermal conductivities intermediate to EB-PVD and APS.  The APS coatings were deposited with parameters such that the porosity was sufficiently high to improve the thermal cycling characteristics in future studies.  The erosion rates for the YSZ coatings therefore trended from APS (1.026 g/kg) > PS-PVD (0.277 g/kg) > EB-PVD (0.064 g/kg).  For the YSZ coatings, the PS-PVD depositions utilized a novel hollow sphere (HOSP) particle feedstock morphology.  It was found that this morphology is difficult to fully evaporate since the particles do not break apart when entering the plasma, which then yields very low depositions rates, and subsequently, large intercolumnar gaps and a relatively high erosion rate.  The EB-PVD YSZ erosion rate was significantly improved over previous EB-PVD YSZ (0.118 g/kg).  It was determined that the higher porosity yields larger intercolumnar gaps which prevent transcolumnar cracking from one column to neighboring columns.  This was observed for each of the EB-PVD coatings in the final study.  The thermal conductivity was highest for the EB-PVD t\u2019 Low-k (1.56 W/m-K), lowest for the APS t\u2019 Low-k (0.62 W/m-K), and intermediate for the highly porous PS-PVD t\u2019 Low-k (0.83 W/m-K).  The erosion rates for the t\u2019 Low-k coatings trended from PS-PVD (8.076 g/kg) > APS (0.789 g/kg) > EB-PVD (0.070 g/kg).  The t\u2019 Low-k PS-PVD coating utilized a more ideal spray dry particle feedstock morphology, however, the PSD was sufficiently high that significant portions were not evaporated, and very large intercolumnar gaps were formed.  This yielded extremely high erosion rates due to columns fracturing and being removed.  The thermal conductivity was higher for the EB-PVD GZO (1.06 W/m-K), and nearly identical for the APS GZO (0.51 W/m-K) and PS-PVD GZO (0.49 W/m-K).  The erosion rates for the GZO coatings trended from APS (6.409 g/kg) > PS-PVD (4.050 k/kg) > EB-PVD (0.692 g/kg).  The smaller particle size of the spray dried  PS-PVD GZO feedstock enables significant vaporization, though the column widths were still slightly too large to take full advantage of the PS-PVD pseudo-columnar morphology, and thus the erosion rate was higher than EB-PVD.  To further tailor the PS-PVD GZO coating vapor phase deposition and morphology, coatings were deposited at various incidence angles and assessed in terms of morphology and erosion.  It was found that depositing at a 45\u00b0 incidence can significantly reduce the intercolumnar gaps and reduce the erosion rate to a value of 0.305 g/kg, nearly half that of the EB-PVD GZO.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13428], "author_name_tesi": "Schmitt, Michael Powell", "last_name_ssi": "Schmitt", "middle_name_ssi": "Powell", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Edward Wolfe", "Douglas Edward Wolfe", "Gary Lynn Messing", "James Hansell Adair", "Md Amanul Haque", "John Richard Hellmann Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Edward Wolfe, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas Edward Wolfe, Committee Chair", "Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Md Amanul Haque, Outside Member", "John Richard Hellmann Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thermal Barrier Coating", "YSZ", "gadolinium zirconate", "design architecture", "composite", "multilayer", "PS-PVD", "Gd2Zr2O7", "rare earth"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Effects of Polychlorinated Biphenyls and Mercury on the Common Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina serpentina)\n", "id": "9291", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2795", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Snapping turtles are a good bioindicator of aquatic contaminants.  Two contaminants of concern in aquatic environments are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury.  Snapping turtles are capable of surviving high levels of PCBs in their tissues.  Females pass contaminants to their eggs, thereby exposing embryos prior to development.  The effects of PCBs through maternal exposure on the developing embryo and neonate hatchling are poorly understood.  My study addressed techniques to mimic maternal exposure, the change in PCBs from egg to hatchling, and the effects of PCBs on neonate hatchling respirations.  My study also addressed estimating mercury levels in snapping turtles through a non-invasive technique.  Snapping turtle eggs were collected, injected with oil or a low (1 ppm) or high (10 ppm) PCB solution, and incubated under low and high temperature and moisture treatments.  Upon hatch, neonate hatchlings were measured in a respirometer for CO2 production.  In adult snapping turtles, the claw, liver, muscle, and adipose tissues were sampled and analyzed for mercury concentration.  Hatching success in PCB injected eggs was 61% overall.  A comparison of congener specific profiles from egg to hatchling indicated an increase in higher chlorinated congeners and a decrease in lower chlorinated congeners.  The interaction of high PCB treatment and high incubation temperature resulted in a lower total PCB concentration in the hatchling.  Data did not support the relationship of PCB treatment and CO2.  In modeling mercury contaminants in internal tissues, the claw alone was not a good indicator.  The model to estimate mercury in the liver required the mercury in the claw and the weight of the turtle.  Future contaminant studies should continue attempts with egg injection techniques to mimic maternal transfer.  Understanding the toxicokinetics of PCBs during embryonic development is still in its infancy.  My study revealed that PCBs are mobile and dynamic during embryonic development.  Although effects were not observed in respiration measurements, other physiological effects should continue to be examined.  Contaminant monitoring should be limited to non-invasive techniques when possible.  Predictive models should continue to be developed to limit impacts to stable populations and to infer contaminants in threatened or endangered populations of turtles. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2792], "author_name_tesi": "Schnars, Jeanette L.", "last_name_ssi": "Schnars", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Jeanette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr.", "Hunter J Carrick", "C Paola Ferreri", "Charles Andrew Cole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr., Committee Chair", "Hunter J Carrick, Committee Member", "C Paola Ferreri, Committee Member", "Charles Andrew Cole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chelydra", "mercury", "PCB", "maternal transfer", "hatchling", "respirometry"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ICE PROJECTILE LENGTH PREDICTION OF SHED ICE FROM ROTOR BLADES", "id": "13562gms5247", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13562", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ice shed from rotor blades can be a ballistic concern for conventional helicopters, tiltrotors, wind turbines, and propellers. In conventional helicopters these ice projectiles can cause damage to the empennage and tail rotor, and in a tiltrotor configuration fuselage damage can be a concern. In both types of rotorcraft the ice could be ingested by the engine. All of these can lead to a catastrophic failure of the rotorcraft. A significant amount of research has already been conducted on adhesion strength of ice, ice shedding, projectile trajectories, and impact damage. This thesis will discuss research conducted to predict the ice projectile length of shed ice leaving the tip of a rotating blade. Knowing the size of the ice projectile is critical during the design of ice protection systems and critical structures that could be impacted by shed ice. \nTwo models (based on Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories respectively) were developed to predict the length of shed ice as it slides past the tip of the rotor blade due to the effect of centrifugal force. The failure mechanism of the ice was determined to be due to direct stresses created by the bending of the ice shape as it hangs over the rotor blade tip. These direct stresses exceeded the ultimate strength of the ice once the overhanging ice structure reached a critical length. An Euler-Bernoulli model for ultimate tensile strength failure was compared to a Timoshenko shear failure model. Comparison of the models confirmed failure due to direct tensile stress.\nGiven the large discrepancy of the reported values of ultimate tensile strength of ice found in literature, this value was experimentally measured in this research for impact ice shapes. The Pennsylvania State University's Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand (AERTS) was used to create ice at representative in-flight icing conditions. Such ice shapes were removed from the rotor and used to determine the tensile strength of impact ice. The ultimate tensile strength of impact ice was found to be 0.685 MPa with a relative standard deviation of 38%.\nThe same facility was used to conduct experiments to visualize ice sliding down the rotor blade upon shedding and the breaking up of the ice projectiles was quantified during rotation. The cross-section of the ice shapes was photographed prior to inducing shedding. These ice shape were then digitized and the second moments of area and centroid were found for the accreted ice shapes. Electro-thermal heaters were used to induce the accreted ice to shed during rotation and high-speed cameras were used to capture the breakup of ice as it traveled over the tip of the rotor. Quantification of the break lengths of the ice projectiles was obtained. Using the measured cross-sectional properties of the shed ice cross-sections and the ultimate tensile strength of ice experimentally quantified, the model was able to predict the break length within 11% of the experimentally measured lengths for the entire data set. Knowledge of the cross-sectional properties closer to the fracture face of the ice projectile results in predictions within 8.6% of the experimentally measured lengths as compared to 13% for cross-sectional properties estimated using the ice shape at the tip of the rotor blade.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13544], "author_name_tesi": "Schneeberger, Grant M", "last_name_ssi": "Schneeberger", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Grant", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Palacios", "Richard Randolph Auhl", "Philip John Morris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Palacios, Thesis Advisor", "Richard Randolph Auhl, Committee Member", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ice", "rotorcraft", "shedding"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Use of Spatial Statistics in Precipitation Climatology and Model Evaluation", "id": "24779", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10915", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A quantitative technique is developed which distinguishes different precipitation structures based on a small set of spatial statistics of the mesoscale reflectivity field.

RCS may be a useful trait for water and nutrient acquisition, particularly in edaphic stress conditions. \n\nRCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. As RCS progresses, less metabolic resources need to be invested in cortical maintenance, which could permit greater resource allocation to the growth of shoots, other roots, and reproduction.

Projected global warming over the coming century will result in oceanographic changes and acidification of the surface ocean. One way of better understanding the effects of climate on modern nannoplankton populations is to study their fossil record. \n\tIn this dissertation I present studies of three intervals from the geologic record: the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), the Eocene epoch, and the middle Miocene transition (MMT).

Reticulofenestra migrates from high latitudes to low latitudes with global cooling in the middle Eocene. The expansion of Reticulofenestra in the high latitudes coincides with a decline in thermal stratification and biological pumping efficiency, as indicated by vertical stable isotope gradients. We propose that warming in the early Eocene caused bottom waters to warm, which in turn led to a decrease in the vertical thermal gradient of the ocean and an increase in vertical mixing.\n\tDuring the PETM, the global nannoplankton response varies regionally. Nannofossil counts from several different PETM studies were combined into one large database for multivariate statistical analyses. In addition, we used GENIE modeling results from the PETM to estimate changes in the export production along with temperature proxies across the event. Nannoplankton ecology is reevaluated using more quantitative methods than have previously been applied. We find that the nannoplankton community structure changed across the PETM and these changes persisted even after the event.\n\tCooling during the MMT in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) impacted nannoplankton communities. Nannoplankton assemblage counts reveal an increase in equatorial productivity during the MMT and the Mi-3 glaciation. The change seen in the assemblage occurs concurrent with cooling as identified by benthic isotopes. This shows that high latitude forcing strengthened EEP upwelling. It is likely that Antarctic glaciation caused an increase in the latitudinal thermal gradient, intensifying wind patterns.\n\tThere are similarities in the response of nannoplankton to climate change in these studies. First, the amount of time the assemblage shift occurred over is proportional to the duration of climate change. Second, each study showed that there were long-term effects on the assemblage as a result of environmental change. Finally, in each instance there is evidence for an individualistic response of nannoplankton. These findings can be applied to modern nannoplankton in an effort to understand how climate will impact the community.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3759], "author_name_tesi": "Schneider, Leah Jill", "last_name_ssi": "Schneider", "middle_name_ssi": "Jill", "first_name_ssi": "Leah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lee Kump", "Timothy Bralower", "Lee Kump", "Timothy Bralower", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lee Kump, Dissertation Advisor", "Timothy Bralower, Dissertation Advisor", "Lee Kump, Committee Chair", "Timothy Bralower, Committee Chair", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY, Committee Member", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["calcareous nannoplankton", "geosciences", "paleoceanography", "Cenozoic"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF ANTIBODY SUBTYPES AND T LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION FOLLOWING VACCINATION OF HEALTHY FOALS AGAINST WEST NILE VIRUS", "id": "11536", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5284", "abstract_tesi": "West Nile Virus (WNV) was first identified in the United States in 1999 in several avian species, the natural host and transmitters of the virus.  Incidental infection can occur in horses, and , although infections are most often asymptomatic, neurological signs such as ataxia, hind limb paresis and muscle tremors can occur.  In severe cases, encephalitis, myelitis or death may occur.  Currently, the only significant protection against WNV infection in horses is through vaccination.  There are currently seven licensed vaccines on the market to protect horses against WNV infection. The first approved vaccine was an inactivated whole virus product but others include a modified live canarypox-vectored vaccine, a purified DNA plasmid vaccine, and several combination vaccines using both the whole killed and modified live viral products.  Combination vaccines have been made to protect horses from WNV and eastern/western encephalomyelitis, Venezuelan encephalomyelitis, and/or tetanus toxoid.  Much of the current research on equine immunity to WNV infection demonstrated that antibody was protective against infection.  Interestingly research has also shown that horses have more IgG isotypes than most other species which suggests that isotype variation may be important for an effective immune response in the horse.  Other studies showed that specific IgG subtypes should be targeted in the production of specific vaccines to maximize effector function.  However, there was a paucity of data to define the specific subtypes responsible for protection afforded by many of the current vaccines.  Also, little research has been conducted in horses to define specific cellular immune responses elicited in response to vaccination against WNV.  \n\tThere is a strong need to evaluate the current vaccines for efficacy so that future vaccines may be optimized to afford greater protection against WNV infection of horses with more effective vaccine protocols.  The aim of this study was to evaluate both the humoral and cellular immune responses elicited in Quarter Horse foals vaccinated with either the killed or modified live vectored vaccine with specific emphasis on T-cell activation and antibody subtype production.   Our results suggested that the killed vaccine produced a significantly higher antibody response in foals compared to the modified live vaccine for each subtype tested with the IgG(T) subtype having the highest titer followed by IgG(b) and IgG(a).\n\tAn assay for analysis of T- cell activation measured by interferon gamma production from peripheral blood lymphocytes in WNV-vaccinated foals was validated in this study.  Lymphocytes were isolated either by direct lysis of red blood cells or by ficoll gradient separation, and interferon gamma measured by RT-PCR. Phenotyping results of the peripheral blood lymphocytes showed comparable retention of T lymphocyte populations using either method of isolation.  Further research is needed to identify specific differences that may exist between the stimulation of the immune system.      \n\tThis research will benefit further investigations of immune activation following vaccination of horses for West Nile Virus infection and contribute to ongoing studies of the analysis of vaccine efficacy.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5261], "author_name_tesi": "Schneider, Rhiannon Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Schneider", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Rhiannon", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Avery August", "Avery August"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Avery August, Thesis Advisor", "Avery August, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Interferon gamma", "IgG", "West Nile Virus", "real time RT PCR"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Organic Classrooms: Rhetorical Education at the Highlander Folk School, 1932-1961\n", "id": "7568", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5504", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<i>Organic Classrooms: Rhetorical Education at the Highlander Folk School, 1932-1961</i> evaluates the programs taught at one of the twentieth century\u2019s most controversial educational institutions.

I used stand structural analysis and reconstructed fire regime characteristics to determine the relationship between fire regimes and forest structure (i.e. age, size, composition, and spatial patterning) at the plot scale.  The structure and composition of the contemporary forest varied spatially with several environmental factors (i.e. slope aspect, TRMI, elevation), although there were no significant differences in fire regime parameters across environmental gradients and forest compositional groups.  The contemporary forest was significantly different from the reconstructed forest in basal area, density and mean diameter.  The contemporary forest was denser, contained more basal area, but the mean diameter decreased due to the infilling of younger trees since fire suppression.  In addition, the majority of the increased density in the forest was due to increases in the number of fire intolerant species (e.g. white fir, incense cedar).  The spatial pattern of trees in the contemporary forest also changed from the reconstructed forest with a smaller number of plots demonstrating a clustering of trees of similar ages.  Several fire regime parameters varied at the study area scale (extent, severity).  Fires of all sizes were present in the study area, although the majority of the fires were < 250 ha in size.  There was also a combination of low to moderate severity fires, with no evidence of high severity fires occurring.  The relationship between fires and changing climate conditions was assessed by comparing the occurrence and extent of fires with several climate variables (e.g. Palmer Drought Severity Index, temperature).  Strong relationships between climate variability and fire occurrence and extent were identified at both the interannual and interdecadal scale.  At the interannual scale fire extent was linked to regional drought.  At the interdecadal scale, fire occurrence and extent was significantly correlated with distinct phases of several interhemispheric climate patterns (e.g. El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation), in addition to interactions between the climate patterns.  The influence of fire regimes and forest structure on carbon sequestration was assessed by calculating the total biomass and carbon levels for both the reconstructed and contemporary forest.  Total carbon storage increased significantly due to fire suppression.  However, the location of the carbon in the forest changed due to the changing structure of the contemporary forest.  More carbon was stored in smaller trees established since fire suppression, and fire intolerant species (white fir, incense cedar) stored a significantly greater amount of carbon than in the reconstructed forest.  The results of this study indicate that there was a high degree of variability in forest structure and composition in the study areas, however, not all of the variability was related to fire regime characteristics.  The influence of fire on the forest structure and carbon sequestration also varied over time, due to changing climate conditions.  In addition, the significant role fire played in the historic forest structure is apparent from the high degree of change that occurred due to the removal of fire from the system for over 100 years.  Contemporary mixed conifer forests in Yosemite National Park are much denser and homogeneous than historic forests.     \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [110], "author_name_tesi": "Scholl, Andrew E", "last_name_ssi": "Scholl", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan H Taylor", "Robert P Brooks", "Andrew Mark Carleton", "Eric S Post"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan H Taylor, Committee Chair", "Robert P Brooks, Committee Member", "Andrew Mark Carleton, Committee Member", "Eric S Post, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fire climate interactions", "forest dynamics", "vegetation change", "fire history", "carbon sequestration", "fire suppression"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Sawing and Drying of Hardwood Lumber from Small Diameter Logs", "id": "7148", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4366", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With high stumpage prices, each year sawmills are processing more and more smaller diameter hardwood logs.

Drying was conducted through the use of a conventional kiln drying schedule and two modified kiln schedules designed to dry the lumber under milder drying conditions compared to the conventional kiln schedule. The first modified kiln schedule lowered the final dry bulb settings, while the second decreased the initial and final dry bulb settings.  Modifications were made to the conventional kiln schedules published in the Dry Kiln Operators Manual but maintained comparable equilibrium moisture content (EMC) conditions for drying steps of the conventional kiln schedules.

This has happened both because writing pedagogy in EFL settings is often seen as no more than a imported ESL teaching methods which have been adapted to local practical limitations, such as a lack of textbooks and other resources, and ideological constraints, such as exam-driven cultures and a perception that writing is secondary to the teaching of other language skills (Leki, 2001).  Yet research in international writing instruction can bring scholarly attention to important factors in writing pedagogy which might otherwise be overlooked, in particular the influence of institutional practices and regulations (Cimasko & Reichelt, 2011), and in so doing, can help scholars question their assumptions about writing instruction (Donahue & Anson, 2015).\n This study examines in depth two contexts of EFL writing instruction, the English departments of two universities in Serbia, with a focus on how teachers negotiate between multiple rhetorical and education traditions based on their own conceptions of writing, the needs and expectations of the students, and the positioning of English language writing within the educational institution and the community. Employing ethnographic data collection methods and using cultural historical activity theory (Engestr\u00f6m, 1987) as an analytical framework, this one-semester case study draws on classroom observations, interviews, and textual artifacts. This study first examines three factors which shape EFL writing instruction in these contexts: the overall curricular objectives, a contrastive rhetoric ideology, and the role of foreign lectors, tracing how each factor is a reflection of multiple scale-levels (Blommaert, 2010) from local to global.

High strain rate properties of materials are often difficult and expensive to obtain. There is a growing interest in the high strain rate behavior of metallic materials. A finite element model of a metallic ring under high strain rate loading was developed using the Johnson-Cook constitutive material model in Abaqus CAE. High strain rate properties of AISI 4340 and HF-1 steel were used for the analysis. The finite element model was coupled with the split Hopkinson pressure bar technique, along with a novel experimental method of characterization. The ring was modeled both axisymmetrically and in 3D to help ensure accuracy in results. Failure was determined by defining a failure strain to start the process of element deletion. Failure strain in the FEA was adjusted to induce failure in the ring. It was found that element deletion would occur when the failure strain was below 1x10-5.Results of both axisymmetric and 3D were found to be within 3% of each other with respect to maximum von Mises stress, and failure modes were identical.

Providing high quality pasture is of critical importance to all dairy producers but is especially imperative to organic dairy producers because of the grazing requirement defined by the National Organic Program. Due to the grazing requirement for organic production, most organic producers purchase grain instead of producing it on farm. In recent years the cost of organic milk has been stable while grain prices are growing substantially, leading to shrinking profit margins for organic dairies. Intensifying production on organic dairy farms by growing more energy dense feeds would reduce the amount of feed purchased and potentially improve net returns. This research hypothesized that rotating annual pastures with corn silage will increase the energy content of feed produced on farm while retaining available pasture and, consequently, improve farm profitability.\nFor the annual pastures, this study examined warm-season annual grasses. Warm-season annual grasses have attributes that make them ideal for dairy operations. They are drought resistant, are most productive in the summer when cool-season production declines, they establish rapidly and have high quality. Furthermore, they offer producers more flexibility than perennial pastures. While warm-season annuals are growing in popularity in the United States, there is still a dearth of information concerning their performance under pasture management and in mixed stands. \n\nThis research had two main parts; the first part compared the performance of monocultures and mixes of warm-season annual pastures and the second part compared a cool-season perennial pasture system to an annual pasture rotated to corn silage system. The objectives of the first research area were to compare yield, forage quality, and pasture composition between the warm-season annual pastures, and with a cool-season perennial pasture. The objectives of the second research area were 1) to determine the effects of annual pastures on corn silage yield, 2) to compare the total rotation yield of two years of established perennial pastures and annual pasture rotated to corn silage, and 3) to examine how annual pasture rotated to corn silage affects net returns compared to a perennial pasture system. \nThe warm-season annual grasses examined were teff (Eragrostis tef) and sorghum-sudangrass (Sorghum x drummondii) in monoculture and mixes of two and three species with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.). A red clover monoculture was treated as an annual cool-season pasture. A mixture of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L) and red clover served as a cool-season perennial pasture point of comparison. \n\nWithin the warm-season annual pastures there were few differences in yield and quality but, in general, the monocultures and the mix of the two warm-season annuals yielded best and the pastures with sorghum-sudangrass had the best quality. Yields ranged from 6800 kg/ha to 5300 kg/ha for the warm-season pastures. When comparing the warm-season annual pastures with established cool-season perennial pasture, the warm-season annuals yielded higher in the summer and the warm-season pastures that did not include red clover also yielded higher in fall. The sorghum-sudangrass monoculture had the lowest proportion of weeds, a seasonal mean of 100 g/kg dry matter, in the stand compared to the other warm-season pastures. The warm-season pastures that did not include sorghum-sudangrass had high weed pressure during establishment, indicating teff establishes more slowly and is more sensitive to weed invasion early in the season. The established cool-season perennial pasture was better at suppressing weeds than the warm-season pastures; however during establishment the red clover had the highest proportion of weeds. Quality between the warm and cool-season pastures was similar for most measures analyzed but the warm-season pastures did have higher neutral detergent fiber digestibility. Overall, this experiment showed that both sorghum-sudangrass and teff are high yielding and have good forage quality but sorghum-sudangrass may be more competitive with weeds, which is especially important for organic producers. \n\nAnnual pastures were determined to have no effect on the following corn silage. Total rotation yield, which ranged from 16,500 kg/ha to 19,200 kg/ha, also did not differ between annual pasture treatments. Furthermore, at 15,700 kg/ha, the two years of established cool-season perennial pasture did not yield differently from the annual systems. A partial budget analysis was performed to identify differences in net returns between the annual and perennial systems over four years and eight years. Excluding the red clover monoculture, over four years the annual systems resulted in higher net returns compared to the perennial system, and had annual net differences that could be expected to consistently return higher profits compared to the perennial system. Over eight years, not all of the annual treatments had positive net returns. Both warm-season monocultures and the sorghum-sudangrass mixes with red clover and teff had annual net returns large enough that they are anticipated to yield higher net returns than the perennial system over eight years. Thus, this research found that annual pastures do not affect subsequent corn silage yield and that warm-season annual pastures rotated with corn silage may produce higher net returns compared to a perennial pasture system.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10304], "author_name_tesi": "Schrenker, Denyse ", "last_name_ssi": "Schrenker", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Denyse", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marvin H Hall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marvin H Hall, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["forages", "organic dairy", "organic production", "warm-season grasses", "profitability"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Material Witnesses: A Feminist Disability Theory of Testimonial Voices\n\n", "id": "10851", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "394", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although Western philosophies of communication and testimony claim to focus only on the content and meaning of given communications, I argue that these conceptions are based on an epistemic standard that privileges clear-and-distinct speech over other spoken or communicated expressions. I refer to this standard as \u201carticulateness,\u201d and show that this standard is taken to be the measure of epistemic credibility on the part of speakers. This illusory standard has profound effects on the legitimacy of non-articulate testimonies, leading to their exclusions from the epistemologies of testimony and other social-political spheres such as courtrooms, classrooms, and parliaments. Those who have non-articulate voices include primarily, but is not limited to, those who have communication difficulties, such as stutters, cerebral palsy, deafness, autism, thoracic weakness, cleft palates, paralysis, and cognitive disabilities. The failure to have a more inclusive model of testimony is revealed by reflecting on the phenomenon of bodily self-control that is expected of fully rational knowers. Articulateness is a social and epistemic problem that emerges from carnal presuppositions that privilege and normalize able-bodiedness as a precondition for the credible witness. In examining accounts of non-articulate witnesses, I stress the need for a model of inclusive testimony.\n\nThis dissertation is organized as follows: In chapter 2, I provide an overview of two major philosophers whose views on speaking and communicating have had profound effect on Western philosophy (Aristotle and Locke). This investigation seeks to establish (1) that logos is rooted in materially clear-and-distinct speech, and (2) that modern theory of communication established in part by Locke is based on a code of intelligibility that has normative carnal presuppositions about credible speech. In chapter 3 and chapter 4, I demonstrate how current models of testimonial credibility (i.e. contemporary analytic epistemology of testimony and feminist epistemology) are called into question by the existence of materially non-articulate voices. Current theories on testimonial credibility do not have the means to fully include non-articulate voices unless they undertake to revise the normative carnal presuppositions inherent in their ontological approaches to epistemology. In chapter 5, I adopt an alternate ontology of materiality proposed by neo-materialist feminism and suggest a model for communication based on the concept of testimonial voice not as speech but as \u201ccommunicability.\u201d In my conclusion, I outline some possibilities for assessing testimony through communicability in ways that at once include a wider variety of voices but also avoids a valueless relativism.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [389], "author_name_tesi": "Schriempf, Alexa ", "last_name_ssi": "Schriempf", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alexa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Shannon Sullivan", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Vincent M Colapietro", "John Philip Christman", "Jennifer Mensch", "Susan Merrill Squier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Shannon Sullivan, Dissertation Advisor", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Committee Chair", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Jennifer Mensch, Committee Member", "Susan Merrill Squier, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neo-materialist feminism", "testimony", "epistemology", "disability"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Consolation of Narrative: Figural Selves from Augustine to Thomas More", "id": "10710", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "960", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Augustine\u2019s Confessiones and De Civitate Dei served medieval Christendom as canonical autobiography and historiography, respectively.  Both works present variations upon a single narrative model derived from sacred history.  First, events foreshadow a climactic revelation which, when it comes, provides a summary meaning to history.  Then a posthistorical space follows, in which the implications of that climax are tentatively interpreted and performed.  Thus the narrative ends in anticlimax or lack of closure, not the triumphalism of a Eusebian historiography or a saint\u2019s life.  If an end-stopped, triumphalist narrative generates fixed meaning, an Augustinian narrative produces consolation in the absence of meaning because authoritative sacred metanarrative predicts such absence.  Following Augustine\u2019s example, important medieval narrative structures of the self (Abelard\u2019s Historia calamitatum, Chaucer\u2019s Knight\u2019s Tale, Langland\u2019s Piers Plowman, and More\u2019s Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation) use the anticlimactic structure of sacred history in order to provide consolation for their own lack of closure.  This consolation arises from grounding the meaningless autonomies of their characters in inscrutable transcendence and from exploring a previous climactic moment through a provisional authorship.  In short, this dissertation chronicles the role of the literary use of sacred history in the late classical and medieval construction of narratival selfhood and identity.\nThis dissertation contributes primarily to three important discussions in medieval studies.  First, it provides partial motivation for the frequent lack of resolution in medieval narrative form.  By grounding itself in a posthistory governed by indiscernible divine form, medieval Augustinian narrative recontextualizes the formal problem of closure within religious culture.  Second, it identifies a distinctively Augustinian narrative consolation that supplements Boethius\u2019s Consolation of Philosophy, dominant in the medieval period.  The linearity of Augustine\u2019s sacred history up to conversion or incarnation provides an authoritative narrative absent from Boethius\u2019s strictly philosophical resources.  The authority of a climactic event enables Augustine\u2019s return from that event into a posthistory where it can be re-performed.  Third, its analysis of allusive narratives contributes to the history of medieval exegesis and hermeneutics.  A figural telling of one\u2019s own story, or the story of another person, is also a reading of individual and sacred history.  The texts this project will examine are already provisional interpretive responses to the sacred narrative.  However, they exemplify specifically literary interpretation, outside the usual functions of church hierarchy.  As neither strictly sacred nor secular narratives because they interpret both sacred (biblical) and secular (individual) history, they offer unique opportunities to examine the competition and fusion of various interpretive techniques in the medieval period.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [953], "author_name_tesi": "Schrock, Chad David", "last_name_ssi": "Schrock", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Chad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert R Edwards", "Robert R Edwards", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt", "Patrick G Cheney", "Benjamin Thomas Hudson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert R Edwards, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert R Edwards, Committee Chair", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt, Committee Member", "Patrick G Cheney, Committee Member", "Benjamin Thomas Hudson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["consolation", "narrative", "history of exegesis", "Augustine", "figural interpretation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Fighting and Dying for One's Country: Nationalism, International Conflict, and Globalization", "id": "11364", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2112", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Scholars and laypeople alike often consider nationalism to be a primarily destructive phenomenon because it supposedly has the potential to promote extremely violent international conflict and other atrocities.  By glorifying the history, myths, and attributes of a national group while marginalizing or dehumanizing excluded groups, nationalism creates unbridgeable differences, irresolvable animosities, and perceived existential threats conducive to the outbreak of violence.  \n\nDespite this argument\u2019s widespread acceptance, the extant literature does not adequately theorize about or assess the relationship between nationalism and violent international conflict.  Theorization has focused almost exclusively on the association between nationalism and the incidence of interstate violence, preventing the formulation of a comprehensive theory regarding nationalism\u2019s impact on international conflict behavior.  Furthermore, any insights derived from existing theories are dubious because they are supported mainly on the basis of a nonrandom sample of case studies.  \n\nMy dissertation addresses these problems in the literature.  I first develop a comprehensive theory of the relationship between nationalism and international conflict behavior, specifically in terms of war initiation, severity, and duration.  I argue that, in order to obtain mass cooperation, political elites embed their goals and the related policies in nationalist rhetoric and images.  However, these \u201cnationalist persuasion campaigns\u201d can result in several mechanisms that promote long and deadly international conflict.  Nationalism can provoke \u201cnational enemies\u201d and their foreign allies, generate biased strategic assumptions, create domestic interest groups that favor war, permit the suppression of opposition groups, and promote \u201cnationalist bidding wars\u201d that bring about unexpectedly more aggressive military policies.  It is possible that these mechanisms affect international conflict behavior to varying degrees depending on the form of nationalism present in a particular state.  Therefore, I construct a series of hypotheses regarding the effect of four types of nationalism on three facets of international conflict behavior. \n\nIn order to assess the accuracy of my argument and move beyond the qualitative techniques that have limited generalizability, I use original data on the existence and type of state-level nationalism from 1816 to 1991 and quantitative analysis (namely, summary statistics, cross-tabulations, and specialized regression models).  I find that nationalism contributes to the initiation of more deadly conflicts, but not necessarily to longer wars.  Nationalism significantly increases both the probability that a state will initiate an interstate war and the number of battle deaths the war will cause.   There is greater uncertainty surrounding the effect of nationalism on interstate war duration.   Nationalism in the initiator significantly decreases the length of war, while nationalism in the target significantly increases it, though only during the twentieth century.  None of nationalism\u2019s subtypes has an unambiguous effect on international conflict behavior that is consistent with the expected pattern of violent conflict.  \n\nGiven that nationalism encouraged the initiation of more lethal conflicts from 1816 to 1991, one may suspect that the international community might not have to concern itself as much in the future with the violent ramifications of nationalism due to increasing globalization.  Yet, the empirical evidence described in the last part of my dissertation shows that this is not the case; national attachment and pride are still ubiquitous among individuals in more developed countries, due to perceived unsatisfactory economic conditions.  Political leaders and the global community in general must then be cognizant of nationalism\u2019s potentially violent consequences and support efforts to combat its divisiveness and prevent the accession of extreme-right parties.  Otherwise, the possibility of extremely violent nationalist conflict and the ensuing human suffering remains. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2093], "author_name_tesi": "Schrock-Jacobson, Gretchen Ursula", "last_name_ssi": "Schrock-Jacobson", "middle_name_ssi": "Ursula", "first_name_ssi": "Gretchen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas William Lemke", "Douglas William Lemke", "David Scott Bennett Jr.", "Burt Monroe Iii", "Catherine Wanner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas William Lemke, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas William Lemke, Committee Chair", "David Scott Bennett Jr., Committee Member", "Burt Monroe Iii, Committee Member", "Catherine Wanner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nationalism", "interstate conflict", "globalization"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Developmental Trends, Processes, and Associations between Children's Gender Understanding and Felt Pressure to Conform to Gender Roles", "id": "13570kms676", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13570", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although many theories of gender development place emphasis on children\u2019s cognitions as a precursor to gendered behaviors and attitudes, few researchers have attempted to examine children\u2019s explicit access to and the content of their gender cognitions.

Seventy-seven children between the ages of six and 12 years (Mage = 9.03 years; 48% girls) were interviewed about their understanding of gender. The interview, presented in both open-ended and forced-choice formats, was designed to tap three specific facets of children\u2019s gender cognitions, namely: (1) definitions of gender category labels, (2) the prescriptive nature of gender, and (3) the origins of gender differences in behavior. The current study also measured children\u2019s felt pressure to conform to traditional gender roles, as it was hypothesized to be associated with children\u2019s understanding of gender. To measure potential precursors and outcomes related to felt pressure, parents responded to questions about their gender socialization strategies and opinions. Children responded to vignettes about their peers\u2019 sexist comments and behaviors. \n\tData showed that younger children defined gender labels by external traits (appearance and behaviors) more than did older children. Additionally, when asked about the origins of gender differences, younger children were more likely to agree with biological reasons than were older children. Contrary to hypotheses, younger children were also more likely to agree that gender differences were the result of socialization and expectations about future roles than were older children. Findings showed substantial support for hypotheses related to the processes surrounding children\u2019s experiences of felt pressure to conform to traditional gender roles. Specifically, parents\u2019 more egalitarian socialization strategies were related to children\u2019s lower levels of felt pressure, and children\u2019s lower levels of felt pressure were related to more frequent confrontation of peers\u2019 sexist comments and behaviors. Data also showed that felt pressure was associated with children\u2019s gender cognitions.

Differential rates of political participation are an important way in which political inequality is generated in modern democracies, yet we know little about how socioeconomic inequality influences the social context in which citizens act politically.  A large literature on democratization argues that inequality erodes the sense of commonality and mutual trust that underpins democratic self-governance, and there is some evidence that inequality lowers rates of political participation even in modern democratic societies.  But these claims have recently been contradicted by other researchers who claim that inequality fosters the sort of conflict and debate on which democracy thrives.  \n\nI propose that these two opposing literatures can be reconciled by attending to the scale at which inequality exists.  Inequality among close neighbors might lower participation by reducing interpersonal trust and the opportunities for political discussion, inequality among people in different neighborhoods might instead increase participation by heightening political conflict, and inequality among people in different counties might reduce participation rates by undermining the feeling of consensus and shared fate on which democratic governance rests.  I attempt to unravel this complex dynamic with measures of economic segregation, created by decomposing total inequality into three portions: inequality across counties and within states; inequality across neighborhoods and within counties; and inequality across individuals within neighborhoods.  I then link these measures to individual-level survey data from the American National Election Studies and the Roper Social and Political Trends dataset.\n\nContrary to my suppositions, inequality among close neighbors increases voter registration while decreasing participation in endeavors other than political campaigns.  Furthermore, these effects are particularly strong among low-income people, thus altering income differences in participation rates.

As a consequence, gas turbines run at high turbine inlet temperatures that require sophisticated cooling technologies to ensure survival of turbine components.  One such technology is film cooling with shaped holes, where air is withdrawn from latter stages of the compressor, is bypassed around the combustor, and is eventually ejected out holes in turbine component surfaces.  Air ejected from these shaped holes helps maintain components at temperatures lower than flow from the combustor.  Many studies have investigated different factors that influence shaped hole performance.  However, no studies in open literature have investigated how cooling performance is affected by roughness along interior walls of the shaped hole.  The effect of in-hole roughness on shaped hole film cooling was the focus of this research.\n    Investigation of in-hole roughness effects first required the determination of behavior for a shaped hole with smooth walls.  A public shaped hole, now used by other investigators as well, was designed with a diffused outlet having 7 degree expansion angles and an area ratio of 2.5.  At low freestream turbulence intensity of 0.5%, film cooling adiabatic effectiveness for this smooth hole was found to peak at a blowing ratio of 1.5.  Measurements of flowfields and thermal fields revealed causes of this behavior.  Blowing ratio increases above 1.5 caused the jet from the smooth hole to penetrate higher into the surrounding mainstream, exhibit a stronger counter-rotating vortex pair, and have narrower contact with the wall than at lower blowing ratios.  Experiments performed at high freestream turbulence intensity of 13% revealed dynamics of how freestream turbulence both diluted and laterally spread coolant.  At the high blowing ratio of 3 the dilution and spreading were competing effects, such that elevated freestream turbulence did not cause a decrease in area-averaged effectiveness.  At the blowing ratio of 1.5, high freestream turbulence caused area-averaged effectiveness to decrease 17% relative to the low freestream turbulence case.\n    Film cooling performance was measured for the shaped hole geometry with several different configurations of in-hole roughness.  At low freestream turbulence intensity, in-hole roughness caused decreases in area-averaged adiabatic effectiveness up to 61% relative to the smooth hole performance.  These percent decreases in adiabatic effectiveness were more severe with increasing roughness levels and with increasing blowing ratios.  Flowfield and thermal field measurements for the configuration with largest roughness size showed that the decrease in adiabatic effectiveness for rough holes as compared to smooth holes was due to thicker boundary layers along the interior walls of the cooling holes.  The thicker boundary layers resulted in faster jet core flow, which in turn caused increased penetration of coolant into the mainstream and increased turbulence intensity inside the jet, with both leading to reduced adiabatic effectiveness.  Detrimental effects of in-hole roughness persisted at the high freestream turbulence conditions as well.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11286], "author_name_tesi": "Schroeder, Robert Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Schroeder", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole", "Karen Ann Thole", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Stephen P Lynch", "Brent Craven", "James Heidmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Chair", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Stephen P Lynch, Committee Member", "Brent Craven, Committee Member", "James Heidmann, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["film cooling", "rough wall", "gas turbine heat transfer", "detached jet", "shaped hole", "viscous sublayer"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Radar Observations of Dendritic Growth Zones in Colorado Winter Storms\n", "id": "24979", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11253", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "X-band polarimetric radar observations of winter storms in northeastern Colorado on 20-21 February, 9 March, and 9 April 2013 are examined.

Recent data suggest that avoidance of the taste cue occurs because the rewarding properties of the saccharin are devalued in anticipation of the availability of the more rewarding drug of abuse. This \u2018reward comparison\u2019 paradigm serves as the first and only model of devaluation of natural rewards by drugs of abuse. Interestingly, while drug-induced suppression of saccharin intake is a robust phenomenon, clear individual differences have emerged. Indeed, approximately half of the Sprague-Dawley rats greatly avoid intake of the saccharin cue following taste-drug pairings (referred to as the large suppressers), while the other half of the rats (referred to as the small suppressers) do not. In addition, greater avoidance of the saccharin cue by the large suppressers is associated with greater saccharin cue induced elevations in circulating corticosterone (CORT) at test and, importantly, with greater cocaine self-administration behavior, as well. Although it is clear that humans also exhibit individual differences in the susceptibility to drug-taking behavior, it is not clear what mediates these differences in behavior or what factors contribute to the transition from recreational use to addiction. It is possible that individual vulnerability to addiction is mediated, in part, by greater drug craving or withdrawal when presented with conditioned drug cues. In the present paradigm, it is hypothesized that greater avoidance of the saccharin cue reflects better learning of the taste cue-drug association and this learning is facilitated by increased circulating levels of CORT. The present set of experiments addressed this hypothesis by employing behavioral and genetic methods to examine the nature of the differences observed in the large and small suppressers. The first few sets of experiments were designed not only to evaluate the nature of the CORT response in the phenomenon but also to determine whether the unconditioned CORT response to cocaine can predict which rats will go on to become large or small suppressers. The results of these experiments support the conclusion that greater elevations in both the conditioned and uncondtioned CORT response are associated not only with greater cocaine self-administration behavior but also with greater suppression in saccharin intake. Thus, higher levels of circulating CORT result in being more prone to drug-taking behavior and subsequent devaluation of a naturally rewarding saccharin solution. In a separate experiment, the general preference for sweets was tested for its predictive value in our paradigm. Greater intake of sucrose, however, was not associated with greater cocaine-induced avoidance of saccharin intake. The second set of experiments was designed to determine the extent to which genetic background would influence responsiveness to cocaine and subsequent devaluation of the saccharin reward. The results of a three generation selective breeding study revealed significant differences in the large and small suppresser lines by the second generation, suggesting that genetic makeup alone can influence behavior in the reward comparison paradigm. This conclusion was supported by the results of the final experiment that tested several inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6Ibg, DBA/2Ibg, and Sv129Ibg) in the reward comparison model that revealed significant strain differences in saccharin intake behavior. Taken together, these findings support that individual differences in cocaine-induced avoidance of saccharin intake are mediated by differences in genetic makeup, CORT, and learning (i.e., conditioning).  Implications of these findings for drug addiction are discussed.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4902], "author_name_tesi": "Schroy, Pearl Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Schroy", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Pearl", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Matthew Mc Echron", "Ralph Norgren", "Richard Radcliffe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson, Committee Chair", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Matthew Mc Echron, Committee Member", "Ralph Norgren, Committee Member", "Richard Radcliffe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cocaine", "drug abuse", "addiction", "individual differences", "saccharin", "taste", "reward comparison", "corticosterone", "inbred mouse strains", "selective breeding", "conditioned taste avoidance", "conditioned taste aversion", "anticipatory contrast", "self-administration", "sucrose", "conditioning"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF THE EXPRESSION AND REGULATION OF VEGF AND 4E-BP1 IN THE RETINA DURING DIABETES AND UNDER HYPERGLYCEMIC CONDITIONS\n", "id": "9549", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6230", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among working-age adults, occurring in the majority of individuals who have had diabetes for twenty or more years.  Among the causes implicated in the development of diabetic retinopathy, increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in the development of both abnormal neovascularization increased vascular permeability of nascent retinal vessels.  Currently, the only treatment for diabetic retinopathy is laser-mediated ablation of the peripheral retina.  Because this treatment results in permanent laser scars and is only effective in completely relieving the neovascularization in half of the patients undergoing the procedure, subsequent treatments are often required.  This leads to a reduction in peripheral vision, night vision, and color detection.  Additionally, this procedure only relieves the symptoms, but does not approach the molecular basis behind the disease.  Therefore alternate molecular approaches to treatment are required.  \nThe first aim of this project was to define the time course of VEGF protein upregulation in the retina of diabetic rats to better understand the early progression of the disease.  Retinas were isolated from rats 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks after streptozotocin (STZ) treatment and assessed for VEGF mRNA and protein expression.  VEGF protein, but not mRNA expression was upregulated after 2 weeks of diabetes, and was returned to control levels after 12 weeks.  The absence of a change in the expression of VEGF mRNA suggested a post-transcriptional mechanism for upregulated protein expression.  The VEGF mRNA is complex and contains multiple elements that allow for translational control, including a uORF, 5 initiation codons, and 2 internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs).  VEGF IRES utilization in response to cell stress has been well documented, but the factors involved in its utilization have not been identified.  Therefore, the expression of proteins involved in translational control was evaluated.  Eukaryotic initiation factor-4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), a key repressor of translation initiation, was upregulated following the same time course as VEGF protein expression.  Altered expression of 4E-BP1 correlated with increased sequestration of eIF4E, the mRNA cap-binding protein, an event that would be expected to repress global rates of mRNA translation.  Ablation of 4E-BP1/2 in mice prevented the diabetes-induced increase in VEGF, suggesting that 4E-BP1 is required in this process. \nThe second aim was designed to delineate the mechanism by which 4E-BP1 expression is increased in M\u00fcller cells exposed to hyperglycemic conditions. 4E-BP1 expression was maximally increased in the absence of a change in its mRNA after exposure to hyperglycemic conditions for 10 hours.  Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) results in release from eIF4E and targets the protein for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.  Analysis of the retinal lysates revealed a decrease in the relative phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on T37/46.  O-GlcNAcylation of 4E-BP1 was increased, which, unlike phosphorylation, does not interfere with the ability of 4E-BP1 to bind to eIF4E.  O-GlcNAcylation of 4E-BP1 did, however, interfere with its ubiquitination, which would be expected to contribute to the stabilization and increased expression of the protein under hyperglycemic conditions.\nOverall the data are consistent with a model in which hyperglycemia-induced O-GlcNAcylation decreases the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of 4E-BP1.  This leads to increased expression of 4E-BP1 and sequestration of eIF4E, which would be expected to repress cap-dependent translation, making complex mRNAs and those that can be translated cap-independently more competitive for translation, including the mRNA encoding VEGF.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6221], "author_name_tesi": "Schrufer, Tabitha Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Schrufer", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Tabitha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Scot R Kimball", "David A Antonetti", "Yuguang Shi", "Williard M Freeman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Committee Chair", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "David A Antonetti, Committee Member", "Yuguang Shi, Committee Member", "Williard M Freeman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["VEGF", "4E-BP1", "diabetic retinopathy", "diabetes", "retina", "translational control"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Role of linker DNA length and linker histone occupancy in chromatin compaction", "id": "26453", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11230", "abstract_tesi": "Chromatin condensation underlies many important biological processes such as cell differentiation, cell division and senescence. In this work, reconstituted nucleosomal arrays with various DNA linkers were constructed and used in combination with electron microscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation to investigate the internal organization of condensed chromatin in vitro and the effects of linker histone levels on chromatin folding. The internucleosomal interaction pattern within reconstituted chromatin is shown to closely resemble that obtained with chromatin fixed in situ, suggesting that the reconstituted arrays correctly recapitulate the nucleosome folding in living cells. A negative correlation between nucleosome repeat length (NRL) and chromatin folding was consistently observed for chromatin arrays with parallel nucleosome interaction faces. For arrays with shorter NRLs, chromatin folding showed a strong rotational periodicity, whereas folding in arrays with longer NRLs was unaffected by internucleosomal rotational changes. Our data is also consistent with results of mesoscopic modeling predicting that in condensed chromatin, nucleosome association with linker histone that triggers linker DNA crossing (\u201cstem\u201d formation) tends to maintain the two-start zigzag topology despite generation of metastable interdigitated forms without a distinct fiber diameter. Furthermore, in chromatin arrays with sub-saturated ratios of linker histone, a tendency toward stronger long-range nucleosome interactions is observed, similar to that revealed in condensed metaphase chromosomes in situ. Taken together, these observations suggest that condensed chromatin preserves zigzag features and is compacted via processes that promote formation of multiple loops and bundles of the nucleosome zigzag chain, rather than longitudinal compaction into regular 30 nm fibers. Such looped chromatin forms could be modulated by the ratio of linker histone and histone charge modifications, thereby altering global and local and global chromatin architecture.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10773], "author_name_tesi": "Schubert, Michael Bruce", "last_name_ssi": "Schubert", "middle_name_ssi": "Bruce", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sergei A Grigoryev", "Laura Carrel", "Gregory Steven Yochum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sergei A Grigoryev, Thesis Advisor", "Laura Carrel, Thesis Advisor", "Gregory Steven Yochum, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chromatin", "chromatin structure", "nucleosome", "linker histone", "analytical ultracentrifugation", "electron microscopy", "EMANIC"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF THE RECOVERY OF CALCAREOUS NANNOPLANKTON AND PLANKTONIC FORAMINIFERA FROM THE CRETACEOUS/PALEOGENE (K/P) MASS EXTINCTION\n", "id": "10281", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2639", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/P) bolide impact decimated surface ocean ecosystems.

This study utilizes multivariate analysis on abundance counts from five sites with wide global distribution to compare the recoveries of these calcareous plankton groups.  The analysis shows there is a distinct geographical differentiation in the recovery of both groups, with assemblages in the northern hemisphere surface oceans diversifying more slowly than southern hemisphere surface oceans.  This is most likely a result of higher extinction intensity caused by the concentration of dust created by the bolide impact in the northern hemisphere.  The multivariate analysis results suggest a probable long-term influence on the post-extinction marine ecosystem was increased nutrient concentration in the surface ocean resulting from the collapse of the biological pump.  Nannoplankton recover before planktonic foraminifera in the open ocean, as expected, but after planktonic foraminifera on the shelf.  Dinoflagellates, which were common at many shelf locations across the K/P boundary may have provided another food source for planktonic foraminifera and hindered nannoplankton diversification by invading niche space emptied by the K/P extinction.

However, the long-term impacts on marine phytoplankton are uncertain, especially concerning extinction risk and how communities will recover when faced with large-scale extinction.  Calcareous nannoplankton, an important group of eukaryotic phytoplankton, are especially at risk given their sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions and susceptibility to ocean acidification.  Nannoplankton have an extensive and detailed fossil record dating to the Mesozoic and can be used to investigate how phytoplankton have responded to past environmental and ecological perturbations.  This focuses on the fossil record of nannoplankton to understand the relationship between climate change and nannoplankton extinction and how nannoplankton communities recover following mass extinction.\n\t\nThe Probable Datum Method (PDM) presented in Chapter 1 estimates the age of origination or extinction of nannoplankton.  Comparisons of origination or extinction between locations can be complicated by inter-site differences in abundance or preservation.  The PDM models preservation and counting, two processes that can lead to misinterpretation of first and last appearances of a taxon in the fossil record, to estimate the true age of origination or extinction.  The PDM allows for interpretation of origination and extinction between locations that lessens errors common in such comparisons and strengthens conclusions made on global-scale patterns of origination and extinction.\n\t\nIn Chapter 2, the evolutionary recovery of nannoplankton from the Cretaceous/Paleogene mass extinction is investigated.  Many new Paleogene taxa are determined to have originated first in the North Pacific Ocean and were restricted there for tens to hundreds of thousands of years.  Survivors of the event quickly expanded in the Southern Hemisphere and established localized incumbent assemblages.  This limited diversification in the Southern Hemisphere and acted as a biologic barrier to the dispersal of new species.  Most importantly, this chapter shows how some species of phytoplankton can act as a biologic barrier to the dispersal of others.  Therefore, incumbent competition is as important in nannoplankton as it is in higher groups, which has never been clearly shown before.\n\t\nIn Chapter 3, the extinction of the nannoplankton genus Discoaster in the Pleistocene is investigated.  There was an overall increase in climatic variability and a decrease in ocean stratification from the Pliocene and into the Pleistocene that may have contributed to the extinction of the genus.  The ecology of Discoaster is determined using multivariate analysis. This analysis shows a possible ecological correspondence between Discoaster and the extant genus Florisphaera, which today is most abundant in deep waters.  Therefore, Discoaster may have preferred the lower photic zone of warm, stratified watermasses.  Discoaster\u2019s abundance is tied to changes in climate variability, temperature and productivity.  These relationships are interpreted as indicating a link between changes in the depth of the nutricline and the demise of the genus.  The extinction itself is coincident with a global shoaling of the nutricline from 2.1 to 1.9 Ma.  Pleistocene environmental changes greatly restricted the deep-water habitat of Discoaster and eventually contributed to its extinction.  This indicates a possible relationship between ocean stratification, or the depth of the nutricline, and overall nannoplankton diversity.  Because of this relationship, nannoplankton may diversify if ocean stratification increases in the future.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9390], "author_name_tesi": "Schueth, Jonathan Douglas", "last_name_ssi": "Schueth", "middle_name_ssi": "Douglas", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy Bralower", "Klaus Keller", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY", "Eric S Post"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy Bralower, Dissertation Advisor", "Klaus Keller, Committee Member", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY, Committee Member", "Eric S Post, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nannoplankton", "extinction", "recovery", "incumbency", "datum"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "CULTURAL MODELS AND CULTURAL SELF-AWARENESS:\nA DISCOURSE ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO THE LANGUAGE OF STUDENTS\u2019 ONLINE JOURNAL ENTRIES\n", "id": "6545", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1666", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates whether three participants in a fourth semester German course\u2014designed around the German film epic Heimat\u2014develop critical self-awareness and intercultural competence in the course of the semester, and, if so, how this development is reflected linguistically in their written discourse.  The data for this study are composed of students\u2019 online journal entries in the form of weblogs, and their answers to cultural and biographical questionnaires.  Drawing on a Hallidayian-inspired philosophy that sees language as \u201csocial-semiotic\u201d (1978), this study looks at the data through a discourse analytical lens.  In particular, the discourse analysis relies on the works of linguists Gee (1999) and Fowler (1996), whose approaches are based on the functional-textual theory of language (e.g., Halliday, 1978, 1985).  These researchers consider discourse analysis to be a tool for uncovering underlying ideological principles and cultural models.  The linguistic analysis in this dissertation focuses on the occurrence and distribution of epistemic and deontic modality (Simpson, 1993, Toolan, 2001), lexical absolutes, verbs of reflection, and temporal adjectives.  The findings of the linguistic analysis are compared to the components and objectives of Byram\u2019s (1997) model of intercultural communicative competence (ICC).  The analysis shows that while each participant engages in the process of developing reflectivity and critical cultural-self awareness, they each take very individual paths, even to the point where one student\u2019s willingness to reflect upon the self and the other culture regresses and ruptures by the end of the semester.  The study supports the idea that \u201cthe self\u201d needs to be openly and reflexively acknowledged in foreign language education (FLE) and research, and that self-scrutiny should be encouraged and facilitated during a period of development and identity formation.  It suggests the use of weblogs as a possible tool for tracing students\u2019 development, and as a means for encouraging the inquiry process, and for shedding light on the intricacies of intercultural learning.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1652], "author_name_tesi": "Schuetz, Dorothee ", "last_name_ssi": "Schuetz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dorothee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Julie A Belz", "Gabriella Appel", "Steve L Thorne", "Cecilia Novero"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Julie A Belz, Committee Chair", "Gabriella Appel, Committee Member", "Steve L Thorne, Committee Member", "Cecilia Novero, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cultural models", "intercultural competence", "Heimat", "discourse analysis", "weblogs"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Formation and Kinetics of Axially Intruded Iron Silicide and Nickel Silicide Nanowires", "id": "15540", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7870", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThe formation of axially intruded iron silicide nanowires is investigated for its potential applications in spintronics research.
