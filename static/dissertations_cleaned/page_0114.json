Following the history of American wars beginning with the Civil War and proceeding through the current War on Terror, numbers are used but rarely investigated for their rhetorical potential. As an inventional resource, rhetors can use numbers to limit deliberation or discussion of an issue, or rhetors can use numbers in order to open a space for greater democratic deliberation. The rhetorical use of numbers in pro- and antiwar rhetorics is worth examining in depth and it is important to put these divergent uses of numbers to support or challenge war in conversation because by doing so, we see a contrast in motives. This dissertation accounts for three different motives associated with the use of numbers in war rhetoric: commemoration, control, and deliberation. The three motives operate simultaneously and are not taken to be mutually exclusive. To uncover these motives, I first offer a genealogy of numbers in war rhetoric, beginning with the Civil War and moving through the 20th century. Next, I explore how numbers are marshaled in contemporary anti- and pro-war rhetorics in the War on Terror. Within the War on Terror discussion, I offer an apparatus for judging the use of numbers in war rhetoric, focusing on three criteria: accuracy, transparency, and magnitude. With the criteria in mind, it is easier for the public to broach discussion, and create a space to challenge the rhetorical use of numbers and engage in a discussion of the ethical and financial costs of war.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10046], "author_name_tesi": "Stec, Frank Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Stec", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Frank", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeremy Engels", "James Hogan", "Stephen Howard Browne", "Matt Jordan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeremy Engels, Dissertation Advisor", "James Hogan, Committee Member", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Member", "Matt Jordan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rhetoric", "war rhetoric", "biopower", "counting", "numbers"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Genetic Differentiation of Populations of European Wild Rabbits at Different Spatial Scales", "id": "18115", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8754", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The levels of genetic differentiation within and between populations of social animals are dependent on many factors such as social behaviors, geographical barriers, or the effects of genetic drift acting on small effective population sizes.  A fundamental question is whether there are consistent patterns that characterize population genetic structure within a single species. Previous studies of population genetic structure of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in the United Kingdom and Australia show very different patterns of differentiation. In this study we address whether general patterns exist for genetic structure in wild rabbit populations across multiple spatial scales.  Ten microsatellite loci were used to determine genetic structure both within a wild population of rabbits cohabitating in an area approximately 2km2 in Perthshire, Scotland, and between four natural populations across the UK varying in distance from 12km to 500km apart.  Microsatellite allele frequencies indicate there was no significant genetic differentiation within subdivisions of the Perthshire population but comparisons between populations at larger geographical scales were significantly different.  Rabbits within the focal population in Perthshire, Scotland exhibit a high degree a gene flow resulting in a panmictic population. As geographical distances increase to the regional scale, genetic differentiation between populations emerges due to geographical barriers reducing gene flow.  These data, in combination with previous studies, suggest that within this species of rabbit, there is neither a consistent effect of social behaviors nor the effect of habitat on the genetic structure of populations.  Clearly, there are no consistent patterns that can help predict population genetic structure within this rabbit species ", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8610], "author_name_tesi": "Steele, Molly Katherine", "last_name_ssi": "Steele", "middle_name_ssi": "Katherine", "first_name_ssi": "Molly", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Isabella Cattadori"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Isabella Cattadori, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microsatellites", "population genetic structure", "European rabbits", "Oryctolagus cuniculs"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Control in Polyphosphazene Materials", "id": "7727", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3727", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis is the culmination of several recent studies focused on the surface characterization of polyphosphazenes specifically the properties of water repellency or hydrophobicity. Chapter 1 is a background account of polyphosphazene chemistry and the hydrophobicity of polyphosphazenes.\nChapter 2 provides an examination of the role of surface morphology on hydrophobicity. This study deals in depth with the electrospinning of poly[bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene] in tetrahydrofuran. This process yields fiber mats or bead and fiber mats which exhibit roughness in continuous contact with the water droplet (fiber mats) or discontinuous contact (bead and fiber mats). These surface roughness types are compared to spun cast films using water contact angles to measure the air-water-polymer interface.\nThe influence of aromatic moieties and fluorine content on the air-water-polymer interface is examined in Chapter 3. This study examines the influence of fluorine content and aryloxy groups on the hydrophobicity of a polyphosphazene surface via static water contact angle measurements on a goniometer. Polymer surfaces of spun cast and electrospun mats were probed with advancing, receeding, and static water contact angle and dip coated slides of the same materials were also examined with a Langmuir-Blogett trough.\nChapter 4 is a description of the environmental plasma surface treatments of polyphosphazenes as a method of functionalizing solid polymer surfaces. The treatment procedure of functionalizing spun cast and electrospun poly[bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene] surfaces with plasma gases of oxygen, nitrogen, methane, and tetrafluoromethane is detailed. The resulting functionalization of the surface is examined with XPS and water contact angle data.\nIn Chapter 5 fluoroalkoxy polyphosphazenes were processed with liquid carbon dioxide into foams. The foams were then tested for flame retardance and hydrophobicity.\nAppendixes A-C contain studies on moisture sensitive phosphoranimine monomer storage, micelle formation in water from triblock copolymers, and single ion conductive membranes with increased hydrophobicity respectively. Although the appendixes examine polyphosphazene hydrophobic relationships they are not specific to surface hydrophobicity of solids and were not placed in the main text. Appendix A involves the optimization of storage conditions for a phosphoranimine monomer. Conditions examined include room temperature to -80 \u00baC and dilution with a variety of organic solvents. The micelle formation of A-B-A triblock copolymer of poly[bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene]-poly(propylene-glycol)-poly[bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene] was explored in appendix B. It was determined with light scattering and TEM that hairpin folding of our triblock copolymer allowed micelle formation with the two hydrophobic poly[bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene] blocks facing the hydrophobic core of the micelle. Appendix C details the lithium ion conductivity of poly[norbornene-pendent-cyclotriphosphazene] with sulfonimide and methoxyethoxyethoxy groups attached.

One mechanism of regulating gene expression levels involves the pausing of RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) on genes by the protein complexes DSIF and NELF.  RNA Pol II is then poised to rapidly transcribe the genes in response to an appropriate stimulus. On the heat shock protein (hsp) genes in Drosophila melanogaster, the transcriptional activator Heat Shock Factor (HSF) senses cellular stress such as heat shock and reactivates a paused RNA Pol II to a state of active transcription in a process that is collectively known as the heat shock response.  In addition to the heat shock response, the biological importance of Pol II pausing is evident from its correlation with genes that are synchronously induced in an organized fashion during development.  \n\tThis thesis discusses the purification of recombinant Drosophila melanogaster HSF to make a polyclonal antibody against it for the purpose of using the antibody in various biochemical assays, including electrophoretic mobility shifts and in vitro transcription reactions.

Cytarabine and other currently available treatments for acute myeloid leukemia are highly toxic and insufficient, as more than half of all AML patients develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Since AML often affects older people who are less tolerant of chemotherapy, there is need for novel, targeted, less toxic drugs in order to improve survival for this disease. \nCasein Kinase II (CK2) is a pro-oncogenic serine/threonine kinase that is essential for cellular proliferation. Overexpression or increased CK2 activity is associated with various types of human malignancies. In hematopoietic cells, increased CK2 expression is associated with malignant transformation and development of leukemia. Increased CK2 activity is associated with a poor prognosis in AML. Targeted inhibition of CK2 with a novel, specific inhibitor produced a strong anti-leukemia effect in vitro and in pre-clinical models. However, the mechanism through which CK2 inhibitors exert an anti-leukemia effect is unknown. The goal of our project is to identify the mechanism of the therapeutic activity of CK2 inhibition using CX-4945 in AML. \nIkaros is a zinc finger, DNA-binding protein that is encoded by the IKZF1 gene and acts as a tumor suppressor in hematopoietic malignancies. Deletion or functional inactivation of Ikaros is associated with development of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as well as AML. Previously published data showed that CK2 directly phosphorylates Ikaros at multiple evolutionarily-conserved sites. The CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ikaros results in reduced DNA-binding affinity and loss of Ikaros function as a transcriptional regulator of gene expression. Inhibition of CK2 restores Ikaros function as a tumor suppressor and produces an anti-leukemia effect in ALL. Based on these data, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of therapeutic action of CK2 inhibitors in AML involves restoration of Ikaros function as a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in malignant transformation. \nGenome-wide binding studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) demonstrated that inhibition of CK2 via CX-4945 in U937 and primary AML cells enhances Ikaros binding affinity at the promoter regions of its target genes. We used gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments to determine how Ikaros regulates several novel target genes involved in malignant transformation and drug resistance. Results demonstrated that Ikaros directly represses transcription of the BCL2A1 gene, which promotes leukemogenesis and has an anti-apoptotic function. We show that the ability of Ikaros to repress transcription of BCL2A1 is impaired in AML, overexpression of BCL2A1 is a negative prognostic marker, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms contribute to resistance to chemotherapy. Repression of BCL2A1 results in increased apoptosis. The ability of Ikaros to repress BCL2A1 transcription is impaired by CK2. Inhibition of CK2 via CX-4945 increases Ikaros binding at the BCL2A1 promoter, resulting in transcriptional repression of BCL2A1. Increased Ikaros binding to the BCL2A1 promoter is associated with formation of repressive chromatin that is characterized by the loss of the positive marker H3K4me2 and increase in the negative marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3. Since BCL2A1 has an anti-apoptotic function, we tested whether CK2 inhibition increases susceptibility of AML cells to apoptosis. Results showed that CK2 inhibition increases apoptosis of AML cells and that the CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 has synergistic therapeutic effects in combination with a standard drug for AML, Doxorubicin. These data indicate a new Ikaros target gene, one mechanism for the therapeutic activity of CK2 inhibition, and a novel combination treatment for AML.\nSimilar functional experiments were performed on four additional Ikaros target genes that were identified by ChIP-Seq (MTHFR, CDA, DLX1, and DLX2). Results demonstrated that CK2 impairs transcriptional regulation of these genes by Ikaros in AML. Treatment with CK2 inhibitor restores Ikaros-mediated regulation of these genes. Since two of the newly-identified Ikaros target genes are known to be involved in drug resistance, the therapeutic effect of the CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 has been tested in combination with additional chemotherapeutic agents, and results showed a synergistic effect of these combination treatments in AML cells.\nFinally, a systems biology approach was used to determine the effect of CK2 inhibition on the epigenome and transcriptome of AML cells. The analysis revealed that CK2 inhibition results in alterations in the epigenomic signature of AML cells. The prominent changes involved alteration of enhancer and super-enhancer landscapes, which were associated with transcriptional regulation of many genes that are critical for cellular proliferation.\nIn summary, our results demonstrate that the therapeutic effect of CK2 inhibition in AML cells involves restoration of Ikaros function as a tumor suppressor and transcriptional regulator. Our results have identified novel pathways that are regulated by Ikaros as well as an epigenomic landscape that is regulated by CK2. These data led to the development of novel combination treatments for AML which showed synergy when tested on AML cells. Our results provide a mechanistic rationale for development of novel, targeted treatments for AML.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11382], "author_name_tesi": "Steffens, Sadie Lynne", "last_name_ssi": "Steffens", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynne", "first_name_ssi": "Sadie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sinisa Dovat", "Sinisa Dovat", "Barbara Miller", "Sergei A Grigoryev", "Jong Kak Yun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sinisa Dovat, Dissertation Advisor", "Sinisa Dovat, Committee Chair", "Barbara Miller, Committee Member", "Sergei A Grigoryev, Committee Member", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ikaros", "CK2", "AML", "drug resistance", "BCL2A1", "MTHFR", "CDA", "DLX1", "DLX2", "cytarabine", "methotrexate", "doxorubicin"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Decision Algorithm to Improve Data Collection in Stochastic Environments\n", "id": "10837", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2575", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Field experiments are conducted to collect observations of a particular meteorological condition or phenomena in order to enhance scientific understanding.  In some cases, the decision to deploy costly data-collecting resources must be made ahead of time, when the presence of the sought after condition is unknown, resulting in decisions being  made from imperfect forecasts.\nTraditionally, forecasters are used to predict the likelihood of good data-collecting conditions existing, while a group of scientists use this information to make resource deployment decisions.  A new method for resource deployment decisions is presented that shifts the emphasis from the forecasts to the decision-making aspect of the problem.  The performance of this new method is evaluated through using the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) RACORO field campaign, which sought to obtain aircraft measurement of boundary layer clouds (BLCs).  \nDynamic programming is used to quantify the expected number of successful deployments yet to be launched for any combination of days and resources remaining in the field season.  For a given forecast of boundary layer clouds existing a decision can be made which maximizes the expected number of successful deployments.  \nTo create BLC forecasts Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) are used to cluster days according to relative humidity profile.  Using cloud data available from the experiment site, the likelihood of BLCs existing for each cluster is determined.  A numerical weather prediction model predicts the cluster that the relative humidity profile will belong to, from which the probability that good data-collecting conditions will exist is derived.  \nIf the presented, alternative method had been implemented for RACORO, 34 successful flights would have been launched, as opposed to the 28 successful flights that were actually launched.  In addition to this 20% increase in the amount of data collected, the new method can operate efficiently in real time, significantly saving scientists time spent on decision-making and eliminating forecasting costs.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2555], "author_name_tesi": "Stefik, Jason Brian", "last_name_ssi": "Stefik", "middle_name_ssi": "Brian", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Johannes Verlinde", "Johannes Verlinde", "Arthur A Small Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Johannes Verlinde, Thesis Advisor", "Johannes Verlinde, Thesis Advisor", "Arthur A Small Iii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["optimized decision making", "self-organizing maps", "dynamic programming", "resource allocation", "field experiments"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "ANXIOUS CONFESSIONS: PENITENCE, MEMORY, AND DESIRE IN EARLY MODERN ENGLISH LITERATURE\n\n", "id": "7551", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4876", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Anxious Confessions: Penitence, Memory, and Desire in Early Modern English Literature addresses the consequential intersections of literary imagination and penitential practices in early modern England. The English Reformation rejected the sacramental status of private, auricular confession and dispensed with the medieval requirement that individuals confess their sins at least once a year. The Church of England maintained a desacramentalized, voluntary form of private confession, but reserved it as an extraordinary rite for those individuals needing further consolation. However, this reorientation led to the effective disappearance of the rite in early modern England. The loss of private confession disrupted a significant means for achieving forgiveness and reassurance. Conventionally, literary critics have overlooked the importance of private confession in early modern England because they tend to categorize ritual practices as either Protestant or Roman Catholic and to associate literary representations of the rite of private confession with England's religious past or with contemporary Roman Catholicism. This received interpretation neglects the ongoing literary engagements with the developments in penitential practices in Elizabethan and Jacobean England. By reconstructing the discourses surrounding the rite of private confession in early modern England, this study explores how four major authors -- Spenser, Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Donne -- represent the rite as a unique site for negotiating memories of past sins and achieving reconciliation and consolation. In its consideration of the widespread effects of the shifts in ritual confession, this study examines texts ranging from epic poetry, sonnet sequences, and female complaint to sermons, devotional prose, and early modern translations of St. Augustine. This study demonstrates how early modern representations of the rite of private confession engage the shifting relationship of individuals to political, ecclesiastical, and divine authority in the early modern period.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4853], "author_name_tesi": "Stegner, Paul Dustin", "last_name_ssi": "Stegner", "middle_name_ssi": "Dustin", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick G Cheney", "Robert R Edwards", "Laura Lunger Knoppers", "Garrett Sullivan Jr.", "Linda Woodbridge", "Ronnie Po Chia Hsia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick G Cheney, Committee Chair", "Robert R Edwards, Committee Member", "Laura Lunger Knoppers, Committee Member", "Garrett Sullivan Jr., Committee Member", "Linda Woodbridge, Committee Member", "Ronnie Po Chia Hsia, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Marlowe", "Auricular Confession", "Augustine", "Penitence", "Ritual", "Memory", "Reformation", "Andrewes", "Shakespeare", "Donne", "Spenser", "Desire"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "MAPPING SEMANTIC AND SPATIAL MEDIASCAPES IN THE CATALONIAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT: GEOPOLITICS, SPORTS, AND BLACK BOXES", "id": "14724sks5122", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14724", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores the geographic and semantic spaces of local and international news media reporting on the Catalonian independence movement of fall 2015.

In particular, time provides a measure to indicate consistency and change. Finding significant temporal patterns thus remains a popular and necessary topic of research in many fields, geography included. This research adds to this scholarship by extending sequence analysis techniques to evaluate the significance of a single established pattern by confirming its existence under new conditions. This effort investigates two questions: How well does the pattern fit in these new conditions? In what ways does the pattern change from the expectation it presents?\n\nBy using a variation on the sequence alignment algorithm developed in computational biology this Masters thesis addresses these questions. Sequence alignment uses matrix representations and traversal to compare two sequences by modifying them to make them approximate one another, which can be visually represented. Further, sequence alignment generates a measure of the total modification done that can be used to quantitatively compare sequences of events.\n\nThis thesis extends sequence alignment to account for the properties of spatio-temporal sequences extraneous to the original intent of the algorithm. Sequence alignment, developed for analysis of the physical structure of DNA, places a base pair within every possible location within a sequence. In this research, sequence alignment is amended to instead analyze the temporal intervals between successive events. Additionally, unlike the physical structure of DNA in which one base pair can occupy a location in the sequence, events can occupy the same temporal unit. This Masters thesis introduces the Temporal Deviation Distance as a measure of the amount of temporal deviation between an expected pattern of events and empirical data. The output from this operation is color-coded to facilitate visual exploration of those deviations with respect to the times and locations in both sequences that they take place.\n\nThis thesis demonstrates the temporally-aware sequence alignment algorithm on a statistically derived pattern of diplomatic events taking place in Yemen between February 2011to March 2012. This pattern is compared to a series of events in time periods previous to those from which it was derived.

The overarching aim is to show how the religious impulse, when held in check by certain critical principles, is among the most powerful resources humans possess (or perhaps more accurately, the most powerful force that possesses humans) for engaging in the ethical and political project of transforming ourselves and our world.\n\nThe first chapter outlines William James\u2019 approach to religion as something that may contribute to a more unified psychological life and a more strenuous practical life. For James, the genius and vitality of religion stems from our capacity to experience ourselves as belonging more intimately to an \u201cunseen\u201d or \u201cideal\u201d world than to the \u201cseen\u201d or \u201creal\u201d world, so that we are psychologically motivated to painstakingly realize the ideal.\n\nSince James left the social dimensions of religion largely unexplored, the second chapter turns to Josiah Royce, who elucidates how profound transformations come about when an individual comes to identify with the memories and hopes of a larger community, especially when it is posited as part of the universal community of life. We can understand this transformation as religious (in the etymological sense of \u201cto bind\u201d) since it recognizes interdependence and cultivates our ethical bonds.\n\nChapter three uses John Dewey to go beyond Royce\u2019s limited analysis of the concrete historical conditions that have produced \u201clost\u201d individuals in need of the \u201csaving power\u201d of participation in community life. By re-working Royce\u2019s religious community as democratic community, Dewey naturalizes and concretizes the conditions for human flourishing. Dewey also shows how the religious dimension of life shows up in everyone (though many very reasonably dispute calling this dimension religious), since our lives depend upon our desire and ability to incorporate and embody ideals (things which \u201care and are not\u201d) in habit-based forms of practical life and public institutions.\n\nAs a power source that moves people through their convictions, the ties between religion and oppressive ideals must be differentiated from those between religion and liberating ideals. With this in mind, my final chapter works to avoid a dangerous (but typical) reduction of American philosophy to U.S. philosophy by putting pragmatism into an inter-American dialogue with Enrique Dussel\u2019s philosophy of liberation. Like the pragmatists, Dussel develops intimately interconnected philosophies of religion, ethics, and politics, but he does so by beginning from the reality of so many peoples\u2019 everyday experiences of being poor or otherwise oppressed. In the process, Dussel also achieves a critical transformation of pragmatism\u2019s philosophy of religion by emphasizing the moments of our experience when our projects and identities are interrupted by those excluded or oppressed by the present order, so that we are called to open ourselves and our projects to criticism launched from beyond our limited sense of who \u201cwe\u201d are. My final chapter enacts this at the philosophical level by interrogating the U.S.-American pragmatist account of the religious dimensions of ethical and political life by way of a transformational Latin American critique.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [463], "author_name_tesi": "Stehn, Alexander Veasey", "last_name_ssi": "Stehn", "middle_name_ssi": "Veasey", "first_name_ssi": "Alexander", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Vincent M Colapietro", "John Philip Christman", "Djelal Kadir"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Dissertation Advisor", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Committee Chair", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Djelal Kadir, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["William James", "Philosophy of Liberation", "Pragmatism", "Latin American Philosophy", "American Philosophy", "Josiah Royce", "John Dewey", "Enrique Dussel"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Modeling Studies of the Transport and Transformation of Pollutants in the Lower Troposphere", "id": "5892", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "142", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-10-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The utilization of mathematical models to represent the fates and transformations of atmospheric pollutants constitutes a fundamental practice that has contributed to the conceptual understanding of a variety of phenomena. These models provide the necesary framework for incorporating diverse atmospheric processes into a coherent system for studying their interactions. Consequently, we use several increasingly complex simulation tools to comprehend different aspects of pollution phenomena, such as the dispersion of non-reacting pollutants emitted from a smokestack, the forecast of tropospheric ozone formation over a regional scale, and the sensitivity of sulfate aerosol to changes in nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbon source strengths.\nStarting with the simplest approach for simulating the dispersion of a chemically non-reactive contaminant, we explore the comparability of Gaussian-type model predictions to atmospheric measurements. This work investigates the differences between time-averaged observations and ensemble mean concentrations as predicted by Gaussian models in laboratory and atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flows. For a given averaging time it is shown that this difference is smaller in laboratory flows than in the ABL under the same stability and statistical conditions. Furthermore, with data from the Willis-Deardorff convection tank experiments, it is shown that the values of the normalized differences between observations and model-predicted concentrations in the ABL exceed 50 % for an averaging time of the order of 1 hour. These findings give a clear indication of the need for development of more accurate and sophisticated modeling tools to depict the atmospheric dispersion of non-reactive pollutants.\nIn view of the fact that Gaussian models show high discrepancies between modeled and observed concentrations and that this approach is unable to simulate the formation of secondary pollutants, it is necessary to increase the level of complexity to model phenomena such as photochemical smog. Thus, a three-dimensional model, the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectories model with a generalized non-linear Chemistry Module (HY-SPLIT CheM), has been utilized to forecast summertime ozone concentrations over the northeastern United States. The ability of HY-SPLIT CheM to simulate ozone mixing ratios has been evaluated by comparing calculated summertime ozone mixing ratios against measured values for the month of July, 1999. Generally, a fair agreement is observed at most stations, especially taking into account the large number of assumptions used to construct the model. HY-SPLIT CheM is the first operational implementation of the particle-in-grid approach applied to air quality modeling. This model constitutes a feasible tool due to its simplicity and low cost of implementation. \nThe study of the formation of aerosol particles, specifically sulfate (SO42-) aerosols, involves a complicated coupling among gas-phase chemical reactions (as in the formation of ozone), aqueous-phase photochemical, and meteorological processes within the simulation framework. The formation of SO42- is chemically linked to primary emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) via atmospheric oxidants and therefore also to the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). These compounds represent the chemical precursors of ozone, which in turn constitutes the main source of SO2 oxidants. \nThe response of SO42- production to controls in NOx and VOC emissions depends in part on the resulting changes in oxidant levels and the competition that naturally exists between the gas- and aqueous-phase pathways for SO2 oxidation. We therefore propose the use of a combination of concentrations of nitric acid, particulate nitrate, hydrogen peroxide, and sulfate as a non-dimensional indicator of the effectiveness of VOC or NOx controls in decreasing SO42- abundance. The concentrations of these indicator species were calculated from a series of photochemical model simulations with varying rates of NOx and VOC emissions using a state-of-the-art three-dimensional Eulerian model (MODELS-3) that covers the northeastern United States. It is shown that sulfate concentrations are likely to decrease as VOC emissions are reduced when the non-dimensional indicator is less than about 1.5. Under these same conditions a reduction in NOx emissions would, however tend to increase the SO42- levels. On the other hand, a higher value of the indicator identifies a regime in which reductions in NOx emissions are more effective for reducing sulfate than VOC emissions are. In addition, a description of the sulfate-formation pathways, along with a theoretical analysis of the transition between NOx- and VOC-sensitive regimes, provides a strong rationale for the use of the sulfate-sensitivity indicator.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [141], "author_name_tesi": "Stein, Ariel Fabian", "last_name_ssi": "Stein", "middle_name_ssi": "Fabian", "first_name_ssi": "Ariel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey", "Gregory S Jenkins", "Dennis Lamb", "William Henry Brune"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "Gregory S Jenkins, Committee Member", "Dennis Lamb, Committee Chair", "William Henry Brune, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sulfate", "ozone", "aerosols", "photochemical modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Mid-rotation Patterns of Change in Developing Mixed-oak Stands", "id": "17455", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7773", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Oak species (Quercus spp.) are becoming less prevalent in the Eastern forest landscape that they formerly dominated.  One apparent reason for the decline in oaks is the increase in competition from more mesophytic species such as red maple (Acer rubrum L.).  Characteristics of red maple\u2019s growth and development give it an advantage over oak species following harvest resulting in a transition from an oak-dominated composition to a mixed or red maple-dominated composition.  However, there is uncertainty about whether red maple can sustain an initial advantage in density and abundance through the entire stand rotation.\nIn this study, we examine the composition of 46 formerly oak-dominated stands in central Pennsylvania, across three main physiographic regions.   Prior to harvest, the stands had an average of 80% of their basal area in oak species, and oak made up over 45% of the basal area in every stand.  We used data from these stands measured an average of 24.7 years (range 21-33) following clearcut harvest and, again, an average of 37.8 years (range 35-43) after harvest to study the changes in composition and structure.  Of particular interest was the interaction occurring between the major oak species and their primary competitor, red maple.   \nBetween the two measurements, oak\u2019s relative basal area increased by 6.8, 4.6 and 0.5 % in the Blue Ridge, Ridge and Valley and Appalachian Plateau regions, respectively.  Red maple, on the other hand, decreased 5.2, 0.3, and 12.7 %, respectively.  The relative density of the oak group increased 20.8, 9.3, and 1.6%, respectively, while red maple relative density decreased 2.1% in the Blue Ridge and increased 4.2 and 6.8% in the Ridge and Valley and Appalachian Plateau, respectively.  The oak species averaged an 11.4, 5.6, and 2.0% increase in proportion of upper canopy occupied by its stems.  Conversely, red maple experienced a 9.4, 2.4, and 18.9% decrease in the proportion of upper canopy occupied by its stems.  Despite red maple\u2019s tendency to dominate stands following harvest there is evidence to support a shift in the growth of oak species and a decline in red maple that occurs decades after harvest.  The change in composition and structure of the stands is a movement towards pre-harvest conditions which were predominantly oak.  The cause of these changes appears to be differences in inherent growth characteristics; however, it is unlikely that many of these stands will regain the dominance expressed prior to harvest.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7704], "author_name_tesi": "Stein, Benjamin Silas", "last_name_ssi": "Stein", "middle_name_ssi": "Silas", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kim C Steiner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kim C Steiner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["oak", "red maple", "competition", "stand dynamics", "mid-rotation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Children\u2019s response to food branding at three laboratory test-meals\n", "id": "26504", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11268", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Food marketing has been shown to influence children\u2019s food requests, preferences, and intake.

The last step is catalyzed by methanogens which produce primarily methane, carbon dioxide, and water as products of metabolism.  Anaerobic digestion occurs naturally in a variety of water-saturated sediments, but is also used to treat waste in constructed reactors.  There are a number of advantages to treating waste with anaerobic digestion, but perhaps the greatest is that waste treatment can be coupled to energy generation by the production of a methane-rich biogas.  Despite the advantages, anaerobic digestion is severely under-utilized in waste treatment mainly due to the belief that anaerobic digesters are less stable than aerobic treatment processes.  Anaerobic digesters are typically operated under warm temperatures and circumneutral pH, with operation outside of these conditions leading to instability and potential reactor failure.  Reactor failure is expensive and time-consuming to recover, and has mainly been attributed to the sensitivity of the methanogens in the microbial consortium.  The most often-cited reason for digester failure is acidic pH which may result from overfeeding of the reactor leading to the buildup of fermentation by-products.  In contrast to constructed reactors, methanogenesis in acidic wetlands proceeds at pH values less than 4.  Based on previous findings, there were two hypotheses driving this study.  The first was that the methanogens present in an acidic wetland would be distinctly different than methanogens found in a constructed anaerobic reactor.  The second hypothesis was that a reactor inoculated from an acidic peatland would be more tolerant of sudden increases in feeding rate, and the resultant drop in pH, than a reactor inoculated from a traditional anaerobic digester.\nTo investigate the first hypothesis, the methanogens in a local oligotrophic, acidic fen known as Bear Meadows Bog and a mesophilic anaerobic digester treating municipal wastewater sludge at the Pennsylvania State University Wastewater Treatment Plant were analyzed with clone libraries.  Two clone libraries were created for each environment, one for the 16S rDNA and a second for the methyl coenzyme M reductase alpha subunit gene (mcrA).  The Mcr is unique to methanogens and shows similar phylogeny as the 16S rDNA so it may be used independently of, or in conjunction with, the 16S rDNA to determine methanogen taxonomy.  A quantitative framework was developed to assess the differences between these two communities by calculating the average sequence similarity for 16S rDNA and mcrA within a genus and family using sequences of isolated and characterized methanogens and an established methanogen taxonomy.  The average sequence similarities for 16S rDNA within a genus and family were 96.0 and 93.5%, respectively, and the average sequence similarities for mcrA within a genus and family were 88.9 and 79%, respectively.  The clone libraries of the bog and digester environments showed no overlap at the species and genus levels, and almost no overlap at the family level.  Both libraries were dominated by clones related to uncultured methanogen groups within the Methanomicrobiales, specifically the Fen Cluster in the bog and MCR-7 in the digester.  Despite differences in the sequences detected, diversity was similar in both environments.\n\tBased on the results of the clone libraries, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods were developed to distinguish and quantify members of different methanogen clades. Biases inherent in PCR prevent inference of an organism\u2019s environmental abundance based on end-point PCR product abundance, but qPCR overcomes some of these biases.  A SYBR-Green I qPCR assay was developed to quantify total numbers of mcrA genes, and TaqMan probes were also designed to target several different phylogenetic groups.  Groups which were targeted by TaqMan probes included Methanosaetaceae, Methanosarcina, Methanocorpusculaceae, Methanospirillaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, and the environmentally-defined clades Fen Cluster, MCR-7, and MCR-2 subgroups a and b.  Many of these groups represent largely uncultured clades whose taxonomic standing has yet to be determined.  Both SYBR-Green I and TaqMan qPCR assays showed good reproducibility and specificity for their methanogen targets.  These methods were further tested by determining total mcrA and mcrA of different methanogen groups from six samples: four samples from anaerobic digesters treating either primarily cow or pig manure, and two aliquots from an acidic peat sample stored at 4\u00b0C or 20\u00b0C.  The three samples obtained from cow manure digesters were dominated by members of the genus Methanosarcina, whereas the sample from the pig manure digester contained detectable levels of only members of the Methanobacteriaceae.  The acidic peat samples were dominated by both Methanosarcina and members of the Fen cluster.  In two of the manure digester samples only one methanogen group was detected, but in both of the acidic peat samples and two of the manure digester samples, multiple methanogen groups were detected.\nTo investigate the second hypothesis of this study, lab-scale reactors were inoculated with either bog sediments (Bog reactors,) wasted sludge from the anaerobic digester (Digester reactors), or with a mixture of these two inocula (Hybrid reactors).  Reactors were maintained at 30\u00b0C and operated in semi-batch mode with feeding and wasting every four days, and gentle mixing once daily.  Digester performance was monitored chemically and microbiologically using the previously designed qPCR assays.  After the establishment of active methanogenic cultures in all reactors, a set of test reactors were inoculated from the control reactors and used to examine the effects of periodic doses of glucose to the consortia derived from different inocula.  \nA total of three sets of organic shocks were delivered.  Glucose pulses were equal to 1-10 times the normal amount of volatile carbon in a feeding, and these resulted in the production of large amounts of volatile fatty acids which reduced reactor pH to less than 5.  The first shock was 10 g of glucose, and this caused the Digester- and Hybrid-inoculated test reactors to fail, but the Bog-inoculated reactor recovered.  After re-inoculating the Digester- and Hybrid-test reactors, three successive glucose pulses of 1, 5, and 10 g of glucose were delivered.  The Hybrid-test reactor failed after receiving the 5 g glucose pulse, but the Bog- and Digester-test reactors only failed after receiving the 10 g glucose pulse.  All reactors were recovered by the addition of NaOH to raise reactor pH to neutral levels.  A second set of test reactors was established from the first set, and a third glucose pulse of 10 g was delivered.  One set of reactors received mineral nutrients with the glucose pulse, but the second set did not.  All reactors failed, but the Bog- and Digester-inoculated reactors recovered after pH was raised to only 4.8-5.  The Hybrid-inoculated reactor did not show signs of recovery until the end of the testing period.  Reactors with the same inoculum acted similarly, suggesting mineral nutrients did not prevent reactor failure. \t\nOriginally the Bog-inoculated test reactor was dominated by members of the Fen Cluster, but this clade only persisted through the second set of glucose shocks.  The Fen Cluster was detected in the Hybrid-test reactor after glucose pulses, but was never detected in the control reactor.  Methanosarcina and Methanobacteriaceae came to quickly dominate all control and test reactors, and the presence of Methanosarcina correlated with reactor recovery after glucose pulses.  The control reactors showed less diversity than test reactors, and all control reactors were dominated by Methanosarcina with fewer numbers of Methanobacteriaceae and MCR-7.  \n\tAlthough distinct differences existed in the methanogen communities from the bog and digesters, these differences could not be maintained in constructed reactors.  The methanogen communities in control reactors were less diverse than those in test reactors, and the acidophilic Fen Cluster was detected when reactor pH was acidic.  The test reactors showed greater resilience to low pH conditions than has been previously reported in the literature, and reactors were able to recover activity after a glucose pulse from a pH as low as 4.8-5.  Further research is needed to understand the role that different methanogen groups, specifically the Fen Cluster and Methanosarcina, play during periods of acidic operation, and how their presence may be maintained and their activity enhanced in order to provide greater stability to anaerobic digesters.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3802], "author_name_tesi": "Steinberg, Lisa Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Steinberg", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Lisa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Regan", "John Michael Regan", "Christopher Howard House", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "Jenn Macalady"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Regan, Dissertation Advisor", "John Michael Regan, Committee Chair", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Member", "Jenn Macalady, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["methyl coenzyme M reductase", "pH", "shock loading", "methanogen", "anaerobic digestion"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "AN INVESTIGATION OF PERFORMANCE BENEFITS AND TRIM REQUIREMENTS OF A VARIABLE SPEED HELICOPTER ROTOR\n", "id": "8874", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2712", "abstract_tesi": "This study primarily examines the main rotor power reductions possible through variation in rotor RPM.  Simulations were based on the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter, and emphasis was placed on possible improvements when RPM variations were limited to \u00b1 15% of the nominal rotor speed, as such limited variations are realizable through engine speed control.  The studies were performed over the complete airspeed range, from sea level up to altitudes up to 12,000 ft, and for low, moderate and high vehicle gross weight.  \nFor low altitude and low to moderate gross weight, 17-18% reductions in main rotor power were observed through rotor RPM reduction.  Reducing the RPM increases rotor collective and decreases the stall margin.  Thus, at higher airspeeds and altitudes, the optimal reductions in rotor speed are smaller, as are the power savings.  The primary method for power reduction with decreasing rotor speed is a decrease in profile power. When rotor speed is optimized based on both power and rotor torque, the optimal rotor speed increases at low speeds to decrease rotor torque without power penalties. Optimization at high flight speeds shows that both power- and torque-weighted optimums occur at the same rotor speeds. This trend is independent of vehicle gross weight. For very high gross weight and high altitude operations, the flight envelope can be expanded by increasing the rotor speed, preventing rotor stall.  \nShaft torque was not seen to increase appreciably for moderate and high speed flight, with only a small increase in low speed flight.

However, memory is often imperfect (e.g., eyewitnesses identify the wrong individual as often as 78% of the time; Malpass & Devine, 1981), as well as biased (e.g., the ability to remember faces dramatically decreases if the person belongs to a different group or race; Hugenberg & Corneille, 2009). Several contemporary models attempt to address how preconceived expectations might influence the ability to accurately remember faces (i.e., sensitivity) as well as the tendency to falsely remember a face (i.e., bias). However, these models differ on whether people will be more adept at remembering faces that satisfy (i.e., are congruent with) or violate (i.e., are incongruent to) preconceived expectations and whether the contribution of these expectancies will have the greatest influence at the initial formation of the memory (encoding) or at the recall stage of the memory (retrieval).

The present study provides a new perspective and findings on this debate by investigating individual-level fertility outcomes in one country, Kenya, utilizing multi-level models applied to a unique data set integrating community-level development and family planning service quality of care indicators with nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey data from 1993 and 1998 and clinic-level data from 1989 and 1999 to test both direct and interactive effects of community context on changing fertility behaviors and outcomes.  \nThe results of most models examined in this study illustrate the primary importance of an individual woman\u2019s characteristics, particularly her age at marriage and educational attainment, in influencing the number of children ever born to her and whether she ever used modern contraceptives.  The level of infrastructural development in a district was the only community development factor to have a very significant and consistent inverse direct effect on the number of children ever born to a woman.  Although the cross-level interaction considering the effect of a woman ever using modern contraceptives and an increased level of infrastructural development in a district has a significant positive effect, the overall effect of an increased level of infrastructural development ultimately further reduced the number of children ever born to a woman.  Most of the other community development factors have no significant main effect on a woman\u2019s decision to ever use modern contraceptives, especially in the later time period.  Most of the cross-level interactions with the level of infrastructural development in a district and a woman\u2019s educational attainment had a non-significant combined effect in both time points as well.  Similarly, the measures of quality of care at service delivery points on their own have a limited effect on the number of children ever born to a woman and almost no effect on her decision to ever use modern contraceptives.  However, the inclusion of cross-level interactions of the quality of care measures and whether a woman ever used modern contraceptives illustrated significant effects on the number of children ever born to a woman.  The cross-level interactions of the choice of oral contraceptives at service delivery points in a district and a woman\u2019s educational attainment also illustrated the importance of family planning context on a woman\u2019s decision to ever use modern contraceptives.  \nThe significance of a woman\u2019s individual characteristics is not surprising given the dependent variables are measured at the individual level.  Thus, although there are only a few significant variables at the contextual level it is important to discuss how they relate to the ongoing debate of what factors influence a fertility decline.  The subsequent section will discuss all the main effects and cross-level interactions in the context of current demographic scholarship. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4506], "author_name_tesi": "Steinmetz, Michele ", "last_name_ssi": "Steinmetz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Michele", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gordon F De Jong", "Stephen Matthews", "Leif Jensen", "Patricia Barthalow Koch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gordon F De Jong, Committee Chair", "Stephen Matthews, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "Patricia Barthalow Koch, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fertility", "quality of care", "development", "Kenya"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Predictive Network Modeling And Experimentation In Complex Biological Systems: Applications To Cancer And Infectious Disease", "id": "24852", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11141", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Biology is incredibly complex \u2013 at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and population level, there exists a tremendous number of discrete interacting components tightly regulating the processes that sustain life. Biological systems have traditionally been viewed in a reductionist manner often literally (and metaphorically) through a magnifying glass, leading to insight into how the individual parts work. Network theory, on the other hand, can be used to put the pieces together, to understand how complex and emergent behaviors arise from the totality of interactions in complex systems, such as those seen in biology. Network theory is the study of systems of discrete interacting components and provides a framework for understanding complex systems. A network-focused investigation of a complex biological system allows for the understanding of the system\u2019s emergent properties, for example its function and dynamics. Network dynamics are of particular interest biologically because biological systems are not static but are constantly changing in response to perturbations and environmental stimuli in space and time. \n\nSystems level biological analysis has been aided by the recent explosion of high throughput data. This has led to an abundance of quantitative and qualitative information related to the activation of biological systems, but frequently there is still a paucity of kinetic and temporal information. Discrete dynamic modeling provides a means to create predictive models of biological systems by integrating fragmentary and qualitative interaction information. Using discrete dynamic modeling, a structural (static) network of biological regulatory relationships can be translated into a mathematical model without the use of kinetic parameters. This model can describe the dynamics of a biological system (i.e. how it changes over time), both in normal and in perturbation (e.g. disease) scenarios. In this dissertation we present the application of network theory and discrete dynamic modeling integrated with experimental laboratory analysis to understand biological diseases in three contexts. \n\nThe first is the construction of a network model of epidermal derived growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in cancer. We translate this model into two types of discrete models: a Boolean model and a three-state model. We show how the effects of an EGFR inhibitor (such as the drug gefitinib) can suppress tumor growth, and we model how genomic variants can augment the effect of EGFR inhibition in tumor growth. Importantly, we compare discrete modeling outcomes to an alternative modeling framework, which relies on detailed kinetic information, called ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling and show that both models achieve similar findings. Our results demonstrate that discrete dynamic model can accurately model biomedical systems and make important predictions about the effect a drug will have on a disease (e.g. tumor growth) in the context of various perturbations. Importantly, discrete dynamic models can be employed in the absence of kinetic parameters, making this modeling approach suitable for the many biological systems in which detailed kinetic information is not available. \n\nSecond, we construct a network model of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a developmental process hijacked by cancer cells to leave the primary tumor site, invade surrounding tissue, and establish distant metastases. We demonstrate that the EMT network model recapitulates known dysregulations during the induction of EMT and predicts the activation of the Wnt and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathways during this process. We confirm the cross-talk between TGF\u03b2, Wnt and SHH signaling in vitro in multiple human liver cancer cell lines and tumor samples. Next, we use the EMT network model to systematically explore perturbations that suppress EMT, with the ultimate goal of identifying therapeutic interventions that suppress tumor invasion. We computationally explore close to half a million individual and combination perturbations to the EMT network and identify that only a dozen suppress EMT. We test these interventions experimentally and our findings suggest that many predicted interventions suppress the EMT process. \n\nLastly, we construct a model of the enormous ecological community of bacteria that live in our intestines, collectively called the gut microbiome. This model is used to understand the effect of antibiotic treatment and opportunistic C. difficile infection (a devastating and highly prevalent disease entity) on the native microbiome and predict therapeutic probiotic interventions to suppress C. difficile infection. We integrate this modeling with another type of modeling, genome scale metabolic network reconstructions, to understand metabolic differences between community members and to identify the role of metabolism in the observed microbial interactions. In vitro experimental data validate a key result of my computational model, that Barnesiella intestinihominis can in fact suppress C. difficile growth. This novel result suggests that Barnesiella could potentially be used as a probiotic to suppress C. difficile growth.\nTaken together, the studies presented in this thesis demonstrate the tremendous capacity of network modeling to elucidate biomedical systems. We build networks, construct mathematical models, study network dynamics, and use network-directed insight to guide experiments in critical biomedical areas. The ultimate goal of this work has been to translate network-directed insight into actionable biomedical findings that lead to improved understanding of human disease, enhanced patient care, and a betterment of the human condition.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10705], "author_name_tesi": "Steinway, Steven Nathaniel", "last_name_ssi": "Steinway", "middle_name_ssi": "Nathaniel", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Reka Z Albert", "\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\"", "Reka Z Albert", "David J Feith", "James Riley Broach", "Diane M Thiboutot"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Reka Z Albert, Dissertation Advisor", "\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\", Dissertation Advisor", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Chair", "David J Feith, Committee Member", "James Riley Broach, Committee Member", "Diane M Thiboutot, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Network analysis", "dynamic modeling", "discrete dynamic modeling", "cancer", "microbiome", "tumor invasion & metastasis"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Nurse Recognition of Delirium Superimposed on Dementia in Hospitalized Older Adults\n", "id": "9749", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4374", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nBackground: Delirium is an acute, fluctuating confusional state that is potentially preventable and treatable, especially when recognized early.  Unrecognized delirium in older adults results in increased risk for poor health outcomes.  Persons who experience delirium in addition to dementia have a two-fold increase of death within one year.  \nPurpose: To explore acute care nurses\u2019 recognition of delirium in hospitalized older adults with dementia and to describe how nurses manage their patients using the Recognition in the Context of Nurse-Patient Interactions framework to guide this study.  \nMethods: This study was a secondary analysis of data from a previous study that followed 140 hospitalized older adults with dementia, followed by a retrospective chart review of the nurses\u2019 documentation.  \nResults: In the original study by Fick, research assistants assessed the patients daily using the Confusion Assessment Method to determine if they experienced delirium or not.  This study sample consisted of two groups of hospitalized older adults (>/=65 years) (Dementia-Only and Delirium Superimposed on Dementia).  Analysis of nurses\u2019 documentation included qualitative content analysis, descriptive statistics, logistic analysis with repeated measures and logistic analysis and multinomial logistic regression.  The most significant finding was that there were no patient days (n=116) on which acute care nurses recognized delirium in this population.  \nConclusion:  The absence of recognition may lead to improper or ineffective nursing management of the patient experiencing delirium, potentially increasing the risk of poor health outcomes.  Implications of these results include the need for comprehensive education of acute care nurses. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4346], "author_name_tesi": "Steis, Melinda R", "last_name_ssi": "Steis", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Melinda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donna Marie Fick", "Donna Marie Fick", "Janice Lee Penrod", "Susan Jayne Loeb", "Robert William Schrauf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donna Marie Fick, Dissertation Advisor", "Donna Marie Fick, Committee Chair", "Janice Lee Penrod, Committee Member", "Susan Jayne Loeb, Committee Member", "Robert William Schrauf, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["delirium superimposed on dementia", "nurse recognition", "older adults"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECT OF MICROFIBER MORPHOLOHY AND CELL DENSITY ON THE  LOCALIZATION OF YAP PROTEIN IN MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS ", "id": "15394aes5689", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15394", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a non-hematopoietic adult derived stem cell found in the bone marrow of mammals, are capable of differentiating into many cell types of the mesenchyme, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myoblasts. The ability to easily harvest and grow these stem cells has caused MSCs to become a large focus of research in regenerative medicine.  Past studies have shown that combinations of chemical and mechanical stimulus, including specific growth factors and extracellular fiber morphology, can be used to influence the differentiation of MSCs into specific cell types. However, the underlying signaling pathways controlling how MSCs respond to different extracellular signals are not as well understood. Recently, Yes-associated protein (YAP), a well-known regulator and coactivator in the Hippo Signaling Pathway, has been shown to function as a nuclear transducer of mechanical signals. YAP is now known to transduce many mechanical signals, including ECM rigidity, cell density, and tensional forces, into cell responses.  \nIn this study, the effect of microfiber morphology and cell confluence on the localization and concentration of YAP protein in mouse mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) was investigated. mMSCs were grown on both flat PMMA surfaces and PHEMA surfaces coated in PMMA microfibers at different cell densities. The cells were allowed to incubate for 24 hours, then were examined using immunofluorescence and DIC microscopy, as well as Western Blot to quantify YAP expression and localization. In a follow up experiment, the effect of different fiber diameters as well as cell confluency on YAP expression and localization was examined. In addition to immunofluorescence and DIC microscopy, samples were separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear components. Western blotting was then used to quantify changes in nuclear and cytoplasmic YAP expression as a function of fiber diameter. Results suggested that cell-cell contact and cell microenvironment have an effect on mMSC YAP localization.

At the heart of each of these distinctions is his understanding of phantasia.  By attending in the De Anima to what Aristotle says about the imagination, but also to how he uses imagination, this project aspires to sketch out a naturalistic account of phantasia.  It takes seriously Aristotle\u2019s suggestion that phantasia is some sort of motion and discloses a unified image of Aristotelian phantasia as the kin\u0113sis by which the intelligible comes to be.  Phantasia is the motion by which the entelecheiae of the extended magnitudes of the perceptible realm come to be the analogical \u2018perceptible things,\u2019 the phantasmata, of the intelligible realm.  This understanding not only attempts to account for phantasia\u2019s seemingly contradictory appearances within the De Anima, but, by means of a metaphoric extension, also considers phantasia\u2019s roles in the Rhetoric, the Poetics, and the De Memoria.  Here, the \u201cmetaphoric phantasia\u201d of DA III.3 428a is found to be the motion by which the intelligible is \u201cbrought before the eyes\u201d and made clear and distinct.  It is the motion by which the intelligible becomes perceptible, and is thus the motion by which metaphors themselves come to be.  And insofar as such \u201cbringing before the eyes\u201d relies on one\u2019s ability to present the entelecheia of a given thought, metaphoric phantasia can also be uncovered as the motion by which apophantical naming itself occurs.  \u201cMetaphoric phantasia\u201d thus makes room for a creative, poetic imagination within Aristotle\u2019s thought, and its link to phantasia per se means that a physics of phantasia is also a physics of language, is an account of how a thing gets to be said as what it is.

OmcB is a cytochrome that is important for both the reduction of soluble and insoluble iron(III) (Leang et al., 2003). Acetate kinase is involved in the metabolism of acetate (Galushko and Schink, 2000). Acetate served as the electron donor and carbon source for Geobacter cells in all experiments. Immunolocalization of these proteins in the biofilm was visualized with transmission electron microscopy. OmcB labeling of the biofilm revealed that OmcB was more abundant at the outer membrane of cells in the outer layers of the biofilm compared to cells closer to the electrode surface. In contrast, acetate kinase was expressed evenly throughout the biofilm. The difference in the abundance of OmcB in the biofilm is consistent with electron acceptor limitation for cells in the outer layers of the biofilm.\n  Differences in protein expression between current-producing biofilm cells and fumarate-grown planktonic cells were investigated using iTRAQ-MS analysis. Some of the proteins that were up regulated in the biofilm cells relative to the planktonic cells are involved in cell division, protein folding, sensing environmental changes or stimuli, signal transduction, DNA synthesis and oxidative stress response. Some of the proteins that were down regulated in the biofilm cells are proteins involved in fumarate metabolism, proteolysis and oxidative stress response. One outer membrane cytochrome (GSU2811) was up regulated in the biofilm cells. Other outer membrane cytochromes such as OmcB, OmcE, OmcS, which play important roles in the iron reduction pathway (Leang et al., 2003; Mehta et al., 2005) were not identified in the iTRAQ study. OmcZ, which is involved in electron transfer to electrodes (Nevin et al., 2009), was identified but not labeled by the iTRAQ reagents and PilA, which is the pilin subunit for the proposed conductive nanowires (Reguera et al., 2005), was also not identified in the iTRAQ study.\n  To determine the expression of these proteins in the current-producing biofilm cells compared to the fumarate-grown planktonic cells, antibodies produced against the purified protein or peptides were used in Western blotting. Both OmcB and OmcS showed a slight difference in expression with slightly less OmcB and slightly more OmcS in the biofilm cells relative to the planktonic cells. Acetate kinase protein AckA-1 was also slightly more intense in the biofilm cells compared to the planktonic cells. More significant differences in expression were seen for OmcZ, PilT-4 and PilA. The 30 kDa OmcZ was more abundant in the biofilm cells compared to the planktonic cells and some of the 50 kDa OmcZ was detected in the planktonic cells, but not in the biofilm cells, indicating incomplete processing of the 50 kDa OmcZ protein by the subtilisin protease in the planktonic cells. Also, PilT-4 was more abundant in the biofilm cells compared to the planktonic cells. PilA however showed no trend in its abundance between biofilm cells and planktonic cells.\n  A difference in the abundance of the outer membrane cytochrome OmcB in the current-producing biofilm based on the cells\u2019 proximity to the anode was demonstrated in this study. In addition, differences in expression for various outer membrane cytochromes and pili proteins were also evaluated.

Isolates (n = 673) were evaluated in a vegetative compatibility group (VCG) assay using red food coloring amended PDA. Macroscopic observations of mycelial interactions between unknown isolates and known tester isolates belonging to VCGs A to K were used to group isolates.  A total of 9 of 11 known VCGs were recovered, however the majority of isolates belonged to VCGs B, C, and K. Of the 673 isolates evaluated, 110 were incompatible with all known VCGs and may represent a greater level of VCG diversity than previously reported. Only 8 of the 11 known VCGs were recovered within Pennsylvania. Select VCGs were more prevalent in different management sites. Isolates belonging to VCG B was well represented across all management sites. While VCG C was also predominate on fairways, tees, and roughs, this VCG was low on greens and VCG E was highly represented. Isolates belonging to different VCGs also exhibited a differential in vitro insensitivity. Isolates belonging to VCG E, F, and G exhibited the highest levels of insensitivity to boscalid, iprodione, and propiconazole and VCGs G, H, and K contained the highest frequency of isolates exhibiting a 4 MDR profile. Relative mycelial growth (RMG) values of isolates were significantly influenced by select curative and preventive fungicide applications. Preventive and curative treatments in 2016 significantly influenced RMG of isolates from the final collection date evaluated against iprodione, and iprodione and propiconazole in vitro, respectively. Isolates exposed to curative treatments of boscalid in 2016 had the highest RMG when evaluated against iprodione and propiconazole. Differences between years were observed when analyzing the mean RMG of isolates collected throughout each growing season and exposed to various curative fungicide treatments. When evaluated against propiconazole and iprodione, a total of two (e.g. chlorothalonil and fluxapyroxad) and six (e.g. chlorothalonil, thiophanate-methyl, iprodione, boscalid, fluxapyroxad, and fluazinam) curative fungicide treatments resulted in higher mean RMG in 2017 compared to 2016, respectively.

Due to their unique physical and chemical properties, magnetic nanoparticles are appealing candidates for biomedical applications and analytical separations. Yet in the absence of methods for assessing and assuring their purity, the ultimate use of magnetic particles and heterostructures is likely to be limited. For magnetic nanoparticles, it is the use of an applied magnetic flux or field gradient that enables separations. Flow based techniques are combined with applied magnetic fields to give methods such as magnetic field flow fractionation and high gradient magnetic separation. Additional techniques have been explored for manipulating particles in microfluidic channels and in mesoporous membranes. This thesis further describes development of these and new analytical tools for separation and analysis of colloidal particles is critically important to enable the practical use of these, particularly for medicinal purposes. \nMeasurement of transport of nanometer scale particles through porous media is important to begin to understand the potential environmental impacts of nanomaterials. Using a diffusion cell with two compartments separated by either a porous alumina or polycarbonate membrane as a model system, diffusive flux through mesoporous materials is examined. Experiments are performed as a function of particle size, pore diameter, and solvent, and the particle fluxes are monitored by the change in absor- bance of the solution in the receiving cell. Using the measured extinction coefficient and change in absorbance of the solution as a function of time, the fluxes of 3, 8, and 14 nm diameter CoFe2O4 particles are determined as they are translocated across pores with diameters 30, 50, 100, and 200 nm in hexane and aqueous solutions. In general, flux decreases with increasing particle size and increases with pore diameter. We find that fluxes are faster in aqueous solutions than in hexane, which is attributed to the hydrophilic nature of the porous membranes and differences in wettability. The impact of an applied magnetic flux gradient, which induces magnetization and motion, on permeation is also examined. For larger membrane pore diameters, applied magnetic fluxes increase the rate of transport of 14 nm CoFe2O4 particles more than that of 3 or 8 nm diameter particles, reflecting their differences in susceptibility. However, larger particles are excluded from membranes with small diameter pores, consistent with magnetic interparticle attractions that reversibly induce magnetic aggregation. \nSurface chemistry plays an important role in determining flux through porous media such as in the environment. Diffusive flux of nanoparticles through alkylsilane modified porous alumina is measured as a model for understanding transport in porous media of differing surface chemistries. Experiments are performed as a function of particle size, pore diameter, attached hydrocarbon chain length and chain terminus, and solvent. Particle fluxes are monitored by the change in absorbance of the solution in the receiving side of a diffusion cell. In general, flux increases when the membranes are modified with alkylsilanes compared to untreated membranes, which is attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the porous membranes and differences in wettability. We find that flux decreases, in both hexane and aqueous solutions, when the hydrocarbon chain lining the interior pore wall increases in length. The rate and selectivity of transport across these membranes is related to the partition coefficient (Kp) and the diffusion coefficient (D) of the permeating species. By conducting experiments as a function of initial particle concentration, we find that KpD increases with increasing particle size, is greater in alkylsilane\u2013modified pores, and larger in hexane solution than water. The impact of the alkylsilane terminus (\u2013CH3, \u2013Br, \u2013NH2, \u2013COOH) on permeation in water is also examined. In water, the highest KpD is observed when the membranes are modified with carboxylic acid terminated silanes and lowest with amine terminated silanes as a result of electrostatic effects during translocation. \nFinally, the manipulation of magnetic nanoparticles for the controlled formation of linked nanoparticle assemblies between microfluidic channels by the application of an external magnet is discussed. Two orthogonal channels were prepared using standard PDMS techniques with pressure-driven flow used to deliver the Fe3O4 and Au nanoparticle reactants. Nanoparticle assembly formation is based upon locally confined surface modification of Fe3O4 nanoparticles interacting with Au nanoparticles bridging the two particles together. For the magnetic particles, transfer between flow streams is greatly increasd by placing a permanent magnet above and below the channel intersections. Multiple configurations of Fe3O4 and Au nanoparticle assemblies are observed as a function of flow rate and interaction time of the individual nanoparticle components. We observe the formation of higher order assemblies by increasing the concentration of Fe3O4 nanoparticles introduced to the microfluidic device. This technique demonstrates the ability to form nanoparticle linked assemblies and could be easily linked to other analytical techniques developed in our lab to further isolate and separate a particular product.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7391], "author_name_tesi": "Stephens, Jason Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Stephens", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Kyle Jeffrey Magnuson Bishop"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams, Dissertation Advisor", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Kyle Jeffrey Magnuson Bishop, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Magnetic Nanoparticles", "Separation", "Transport", "Linked Assembly"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Numerical Simulations of Two-Dimensional Laminar Flow Over Bluff Bodies Using the Immersed Boundary Method with Cartesian Grids\n", "id": "9296", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2599", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The details of flow past bluff bodies are investigated with two computational fluid dynamics solvers.

The implementation of the immersed boundary method is assessed within the framework of NPHASE-PSU through comparisons of flowfields modeled both with and without the use of the immersed boundary method.\n\nThe initial test case consists of steady state two-dimensional laminar flow past a circular cylinder (Re=1). The flowfield is solved initially by using a standard boundary approach on a body-fitted grid. A subsequent study uses a similar body-fitted grid with the immersed boundary method. Finally, a uniform Cartesian grid is coupled with the immersed boundary method. The three flow solutions are compared and their velocity fields and flowfield symmetries are examined in detail.

Histopathological and in vivo labeling studies suggest that this loss occurs most extensively in the caudal part of the putamen and head of the caudate, although the caudate generally is less affected than the putamen. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced striatal (caudate and putamen) volume in PD subjects, yet the exact spatial pattern of striatal atrophy remains unknown.  \n\nObjective: To use shape analysis to delineate the spatial locations of striatal atrophy in relation to the known pattern of dopaminergic terminal loss in PD.\n\nMethods: High resolution T1- and T2-weighted brain MR (3T) images were obtained from 40 PD and 40 controls matched for age distribution and gender. Striatal regions of interest (ROIs) were obtained using an atlas-based automatic segmentation algorithm, followed by manual correction of original and left-right mirrored images. Averaged ROIs were used in order to control rater left-right asymmetric bias. Shape analyses then were conducted using spherical harmonic shape descriptions and point distribution models. The associations between the clinical data and the striatal volumes/shapes also were determined, and adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.\n\nResults: Compared to controls, PD subjects had lower putamen (p<0.001) and caudate (p=0.006) volumes. The greatest magnitudes of surface contractions in the PD striatum were located at the caudal putamen (p<0.005) and on the head and dorsal body of the caudate (p<0.005). Differences were detected even in relatively newly diagnosed patients (p<0.005). Contractions on the dorsolateral and rostral ventrolateral surfaces of the putamen were correlated with lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores (p<0.005).\n\nConclusions: The spatial distribution of striatal atrophy is consistent with the known pattern of nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminal losses in PD, and the shape differences between PD and controls are apparent even in early stages of the disease. Thus, shape characteristics may be useful for reflecting striatal pathological changes and thus for monitoring PD progression in vivo. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to report shape differences between the putamen of PD and control subjects.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8575], "author_name_tesi": "Sterling, Nicholas William", "last_name_ssi": "Sterling", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Allen Lloyd"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Allen Lloyd, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["parkinson", "shape", "putamen", "caudate", "shape volume"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Tracking and Understanding Parkinson\u2019s Disease Progression Through the Lens of Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "id": "27705", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12283", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that typically begins with prodromal non-motor symptoms (such as loss of olfaction and sleep dysfunction) and relatively subtle motor changes (such as reduced arm swing). The current clinical diagnosis is based on the presence of classic motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor at rest. As PD progresses, many patients develop severe motor (including gait and postural changes) and cognitive disability which ultimately lead to the loss of independence. The current treatment of PD is mainly based on management of symptoms, and there is no known therapy that can halt or reverse the progression of neuropathology. As life expectancies increase globally, PD is expected to double in prevalence over the next 25 years. Neuroprotective strategies that can modify the course of the disease, therefore, are critically needed. Past efforts to identify, understand and evaluate potentially neuroprotective treatments for PD, however, have been hindered by the lack of cellular or animal model that exactly mimic human disease, and the lack of objective and reliable in vivo markers of PD-related pathology in humans. The goals of this research were to identify structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of PD progression and utilize these markers to understand the factors that may influence the progression of PD. \n\nAfter providing an introduction that underscores the importance of my research goals (Section I) and the strengths and limitations of the approaches that I used (versus the current art of the field), I discuss in Section II the use of structural magnetic resonance imaging to explore gray matter changes in various stages of PD. Striatal atrophy was found to be related to early changes in PD, and cortical atrophy (particularly loss of cortical folding) was found to be associated with worsening clinical symptoms and longer disease duration. These findings were consistent with the known pathologic trajectory of PD, where PD-related pathology affects brainstem and nigrostriatal structures well before the time of diagnosis, and Lewy pathology subsequently progresses in an ascending fashion to later involve higher-level cortex structures. In Section III, I examine the relationships between cortical gray matter atrophy and changes in subcortical white matter. Poorer subcortical white matter diffusion characteristics were found to be associated with cortical atrophy in PD, and opposite associations were found in control subjects. \n\nThese data provided the foundation for Section IV, where I utilized these newly described cortical imaging markers, along with changes in cognitive function, to explore the role of plasma cholesterol in PD. The link between plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and PD had been pioneered by my research mentor\u2019s laboratory, and the studies described in this dissertation are the first attempts to associate LDL-cholesterol with specific in vivo cortical changes in PD. This relationship, if proven, may be a topic of high public health relevance, given the widespread use of cholesterol-lowering therapies. Higher plasma cholesterol, indeed, was found to be associated with preserved cognitive function and delayed loss of cortical gyrification in PD. Finally, I summarize in Section V the clinical and scientific implications of my work and offer future clinical and research directions. Of note, I propose that structural imaging measurements of the cortex are useful as markers of PD progression, and that subcortical white matter changes associated with cortical atrophy are an aspect of PD that may reflect altered neuroplasticity during PD progression. Finally, I show that higher plasma cholesterol is associated with delayed loss of cortical gyrification and slower motor and cognitive decline in PD, supporting the hypothesis drawn from case-control and epidemiological data. Thus, my research has shown how structural MRI can offer powerful biomarkers to gauge PD progression and also provide clues about how specific factors might influence the course of PD.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11664], "author_name_tesi": "Sterling, Nicholas William", "last_name_ssi": "Sterling", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Xuemei Huang", "Xuemei Huang", "Thomas Allen Lloyd", "Diane M Thiboutot", "Ming Wang", "Martin Styner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Xuemei Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Xuemei Huang, Committee Chair", "Thomas Allen Lloyd, Committee Member", "Diane M Thiboutot, Committee Member", "Ming Wang, Committee Member", "Martin Styner, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Parkinson's disease", "cholesterol", "imaging", "neuroprotection"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Study of Competencies and Competency-Based Human Resource Management: Exploring Practices and Perspectives of Selected Senior Human Resource Leaders/Practitioners\n", "id": "11318", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1438", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n     The purpose of this research study was to explore competencies and competency-\n\nbased human resource management (CBHRM) practices and perspectives of selected \n\nsenior human resource leaders/practitioners and thought leaders.

We hypothesized that during hill walking and hill transitions, participants will alter gait parameters to achieve greater anterior-posterior and medial-lateral stability. Additionally, we hypothesized that these observed differences will be less in textured insole footwear worn during locomotion and that, compared to healthy adults, children age 3 \u2013 6 will present greater differences in temporal-spatial gait parameters between the level and hill walking tasks. Results showed that the level to downhill transition poses the greatest challenge to both anterior-posterior and medial-lateral stability. Compared to level walking, speed and step length were significantly less during the L-DN stride and speed, step length, and stance time variability, step width, and base of support area significantly increased. During the same stride, wearing textured insoles resulted in less lower limb muscle activity and improved response to medial-lateral stability as measured by step width. Finally, during level, uphill, and downhill walking, gait variability is significantly greater in children as compared to adults and this variability significantly increases from level to downhill walking in the child group only.

One theoretical foundation was communication privacy management theory, which discusses the process by which people negotiate privacy boundaries and coordinate information management. The revelation risk model identified factors that contribute to the sharing of sensitive information. Finally, mechanisms specified within the relational turbulence model were used to predict situations in which boundary turbulence might be particularly prominent. Hypotheses specified that stigma (H1), communication efficacy (H2), and perceived closeness (H3) are associated with the amount of disclosure to social network members, and that facets of relational uncertainty (H4) and partner interference (H5) would have a negative association with boundary turbulence between spouses.\nTo test these hypotheses, a study of married couples coping with infertility was conducted. Using a systematic process, couples selected five social convoy members and partners each reported characteristics of their relationships with those people, as well as details about their infertility-related disclosures to them.  Each partner also completed questionnaires about their infertility experience and characteristics of their marriage. In total, 100 individuals (50 husbands and 50 wives) reported on a total of 500 social convoy relationships. \nResults from hierarchical linear modeling documented a negative association between facets of stigma and disclosure, as well as positive associations between both communication efficacy and perceived closeness and disclosures to social convoy members. Furthermore, as predicted, facets of relational uncertainty and partner interference were positively associated with boundary turbulence; which was operationalized as relative discomfort with partner disclosure, individuals\u2019 perceptions that their spouses think their disclosures are acceptable, and discrepancies between husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 disclosures. This discussion highlights the theoretical advances promoted by considering individual, marital, and social network member characteristics when examining disclosure, and considering how characteristics of the marriage and the social network contribute to boundary turbulence between spouses.  \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3533], "author_name_tesi": "Steuber, Keli Ryan", "last_name_ssi": "Steuber", "middle_name_ssi": "Ryan", "first_name_ssi": "Keli", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Denise Haunani Solomon", "Denise Haunani Solomon", "Jon F Nussbaum", "Rachel Annette Smith", "Alan Booth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Denise Haunani Solomon, Dissertation Advisor", "Denise Haunani Solomon, Committee Chair", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member", "Rachel Annette Smith, Committee Member", "Alan Booth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["infertility", "marital quality", "privacy management", "social networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "THE PROSODIC-SYNTACTIC STRUCTURE OF INTRA-SENTENTIAL MULTI-WORD CODE-SWITCHING IN THE NEW MEXICO SPANISH-ENGLISH BILINGUAL COMMUNITY", "id": "15127jws356", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15127", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines the prosody of spontaneous code-switching, broadly defined as the alternation of languages in the same conversation. While recent findings from phonetic (e.g. Fricke, Kroll, & Dussias, 2016) and psycholinguistic (e.g. Tamargo, Kroff, & Dussias, 2016) research suggest that bilinguals may utilize certain features to anticipate an upcoming language switch, studies of prosodic patterns in production have been lacking. A large sample of multi-word code-switches (MWCS; n = 407) comprised of at least two words in English and Spanish is taken from the New Mexico Spanish-English Bilingual corpus (Torres Cacoullos & Travis, in prep), a collection of sociolinguistic interviews from members of a speech community where code-switching is a discourse mode (i.e. a community norm). The data are transcribed in Intonation Units (IUs) (see Du Bois, Schuetze-Coburn, Cummings, & Paolino, 1993), which enables the analysis of the linguistic properties of MWCS at the interface of prosody and syntax. \n\nThis study utilizes a novel unit for the study of code-switching: The prosodic sentence (PS), defined using intonation (see Chafe, 1994). The PS is the basis for characterizing intra-sentential MWCS according to prosodic-syntactic factors: the prosodic position of MWCS (across-IUs versus IU-internally within a single IU), pause expression (pauses expressed at the beginning/end of an IU versus IU-internally), transitional continuity (the intonation contour of the IU preceding a target IU), length measures (number of IUs, words, seconds), and switch direction (which captures the language a speaker code-switches into within the PS). To provide accountability in analysis, bilingual PSs containing MWCS (n = 323) are systematically compared with two sets of PSs. The first is constituted by otherwise unilingual PSs containing a noun of other-language origin (\u201cLOLI-nouns\u201d; Spanish-origin (n = 78), English-origin (n = 216)). The second is the benchmark of entirely unilingual PSs (n = 584) with a lexical Spanish (n = 231) or English (n = 238) noun (\u201cnouns\u201d) (n total nouns = 763).         \n\nOverall, clear prosodic-syntactic properties of spontaneous MWCS emerge. First, an analysis of prosodic position indicates a strong speaker preference for code-switching across prosodic boundaries (i.e. IU boundaries) rather than IU-internally. However, when it comes to LOLI-nouns, the preferred prosodic position\u2014at the very beginning or end of the IU rather than in IU-medial position\u2014is mirrored in the prosodic position of nouns in unilingual PSs. Second, with respect to pause expression, more unfilled pauses are produced at the beginning of IUs containing an IU-internal MWCS, whereas pauses preceding MWCS across-IUs tend to be filled pauses such as uh and eh. The same asymmetry between unfilled and filled pauses is observed within IUs immediately preceding an IU-internal MWCS (although IU-internal pauses are infrequent compared to IU-initial pauses). While the rate and type of pause expression varies according to the prosodic position of MWCS, helping to differentiate between each prosodic position, pause expression does not vary to a similar degree in the unilingual PSs. Thus, it appears that when code-switching, speakers tend to prosodically separate the two languages through pauses, regardless of whether the code-switch is positioned across-IUs or IU-internally. \n\nThird, truncation was examined as a possible indicator of relatively heavier cognitive load, as a test of the hypothesis that code-switching is cognitively costly. On the one hand, IU-internal MWCS are found to be more often preceded by a truncated IU than are MWCS across-IUs, which may indicate that IU-internal MWCS is more demanding than across-IU MWCS. However, contrary to the hypothesis, MWCS occur on average no more after truncation than continuing intonation as compared to unilingual IUs in the same PS, indicating that code-switching is no less fluid than speech produced in just one language. Fourth, a first-time quantification of various length measures of bilingual and unilingual PSs reveals differences, although the greater length of bilingual PSs may to some extent reflect the operational definition of bilingual PSs as containing at least two contiguous words in each language.\n\nFinally, when switch direction is considered, the prosodic-syntactic factors examined vary according to the language a speaker code-switches into. In contrast, the prosodic features of unilingual PSs in English versus Spanish do not differ for these New Mexican bilingual speakers. This result provides additional evidence for particular prosodic patterns in MWCS. Together, the findings highlight the unique prosodic-syntactic signature of MWCS as compared to unilingual stretches where MWCS are absent, part of the norms for combining two languages in bilingual communities.

These two subjects intersect for both obvious and less-obvious reasons. New Orleans is, of course, the nation\u2019s depository and hub for fun, freedom, and cultural exchange. I argue that connotations of celebration, as in a \u201csocial event,\u201d are not divorced from what we see as sociological interaction. Thus, many of my readings of texts emphasize moments of excessive pleasure and desire, or meditations on collectivities in carnivalesque action. I pair a desire for Otherness in local-color writing with the discourse of \u201csocial equality,\u201d or, for another example, antebellum quadroon balls with postbellum prognostications of large-scale racial \u201cmiscegenation.\u201d In other words, I argue that New Orleans shows us how social order and sociality\u2019s affects overlap and influence one another throughout the nineteenth century.\nSocial Lives contributes to the fields of aesthetics, transnationalism, and African-American literature especially where they intersect with notions of publicity or collectivity. A large body of scholarship posits a pure form of (social) interaction as prior to and more real than any recognizable or named social order. My intervention involves exploring the way that nineteenth-century texts theorize the idea of the social before the professionalization of sociology. My dissertation finds that there are many more ways that the social takes formal shape at different scales of the local, regional, and global. Moreover, part of my interest is to emphasize New Orleans\u2019s importance to African-American literature\u2014not a surprising claim but one, I argue, that has not been examined as a distinctly social issue, as opposed to the many studies of cultural traditions in the city. This new understanding of New Orleans\u2019s social lives engages issues surrounding slavery and the \u201cNegro Problem\u201d in the nineteenth century, showing how New Orleans helped writers to understand their aesthetic and political projects. \n\nThe \u201csocial\u201d looks different in each of the project\u2019s chapters in order to capture its mobility and ambiguity in reference to structure, relation, interaction, or entertainment.

Geologically rapid changes in lithospheric loading during ice-sheet growth and decay produce large changes in the effective stress state beneath and near the ice sheet. Cyclic loading will cause oscillating melt volume in deep rocks, and the nonlinear increase of melt-migration velocity with melt fraction means that extended ice-age cycling likely enhances upward melt migration over several cycles. Computationally efficient simulations resolving flexural stresses from ice-sheet/lithosphere interactions result in widespread occurrence of stresses sufficient to allow dike emplacement across all reasonable ranges of parameters in this system. Modeled stresses in the shallow crust tend to be compressive beneath an ice sheet and tensile in the forebulge, with opposite-sign anomalies beneath. The stress patterns migrate laterally with ice-sheet growth and shrinkage, with magnitudes that depend somewhat on the rate of ice-sheet change, as well as on the ice-sheet thickness and on focusing from variations in bedrock topography and crustal thickness. Magma could move upward through dike emplacement in regions of strongly tensile stresses, and the migration of the stress pattern suggests the possibility of multi-step transport upward, thereby transporting heat closer to the base of the ice sheet. Large shear stresses are modeled some places extending through most of the crustal thickness; vug waves or other shear-related transport mechanisms thus may allow magma migration from deep in the crust to near the surface. Fracturing from flexural stresses might also increase upper-crustal permeability, promoting groundwater flow that also moves heat upwards. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the regions of anomalously high geothermal flux beneath Greenland\u2019s ice sheet arose from ice-age cycling of the Greenland ice sheet, enhancing melt extraction from a deep source and emplacement near or at the base of the ice sheet, with correspondingly enhanced geothermal flux and possibly volcanism.

In order to improve the processing and properties of Nd:YAG transparent ceramics and facilitate increased adoption, this dissertation explores the effects of sintering aids on defects, densification and single crystal conversion (SCC) of Nd:YAG ceramics.</p>\n   <p>To explore the role of SiO<sub>2</sub> doping in densification and microstructure development of Nd:YAG transparent ceramics, 1 at% Nd:YAG powders were doped with 0.035-0.28 wt% SiO<sub>2</sub> and vacuum sintered between 1484<sup>o</sup>C and 1750<sup>o</sup>C. <sup>29</sup>Si magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance showed that Si<sup>4+</sup> substitutes onto tetrahedrally coordinated Al<sup>3+</sup> sites at sintering temperatures > 1600<sup>o</sup>C. High resolution transmission electron microscopy showed no grain boundary second phases for all silica levels in samples sintered at 1600-1750<sup>o</sup>C. Coarsening was limited by a solute drag mechanism as suggested by cubic grain growth kinetics and TEM energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy observations of increased Nd<sup>3+</sup> concentration near grain boundaries.  Increasing SiO<sub>2</sub> content increased both densification and grain growth rate and led to increasingly coarsening-dominated sintering trajectories.  The average grain size could be controlled (2.8 &#956;m \u2013 18 &#956;m) in highly transparent ceramics using a combination of SiO<sub>2</sub> content, sintering temperature, and sintering time. </p>\n   <p>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub> was shown to act as a transient liquid phase sintering aid that reduces the sintering temperature of Nd:YAG ceramics to 1600<sup>o</sup>C. 1 at% Nd:YAG ceramics were doped with 0.34-1.35 mol% B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub> and sintered between 1100<sup>o</sup>C and 1700<sup>o</sup>C. Dilatometric measurements showed that B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub> additions increase the densification rate during intermediate stage sintering relative to SiO<sub>2</sub> doped samples. B<sup>3+</sup> content is reduced to < 5 ppm in the samples at temperatures above 1500<sup>o</sup>C, as determined by mass spectrometry. For B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub> doped samples, final stage densification and grain growth follow a more densifying sintering trajectory than SiO<sub>2</sub> doped 1 at% Nd:YAG ceramics because B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub> doping reduces SiO<sub>2</sub> content during final stage densification. The increased densification kinetics during intermediate stage sintering lead to highly transparent (84% in-line transmission at 400 nm) Nd:YAG ceramics when sintered at 1600<sup>o</sup>C in either vacuum or flowing O<sub>2</sub>.  </p>\n  <p> Optical absorption spectroscopy and electron spin resonance were used to study the effects of SiO<sub>2</sub> doping on color center formation in Nd:YAG transparent ceramics. The primary color centers in sintered samples were F and F<sup>+</sup>-centers as evidenced by optical absorption in the 250 nm to 400 nm wavelength range and the presence of an electron spin resonance line at g = 1.9977. Annealing in air at 1600<sup>o</sup>C for 10 h eliminated/reduced the number of color centers in the sample.  The color center induced optical absorption was similar in the 280 nm to 400 nm wavelength range between 0.035 wt% and 0.28 wt% SiO<sub>2</sub> doped 1 at% Nd:YAG. This indicates that SiO<sub>2</sub> doping has little or no effect on color center formation during sintering. Instead, color center formation was shown to be controlled by oxidation and reduction of variable valence impurity ions, primarily Fe<sup>2+/3+</sup>.  After irradiating samples with ultraviolet light, optical absorption increased in the 250 nm to 800 nm wavelength range.  Optical absorption in this range was associated with the formation of aggregate F-centers such as F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> centers.  After ultraviolet irradiation, two overlapping electron spin resonance lines were observed at g = 1.9987 and g = 2.0232 that are consistent with F<sup>+</sup>- and O<sub>h</sub>- center formation.  SiO<sub>2</sub> content did not affect irradiation induced color center formation, as shown by similar optical absorption and electron spin resonance spin counts in 0.035 and 0.28 wt% SiO<sub>2</sub> doped 1 at% Nd:YAG transparent ceramics.  </p>\n   <p>  Two different single crystal conversion methods have been demonstrated for Nd:YAG ceramics.  The solid state method utilizes SiO<sub>2</sub> to increase grain boundary mobility at the seed crystal/polycrystal interface leading to crystals up to 5 mm x 5 mm x 460 &#956;m.  Exaggerated grain growth in highly SiO<sub>2</sub> doped 1 at% Nd:YAG ceramics was found to depend on both SiO<sub>2</sub> content and temperature.

Accordingly, nonverbal sensitivity is necessary for smooth communication and social adaptability. Interestingly, basic emotion perception has largely been shown to be universal across cultures, though small intracultural advantages have also been documented. Two theories may help explain these advantages. First, nonverbal behavior may carry with it cultural dialects, or small, physical differences in the expression of emotions and mental states that vary from one culture to the next that, coupled with culturally defined perceptual attunements to such features, may facilitate accurate decoding of same- versus other-culture members. Second, social categorization, the tendency to allocate more attentional resources to the processing of ingroup targets than to outgroup targets, may influence the ability to properly process emotional or mental state expressions.

While black feminists have rescued Hurston via her gender and sexual politics (black love is political), they have done so largely by divorcing her thoughts on race from this position. However, this dissertation revives Hurston\u2019s position on black liberation politics by introducing the concept called \u201cthe politics of joy,\u201d which recovers the interplay of race, gender, class, region, and religion in Hurston\u2019s critique of contemporary black leadership. Development of this concept is a contribution to black feminism, intersectionality studies, African American and Africana philosophy, and social political philosophy through its implications on concepts of race, gender, sexuality, class, and agency. To develop this concept, this dissertation will draw upon a range of historical figures (W.E.B. Du Bois, Anna Julia Cooper, Richard Wright, John Dewey); a significant portion of the corpus of Hurston\u2019s work (letters, memoirs, essays, and folklore material); black feminist thinkers and contemporary philosophers (Audre Lorde, Patricia Hill Collins, Toni Morrison, James Baldwin, Cornel West, Angela Davis, Eddie Glaude, Saba Mahmood, Michel Foucault); and cultural work (past and current) done on hoodoo/Voodoo ( Kamelaah Martin, Katrina Hazzard-Buzzard, Jeffery Anderson). Through an analysis of Hurston\u2019s folklore material on religion, this dissertation will demonstrate how black liberation politics is often classed gendered, classed, and regionalized. With hoodoo/Voodoo material as a case study, this dissertation will show that concepts of agency need to be expanded beyond the register of resistance: for there are practices which cultivate resistance but cannot be read as simply resistance. Moreover, this dissertation will show that joy is political in two senses. Not only does representation of joy (i.e. folklore) in black life reveal intra-group tensions, but it also, in a deeper sense, addresses a dimension of black liberation that resistance cannot.

Using Bravo Network\u2019s commercially successful The Real Housewives of Atlanta as a case study, this thesis explores the formation of the Black housewife.

Bravo\u2019s successful The Real Housewives series documents the lifestyles of several sets of housewives from different cities/states across the United States. Of the seven different casts in this series, The Real Housewives of Atlanta (RHOA) is the only one to feature Black women, as well as showcase a majority African-American cast. RHOA is an important case study as it reinforces and challenges the normality of the exploitation of the Black woman in media in return for ratings. Though stereotypical portrayals of women of color are all-too-familiar within mainstream television, RHOA is different because this specific cast, still riddled with racist and sexist stereotypes, is Bravo\u2019s Real Housewives series ratings frontrunner. Thus, this study contributes to media studies research on race and gender.

Many classes of contaminants can be reduced by ferrous iron (Fe2+) associated with iron oxides in subsurface anoxic environments. These include contaminants containing nitroaromatic functional groups, which are common due to their widespread release into the environment as pesticides and explosives. Understanding the transformations of these chemicals is essential for determining how to remediate contaminated sites. Nitrobenzene is a useful proxy for nitroaromatic contaminants because it provides a relatively simple model system that can give insight into how more complex or less reactive chemicals are transformed in the environment.\nWhile the reduced products that form as a result of these reactions are often well characterized, the rates at which they occur are typically difficult to predict. Measured values from well-controlled laboratory studies frequently vary by orders of magnitude. In principle, these rates can be described and possibly estimated by the thermodynamic driving force of the reaction (e.g., reduction potential values for the reductant and oxidant), but demonstrating this has been difficult to test due to the difficulty in obtaining meaningful and reliable reduction potential values for iron redox couples. Recently, that limitation was overcome using mediated potentiometry, a technique that has led to a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamics of Fe2+-Fe oxy(hydr)oxide redox couples. Using mediated potentiometry, reduction potentials for these redox couples can be measured, predicted, and controlled.\nThe ability to determine reduction potential of the Fe2+-Fe oxide couple introduces the opportunity to evaluate the relationship between reaction rates and thermodynamic parameters. In this study, I hypothesized that reduction potentials could be used to explain redox reaction rates between nitrobenzene and the Fe2+-goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH) couple. This was tested by measuring nitrobenzene reduction rates as a function of solution pH, Fe2+ concentration, and goethite loading. With these results, the reduction potential of the Fe2+-goethite couple was correlated with the reaction rate constant over all solution conditions using a linear free energy relationship (LFER). The reduction of nitrobenzene was rate-limited by the first electron transfer and the first proton transfer steps, which appeared to be coupled. The best correlation for the data was achieved by normalizing the reaction rate constant to surface area of the oxide, implying nitrobenzene was reduced at the oxide surface by delocalized electrons within the solid, rather than directly by discrete oxide-associated Fe2+ sites.\nThis LFER was further used to determine how changing the goethite particle size, and hence its thermodynamic properties, influence nitrobenzene reduction rates. From experiments with nanogoethite-associated Fe2+, it was found that the surface area normalized reaction rates for nitrobenzene with the Fe2+-nanogoethite couple were better described by the reduction potential of micron-sized goethite than that of nanogoethite. This data suggests that reduction rates by goethite-associated Fe2+ kinetically depend on the surface area of the oxide, but the thermodynamic driving force of the reaction only depends on the standard reduction potential of bulk goethite. These conclusions were further supported by comparisons to data in the literature for goethite and hematite-catalyzed reactions with substituted nitrobenzenes. Previously reported reaction rates correlated well with the LFER developed in this study.\nThese results corroborate the hypothesis that redox reactions involving Fe2+-Fe oxy(hydr)oxide couples could be explained by growth of the oxy(hydr)oxide crystals. The reduction potential of this reaction describes the thermodynamic driving force of nitroaromatic reduction, and the reaction rate is related to the surface area of the oxides. Ultimately, this work provides insight into the mechanisms of important environmental transformations, and can lead to improved predictive models for contaminant reduction rates as a function of geochemical conditions.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14063], "author_name_tesi": "Stewart, Sydney M", "last_name_ssi": "Stewart", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Sydney", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher A.

There is concern that burning such natural gas in power plants causes additional radon to be emitted into the surrounding atmosphere.  On the University Park campus of The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State), radon enhancements were both measured and modeled for areas surrounding their two power plants.  The three-part study first involved measuring ambient outdoor radon concentrations upwind and downwind of the power plants for several months.  Observation sites were located at distances ranging from 80 m to 310 m away from the power plant stacks.  The West Campus Steam Plant (WCSP) sites were placed on rooftops to best capture the plume from an elevated stack.  For each plant, one site served as a background site, while the other three sites measured radon concentration enhancements downwind.  Second, several samples of natural gas were measured for radon, and third, a Gaussian plume dispersion model was used to predict the radon concentrations from the power plants given their emission rates.  These predictions are then compared to the measured enhancements in radon downwind of the plants in order to determine whether the observed radon concentration enhancements may be attributed to the power plant emissions.  Ambient outdoor radon measurements were consistently low, averaging 34.5 Bq m-3 around the East Campus Steam Plant (ECSP) and 31.6 Bq m-3 around the WCSP from August 2014 through January 2015, as compared to the EPA action level of 148 Bq m-3.   Significant concentrations of radon were detected in the natural gas, ranging from 516.4 to 1,242.0 Bq m-3.

Using a survey of all VJOs and semi-structured interviews, this study describes the eligibility requirements of the 17 VTCs currently in Pennsylvania, outlines the various eligibility requirements of other courts, and explores the differences among them. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10672], "author_name_tesi": "Stigerwalt, Sarah Beth", "last_name_ssi": "Stigerwalt", "middle_name_ssi": "Beth", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Criminal Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anne Sumner Douds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anne Sumner Douds, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Veteran Treatment Courts", "Veterans", "Eligibility"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Cooling Performance of Additively Manufactured Microchannels and Film Cooling Holes", "id": "14447cks156", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14447", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Additive manufacturing (AM) enables fabrication of components that cannot be made with any other manufacturing method. Significant advances in metal-based AM systems have made this technology feasible for building production parts to be used use in commercial products. In particular, the gas turbine industry benefits from AM as a manufacturing technique especially for development of components subjected to high heat flux. It has been shown that the use of microchannels in high heat flux components can lead to more efficient cooling designs than those that presently exist. The current manufacturing methods have prevented the use of microchannels in such parts, but AM now makes them manufacturable. However, before such designs can become a reality, much research must be done to characterize impacts on flow and heat transfer of AM parts. The current study considers the effect on flow and heat transfer through turbine cooling features made with AM. Specifically, the performance of microchannels and film cooling holes made with laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is assessed.\nA number of test coupons containing microchannels were built from high temperature alloy powders on a commercially available L-PBF machine. Pressure drop and heat transfer experiments characterized the flow losses and convective heat transfer of air passing through the channels at various Reynolds numbers and Mach numbers. The roughness of the channels\u2019 surfaces was characterized in terms of statistical roughness parameters; the morphology of the roughness was examined qualitatively. Magnitude and morphology of surface roughness found on AM parts is unlike any form of roughness seen in the literature. It was found that the high levels of roughness on AM surfaces result in markedly augmented pressure loss and heat transfer at all Reynolds numbers, and conventional flow and heat transfer correlations produce erroneous estimates. The physical roughness measurements made in this study were correlated to flow and heat transfer measurements to generate a predictive model for flow through AM microchannels. The flow compressibility was also found to play a significant role in flow loss through these channels.\nOverall effectiveness of film cooling combined with the internal microchannel flow was examined in a conjugate experimental setup. The validity of the experimental conditions was established by matching important dimensionless parameters of the experimental setup to common values found in turbine engines. These results showed that the roughness in the film cooling holes produced higher in-hole convection than those made with current manufacturing methods. The roughness in the holes also repressed the film performance. However, high relative roughness was shown to minimize the impact of coolant feed direction on the film effectiveness of the AM holes.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15064], "author_name_tesi": "Stimpson, Curtis Kent", "last_name_ssi": "Stimpson", "middle_name_ssi": "Kent", "first_name_ssi": "Curtis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole", "Karen Ann Thole", "Stephen P Lynch", "Rui Ni", "Edward William Reutzel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Chair", "Stephen P Lynch, Committee Member", "Rui Ni, Committee Member", "Edward William Reutzel, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Additive Manufacturing", "Convection", "Heat Transfer", "Microchannel", "Roughness", "Film Cooling", "Laser Powder Bed Fusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Analyzing Highway Median Safety Through Vehicle Dynamics Simulations\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9993", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3023", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents an analysis of highway median safety through the use of dynamic simulations of vehicles.

The simulations indicate that overall safety of a median depends on the occurrence of both vehicle rollover and median crossover incidents. Based on this data, as the design engineer develops a new median, they can optimize a particular median geometry to prevent rollover or crossover events. Further results provide bumper height traces which allow engineers to design barriers at specific heights and at particular offsets within the median to maximize safety in the event of an off-road excursion.\n\nTo validate the simulation, vehicle trajectories from previous full-scale experimental crash tests, provided by The Texas Transportation Institute, were considered. Further verification of the aggregate simulation results was carried out by comparing them to statistical data from both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Traffic Safety Facts and the National Cooperative Highway Research Program Project 22-21.

Additionally, the presence of more women in engineering courses may positively influence women\u2019s persistence through peer reinforcement and the mitigation of possible social identity threat.  This study explored differing degree outcomes for four cohorts of baccalaureate men and women (N=3,087) in a selective undergraduate engineering program by examining persistence at three levels:  within the institution, within engineering, and within the originally intended engineering major, using three nested logistic regressions with increasingly restrictive criteria.  The study hypothesized positive relationships between women and grades, between women and the proportion of other women in engineering-related courses (female density), and a conditional relationship among being female, grades, and female density. Women with high grades and a higher female density in courses should be more likely to persist in their originally chosen major or within engineering than men in the same situation.\n\nThe findings did not support these hypotheses.  Grades influenced men and women equally at the institution and major levels. At the engineering level, however, men were more grade sensitive than women when earning equal GPAs after the first year in college.  In terms of female density, the study found negative main effects at all three levels.  Moreover, the negative interaction between being female and female density approached significance at the engineering level.

The next phase involved using this hybrid methodology to develop a model that will profile exemplary business market managers using a prospective naturalistic inquiry methodology. This research was conducted using a modified Delphi technique where the initial Delphic instrument was created using a literature review, interviews and expert review panels.\nAgreement within the groups was measured for each competency in order to assess levels of consensus, differences within the groups were measured to identify controversial competencies and inter-rater reliability was measured to assess the consistency of the ratings. Competencies were clustered in order of importance and a competency \u201ckernel\u201d was identified. The Delphi panelists were selected using a purposive non-probabilistic dual-stage stratified sampling technique mixed with a snowball approach. The subjects represented three continents and a wide range of expertise.\nThe design of the competency model entailed three main steps: construction, de-construction and reconstruction. In the construction phase, 153 competencies were identified, arranged into 17 functional clusters and rated. Using the quantitative data, the model was deconstructed and its various parts examined. It was later reconstructed based on the results of the analysis.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency therefore regulates the emissions of nitrogen oxides through the Clean Air Act and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  Approximately 14% of all NOx emissions are produced by the electric power sector and as a result, regulations are often applied directly to the sector. However despite the success of regulations at reducing the amount of NOx emissions over the last several decades, areas not meeting the ozone NAAQS still persist. Further reductions of emissions using current approaches result in rapidly increasing marginal costs.  As a product, new research is needed to design and evaluate the effectiveness of alternative regulatory designs in reducing ground-level ozone. \n     This thesis seeks to evaluate and compare three regulatory designs: undifferentiated pricing, time differentiated pricing, and time and space differentiated pricing. Undifferentiated pricing is used to represent the current Cross-state Air Pollution Rule with constant emissions prices. Time differentiated pricing sets a higher emission price on days designated as having increased ozone formation. Time and space differentiated pricing would operate similarly to time differentiated pricing, except that different emission prices are applied to different regions. A unit commitment model is used to simulate the different regulatory designs for a study region based on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and to evaluate the cost and emissions impacts on the system. The short-term impacts result from the redispatching of resources to lower emitting generators and to generators not located within a region marked by higher permit prices. \n     The results show that of the scenarios analyzed, time and space differentiated pricing is cost effective at reducing NOx emission prices in the nonattainment region on high ozone days, while time differentiation was the most cost-effective method at reducing system-wide emissions on high ozone days. The study also demonstrates the importance of the relative price differential between the emission prices of regions when utilizing time and space differentiated pricing. In particular, smaller differentials result in the greatest reduction in both the nonattainment and system-wide emissions.  Very large differentials induce a shift of lower emitting gas generation in nonattainment regions to higher emitting coal generation in attainment regions, which increases the net NOx emissions for the system as a whole. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11839], "author_name_tesi": "Stines, Zachary O'cain", "last_name_ssi": "Stines", "middle_name_ssi": "O'cain", "first_name_ssi": "Zachary", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mort D Webster"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mort D Webster, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ozone", "NOx", "Electricity", "Differentiated", "Emissions", "Spatial"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Passive Optical Limiting in Long Timescales\n", "id": "10721", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4453", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "From its use in medicine to measure and/or probe various physiologies to commercial applications such as data storage on optical disks, the laser has positively contributed to the lives of people around the globe.

Given the plethora of radiation sources available, it is of significant value to identify a means by which optical limiting can be achieved simultaneously for a wide berth of source parameters.  That said, this document focuses on the exploration of a particular optical limiting modality applied to long timescales;  That is- optical pulses with durations on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds, microseconds and up to continuous-wave.  Given that this modality has been previously shown to be broadband and effective in short timescales, evidence of it\u2019s efficacy in long timescales would demonstrate the modality as an exceptional option in the design of truly robust optical limiting devices.\nThe results of L34 optical limiting trials with incident laser light at a 750nm wavelength and pulse durations in the microsecond and nanosecond regimes as well as continuous-wave light at 532nm are shown and discussed.  Results are discussed for both bulk and liquid-infiltrated capillary-array arrangements and for various output light collection configurations.  The mechanisms by which limiting action occurs are discussed and their optimization within various configurations is considered.\nThrough measurement in a variety of experimental situations and device configurations, the organic liquid L34 is shown to be an effective optical limiting material in long timescales.

Traditionally, this light is generated using dye lasers or tapered amplifier systems. Here we describe a diode pumped solid state ring\nlaser system utilizing a Nd:YVO4 gain crystal.

An area that is currently lacking in these models is the interaction of microbial influences with other hydrological processes. The reduction of iron oxides in anaerobic soil has been shown to coincide with the release of soluble reduced iron as well as phosphate that was associated with the iron oxide surfaces. Most research has focused on correlating soil properties with the amount of ferrous iron and phosphate released, which has left a significant gap in knowledge about the microbial component of this process. \nTo further study changes in the relative abundance of soil microbes during the reduction of iron oxides, soil microcosms were flooded with water to induce anaerobic conditions. Chemical analyses were performed to monitor ferrous iron, phosphate, dissolved organic carbon, pH, and electrical conductivity and soil samples were collected for nucleic acid extraction to monitor changes in the soil microbial community structure. Because of changes caused by gamma sterilization on control samples and the likelihood of resorption of soluble analytes, chemical data were not able to conclusively establish when/if microbial iron reduction was occurring. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the soil microbial community taken during different time points after flooding showed an increase in the relative abundance of Pseudomonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae families. Both of these families contain some species that are known to be capable of anaerobic respiration, which could explain their increased abundance at later time points once oxygen concentrations were lower. Additionally, Rhodocyclaceae contains the genera Ferribacterium and Rhodocyclus. Ferribactierum is known to use Fe3+ as an electron acceptor, possibly contributing to some of the observed iron transformations, and Rhodoclycus is phylogenetically closely related to Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis\u2014a known polyphosphate-accumulating organism\u2014suggesting a possible influence on phosphorus mobilization. Evidence of changes in the microbial community demonstrate the need to account for the interaction of microbial influences, along with hydrological and chemical processes, in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of phosphorus mobilization during iron reducing conditions brought on by soil saturation.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15204], "author_name_tesi": "Stockton, Miranda Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Stockton", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Miranda", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. John Regan", "Dr. Chris Gorski", "Dr. Anthony Buda"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. John Regan, Thesis Advisor", "Dr. Chris Gorski, Committee Member", "Dr. Anthony Buda, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phosphorus", "iron reduction", "soil microbial community"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "BARCODED METAL NANOWIRES FOR \nMULTIPLEXED DNA HYBRIDIZATION ASSAYS ", "id": "7281", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5252", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThis thesis work was aimed towards developing multiplexed DNA hybridization assays using barcoded metal nanowires.  These nanowires are typically several microns in length and ~300 nm in diameter, having segments of different metals along their lengths.  They are promising for multiplexed bioanalysis due to the large number of striping patterns that can be synthesized, and the ease of optical read-out using simple reflectance microscopy.  Oftentimes silver is used as one of the metals in the striped wires due to its high reflectivity at all visible wavelengths and large reflectance contrast to other metals.  Since Ag metal is susceptible to oxidation, the long-term stability of Ag- containing wires in aqueous buffers was investigated and is reported in Chapter 2.  It was found that wires stored in hybridization buffer for longer than two weeks began to show significant degradation of Ag segments.  When agitated with continuous vortexing, the Ag oxidation progressed more rapidly, rendering the barcoded metal nanowires stored in hybridization buffer unidentifiable in less than one week.  Addition of 40 mM citrate as a mild reducing agent increased Ag stability by 17 weeks over those stored in hybridization buffer.  Nanowires subjected to continuous vortexing in 40 mM citrate buffer retained Ag segment stability for longer than 2 weeks.  Derivatization of the wires with biomolecules such as are used in bioassays affords some additional protection against Ag degradation.  Also, it has been discovered that wires coated with rhodamine-tagged DNA oligonucleotides attached via neutravidin-biotin chemistry are stable for 12 days in hybridization buffer and for at least 63 days when 40 mM citrate is added as a reducing agent.  Ag deterioration in these experiments was coupled to loss of fluorescence from the labeled DNA, as well as wire breakage. \n\nWhen fluorescently-tagged oligonucleotides are located near metal surfaces, their emission intensity is impacted by both electromagnetic effects (i.e., quenching and/or enhancement of emission) and the structure of the nucleic acids (e.g., random coil, hairpin, or duplex).  In Chapter 3, experiments are presented that explore the effect of label position and secondary structure in oligonucleotide probes as a function of hybridization buffer, which impacts the percentage of double-stranded probes on the surface after exposure to complementary DNA.  Nanowires containing identifiable patterns of Au and Ag segments were used as the metal substrates in this work, which allowed for direct comparison of different dye positions in a single multiplexed experiment and differences in emission for probes attached to the two metals.  The observed metal-dye separation dependence for unstructured, surface-bound oligonucleotides is highly sensitive to hybridization efficiency, due to substantial changes in DNA extension from the surface upon hybridization.  In contrast, fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides designed to form hairpin secondary structures analogous to solution-phase molecular beacon probes are relatively insensitive to hybridization efficiency, since the folded form is quenched and therefore does not appreciably impact the observed distance-dependence of the response.  Differences in fluorescence patterning on Au and Ag were noted as a function of not only chromophore identity, but also metal\u00a1Vdye separation.  For example, emission intensity for tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled oligonucleotides changed from brighter on Ag for 24-base probes to brighter on Au for 48-base probes.  Fluorescence enhancement at the ends of nanowires and at surface defects were also observed, where heightened electromagnetic fields affect the fluorescence.\n\nFor the research presented in Chapter 4, molecular beacon probes have been combined with barcoded metal nanowires to enable no-wash, sealed-chamber, multiplexed detection of nucleic acids. Probe design and experimental parameters important in nanowire-based molecular beacon assays are discussed.  Loop regions of 24 bases and five-base-pair stem regions in the molecular beacon probes gave optimal performance.  The results suggest that thermodynamic predictions for secondary structure stability of solution-phase MB can guide probe design for nanowire-based assays.  The predicted solution phase \u0192\u00b4G for probes in 500 mM buffered NaCl of approximately \u00a1V4 kcal/mol performed better than those with \u0192\u00b4G > \u00a1V2 or < \u00a1V6 kcal/mol.  Buffered 300 and 500 mM NaCl solutions were selected after comparison of several buffers previously reported for similar types of assays, and concentrations in the range of 300 to 750 mM NaCl was found to be the optimal ionic strength for the hybridization temperature (25 oC) and probe designs used here.  The sensitivity of this assay was ~100 pM and was limited by incomplete quenching.  Single base mismatches could be discriminated from fully complementary targets.  Oligonucleotide target sequences specific for Human Immunodeficiency, Hepatitis C, and Severe Acute Respiratory Viruses were assayed simultaneously in a no-wash, sealed-chamber, multiplexed experiment in which each of three probe sequences was attached to a different pattern of encoded nanowires.  Finally, demonstrated in this chapter is that probe-coated nanowires retain their selectivity and sensitivity in a triplexed assay after storage for over three months.\n\nWith the increasing interest in simultaneous detection of specific DNA hybridization events, the development of methods to measure multiple DNA interactions at one time is of great importance.  Conventional microarrays allow thousands of DNA hybridization interactions to be measured at once; however, this method of detection is limited by high cost as well as the stability and characteristic properties of fluorescent dyes.  In Chapter 5, barcoded nanowires were investigated as replacements for fluorophores on glass surfaces such as those used in microarrays.  Potential advantages of nanowires include ease of reflectance-based optical read-out, the large number of tags available, and ability to distinguish multiple hybridizations occurring in a single DNA spot.   A method of attaching DNA to glass microscope slides was employed which includes the use of a carboxy-terminated silane to derivatize glass slides for DNA attachment.  Also determined here is the efficiency of using nanowires as tags in complementary DNA hybridization events.  An average of ~5 % nonspecific binding was reported for nanowire attachment for all samples.  \n\nIn all chapters, it has been demonstrated that barcoded metal nanowires have promising uses in multiplexed bioanalysis for the detection of multiple analytes simultaneously. The metal surfaces have provided useful information about interactions between fluorophores and metals and DNA hybridization events (as described in Chapter 3).  The surfaces, however, are subject to oxidation of silver segments (Chapter 2), and occasional pits in the metal surfaces have led to fluorescence enhancements at those pits, causing non-uniform fluorescence (Chapter 3).  Also, non-uniformity in signal intensity results from different underlying metals acting differently on the fluorophores, as well as the distance the fluorophores are positioned from the surface (Chapter 3).  To avoid the effects that the metal surfaces impose on fluorophores, nanowires were glass coated before use as substrates for fluorescently labeled bioassays. This work is presented in Chapter 6.  Two different glass thicknesses (13.5 nm and 100 nm) were prepared and studied and 100 nm thickness provided the best surface, as the glass coating that resulted was very uniform.  Also studied were the protective benefits that the silicon dioxide layers provide by shielding the silver segments from oxidative environments.  We note that a 100 nm thick glass coating on the wires provided excellent resistance to dissolution of Ag segments when sonicated in nitric acid for 30 min and retained the same overall length and optical properties.  Also shown in Chapter 6 is the feasibility of using glass coated nanowires as substrates in 2-plex assays where a single base mismatch in the target DNA sequence of a gene that affects the function of a tumor suppressor protein was detected.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5229], "author_name_tesi": "Stoermer, Rebecca Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Stoermer", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Paul S Weiss", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Paul S Weiss, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["barcoded metal nanowires", "DNA", "multiplexed", "beacons", "glass", "silver", "fluorophores", "nanowires", "metal", "fluorescence", "tags"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Embeddings With Certain Non-Degeneracy Conditions\n", "id": "7954", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2113", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We introduce (k,l)-regular maps, which generalize two previously studied classes of maps: affinely k-regular maps and totally skew embeddings.

However, the signals that regulate their functions have not been well characterized. We have previously shown that eosinophil derived IL-13 plays an important role in the recruitment of T cells to the lung, and subsequent development of allergic asthma.  We therefore tested the hypothesis that eosinophils are dependent upon signaling via the Th2 cytokine responsive transcription factor STAT6 signaling in the control of allergic airway inflammation. Using \u0394dblGATA mice lacking eosinophils and transfer of STAT6-/- eosinophils, we found that unlike WT eosinophils, STAT6-/- eosinophils are unable to induce the development of allergic lung inflammation, including AHR, recruitment of CD4+ T cells, eosinophils and mucous production.  By contrast, the absence of STAT6 in eosinophils does not affect their preformed cytokine expression, and there was no difference in homeostatic migration to spleen and peritoneal cavity under basal conditions in WT or STAT6-/- IL-5 transgenic mice. However, STAT6 was required for eosinophil recruitment to the lung during allergic lung inflammation, and for their chemotactic response to Eotaxin in vitro. These data indicate that like Th cells, eosinophils need to respond to Th2 cytokines via STAT6 during the development of allergic airway inflammation. \n   Interleukin-2 inducible T cell kinase (Itk) and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (Btk) are critical signal amplifiers that regulate lymphocyte and leukocyte development and function. However, the role of Itk and Btk in eosinophil function is unknown. Here we have tested the hypothesis that the Tec family kinases Itk and Btk regulate eosinophil function to control development of allergic airway inflammation. We show that Itk regulates eosinophil migration by controlling the downstream events of the CC chemokine receptor-3 (CCR3), which is critical for eosinophil chemotatic responsiveness and migration. Using \u0394dblGATA mice lacking eosinophils and transfer of Itk-/- eosinophils, we found that eosinophils lacking Itk were unable to induce the development of AHR, although recruitment of CD4+ T cells to the lung was largely rescued. These data indicate that Itk not only regulates T cell responses, but that CCR3 signaling via Itk in eosinophils might affect the development of allergic asthma. By contrast, expression of Itk and Btk together negatively regulated eosinophils, resulting in enhanced responses in Itk/Btk double knockout out eosinophils. These studies indicate that eosinophil expression of Tec kinases Itk and Btk are integral in modulation of cytokine and chemokine signals during the development of airway allergic responses.\n   Gastrointestinal eosinophils have been suggested to contribute to gut homeostatic conditions, however the mechanism by which lung and gut microbiota regulate eosinophils under Th2 conditions is unclear. The propensity for Th2 allergic responses and asthma has recently been linked to the dysbiosis of microbial colonization. Thus, the early establishment of microflora can potentially explain why some individuals are more predisposed to develop asthma and some do not. We hypothesize that the microbiota alters the requirement for eosinophil-mediated Th2 responses in during the initiation of allergic airway inflammation. We report that mice housed under \u201cless-restricted specific-pathogen-free\u201d (LR-SPF) conditions are protected against allergic asthma compared to mice house under \u201crestricted specific-pathogen-free\u201d (R-SPF) conditions. Moreover, 16s rRNA analysis of lung and fecal content reveal differences in lung microbiota diversity, suggesting a potential explanation for this phenomenon. Further, consistent with the \u201cmicrobiota hypothesis\u201d, reducing the microbiota in C57Bl/6 \u0394dblGATA mice by antibiotic treatment resulted in enhanced susceptibility to developing allergic airway inflammation comparable to WT mice. Thus, we conclude that shifts in microbiota affect the requirement for eosinophil-mediated Th2 responses.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10155, 10156], "author_name_tesi": "Stokes, Kindra Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Stokes", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Kindra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Avery August", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Curtis John Omiecinski", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Avery August, Dissertation Advisor", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Committee Member", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Eosinophils", "Asthma", "Allergy", "Inflammation", "STAT6", "Itk", "Btk", "Microbiota"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Development of Phosphazene-based Materials for Advance Applications\n\n", "id": "7290", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1327", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In Chapter 2, the synthesis of a new type of cyclolinear polymer, poly(phenylene vinylene-alt-cyclotriphosphazenes), is described.  The synthesis occurs through a Heck-type coupling reactions to produce ?-conjugated macromolecules with excellent solubility and precise electronic control of the band gap energy.  This synthesis method is capable of producing well defined alternating polymers.  The method is highly adaptable and can be readily utilized for other chromophore systems.  The resulting polymers are also capable of accommodating a wide variety of substituents on the cyclophosphazene rings with minimal effect on the electronic properties.  The band-gap and electron affinities of the polymer were varied through the manipulation of the ?-conjugated unit located between the insulating phosphazene rings.  Each chromophore matched the intended conjugation length consistently throughout the macromolecules.  The polymers were good film-formers due to the chosen substituents on the phosphazene rings.  The absorbance of the polymers indicated minimal spectral shift from the monomer absorbance.  This suggests an effective insulation of each chromophore unit from it neighbors by the phosphazene rings.  Solution photoluminescent efficiencies were found to be up to 44.1%.\nIn Chapter 3, a new inorganic-organic macromolecular intermediate, poly(mono(5-norbornene-2-methoxy)pentachlorocyclotriphosphazene), is reported that is capable of being polymerized without halogen replacement on the phosphazene.  It was found that ring opening metathesis polymerization occurs without initiator deactivation even in the presence of highly reactive phosphorus-chlorine bonds.  This route can be utilized as a valuable one-pot synthesis to produce a variety of polymer architectures such as, diblock, multiblock, star, comb, and linear polymers.  The ability to substitute after polymerization avoids any steric or polarity effects of the side groups on ring opening metathesis polymerization.  This polymer intermediate is also capable of long-term storage in solution without significant degradation. Chapter 3 also illustrates three macromolecular products from the same \u201cliving\u201d intermediate.\nIn Chapter 4, three polymer systems were investigated in an attempt to produce lithium ion conductive polymers that resist the absorption of water.  All were synthesized via ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) to give a polynorbornene backbone with each repeat unit bearing a pendent cyclotriphosphazene ring.  Each pendent inorganic ring carried either hydrophilic, ion conductive 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy (MEE) and/or hydrophobic 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy (TFE) side groups.  The three systems were (a) composite blends of two polymers with all hydrophobic and all lithium ion conductive side groups, (b) homopolymers in which each polymer repeating unit bore both hydrophobic and ion conductive side groups, or (c) copolymers derived from two monomers one of which bore only hydrophobic side groups and the other with all ion conductive groups.  Room temperature (25? C) ionic conductivities were measured by incorporating 7 mole % LiBF4 in each system.  Hydrophobicity was estimated from water contact angles of the polymeric materials with and without LiBF4.  One of the homopolymer systems with two MEE and three TFE groups on every side group generated conductivities in the range of 1.2 x 10-5 S/cm at 25? C in combination with a semi-hydrophobic surface with a water contact angle of 77.7 ?.  The conductivity of this polymer was close to that of the highly hydrophilic, water soluble poly[bis(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)phosphazene] (MEEP) which is one of the most conductive solid polymer electrolytes (2.7 x 10-5 S/cm at 25? C). \nIn Appendix A, the development of a biodegradable shape memory polymer is described.  A novel shape memory material is described that has controllable degradation, transition temperature, and does not require physical crosslinks.  A unique hydrogen bonding mechanism in poly(di(amino acid)phosphazene) provides a significant advantage over typical shape memory polymers.  In the phosphazene-based materials, the permanent shape can be reprogrammed.  These materials were found to have an unusually quick response time because of the unique mechanism.  These materials are thought to be ideal for medical implants such as cardiac stents.  Other applications may include: internal stitches that self-tighten, shrink-wrap, tightening band-aids, bone securing devices, thermal responsive applications, and automotive applications.\nIn Appendix B work is focused towards the development of a blue emitting, electroluminescent phosphazene-based polymer.  In this work two chromophores were synthesized and polymerized through a Heck-coupling reaction.  This polymerization produced a perfectly alternating polymer capable of high-energy emission, along with a controllable band gap.  The polymers formed were soluble in common organic solvents due to the substitution on the cyclotriphosphazene ring.  This work showed that the cyclotriphosphazene could indeed be used to break the conjugation of even high energy chromophores to produce a blue emitting polymer.  \nAppendix C is synthetic work towards the development of a 15 \u00c5 diameter tunnel.  This work focused first on the synthesis of tris(o-anthracenedioxy)phosphazene, then the formation of a single crystal.  This single crystal would be utilized to investigate the inclusion behavior of polymers.  The synthetic work is presented in this appendix, although the crystallization is ongoing.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1316], "author_name_tesi": "Stone, David A", "last_name_ssi": "Stone", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock", "Karl Todd Mueller", "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Ayusmen Sen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock, Committee Chair", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member", "Mary Elizabeth Williams, Committee Member", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Ayusmen Sen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phosphazene", "materials", "light emitting diode", "polymer", "battery"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Zinc on the Biological Reduction of Hematite\n", "id": "6015", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2746", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-11-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The impact of zinc on the reductive dissolution of hematite (\u00e1-Fe2O3) by the dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium (DMRB) Shewanella putrefaciens strain CN32 was studied.

Experiments were also conducted with ferric citrate (2 mM) and nitrate (20 mg/L NO3-N) to evaluate the effect of zinc with soluble electron acceptors.  The net effect of zinc was measured based upon the change of rate or extent electron acceptor consumption.  To further our understanding, additional hematite bioreduction experiments were performed using anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), a soluble electron shuttling agent, ferrozine, a strong Fe(II) complexant, and natural organic material (NOM).  All amendments were found to increase zinc inhibition compared to no-amendment biotic controls.  Ferrozine and AQDS addition decreased Fe(II) sorption and increased zinc sorption.  Increased zinc inhibition with ferrozine was a result of complexation of surface bound Fe(II) that subsequently allowed additional zinc sorption to cell and hematite surfaces.  AQDS addition also increased surface sorbed zinc.  Increased zinc inhibition during NOM addition was attributed both the Me(II) complexation capacity and the surface sorption affinity of the NOM.  Taken together, the results show that surface sorbed zinc was a more potent inhibitor of hematite bioreduction than free zinc, especially in the presence of the amendments studied.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2741], "author_name_tesi": "Stone, James Jason", "last_name_ssi": "Stone", "middle_name_ssi": "Jason", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William D Burgos", "Richard Frederick Unz Sr.", "Brian Dempsey", "John Michael Regan", "Susan Louise Brantley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William D Burgos, Committee Chair", "Richard Frederick Unz Sr., Committee Member", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metal reduction", "organic matter", "dissimilatory reduction", "dissolution", "microbial reduction", "zinc", "Fe(III) reduction"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Policy Implementation and Technological Literacy: A Case Study\n", "id": "11035", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2553", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The fundamental problem addressed by this policy implementation case study is the lack of information about street-level efforts to incorporate Technological Literacy into Pennsylvania\u2019s middle and high schools. The purpose of this research was to begin filling in this information gap by analyzing how one such policy \u2013 Pennsylvania\u2019s Classrooms for the Future (CFF) program \u2013 is being implemented in a set of rural school districts. This implementation case study investigated the implementation of CFF using a modified \u201cbottom-up\u201d-style approach. This study examined the local-level policy context as well as the characteristics and activities of teachers and administrators tasked with implementing CFF. This study contributes to the policy implementation literature by using a combination of existing methodologies to expand the field into an important policy domain. The information obtained from this study was expected to provide insight into: (1) how the CFF policy is implemented in context, and (2) how the attitudes, behavior, and perceptions of street-level implementers affect the implementation of CFF. The study findings suggest that CFF is considered to be an important part of school/district Technological Literacy efforts by both teachers and administrators. However, the two groups exhibit some dissonance in their cognitive understandings of the bases of CFF, their perceptions of the implementation behaviors related to CFF, and the perceived success and impact of CFF. The CFF program is seen by both groups as having its primary impact on classroom intangibles (e.g. motivation, and engagement) rather than quantitative academic performance outcomes. Valuation of the policy was seen to differ based on length of exposure to the CFF program as well as the relative \"strength\" of the district. The dissonance between administrators and teachers suggest that the level of implementer discretion is likely. This discretion is likely exacerbated by inadequate training and competition from other priorities.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2533], "author_name_tesi": "Stone, Jeffrey Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Stone", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Ames Peterson", "Steven Ames Peterson", "Jeremy Plant", "James Truman Ziegenfuss Jr.", "Elinor M Madigan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Ames Peterson, Dissertation Advisor", "Steven Ames Peterson, Committee Chair", "Jeremy Plant, Committee Member", "James Truman Ziegenfuss Jr., Committee Member", "Elinor M Madigan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["21st Century Skills", "Technological Literacy", "Education Policy", "Policy Implementation", "Public Policy", "Information Technology"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Exploring the Role of the Axial Ligand in Thiolate-Ligated Heme Enzymes: Spectroscopy of High-Valent Iron Intermediates of Chloroperoxidase\n", "id": "8224", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3475", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cytochromes P450 (P450) are thiolate-ligated heme enzymes that play critical roles in many biological processes, including metabolism of xenobiotics.  Thiolate-ligated heme enzymes are unique among heme proteins because they catalyze oxygen insertion reactions.  Recently, an X-ray absorption spectroscopy study of the ferryl form of chloroperoxidase (CPO-II) suggested a novel role for thiolate-ligation.  It revealed that CPO-II was not an authentic ferryl (iron(IV)oxo), but rather a protonated ferryl with a long Fe-O bond length of 1.82 \u00c5 (typically ferryls have Fe-O bond lengths near 1.65 \u00c5). This finding has important implications for P450 hydroxylation chemistry where a basic ferryl may provide the driving force to perform hydrogen atom abstraction.  The hydroxylation mechanism for P450\u2019s describes two high-valent iron intermediates.  These intermediates are highly reactive.  Due to almost identical first coordination spheres of chloroperoxidase (CPO) and P450\u2019s, CPO has been utilized as a model to investigate high-valent iron intermediates of P450 reaction chemistry.\nTo gain insight into the reactive intermediate of P450 enzymatic catalysis, X-ray absorption measurements of chloroperoxidase compound I were performed.  CPO-I is an authentic ferryl species (a doubly bonded Fe-O bond with a length of 1.65 \u00c5) and strong axial-ligand interactions result in a long Fe-S bond length of 2.48 \u00c5.  This is the first unambiguous structural characterization of a thiolate-ligated compound I species and provides a first glimpse into the reactive intermediate of P450 reaction chemistry.\nWe have also examined the protonation state of CPO-II with the use of multiple spectroscopies: M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy coupled with density functional calculations, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, ENDOR spectroscopy and resonance Raman spectroscopy.  A Badger\u2019s rule analysis of the EXAFS-determined Fe-O bond length of CPO-II (1.82 \u00c5) affords an Fe-O stretching frequency of nBadger = 563 cm-1.  A deuterium and 18O sensitive stretching frequency, nFe-OH= 565 cm-1, was located by resonance Raman spectroscopy in remarkable agreement to what is predicted from Badger\u2019s rule.  \nAll evidence, to date, suggests that the basic ferryls are a general feature of thiolate-ligated heme enzymes. This provides a reasonable explanation of why Nature utilizes the electron donating thiolate ligand to perform some very demanding oxidizing reactions.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3462], "author_name_tesi": "Stone, Kari Lea Lunder", "last_name_ssi": "Stone", "middle_name_ssi": "Lea Lunder", "first_name_ssi": "Kari", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Carsten Krebs", "John H Golbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green, Committee Chair", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Member", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chloroperoxidase", "Ferryl", "Cytochrome P450", "Spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Microtubule Polarity and Drosophila Sensory Neuron Responses to Axon and Dendrite Injury", "id": "23508", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10718", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microtubule polarity in axons and dendrites is essential for polarized transport and function of the neuron.

Although the Watts uprising is one of the most studied riots in U.S. history there is more scholarly work to be done.

Utilizing these advantages, performance improvements can be gained through techniques such as topology optimization, lattice structures, and part consolidation. Continued improvement of the AM process has shifted the focus of AM to end-use components. Qualification is a key step in enabling AM as an end-use manufacturing method, and the industry has turned to Computed Tomography (CT) as a tool in this process. Although well suited for complex components a few centimeters in size, CT struggles as AM components exceed a meter in length due to limited source energy, restrictive inspection volumes, and excessive data generation. This work proposes Digital Radiography (DR) as a non-destructive inspection method capable of accurately inspecting AM components approaching and exceeding a meter in length. To both expedite the inspection process and make DR a feasible inspection technique, an application, SMART DR was developed to optimize component orientation during the inspection process and provide the probability of detection for flaw sizes of interest prior to manufacturing. By providing this information, SMART DR allows for an inspection plan to be developed or the necessary design changes to be made to ensure that a component can be accurately inspected. \nSMART DR utilizes a ray trace algorithm for orientation optimization and experimental data along with theoretical relationships to determine a flaw\u2019s probability of detection.  A parallelized back projection algorithm utilizes a virtual representation of the user\u2019s DR system and a STL representation of the component in question. By projecting the STL facets to the detector and back tracing the X-rays from the detector pixels to the source, the radiographic thickness of the component can be calculated efficiently. To determine the optimal orientation for inspecting the component, the back-projection algorithm is coupled with a genetic optimization scheme to minimize the radiographic thickness of the component.  The probability of detection metric is based off of the contrast-to-noise ratio and normalized image unsharpness. \nDue to limited information on high energy DR in the literature, an experimental plan was created to aid in determining the contrast to noise ratio for source energy between 0.450 Mev to 12 Mev and thicknesses from 25.4 mm to 203.3 mm (1 in. to 8 in.). Square Ti-6Al-4V blocks 76.2 mm (3 in.) wide with cylindrical artificial flaws were used during the experiment. The contrast-to-noise ratio was then measured across each flaw based on ASTM standard E2597 while the normalized image unsharpness was determined based on ASTM standard E2698. Combining these two metrics allow for determining a flaw\u2019s probability of detection for a wide range of flaw sizes, DR systems, and component thicknesses.  Validation was conducted on a 316-stainless steel fin produced using laser based directed energy deposition process. A 0.450 Mev DR system with a 2.5mm spot size and a GE DXR250U-W digital detector array were used during validation. SMART DR produced an optimal orientation that was 40mm thick and predicted that a 0.75 mm diameter flaw with length 0.400mm, .800mm, or 1.60 mm had probability of detection of 91%, 20.7% and 21.7%, respectively. This aligned closely with the smallest detectable flaws on the radiographs of the 316-stainless steel fin, which were 0.508 mm and 0.764 mm. Initial validation results showed that SMART DR is capable of optimizing the DR process and providing accurate probability of detection values within the bounds of the data.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16775], "author_name_tesi": "Stoner, Brant Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Stoner", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Brant", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sanjay B Joshi", "Timothy William Simpson", "Guhaprasanna Manogharan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sanjay B Joshi, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Guhaprasanna Manogharan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nondestructive inspection", "Additive manufacturing", "directed energy deposition", "multi-meter components", "qualification", "digital radiography"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE VARIETIES OF SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE REVISITED: INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT AND EXPRESSION OF SPIRITUAL IDENTITY\nDURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD\n\n", "id": "10132", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6249", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For many individuals, the transition to adulthood in college contexts constitutes an important period for psychosocial identity formation.

The Clinical Manager Survey measures the work design, direct care worker training and development, and supervisor training management practice variables.  The Direct Care Worker Survey contains items used to measure organizational commitment and demographics.  Two types of research designs are used in this study.  First, cross-sectional analyses, using baseline responses, investigate the relationship between baseline management practices and organizational commitment.

Several types of linear regression techniques including ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression with robust estimation are used to analyze the data.  \n\nIn the cross-sectional analysis, greater use of feedback is associated with direct care workers recommending the organization for a job and thinking about quitting less often.

Staff participation in a greater number of staff training programs is also related to direct care workers being less likely to leave their job in the next year.  Being a nursing facility and having staff development and training programs is also linked with direct care worker organizational commitment.  However, including interactions only improved the models marginally.  The only consistent relationship in the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses is the association of supervisor training with direct care workers recommending the organization for a job.  \n\nFindings suggest aspects of both work design and staff training and development practices are related to direct care worker organizational commitment.  For long-term care policy makers and administrators, who are concerned about increasing direct care worker retention, this study offers empirical evidence to formulate policies that improve management practices in these areas.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [241], "author_name_tesi": "Stott, Amy Lynne", "last_name_ssi": "Stott", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynne", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Diane Brannon", "Susan Diane Brannon", "Joseph J Vasey", "Kathryn H Dansky", "Melissa Hardy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Diane Brannon, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Diane Brannon, Committee Chair", "Joseph J Vasey, Committee Member", "Kathryn H Dansky, Committee Member", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nursing homes", "nursing supervisors", "management practices", "long-term care", "direct care worker", "training and development", "work design", "assisted-living", "home care", "organizational commitment"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Development and Testing of a Measure of Eating Competence for use with Low-Income Females", "id": "8785", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2819", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Continuation of unhealthy dietary patterns and related health outcomes among low-income populations underscores the need to improve diet quality.  Enhancing eating competence (EC), based on the Satter model of EC (ecSatter), may be one effective method to reach this goal, but requires substantiation.  The objectives of the research included in this dissertation were to examine the congruence of ecSatter with the cognitive and affective eating behaviors of low-income adults and to test the construct validity of the ecSatter Inventory (ecSI), a self-report measure of EC, with a low-income population.  These objectives were met through three studies. Study I was a qualitative, exploratory assessment of EC with 70 low-income adults.  Findings suggested that ecSatter provided a tenable framework for rationalizing participants\u2019 cognitive and affective responses to eating experiences. Participants who lacked EC were more likely to express negative thoughts and feelings associated with eating, compared to eating competent participants.  Furthermore, for non-eating competent participants, weight management played an important role in food practices.  \nIn study II, the ecSI was cognitively tested with 25 low-income women.  Interview responses were examined for consistency between participants\u2019 reasoning processes and researchers\u2019 intended meaning of survey items.  Findings provided a rationale for making modifications to the ecSI prior to use with low-income adults.  Findings also suggested that the modified items more appropriately matched the cognitive processes of participants.  Scores from the modified instrument, the ecSatter Inventory for Low Income (ecSI/LI), correctly categorized participants by level of EC, supporting the instrument\u2019s validity.   \t \nStudy III was designed to evaluate psychometric properties of the ecSI/LI with 507 low-income women.  Confirmatory factor analysis validated the ecSI/LI factor structure.  Construct validity was supported by comparison of ecSI/LI responses to outcomes of validated measures of cognitive and affective eating behaviors and food preferences and practices.  Findings support the utility of the ecSI/LI to empirically assess the theoretical construct of EC with low-income women.   \nFindings from these three studies lay a foundation for future research regarding EC among low-income groups.

Spring Creek (Centre County, Pennsylvania) is a world-famous limestone trout-fishing stream that once had a viable population of E. guttulata, but numerous pollutants wreaked havoc on the stream\u2019s biota. Some populations of macroinvertebrate species recovered, but E. guttulata has not been observed on Spring Creek since the late 1950s. In the time since the extirpation of the \u201ceastern green drake\u201d from Spring Creek, much work has been done to improve the stream\u2019s water quality; the question is whether it has improved enough to once again support an E. guttulata population.\nThe purpose of my research is to conduct a series of three feasibility studies that will help to answer the question: Can we reintroduce the \u201ceastern green drake\u201d to its historic location on Spring Creek? Such preliminary studies are essential components of a scientifically-based reintroduction program. The three studies conducted were 1) chemical testing, 2) bioassessment and 3) community sampling.\nIn the first study, water and substrate of targeted locations on Spring and Penns Creeks\nwere sampled, then tested for the presence of known pollutants. Water and substrate of two\nlocations on Spring Creek were found to contain low levels of pollutants that were comparable to\nlocations on Penns Creek that support a dense population of E. guttulata.\nIn the second study, I tested the >25-day toxicity of Spring Creek water and substrate\nusing E. guttulata larvae collected from Penns Creek, and using Penns Creek substrate as the\nControl. The survival and growth of E. guttulata larvae in Spring Creek water and substrate\ndemonstrated that Spring Creek may be suitable for the mayfly species.\nIn the third study, I sampled the macroinvertebrate communities of targeted locations on Spring and Penns Creeks, to look for taxa of equal or greater pollution intolerance (according to the EPA ranking of mid-Atlantic macroinvertebrate populations). At all Spring Creek sites, I identified several aquatic insect taxa that are rated as equally or more intolerant of organic pollution than E. guttulata.\nOverall, the results of the three studies suggest that reintroduction of E. guttulata to\nSpring Creek may be possible. Using two freshwater macroinvertebrate reintroduction programs as a template, I designed a strategy for reintroduction, and began its implementation; results so far have been encouraging.\nSuccessfully restoring the \u201ceastern green drake\u201d mayfly to Spring Creek could not only have a positive impact on the economy of Central Pennsylvania, but could benefit the advancing\nscience of aquatic insect reintroductions.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2309], "author_name_tesi": "Stout, Hannah Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Stout", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Hannah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Craig Saunders", "James Lewis Frazier", "Gregory Allen Hoover", "Jay Richard Stauffer Jr.", "Ke Chung Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Craig Saunders, Dissertation Advisor", "James Lewis Frazier, Committee Member", "Gregory Allen Hoover, Special Member", "Jay Richard Stauffer Jr., Committee Member", "Ke Chung Kim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ephemera guttulata", "Ephemeroptera", "macroinvertebrate", "conservation", "reintroduction", "restoration"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Social Capital and Political Participation\n", "id": "8340", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4063", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study seeks to contribute to our understanding of the role that resources play\nin political participation.

The research study was an effort to explore programs and characteristics common among high schools in Pennsylvania that issue reading growth projections provided by the Pennsylvania Value-Added Assessment System.  High growth reading high schools were identified using Average Growth Index (AGI) scores.  Sixty-five high school principals working in these high reading growth schools completed a survey and provided insight into those characteristics and programs in their schools that promoted reading development.  Six onsite visits were completed and personal interviews were conducted with principals of these high growth schools to develop information regarding what these schools did to attain such positive results.  Additionally, a multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine if there was a relationship between a school\u2019s three-year mean AGI score and several variables.  Results of the study concluded that high schools that exceed PVAAS reading projections contained the following characteristics and/or programs:  (a) had remediation and/or tutoring programs in place for students who are not meeting the prescribed academic standards, (b) obtained, reviewed, and utilized student data to maximize the learning potential, (c) utilized a focused approach to staff development, and (d) had high expectations for student achievement as shared by the community, parents, staff, and students.

An extensive amount of work has been performed in elucidating both the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms of ceramide-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.  Interestingly, the administration of several anti-mitogenic cytokines and pro-apoptotic chemotherapeutic agents has been shown to result in the intracellular accumulation of ceramide.  Moreover, exogenous short-chain ceramide analogues, such as C6-ceramide (C6), have been observed to act synergistically with various chemotherapeutic agents to induce cancer cell apoptosis.  Although in vitro tumor cell culture models have illuminated the potential therapeutic utility of C6, in vivo delivery is impeded by the extreme hydrophobicity and physical-chemical properties of these bioactive lipids.  Effective intravenous drug delivery systems are essential in order to realize the true therapeutic value of exogenous ceramide treatment.  Therefore, we investigated the utilization and applicability of liposomal and polymeric nanoparticulate methodologies.  \nInitial work focused on the design and optimization of ceramide-incorporated liposomal vehicles to augment ceramide delivery to MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, a highly aggressive, metastatic cell-line.  We designed conventional, cationic, and pegylated drug delivery vesicles to efficaciously deliver ceramide to MDA-MB-231 cells.  In vitro pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that liposomal ceramide delivery resulted in significantly greater accumulation of ceramide compared to free administration.  These formulations significantly limited MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, inhibited phosphorylated Akt levels, and stimulated Caspase-3/7 activity more effectively than non-liposomal ceramide.  \nDue to the enhanced in vitro efficacy of pegylated liposomal-C6 formulations, we next investigated the effectiveness of the pegylated formulations in a Balb/C mouse solid tumor model of breast adenocarcinoma.  Liposmal-C6 was found to induce significant apoptosis in murine 410.4 mammary adenocarcinoma cells, whereas no cytotoxicity was observed in normal murine HC11 mammary epithelial cells, signifying that normal, healthy mammary cells may be less sensitive to ceramide treatment.  It has been shown that different cell types can metabolize exogenous ceramide as varying rates, resulting in ceramide insensitivity.  Over a three-week treatment period, the systemic intravenous delivery of this formulation elicited an approximate 80% reduction in 410.4-derived tumor size when compared to empty \u201cghost\u201d liposomal treatment.  Importantly, the total body weights of treated mice did not significantly differ over the treatment period, suggesting limited systemic toxicity.  Histological analyses of solid tumors from liposomal-treated mice demonstrated a marked increase in the presence of apoptotic cells, with a concomitant decrease in cellular proliferation and in the development of a microvessel network.  The biophysical mechanisms underlying liposomal-C6-induced cancer cell cytoxicity and apoptosis include the accumulation of ceramide within caveolae and mitochondrial.  Furthermore, a pharmacokinetic analysis of systemic liposomal-C6 delivery demonstrated that the pegylated liposomal formulation follows first-order kinetics in the blood with a half-life of nearly 11 hours and achieved a steady-state concentration in tumor tissue above the in vitro IC50 of liposomal-C6.  \n\nWith the advent of multi-functional polymeric drug delivery, additional efforts were undertaken to develop a drug delivery strategy to specifically target solid tumor tissue.  We evaluated the feasibility of delivering C6 in thermo-responsive, biodegradeable dendritic nanoparticles.  These dendrimers are comprised of thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), biodegradable poly(L-lactic acid), and dendritic poly(L-lysine) and have a lower critical solution temperature of 34\u00b0C.  Temperature-sensitive uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dendrimers was confirmed by confocal microscopy and quantified by flow cytometry in MDA-MB-231 cells.  Upon the confirmation that the dendrimers can be efficiently loaded with ceramide, in vitro drug release assays were performed to validate the utilization of temperature-dependant drug delivery.  Importantly, the dendrimers did not show any cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 tumor cells at concentrations of up to 300 mg/ml, and the treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with C6-loaded dendrimers resulted in the significant growth inhibition.  This novel formulation of C6-loaded dendrimers has the potential to thermally target solid tumor tissue in vivo.    \n\nTogether, these results indicate the bioactive ceramide analogue, C6, can be successfully incorporated into both pegylated liposomal vehicles and dendritic thermo-responsive nanoparticulates.  The enhanced in vitro and in vivo efficacy observed with liposomal delivery suggests that ceramide has utility as an anticancer agent.  Whether or not ceramide has potential as a first-line therapy remains unknown, but it has significant potential as an adjunctive therapy as a synergistic pro-apoptotic agent.  The optimization of targeted ceramide-loaded vehicles would serve to further advance the clinical utility of ceramide treatment in cancer therapy.  The development of ceramide-loaded thermo-responsive dendrimers exemplifies this strategy due to the potential to target solid tumor tissue. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6141], "author_name_tesi": "Stover, Thomas Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Stover", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Kester", "Jong Kak Yun", "Charles D Smith", "Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Tao Lu Lowe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Kester, Committee Chair", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member", "Charles D Smith, Committee Member", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member", "Tao Lu Lowe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tumor", "breast cancer", "dendrimers", "liposomes", "drug delivery", "Ceramide", "pharmacokinetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Consumption of Pottery and Lithics in the Peripheries of Tikal, Guatemala", "id": "15399", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7640", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     My dissertation utilizes field data collected from the Classic lowland Maya center of Tikal by The Pennsylvania State University Tikal Project between 2003 and 2006.

By reconstructing the overlapping crises of the seventeenth century as they occurred in L\u00fcbeck, the capital city of the Hanseatic League, I argue that structural crisis alone did not cause permanent changes in the ordering of urban politics and religious life inherited from the late middle ages and Reformation. In fact, the \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d (c. 1570-1630) and Thirty Years\u2019 War (1618-1648) elicited very different responses from the city\u2019s Lutheran pastors and oligarchic magistrates. In contrast to better-studied cities like Augsburg and Frankfurt, dramatic change came to L\u00fcbeck only when guildsmen mounted a series of overlapping attacks on elite property and religious non-conformists in the 1660s. These attacks drove the city council to make unprecedented political concessions to the guilds in 1669, and to impose new legal restrictions on other, \u201cunorthodox\u201d religious practices during the ensuing decades. These were more than pragmatic expedients: urban elites also cooperated closely with the clergy in everyday religious life, and became enthusiastic patrons of Lutheran music and art after mid-century. By 1700, new consensus regarding their shared \u201ccivic Lutheran\u201d identity enabled magistrates, pastors, and guildsmen to collectively depict their city as stable and prosperous, despite a long-term decline in L\u00fcbeck\u2019s international influence.

The purpose of this work was to investigate the relationship between signals in the TcR/CD3/CD28 pathway and HIV-1 replication.  \nT cell stimulation through TcR/CD3 induces low level HIV-1 transcription.

Using deletional analysis of the HIV-LTR in conjunction with electromobility shift assay (EMSA), we determined that the enhanced HIV-1 transcription in response to CD28 ligation was mediated through the binding of a specific protein to a potential CD28 response element (HIV-28RE) in the region spanning-182 to -205 of the HIV-LTR.  This finding illustrates the positive regulation of HIV-1 expression by molecules in the T cell signaling pathway.\nThe tight link between HIV-1 transcription and T cell activation and its dependence on host transcription factors suggests that provirus activity would be silenced as an infected cell transitioned from an activated to a resting state, such as during the process of anergy or memory induction.  This is thought to be the underlying mechanism of HIV-1 postintegration latency.  The population of resting memory CD4+ T cells harboring latent virus represents the primary barrier against eradication of the virus in HAART patients.  The cellular mediators of the establishment of this reservoir are largely unknown due to the difficulty in the isolation of latent cells in vivo and the lack of available representative in vitro models.  We have developed a novel in vitro system to identify the molecular events involved in silencing the HIV-1 provirus.  This model utilizes a virus engineered to express placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) on its surface upon virus transcription in conjunction with the removal of this marker by Phospholipase C treatment.  Measurement of PLAP re-expression is used as an indicator of the HIV-1 transcriptional response to various signal manipulations.  Using this experimental approach, we demonstrated that suboptimal T cell signaling that activates the calcium pathway induces a reversible, long-term suppression of HIV-1 transcription that may represent a latent state.  These findings indicate that signals in the TcR/CD28 pathway can negatively regulate HIV-1 gene expression. \nThe role of Lck, an early and integral member of the T cell activation pathway, was assessed via the infection of Lck deficient T cell lines.  HIV-1 replication was consistently attenuated in the absence of Lck, suggesting that Lck was positively regulating HIV-1 expression.  However, a series of experiments determined that Lck was not influencing HIV-1 transcription or the early stages of the virus life-cycle, but instead was mediating the later stages of the virus life cycle, namely HIV-1 assembly.  HIV-1 particles accumulated in the intracellular compartments of cells lacking Lck, suggesting that Lck was facilitating the progression of HIV-1 from the microvesicles to the plasma membrane for efficient virus release.  This novel function of Lck did not involve its kinase activity but was mediated through a physical interaction between Lck and Gag.   \nThese findings indicate that T cell signaling proteins can both positively and negatively regulate HIV-1 transcription, and can play important unforeseen roles in other stages of the virus life cycle, such as HIV-1 assembly.  Insight regarding the interplay between T cell signals and HIV-1 will lead to a better understanding of how the virus exploits host proteins to promote its replication and will ultimately provide targets for future therapeutic intervention.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [32], "author_name_tesi": "Strasner, Amy ", "last_name_ssi": "Strasner", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Avery August", "Richard John Frisque", "Dr Biao He", "Dr Shao Cong Sun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "Dr Biao He, Committee Member", "Dr Shao Cong Sun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HIV-1", "T cell signals"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "A STUDY OF APPROXIMATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION TECHNIQUES FOR KERNEL REGULARIZED LEAST SQUARES", "id": "15177bbs5179", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15177", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Researchers using machine-learning algorithms are encountering problems of data storage and computation time with the advent of Big Data in almost all aspects of life and work.

An examination of the sample of six hundred Susquehannock pots reveals several things.  First, the stylistic ceramic typology used by archaeologists to assign temporal affinity is valid.  Second, there is a strong correlation between lip diameter and total vessel volume for Susquehannock pots; this allows broken pots to be included in the analysis of function along with the almost four hundred whole or reconstructed pots.  Finally, and most significantly, a functional typology is discerned within the Susquehannock pottery sample.  The sizes of functional classes within the sample strongly correlate with the classes seen in the ethnoarchaeological and ethnohistorical records supporting the idea that they were used for the same purposes.

These five dimensions are measured through a survey instrument termed SERVQUAL.  A sixth dimension, usability, was added in a modified survey instrument termed SERVUSE.  \n\n\nTo examine the predictive power of both instruments, 200 patients at an on-campus health clinic, University Health Services, were surveyed.

Since it has the strongest interactions, the PVA system is investigated first. AFM is used in conjunction with x-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to show that strong polymer/filler interactions can promote a different crystalline structure and a different morphology than those seen in the bulk.\n\nThe study then proceeds to the weakly interacting PEO/inorganic system where it is found that the inorganic layers disrupt crystalline morphology, but do not change the crystal structure. Furthermore, crystallization always occurs in volumes away from the inorganic filler. The third system (neutral interactions), PP/inorganic is then discussed. The three systems are compared with each other, and it is found that the crystalline morphology and structure is highly dependent upon the strength of interaction between the polymer and filler.\n\nDue to its far-reaching morphology changes, the strongly interacting system was chosen for property studies. The composite structure study revealed a coexistence of exfoliated and intercalated MMT layers, especially for low and moderate silicate loadings. The inorganic layers promote a new crystalline phase different than the one of the respective neat PVA, characterized by higher melting temperature and a different crystal structure. This new crystal phase reflects on the composite materials properties, which have mechanical, thermal, and water vapor transmission properties superior to that of the neat polymer and its conventionally filled composites. For example, for a 5wt.% MMT exfoliated composite, the softening temperature increases by 25 degrees celcius, the Young's modulus triples with a decrease of only 20% in toughness, whereas there is also a 60% reduction in the water permeability. Furthermore, due to the nanoscale dispersion of filler, the nanocomposites retain their optical clarity.\n\nFinally, to better connect changes in morphology with property enhancements, AFM methods were devised which allow direct imaging of morphology as well as local properties.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3635], "author_name_tesi": "Strawhecker, Kenneth Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Strawhecker", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Evangelos Manias", "Sridhar Komarneni", "Ralph H Colby", "Sanat Kumar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Evangelos Manias, Committee Chair", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Sanat Kumar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer", "inorganic", "nanocomposites", "AFM", "layered silicates", "composites", "materials"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Design of functional layered oxide materials through understanding structure-property relationships", "id": "25914", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11338", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships is imperative in the rational design of new materials for tailored applications.

This dissertation focuses on understanding the structure-property relationships in supported catalytic systems and ferroelectric materials to aid in the rational design of functional materials.\nIn Chapter 2, a correlation between the enthalpy of nanoparticle adsorption to oxide supports and the subsequent growth of these nanoparticles as a function of temperature is investigated. When deposited onto layered niobium oxide and tantalum oxide supports, rhodium hydroxide nanoparticles remain small and evenly dispersed upon heating to 750 oC. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, the bonding enthalpy of rhodium hydroxide nanoparticles to oxide supports is quantified for the first time under the wet synthetic conditions of catalyst preparation. Rh(OH)3 is concluded to have a strong, covalent interaction with the early transition metal oxide supports, and the interfacial bonding is hypothesized to occur through Rh \u2013 O \u2013 Nb bonding. \nChapter 3 extends the studies in Chapter 2 to include supported metal, metal oxide, and metal hydroxide nanoparticles in the cobalt, nickel and copper triads. The data confirms a strong correlation between the heats of interaction and stability of the supported nanoparticles. Both experimental data and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the support and nanoparticle compositions impact the heat of interaction and that the qualitative periodic trends of the metal bonding interaction are independent of the metal oxidation state. A strong bond is shown computationally to arise from the formation of mixed d-states between an adsorbed metal atom and a metal atom in the support.\nA preliminary investigation into the synthesis and stability of catalytically relevant ligand-free metal nanoparticles is presented in Chapter 4. The nanoparticles are synthesized via base hydrolysis and reduction with methanol. When deposited onto a niobium oxide support, the nanoparticles are thermally stable at temperatures up to 900 oC.

Streb\nAdvisor: Dr. Sarah K. Rich\n\n\nMinna Citron (1896-1991) was a lifelong self-proclaimed feminist, a divorced mother and an artist who believed in individual expression. One of her main artistic interests, particularly early in her career, was the way feminist concerns related to her dual roles as wife/mother and professional artist. She struggled to make a name for herself in the male-dominated art world between the 1930s and 1950s, beginning during a decade in which social roles for women increasingly tended towards domesticity. By the late 1960s, however, Citron\u2019s interest in feminism was renewed by a new generation of women. The course upon which she set herself, in many ways, was uncharted and her concern with women\u2019s issues and the challenges faced by women perhaps resonate more clearly with us today than while she was alive. \nMy dissertation brings to the fore the Depression-era work of this American, whose career has been largely undervalued and overlooked by the traditional art historical canon. Through an interdisciplinary approach involving concepts from art history, visual culture, social history, film studies and women\u2019s studies, I demonstrate how Citron wove her personal experiences in the 1930s into the larger social context and created unique social realist works that at times reflect her feminist interests as well. Works from her three major series of the decade, \u201cFeminanities,\u201d the \u201cGambling Series,\u201d and \u201cJudges and Juries,\u201d will be discussed in relation to Depression-era advertising images found in popular magazines such as The Ladies\u2019 Home Journal, popular Hollywood films, and novels and plays focusing on women subjects, as well as contemporary feminist issues. The distinctive works of this witty American artist are sarcastic, even boldly ironic, and they are unmatched by anything produced by her peers. Citron\u2019s paintings and prints from the 1930s, as will be demonstrated in this thesis, are representative of several socio-historical trends including issues regarding feminism and women\u2019s changing social roles, their continued fight for equality, and increasing interest in gambling, the law and court proceedings. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2805], "author_name_tesi": "Streb, Jennifer L", "last_name_ssi": "Streb", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah K Rich", "Craig Robert Zabel", "Joyce Henri Robinson", "Nan Elizabeth Woodruff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah K Rich, Committee Chair", "Craig Robert Zabel, Committee Member", "Joyce Henri Robinson, Committee Member", "Nan Elizabeth Woodruff, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["American Art", "Feminism", "1930s Art", "Social Realism", "Women Artists"]}]
