Researchers have reported concentrations of estrogens in milk, but few milk samples that contain fat have been analyzed.  Furthermore, the mechanisms by which estrogens accumulate in milk are not well-defined.  The objectives of this research were to quantify estrone (E1) and 17&#946;-estradiol (E2) concentrations in raw, pasteurized/homogenized, and commercial milk samples and compare the mass consumed in dairy products to 24-h production rates of these hormones in humans.  In addition, mechanisms that may contribute to the accumulation of E1 and E2 in milk were investigated.  To meet the first objective raw and commercial milk samples were collected and milk composition was recorded.  E1 and E2 were quantified by radioimmunoassay after organic solvent extractions and Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography.  E2 concentrations in raw whole milk averaged 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 pg/mL from cows of all reproductive stages, and 0.3, 0.9, and 5.0 pg/mL from cows in trimesters 1, 2, and 3 of pregnancy, respectively.  E1 concentrations in milk averaged 0.6, 7.9, and 27.1 pg/mL from cows in trimesters 1, 2, and 3 of pregnancy, respectively.  Pasteurization/homogenization treatment did not significantly affect E2 concentrations in milk.  Concentrations of E1 and E2 in commercial skim, 1%, 2%, and whole milk samples averaged 2.9, 4.2, 5.7, and 7.9 pg E1/mL and 0.4, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.1 pg E2/mL milk, respectively.  E1 and E2 concentrations were greater as milk fat increased (butter >> cream > half-and-half > milks).  However, type of product (conventional or organic) did not affect E1 and E2 concentrations in these products.  It was concluded that the mass of E1 and E2 in a serving of commercial milk was low (0.01%) relative to published estimates of production of estrogens by the ovaries or testis in humans.  The predominant factors regulating plasma E1 and E2 concentrations are the production and metabolic clearance rates of E1 and E2 and binding of E1 and E2 to plasma proteins, as opposed to ingestion of E1 and E2 from the diet.  Therefore, it is unlikely that the amount of E1 and E2 consumed from milk would lead to adverse health consequences.  When investigating mechanisms that may contribute to the accumulation of E1 and E2 in milk, milk E1 and E2 concentrations were highly correlated with their respective concentrations in plasma (r = 0.77 and 0.93).  Milk fat and protein percentages were significantly correlated with E1 and E2 concentrations.  Additionally, transcripts for an enzyme that can convert E1 to E2 were detected in somatic cells isolated from pregnant cows\u2019 milk, suggesting that cells within the mammary gland may synthesize E2 during pregnancy.  Based upon the relationship between plasma and milk concentrations of E1 and E2, this research suggests that passive diffusion from plasma is a significant factor for the accumulation of E1 and E2 in milk.  However, fat and protein-mediated mechanisms likely also contribute to the accumulation of E1 and E2 in milk.

Due to the distinctive hierarchy from subcellular to tissue scale, plant materials can exhibit remarkably different mechanical properties. To date, how the subcellular scale arrangement and the mechanical properties of plant cell wall structural constituents give rise to macro or tissue scale mechanical responses is not yet well understood. Although the tissue scale plant cell wall samples are easy to prepare and put to different types of mechanical tests, the hierarchical features that emerge when moving towards a higher scale make it complicated to link the macro scale results to micro or subcellular scale structural components. On the other hand, the microscale size of cell brings formidable challenges to prepare and grip samples and carry mechanical tests under tensile loading at subcellular scale. This study attempted to develop a set of test protocols based on microelectromechanical system (MEMS) tensile testing devices for characterizing plant cell wall materials at different length scales. For the ease of sample preparation and well established database of the composition and conformation of its structural constituents, onion epidermal cell wall profile was chosen as the study material. Based on the results and findings of multiscale mechanical characterization, a framework of architecture-based finite element method (FEM) computational model was developed. The computational model laid the foundation of bridging the subcellular or microscale to the tissue or macroscale mechanical properties.  \nBeing microscale in size, the subcellular scale mechanical characterization of plant cell walls presents four major formidable challenges to address, namely: (1) excise or cut the sample from a cell, (2) pick and place the sample, (3) grip the sample, and (4) carry test with tensile testing device having force and displacement resolution suitable for submicron scale biological soft materials. By fusing focused ion beam (FIB) based sample preparation and MEMS-based mechanical characterization technique, a novel test protocol was developed, which was able to address the aforementioned four major hurdles. The MEMS-based tensile testing technique was designed, developed, and fabricated to accommodate soft and fragile sample such as a cell wall. Using FIB-based sample preparation and MEMS-based sample characterization technique, 15x5 \u00b5m samples were excised from onion outer epidermal peel and characterized under tensile loading both in major and minor growth directions of a cell. The measured mean modulus, fracture strength, and fracture strain in the major growth direction were 3.7 \u00b1 0.8 GPa, 95.5 \u00b1 24.1 MPa, and 3.0 \u00b1 0.5%, respectively. The corresponding properties along the minor growth direction were 4.9 \u00b1 1.2 GPa, 159 \u00b1 48.4 MPa, and 3.8 \u00b1 0.5%, respectively. The fracture strength and fracture strain were significantly different (p<0.05), whereas modulus of elasticity values were not significantly different (p>0.05), along the major and minor growth directions. The wall fragment level modulus of elasticity anisotropy for a dehydrated cell wall was 1.23, suggesting a limited anisotropy of the cell wall itself compared with tissue-scale results. However, this technique requires the use of a scanning electron microscope, which exposes the sample to vacuum that dries up the sample. \nAs water content has significant impact on the mechanical response of cell wall, to accommodate cell wall samples with water, another novel test protocol was developed and supported by a new MEMS tensile testing device. For preparing never dried cell wall samples, a cryotome based technique was developed. The new MEMS device uses a separate 3D force sensor having very low stiffness with large sample placing area; this allowed the test to be conducted under optical microscope. Using cryotome based technique, subcellular scale cell wall samples were tested for two different water state conditions; which allowed the investigation of the quantitative role of water to wall mechanics. Like tissue sample, the cell wall at subcellular scale showed biphasic material behavior. However, instead of a transition zone between linear elastic or viscoelastic and linear plastic zones, the subcellular scale samples showed plateau-like trend exhibiting sharp drop in modulus value. The critical ranges of stress (20-40 MPa) and strain (5-12%) of the plateau zone were identified. The strain energy of 1.3 MJ m-3 calculated from the critical stress-strain range was in accordance with the previously estimated hydrogen bond energy in cell wall. It was also observed that subcellular scale sample shows very large lateral/axial deformation (0.8\u00b10.13) at fracture, from which an estimate of the free space in the wall network was made. In addition, by investigating the wall mechanical properties at three different water states, it was suggested that the contribution of water is critical for plastic flow behavior of matrix polymers. \nThe cells in plant tissue are joined together by a distinct layer called the middle lamella (ML), which bridges the gap between the subcellular- and tissue-scale mechanical properties. However, the nanoscale size of the ML presents formidable challenges to its characterization as a separate layer. Consequently, the mechanical properties of the ML under tensile loading are as yet unknown. The ML samples were prepared the same way as mentioned in the earlier two different techniques: FIB based and cryotome based. The only difference was the samples were cut including ML contact area between the two adjacent cells. Our test results showed that even at a subcellular scale, the ML appears to be stronger than the wall fragments. There was also evidence that the ML attached at the corner of cells more strongly attached than at the rest of the contact area. The contribution of the additional ML contact area was estimated to be 40.6 MPa. Wall fragment samples containing an ML layer were also significantly stronger (p < 0.05) than the wall fragments without an ML layer. \nApart from direct excision of cell wall samples within the boundary of single cell, another technique was developed to characterize cell wall at subcellular scale while the sample is tested at tissue scale. The same MEMS-based tensile testing device was used as mentioned in the cryotome based technique. The tissue samples were stained by fluorescent polystyrene beads (500 nm in diameter), which can be tracked by a digital image correlation based image analysis technique. Thus, it was possible to investigate the strain field of wall samples at subcellular scale sample by stretching the sample at tissue scale. The Young's modulus values of individual cell walls of dehydrated and rehydrated samples were 3.0\u00b11.0 GPa and 0.4\u00b10.2 GPa, respectively, and are different from the Young's modulus values of the global tissue-scale dehydrated and rehydrated samples, which were 1.9\u00b10.3 GPa and 0.08\u00b10.02 GPa, respectively. The Poisson's ratio showed more than a three-fold increase due to hydration.        \nThe insights gained from experimentations of cell wall at different length scales and the intercellular adhesion were used to link the microscale (subcellular) to macroscale (tissue) mechanical properties. To scale up, a structure-based multiscale finite element method (FEM) computational model was developed, which takes the subcellular scale mechanical properties and the extracellular parameters and properties of the ML as inputs. To bridge micro and macroscales, a 3D repetitive volume element (RVE), which includes both subcellular and extracellular parameters, was built with ABAQUS\u00ae (a finite element modeling software). The two dimensionally arranged RVEs makes up a tissue patch of multiple cells. In a single RVE, wall fragments from four adjacent cells are attached by surface cohesive contact to define the ML interaction. By changing the shape parameters of a cell, four different RVEs were constructed, which allowed the quantitative investigation of cell shape to tissue scale mechanical responses. The RVE finite element simulations were run within 1% strain to ensure elastic only deformation. It was observed that change in the ML contact stiffness has little to no impact on tissue level mechanical responses. However, anisotropy in modulus values was observed for all levels of ML contact stiffness examined. For the range of shape factor values considered, E2 (modulus in transverse direction) and \u03bd21 remain almost unchanged. However, E1 (modulus in longitudinal direction), \u03bd12, and E2/E1 showed substantial change in values when the width to length ratio (WL) value is 1. The G12 (shear modulus in 12 direction, i.e., 1=longitudinal plane orientation direction and 2=transverse direction) values were different for all WL ratios. The experimental results showed good agreement in the anisotropy of modulus value (1.25) observed in the computational model (1.29). A framework is presented to scale up subcellular scale mechanical properties to tissue scale. \nLastly, this study suggests that there are important insights of cell wall mechanics and structural features that can only be investigated by carrying tensile characterization of samples not confounded by extracellular parameters. To the best of our knowledge, the plant cell wall at subcellular scale was never characterized under tensile loading. By coupling the structure based multiscale modeling and mechanical characterizations at different length scales, an attempt was made to provide novel insights towards understanding the mechanics and architecture of cell wall. This study also suggests that a multiscale investigation is essential for garnering fundamental insights into the hierarchical deformation of biological systems.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9566], "author_name_tesi": "Zamil, Mohammad S", "last_name_ssi": "Zamil", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Mohammad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Virendra Puri", "Virendra Puri", "Nicole Robitaille Brown", "Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Md Amanul Haque", "Ho Jae Yi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Virendra Puri, Dissertation Advisor", "Virendra Puri, Committee Chair", "Nicole Robitaille Brown, Committee Member", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Member", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Member", "Ho Jae Yi, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Plant cell walls", "Mechanical characterization", "Tensile loading", "MEMS", "Biomaterials", "Bridging subcellular and tissue scales"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "COMPARATIVE STUDY OF DECLINE CURVE ANALYSIS METHODS USING A LAB-SCALE GAS RESERVOIR", "id": "q237hr920", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13014", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the most effective approaches to estimate Original Gas in Place (OGIP) in dry gas volumetric reservoirs is the use of Decline Curve Analysis methods. The strength of these methods is that they rely on the availability of initial reservoir pressure and production data (flow-rate vs time), which are generally abundant, to generate estimates of original gas in place and future production predictions. Decline curve analysis methods are generally validated using field production data or data from computationally reservoir models. Some disadvantages of these validation approaches include the fact that gas reserves cannot be readily obtained from field data, and the accuracy of production predictions from reservoir models is subject to the model reliability. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of a lab-scale gas reservoir to generate reliable production data for a rigorous validation of decline curve analysis methods recently proposed in the literature. The methods under consideration are Flowing Material Balance (Mattar and Anderson, 2003), Ye and Ayala (2012, 2013), Stumpf and Ayala (2016), and Zhang and Ayala (2013, 2014a, 2014b).

Current treatments for liver failure are inadequate, relying on liver or hepatocyte transplantation, both of which are significantly limited by insufficient donor tissue, donor-to-donor variability in tissue quality, and the risk of rejection, infection, or adverse immune response in the recipient. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) \u2013 derived from the inner cell mass of developing blastocysts and capable of giving rise to any cell type in the body upon exposure to the appropriate conditions \u2013 offer promise as an alternative source of cells from which a supply of hepatocytes may be derived for therapeutic transplantations. Hepatocytes derived from hESCs would also potentially provide a repository of cells for pharmacological and toxicological studies which rely on hepatocytes obtained from human donors as models for drug metabolism research and predictors of toxicological responses that may be associated with exposure to xenobiotic compounds. While a number of studies have demonstrated that hESCs are capable of differentiating into hepatic precursors, the precise means by which these cells may be derived, and the genes governing this multifaceted process, have yet to be fully elucidated. In this investigation we employed a unique hepatic differentiation protocol in which hESCs are cultured for only 10 days on collagen matrix in our hepatocyte media (William\u2019s E Media supplemented with HEPES, glutamine, antibiotics, dexamethasone, insulin, transferrin, selenium, and linoleic acid/albumin). The resulting cell population exhibits hepatic-like cell morphology and decreased expression of \u2018stemness\u2019 markers including certain transcription factors, surface antigens, and enzymes. The hESC-derived hepatic-like cells express enhanced levels of hepatic markers including transcription factors, nuclear receptors, liver-generated plasma proteins, protease inhibitors, metabolic enzymes, and biotransformation enzymes. Acquisition of hepatic function is confirmed by the cells\u2019 ability to transport anionic compounds and store glycogen. Notably, expression of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) \u2013 a nuclear receptor which, in the adult liver, is involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes including all three phases of hepatic biotransformation and elimination as well as energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis \u2013 is highly increased in the hepatic-like cells, to levels approaching those of cultures of primary human hepatocytes. CAR is also expressed robustly and consistently in human fetal liver tissue obtained from subjects of a range of gestational ages. Modulation of CAR levels in differentiating hESCs using a lentivirus system \u2013 which we demonstrate to stably and robustly transduce both hESCs and cultures of primary human hepatocytes without affecting markers of pluripotency or the hepatic phenotype, respectively \u2013 reveals that CAR over-expression and siRNA-mediated attenuation of CAR mRNA levels result in corresponding changes in expression of hepatic markers previously assessed. In contrast, expression of pregnane X receptor (PXR) \u2013 the nuclear receptor exhibiting the most sequence homology to CAR \u2013 is not increased during hepatic differentiation and is negligible in human fetal liver tissue. Further, exogenous expression of PXR in hESCs induced to differentiate along a hepatic lineage does not result in enhanced expression of markers of the hepatic phenotype. Taken together, these results illuminate a unique, expeditious means by which functional hepatic-like cells may be derived from hESCs and further define a novel role for CAR in human hepatic specification.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5711], "author_name_tesi": "Zamule, Stephanie M.", "last_name_ssi": "Zamule", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Curtis John Omiecinski", "Curtis John Omiecinski", "Gong Chen", "Peter John Hudson", "Gary H Perdew", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Kent Eugene Vrana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Curtis John Omiecinski, Dissertation Advisor", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Committee Chair", "Gong Chen, Committee Member", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["embryonic stem cells", "constitutive androstane receptor", "liver", "differentiation", "nuclear receptor", "development", "lentivirus"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Mashups for the Web-Active End User\n", "id": "9241", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4807", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mashups are essentially combinations of APIs and online data in a single interface.

Such development was explored in the context of health status and age/cohort group membership. The first concern of this investigation was to explore the measurement of health behaviors. Second, the following questions were investigated: (1) Do health behaviors change? (2) Does health behavior change vary by age/cohort group? (3) Does health status affect health behavior change? And (4) does the magnitude of health behavior change affect mortality outcomes?\nQ-sort results indicated that health behavior was best assessed separately by health behavior domain (e.g. smoking abstention, alcohol moderation, food consumption, food preparation, physical activity, seat belt use, dental care, and medical care) and by health behavior criteria (e.g. cardiovascular disease, disability).  Frequencies of change indicated that smoking abstention, cardiovascular criteria and seat belt use remained stable while smoking abstention, disability criteria, alcohol moderation food consumption, food preparation, physical activity, dental, and medical care showed some change. Change in health behaviors over time differed by age/cohort group and health status for food consumption, food preparation, and medical care. Logistic Regression results indicated that while magnitude of health behavior change did not predict mortality, higher levels of physical activity decreased the likelihood of mortality. \nUsing health belief and life course perspectives was effective in examining health behavior change for individuals across the lifespan. The results indicated that while it is important to examine health behavior change in the context of age/cohort groups and health status, it is also important to isolate the phenomenon of change to specific health behavior domains, because assumptions about health behavior change could not be generalized to all health behavior domains. \nFuture health behavior interventions need to focus on the old-old and individuals with physical disability. Both the old-old and physical disability individuals did not commonly display positive health behavior change. The health behavior literature indicates that it is never too late to positively alter health behaviors to produce a higher quality of life. Therefore these specific populations need to be targeted to promote positive health behavior change, to limit future onsets of further disability, morbidity, and even premature death. Future work can explore health behaviors change with respect to other health conditions (i.e. diabetes, depression, cognitive impairment, osteoporosis, liver disease, obesity, cancer) and in alternative samples to examine the generalizability of the current findings.\nThe findings did not indicate that positive health behavior change prevents premature mortality. However, a follow-up analysis did indicate a positive relationship between high physical activity levels and survivorship. To prevent premature mortality it may be salient to merely maintain a high level of physical activity rather than initiating positive health behavior change. Therefore, interventions may need to focus on changing poor health behaviors; rather than minimally having the objective of inducing some positive change across several health behaviors. Thus, while there was weak support for positive health behavior changes increasing survivorship, possibly when incorporating other outcomes (disease, disability) positive health behavior change could be seen to decrease the prevalence of disease and/or disability.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1927], "author_name_tesi": "Zanjani, Faika A.K.", "last_name_ssi": "Zanjani", "middle_name_ssi": "A.K.", "first_name_ssi": "Faika", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["K Warner Schaie", "Sherry Lynn Willis", "Keith E Whitfield", "Michael J Rovine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["K Warner Schaie, Committee Chair", "Sherry Lynn Willis, Committee Chair", "Keith E Whitfield, Committee Member", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["health behavior change"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE NUTRITIONAL EFFICIENCY OF DAIRY HEIFERS LIMIT FED DIETS CONTAINING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FORAGE AND CONCENTRATE\n", "id": "9520", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2051", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Limit feeding high concentrate or high digestibility diets for growing dairy heifers may offer an economical alternative to ad libitum consumption of high forage, low digestibility diets that are traditionally fed to dairy heifers. Literature pertaining to economic, physiological, and nutritional responses to alterations in feeding level and dietary concentrate level are reviewed. It is concluded that limit feeding higher concentrate diets do not affect growth or first lactation milk production compared to dairy heifers fed high forage diets when equivalent levels of gain are obtained. It is also concluded that limit feeding high concentrate diets does not need to be excluded as a management option and may offer an opportunity for heifer growers to reduce feed costs and environmental output under certain circumstances. The level of dietary crude protein resulting in maximum efficiency of nutrient utilization under a limit feeding, high concentrate management system and differences from limit-fed high forage feeding are not available from the literature. Therefore, the objective of the reported experiment was to evaluate efficiency of nutrient and N utilization of dairy heifers limit-fed a low forage/high concentrate and high forage diets at equal ME intakes and 4 levels of N intake.\nThe hypothesis of this experiment is that a low forage (LF) ration will be utilized with a greater efficiency than a high forage ration (HF) by dairy heifers and that the response will be affected by level of N intake. To test this hypothesis, 8 Holstein heifers (beginning at 362 \u00b1 7 kg and 12.3 \u00b1 0.4 mo) were fed eight rations according to a split-plot, 4 x 4 Latin square design. Treatments were formulated to contain 25% or 75% forage (corn silage and chopped wheat straw) and fed at 4 levels of N intake [0.94 (Low), 1.62 (MLow), 2.30 (MHigh), 2.96 (High) g N/kg BW0.75 per d]. Diets were limit-fed to maintain equal ME intake. Organic matter (OM) intake was greater for heifers fed HF, but, due to increased OM digestibility of LF (74.0 vs 67.6% \u00b1 0.9; P <0.01), digestible OMI was unaffected by forage level (P > 0.50). OM digestibility was affected by an interaction between forage level and N intake (P < 0.01); increasing to a plateau of 78.01% at 18.43 %CP for LF and 68.78% at 13.90 %CP for HF fed heifers. Apparent N digestibility was greater for heifers fed LF and increased from 47.7% to 80.8% between Low and High N intake. Less N appeared in the feces of heifers fed LF than HF (45.56 vs 52.60 g per d). Urea-N excretion was not different between forage levels, but increased linearly with N intake. Concentration of plasma urea N (PUN) was significantly higher for LF and with increasing N intake. Like urea-N excretion, daily urinary N excretion was affected only by N intake. Retained N responded linearly to increased levels of NI. As a result of a significant interaction between forage level and NI on fecal N excretion and numerical differences in urine N, retained N at maximum N intake was greater for LF than HF. In spite of this observation, the percent of N intake that was retained only tended to be affected by an interaction and was not significantly affected by forage level. It is concluded that increasing N intake increases the digestibility of OM, the magnitude of which depends on the level of dietary forage provided. Furthermore, differences in N utilization between LF and HF in this trial were small and were not evident until N intake increased to impractical levels.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2033], "author_name_tesi": "Zanton, Geoffrey Ivan", "last_name_ssi": "Zanton", "middle_name_ssi": "Ivan", "first_name_ssi": "Geoffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Naomi S Altman", "Gabriella Anne Varga", "Michael O'connor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Dissertation Advisor", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Committee Chair", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member", "Gabriella Anne Varga, Committee Member", "Michael O'connor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dairy heifer", "forage to concentrate ratio", "protein intake"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Response process validation of equivalent test forms:  How qualitative data can support the construct validity of multiple test forms\n", "id": "7662", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5584", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When developing multiple test forms, test developers need to be concerned with whether each form is measuring the intended construct in the same manner.

Much of the latest progress in the field has centered around transverse momentum-dependent (or \u201cunintegrated\u201d) parton distributions: in particular the prediction of the high-energy behavior of these distributions, in the form of the Balitsky-JIMWLK equations, and the development of the hybrid factorization framework, which connects the unintegrated parton distributions to predictions for experimentally measured cross sections. With the advent of high-energy proton-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC, we are able to experimentally test these predictions for the first time. In this dissertation, I show two case studies of these predictions, to illustrate the use of the hybrid factorization at leading and next-to-leading order.\n\nFirst, as a simple example, I analyze the azimuthal angular correlation for a Drell-Yan process, the production of a lepton pair with an associated hadron. The correlation for back-to-back emission turns out to be determined by the low-momentum region of the unintegrated gluon distribution, and the correlation for parallel emission is determined by the high-momentum region. Accordingly, a proper prediction of the correlation at all angles requires a gluon distribution with physically realistic behavior at both high and low momenta. Furthermore, the properties of the central double peak that emerges in Drell-Yan production can provide some insight into the form of the gluon distribution.\n\nI'll then describe a numerical calculation of the cross section for inclusive hadron production, which incorporates all corrections up to next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. This calculation illustrates several obstacles presented by subleading terms, including the removal of divergences by renormalizing the integrated and unintegrated parton distributions. The results of the calculation are negative at high transverse momentum, which is surprising but may be mathematically reasonable, since the perturbative approximation to the cross section may break down under those kinematic conditions. However, it may be possible to make meaningful predictions for the nuclear modification ratio R_pA despite the negative cross section.\n\nMoving beyond next-to-leading order, it may be possible to cure the negativity of the inclusive hadron cross section by altering the formulas used. I'll show two possible methods of doing so: first, a straightforward resummation of selected higher-order terms corresponding to gluon loop diagrams is able to mitigate the negativity, though it requires some alterations of unclear theoretical origin. A more promising alternative seems to be use of exact kinematic definitions, incorporating terms which disappear in the infinite-energy limit; this constrains the kinematics to eliminate the region of phase space which most strongly contributes to the negativity. In this way, the calculation can be adapted to produce reasonable results at high transverse momentum.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10142], "author_name_tesi": "Zaslavsky, David ", "last_name_ssi": "Zaslavsky", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anna Stasto", "Irina Mocioiu", "Mark Strikman", "James Joseph Brannick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anna Stasto, Dissertation Advisor", "Irina Mocioiu, Committee Member", "Mark Strikman, Committee Member", "James Joseph Brannick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["QCD", "small-x physics", "small x", "heavy ion collisions", "partons", "cross sections", "BK evolution", "QCD evolution"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ESSAYS ON ADAPTATION RESPONSES TO CLIMATE VARIABILITY IN INDIA", "id": "sb397825r", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12788", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Studying interactions between human and natural systems presents a unique opportunity for multidisciplinary and policy-relevant research. This dissertation consists of three chapters that examine how changes in water access, availability and use influence agricultural adaptation, and labor mobility in rural India. Since an increasingly variable future climate will amplify stresses on the water cycle, with large and uneven consequences, the findings from these chapters have important implications for both environmental and developmental policies that seek to promote long-run sustainability. \n            The first chapter assesses the challenges of groundwater depletion, surface water stress, and food security that India is likely to face with future climate change. Different from previous literature in this area, it explicitly accounts for both water demand and supply by combining an econometric model of irrigation decision-making with a process based hydrology model.  The results highlight significant spatial and regional heterogeneity in future changes in groundwater demand and supply.  A complete loss of non-renewable groundwater irrigation could reduce annual crop production by as much as 25 percent, directly affecting the caloric intake of more than 170 million people. Results also indicate that India\u2019s large proposed river linking scheme is unlikely to alleviate groundwater stress nationally without substantial investments in reservoir storage capacity. \n            The second chapter examines how the introduction of high yield variety of seeds in the mid-1960s (Green Revolution) and the resulting path dependency of groundwater development underlies the results we see in chapter one. The results suggest that increasing access to more reliable, yet largely unsustainable sources of groundwater, have equipped farmers with the ability to withstand monsoonal fluctuations in the irrigation-intensive dry season. The results also indicate that initial groundwater endowments have influenced the types of irrigation infrastructure and capacities that have developed in India as a result of the Green Revolution, with lasting effects on the adaptability of agriculture to weather shocks.\n            The third chapter investigates how irrigation water access, availability and use also have wider spillover effects on the agrarian labor economy. Results show that migration decisions respond to agricultural opportunity costs associated with irrigation and that access to assured irrigation from deep tubewells determines the relative benefits of migration. Further, higher electricity provision that facilitates groundwater extraction from greater depths increases the agricultural opportunity cost of rural households and reduces the short-term migration of its members. From a policy perceptive, shutting down access to groundwater will have significant effects on temporary labor mobility.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12703], "author_name_tesi": "Zaveri, Esha ", "last_name_ssi": "Zaveri", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Esha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Fisher-Vanden", "Karen Ann Fisher-Vanden", "David Gerard Abler", "Douglas Harvey Wrenn II", "Jenni Evans"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Fisher-Vanden, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Ann Fisher-Vanden, Committee Chair", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Douglas Harvey Wrenn II, Committee Member", "Jenni Evans, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Groundwater", "Indian Monsoon", "Climate Change", "Migration", "Irrigation", "Adaptation", "Inter-basin transfers"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "New approaches to understanding cultural change and continuity at the Bronze-Iron Age transition in Lika, Croatia", "id": "14513ekz5008", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14513", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The European Bronze (ca. 2500 to 800 B.C.) and Iron (ca. 800-35 B.C.) Ages were times of swift cultural change that resulted in new social, political, and economic lifeways. Bronze and then iron-working technologies became common; tools and weapons began to be mass-produced in standardized forms; social differentiation and ranking became more entrenched; and peoples and ideas became increasingly mobile in Europe. Archaeological methods are well suited for identifying both the material and organizational changes that happened during this time (e.g. changes in status, diet, belief systems, settlement), and their effects on local populations. This dissertation examines evidence of increasingly complex social and economic systems during the Late Bronze (1300-800 BC) and Early Iron (800-600 BC) Ages in the Lika region of northern Croatia using burial practices and subsistence strategies as proxies of social reorganization.\n\nThe groups who lived in Lika during the Late Bronze and Iron Ages are known collectively as the Iapodians because of an assumed shared mortuary ritual and material culture (Drechsler-Bi\u017ei\u0107 1979) that is assumed to have formed with the arrival of Urnfield culture and populations in the region and mixing with indigenous populations. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of human remains from multiple sites throughout Lika show that diet remained largely constant throughout the Bronze and Iron Ages. Millet cultivation remained an important staple crop for local risk-management agricultural strategies, and any variation in its consumption was likely more an effect of the Lika climate than sociopolitical developments. New radiocarbon dates presented in this project are used to evaluate the assumed progression of these material markers, finding the earliest phases- those most important for understanding the emergence of a Iapodian material culture- are limited in their ability to describe and interpret local sequences of cultural development. These findings are supplemented with new analyses of the existing mortuary data and literature to recreate basic sociopolitical structures and identify the effects of long-distance exchange and interaction on cultural change and stability. Results show that groups in neighboring valleys adopted new rituals, materials, and status roles more gradually than expected based on varying socio-economic circumstances and contact with communities outside of Lika. In sum, this dissertation shows that while there was a trend towards regional sociopolitical and economic homogenization by the end of the Bronze-Iron Age transition, there is no evidence of a politically or culturally unified Iapodian group in Lika at this time.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15050], "author_name_tesi": "Zavodny, Emily Kathryn", "last_name_ssi": "Zavodny", "middle_name_ssi": "Kathryn", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Barbara Mcclure", "Sarah Barbara Mcclure", "George Robert Milner", "Douglas James Kennett", "Mark Munn", "David Webster", "Jacqueline Balen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Barbara Mcclure, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarah Barbara Mcclure, Committee Chair", "George Robert Milner, Committee Member", "Douglas James Kennett, Committee Member", "Mark Munn, Outside Member", "David Webster, Committee Member", "Jacqueline Balen, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Croatia", "Bronze Age", "Iron Age", "stable isotopes", "radiocarbon dating", "development of complexity", "identity", "Iapodian", "chronology", "risk", "agriculture"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Using the State Need for Affiliation to Predict Perceptions of Touch as a Personal Space Interaction or Invasion\n\n", "id": "9661", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4205", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-01-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current study sought to clear up some of the inherent ambiguity of touch\u2019s meaning by examining the extent to which a person\u2019s state need for affiliation (SN-Aff) explains differences in perceptions of a touch.

I propose that because touch constrains personal space, response to touch depends upon the touched person\u2019s SN-Aff.  In a high-impact behavioral study, a confederate touched, leaned close to or got the attention of a participant (n=262) after the participant\u2019s SN-Aff was measured.

Confirming predictions, only women were affected by the anxious display; specifically, while women in the no emotion condition were diagnosed similarly to men, women who ignored their anxiety were under-diagnosed. Using SSL eliminated this under-diagnosis effect. Results suggest emotion stereotypes as a mechanism for why under-diagnosis of CAD occurs for women, and offers patients SSL as a means of empowerment so as to interrupt these stereotypes and help physicians provide more accurate diagnoses.

Here, two start-up methods were developed and further improved for the enrichment of CO2 fixing and biofuel producing biocathodes. In the pre-enrichment method, anaerobic cultures inoculated with bog sediment were initially heterotrophically grown on glucose then inoculated into bioelectrochemical system (BES) cathode chambers. Next, CO2 was provided as sole carbon source and electron acceptor to select for those bacteria able to switch to autotrophic growth. Following the 14 day heterotrophic start-up period, recorded current density uptake gradually increased and was sustained over a period of about two months with concomitant decreases in cathode chamber headspace CO2. Maximum current density consumed was \u221234 \u00b1 4 mA/m2 (maximum current consumption of \u221250 \u00b1 6 \u00b5A) at a set potential of \u22120.4 V [versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)].

Oscillibacter sp. (99% sequence identity) and Clostridium butyricum (99% sequence similarity) were also dominant groups detected in both replicate biocathode communities. A total of 26 isolated bacterial strains were obtained by cultivating cathode scrapings on agar lacking organic nutrients under anoxic, autotrophic growth conditions with CO2 as sole carbon source and H2 as electron donor. Isolate ZZ16 showed 99% sequence identity to Clostridium propionicum. Isolate ZZ25 had highest sequence identity (98%) with Tissierella sp.S2. Isolates ZZ21, ZZ22, and ZZ23 were assigned with 97\u201399% sequence identity to the species Clostridium celerecrescens, a bacterium known for biocorrosion of steel surfaces. \n\tThe second biocathode start-up method tested concerned a recently developed inversion technique in which a sediment microbial fuel cell (sMFC) anode is electrically converted into a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) biocathode. This inversion method was tested here using a freshwater bog inoculum incubated at 30\u00b0C or 48\u00b0C without additional organic substrate during sMFC operation in either open circuit or closed circuit mode. After 3 months of sMFC operation, sMFC anodes were inverted to act as electron accepting biocathodes in anaerobic two-chamber BESs. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results showed that electrodes operated initially as closed circuit sMFC outperformed electrodes operated at open circuit. During long term operation, biocathodes started as sMFC anodes at an elevated temperature of 48\u00b0C outperformed those at 30oC. Maximum current density uptake of \u221213 mA/m2 (maximum current uptake of \u221219 \u00b5A) and maximum power density consumption of \u221216 mW/m2 were obtained for BES containing an inverted anode obtained from a closed circuit sMFC (48\u00b0C). Cathode chamber headspace gas analyses showed CO2 significantly decreased only for these BES reactors operated at 48\u00b0C, suggesting explorations in temperature beyond the mesophilic range typically studied may enrich novel electrotrophs. Acetate accumulation was only detected in these 48\u00b0C reactors, further substantiating microbial electrosynthesis via reduction of CO2. These results show the glucose pre-enrichment method as well as the elevated temperature inversion method can be successfully employed for enrichment of CO2 fixing and biofuel/biochemical producing biocathodes. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7809], "author_name_tesi": "Zaybak, Zehra ", "last_name_ssi": "Zaybak", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zehra", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["BES", "Bioelectrochemical System", "Biocathode", "Carbon Dioxide Fixation", "Biofuel", "Bioelectrosynthesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Experiencing Variety and Change in  Head Start Parent Involvement Policies and Practices: Personal and Professional and Perspectives", "id": "7096", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2069", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n     Head Start is a forty one year old program, serving children and families living in poverty. Since 1975, Head Start services were planned and implemented in accordance with Head Start Performance Standards, (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1975/1997), which are federal requirements for ensuring that all Head Start families receive comprehensive services in health, nutrition, education, and social services. Parent involvement is at the heart of Head Start.  Head Start believes that parents are a child\u2019s must influential teacher, and are to be engaged in program activities and decision-making processes that cultivate positive outcomes in families.\n     This study describes the parent involvement policies and practices of Head Start that foster positive outcomes in families, such as those ascribed to social competency, and in particular those related to social emotional resiliency. Head Start defines social competency as a person\u2019s everyday effectiveness in dealing with their present environment and responsibilities inherent in everyday living (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1997). Resiliency is the process of struggling through hardships that progress by accumulating small successes which occur side by side with failures, setbacks and disappointments and result in a cluster of strengths (Siebert, 1996).  Social emotional resiliency speaks to strengths such as self-esteem, self confidence, empathy, hopefulness, helpfulness, determination and persistence. This study also details the barriers that preclude successful parent involvement in Head Start programs. A mixed research approach was utilized, including a literature review, stories of Head Start parents posted on the National Head Start Association (NHSA) website and the Administration for Children and Families (ACYF) Bulletin, my autobiography, document review and interviews with four Blair County Head Start staff, current Blair County Head Start Policy Council parents, and three Head Start Federal Reviewers. \n     Autobiographical data included my reflections as a Head Start parent, teacher, manager, consultant and federal reviewer. The history and development of parent involvement policies and practices of Blair County Head Start were also significant to the data, as it was the program in which I began my experiences with Head Start, and where I continue to serve as a member of the Child Advocates Governing Board. Staff Interviews and document review of the program\u2019s parent involvement policies and practices enabled me to verify my personal recollections of my experiences with Blair County Head Start, in order to examine Head Start strategies for cultivating positive outcomes in families.  Literature review detailed the history of Head Start, the Head Start approach to cultivating resiliency, critiques on its parent involvement efforts, longitudinal studies on Head Start impact on families, and perspectives from former Head Start parents. Interviews with current Policy Council Parents provided insight into current policies and practices of Blair County Head Start.\nA process of comparing results from each of the data sources, autobiography, literature and document review, and interviews with Head Start staff and parents, enabled me to reach three conclusions. The research has led me to conclude that Head Start has a comprehensive plan for fostering positive outcomes in families, and in particular those which foster social-emotional resiliency. This plan is clearly defined in Head Start Performance Standards (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1975/1997).  Head Start also has a monitoring system for ensuring that Head Start programs across the nation adhere to Head Start Performance Standards, including those relevant to parent involvement. Additionally, I have concluded that although parents have reported that Head Start has been helpful in addressing family issues and achieving family goals, there remain Head Start programs which continue to struggle with involving families in ways that foster positive outcomes in families. \n     Several barriers to successful parent involvement were identified in researching Head Start parent involvement policies and practices. Some barriers identified were those elicited by Head Start programs, and others were inherent in the lives of families. For example, although Head Start\u2019s services are family centered, Head Start personnel do not always embrace families in ways that nurture parent involvement. Other factors that preclude successful parent involvement include conflicting schedules that occur as more families have been sent into the workforce or into educational endeavors, and rising transportation costs for programs and families. Personal barriers identified by Head Start parents were lack of self confidence and feelings of insecurity about meeting other families and taking on new experiences and challenges. Other parents said they did not participate in program opportunities because they felt hopeless and helpless, while living in the midst of adversity and abuse, and some stated they were not interested in the parent involvement experiences offered. Head Start programs continue to strive to address these barriers, however, much more must be done to examine the most effective practices for successfully involving families in ways which foster positive outcomes in families.\nA review of parent involvement policies and practices designed to foster positive outcomes in families, and an analysis of barriers that preclude successful parent involvement has led me to four recommendations. First, Head Start should revisit the current definition of parent involvement and redefine it to ensure it speaks to individual family goals. Second, Head Start personnel vary in the way in which they embrace Head Starts family centered approach to involving and engaging families. Therefore, performance evaluation of personnel should reflect these differences, and result in appropriate supports and training where it is as most needed. Additionally, Head Start programs should provide ongoing training and support to Head Start personnel to ensure they are individualizing parent involvement efforts in ways that address each family\u2019s interests, strengths, and goals and in accordance with Head Start Performance Standards (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1997).  Finally, Head Start programs must continue to utilize community assessment processes, self assessment, and parent perspectives to inform parent involvement policies and practices. \n     My dissertation shows that Head Start has a plan for responding to the changing needs of families since its birth in 1965, and many Head Start programs have successfully implemented those plans as defined by Head Start Performance Standards (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1975/1997). Head Start also has a comprehensive monitoring system which identifies those programs who do not successfully address parent involvement, as well as all other Head Start Performance Standards, in order to ensure that corrective action is taken, and parents are involved and engaged in ways that foster positive outcomes.  Therefore, I believe Head Start will meet the challenge, and ensure that all Head Start programs are successfully involving and engaging families. \n     \t\t\t\t", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2051], "author_name_tesi": "Zeak, Glenna L", "last_name_ssi": "Zeak", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Glenna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson", "Patrick Willard Shannon", "Thomas Daniel Yawkey", "John Philip Christman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson, Committee Member", "Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Member", "Thomas Daniel Yawkey, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Head Start", "parent involvement", "resiliency"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development Of A Three-dimensional, Three-phase Coupled Model For Simulating Hydraulic Fracture Propagation And Long-term Recovery In Tight Gas Reservoirs", "id": "19717", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9408", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the past decades, development of tight gas reservoirs has become more important. These low permeability reservoirs need to be stimulated effectively with hydraulic fracturing to produce economically. Stimulation design has improved with better understanding these unconventional reservoirs, advances in modeling and study of flow mechanisms.\nConventional fracture propagation models predict fracture geometry based on fracture fluid mechanics, rock mechanics, petrophysics and empirical/analytical leak-off models. Reservoir flow simulators are then used to evaluate post-fracture well performances. These approaches are called de-coupled modeling. It is a challenge to couple these two processes, particularly when dealing with large amounts of input data. Furthermore decoupled modeling is a time-intensive job that requires a coordinated effort from stimulation and reservoir engineers. This approach may not work in low-permeability reservoirs because the hydraulic fracture propagation is complex, fracture fluid leak-off is pressure/reservoir/fracture dependent and there are changes in in-situ stress and permeability during and after a fracture treatment. It has been recognized that fluid loss can be computed directly by solving the multiphase flow equations in porous media. Such an approach is more general and does not have many of the assumptions in decoupled models. Models based on this approach are called coupled models. Hydraulic fracturing is an integrated process of injection of fracture fluid, fracture propagation, proppant transport, clean-up and multi-phase flow through the reservoir. Available coupled models are not fully integrated as they were developed to simulate just one or two of these steps. \nThe main objective of this research is to develop an integrated coupled model which is capable of fully simulating reservoir flow, fracture propagation, proppant distribution, flowback, long term gas recovery and resulted stress change through a stationary reservoir/stress grid system. The model uses a three-dimensional, three-phase finite difference reservoir flow simulator coupled with a finite difference geomechanics model where both are applied on the same grid system. The model has been validated with published data in the literature. \nUsing the developed model, parametric studies have been carried out to quantify important factors affecting fracture and recovery processes such as injection rate, treatment volume, proppant type, flowback rate and flowing bottom hole pressure (FBHP). The model enables us to simulate and compare different scenarios and suggest the optimized hydraulic fracturing design. The new findings lead to better understandings of hydraulic fracturing and well performances in tight gas reservoirs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9207], "author_name_tesi": "Zeinijahromi, Mohamad ", "last_name_ssi": "Zeinijahromi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mohamad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yilin Wang", "Turgay Ertekin", "Russell Taylor Johns", "Terry Engelder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yilin Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Russell Taylor Johns, Committee Member", "Terry Engelder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Numerical Modelilng", "Hydraulic Fracturing Modeling", "Reservoir Simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Interscholastic Sports Participation and Academic Achievement: A New Statistical Approach to a Classic Question\n\n", "id": "8532", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3491", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research concerning the relationship between interscholastic sports participation and academic achievement has evolved over the past forty years.

First, I test the selection hypothesis that the negative relationships between student mobility and educational outcomes only exist because students who transfer between school districts are more likely to have lower levels of prior academic achievement and belong to more socially-disadvantaged social groups.  To do this, I perform propensity score modeling to compare the academic outcomes of transfer students and non-transfer students with extremely similar background characteristics.  Second, I explore whether student mobility is more detrimental to the academic outcomes of specific social groups relative to others based on differential levels of relationships between families and school personnel before the school transfer occurs.  To answer this research question, I utilize OLS and logistic regression techniques that interact levels of student mobility with measures of social group membership.  Finally, I investigate whether participation in specific extracurricular activities in the 8th and 12th grades provides academic benefits to transfer students.  Using the quasi-experimental statistical technique of propensity score modeling, I find that student mobility after the 8th grade is negatively related to students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 12th grade GPAs, the number of units students complete in math and science, and levels of educational attainment.  While the effects of transferring more than once during high school are larger than the effects of transferring once during high school, many of the differences between these groups of mobile students do not achieve statistical significance.  Moreover, this study does not find consistent support for the hypothesis that the effects of student mobility differ across different segments of the population.  Finally, this study finds that transfer students who participate in sports and academic activities in the 12th grade experience more positive academic outcomes relative to transfer students who do not participate in these activities.  While this study clarifies many aspects of the relationships between student mobility and students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 academic outcomes, it is clear that more research is needed to determine the best strategies that schools and parents can utilize to support transfers students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 intellectual growth and academic success.

As such, much work as been done to understand how nuclear dimension behaves for various C*-constructions. Along these lines, Hirshberg, Winter, and Zacharias proved that if A is a C*-algebra having finite nuclear dimension, and if A is being acted on by an automorphism having finite Rokhlin dimension, then the associated crossed product has finite nuclear dimension. This thesis substantially generalizes this result. Indeed, since a crossed product by the integers can be regarded as a Cuntz-Pimsner algebra associated to a singly-generated C*-correspondence, we propose a definition of Rokhlin dimension for arbitrary C*-correspondences that agrees with the traditional one in the singly-generated case. We then show that in many cases (such as for finitely generated projective correspondences), finiteness of nuclear dimension for Pimsner algebras is preserved in the presence of finite Rokhlin dimension.

The negative aspect that was selected by the greatest percentage of festival attendees was crowded, long lines; however, only 33.7% of festival attendees selected this aspect. Barriers that prevented participants from not attending a festival in the past were: distance needed to travel to the festival (36.4%), price of admission (31.5%), and date and/or time the festival was held (27.4%).\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14758], "author_name_tesi": "Zelinskie, Jennifer Ludmila", "last_name_ssi": "Zelinskie", "middle_name_ssi": "Ludmila", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Kathy Kelley", "Dr. Michela Centinari", "Denise Michelle Gardner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Kathy Kelley, Thesis Advisor", "Dr. Michela Centinari, Committee Member", "Denise Michelle Gardner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wine", "wine marketing", "mid-atlantic wine", "new jersey wine", "pennsylvania wine", "new york wine", "winery tasting room marketing", "wine marketing strategies", "wine consumer surveys"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "AN ACOUSTIC SUPERPOSITION METHOD FOR COMPUTING STRUCTURAL RADIATION IN SPATIALLY DIGITIZED DOMAINS", "id": "7377", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "645", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents a new method for computing acoustic fields of structural radiators based on acoustic superposition methods using meshless, spatially digitized domains (ASMDD).  Here the system matrices are assembled knowing only coordinate points in 3D space that describe the geometry of the radiating structure.  In contrast to conventional methods, ASMDD does not require cumbersome numerical, high orders of integration over elemental surfaces to populate system matrices.  The system\u2019s Greens functions are computed simply between source and receiver locations at their respective points.  A new derivation presented in this work provides an analytical solution for coincident source and receiver points where the Greens function is singular. Because of the simplifications used in the ASMDD method, the matrix formulation routines are highly efficient.\n\nA significant contribution of this thesis is the rendering of ASMDD point-based structures in a digital computational domain.  The digital domain is a uniform distribution of points equidistant in the x, y, and z directions.  The centroid of each activated voxel (used only as a means for visualizing the 3D surface) represents a point on the structural surface being modeled.  Work in this thesis exploits the inherent uniformity of neighboring points to formulate a locally determined outward-pointing, surface normal needed for acoustic radiation problems.  The ability of the calculated surface normals to model the curvature of the continuous radiating surface depends on the density of the meshless grid, i.e., higher curvature requires higher grid densities.  The attractiveness of the digital domain approach is its simplicity for morphing of structural shapes.  Shape iterations in the digitized space reduces to a simple process of activating or deactivating selected points in a contiguous manner depending on the desired shape during an optimization. As an example of this, the ASMDD formulation is used to compute the radiation from a square piston in a cubic baffle.  In the first example, the square piston shape is morphed to a hemi-sphere through five evolutionary changes in shape.  The sound power calculations are in good agreement with those computed with conventional BEM codes for shape changes that have low changes in curvature.  For a second example, the ASMDD surface points are shown to blend seamlessly with surface vibration of the plate generated via meshless structural dynamics (Meshless Local Petrov Galerkin method - MLPG).  This is achieved by solving the modal radiated acoustic power from the plate where the surface velocity is specified by the modal results determined by the MLPG method.  The sound power calculations are again in good agreement with those generated via conventional BEM codes.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [641], "author_name_tesi": "Zellers, Brian Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Zellers", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Hugo Koopmann", "Michael Lester Jonson", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "Martin Wesley Trethewey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Hugo Koopmann, Committee Chair", "Michael Lester Jonson, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member", "Martin Wesley Trethewey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ACOUSTICS", "MESHLESS", "COMPUTATIONAL", "DIGITAL", "ELEMENT FREE", "SUPERPOSITION"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF HYDROTHERMAL VENTS AT THE EASTERN-LAU SPREADING CENTER\n", "id": "10143", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3349", "abstract_tesi": "Deep sea hydrothermal vents form at plate boundaries and volcanic hotspots.

In general, communities associated with <em>Alviniconcha</em> sp. were lower in abundance and higher in Shannon diversity index and Pielou\u2019s evenness index, yet had fewer numbers of species. Though Bray-Curtis similarity between <em>I. nautilei</em> and <em>B. brevior</em> hosted communities was significantly different (ANOSIM, Global R=0.82, P=0.02; Chapter 3: Table 6) there was a qualitative trend of higher abundance and biomass and lower Shannon diversity index, Pielous\u2019s evenness index and mean number of species in collections of <em>B. brevior</em> relative to <em>I. nautilei</em> collections.

The new species of shrimp is in the family Alvinicarididae and genus <em>Alvinocaris</em>, a taxon specialized to deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems. A combination of morphological characters set it apart from known described species. Autapomorphies included a well-defined mesial notch in the telson and 2 rows of accessory spinules on the third to fifth\npereopods.

The participants were two prospective elementary teachers enrolled in a teacher certification program at a northeastern U.S. university. The current study is based on teaching experiment as a vehicle to investigate the conceptual development of the participants. \nThe investigation conducted on the two prospective elementary teachers revealed that they had a compartmentalized understanding of division of fractions. The results of the study suggest that the participants viewed division of fractions as a sequence of arithmetic relationships and they did not have an abstraction of quotitive situations. This study also shows that the participants made an abstraction of quotitive situations by reflecting on their mental activities in a diagrammatic world. \nIn addition, this study investigates the mathematical structure of division of fractions as seen through these two participants\u2019 work. As a result, division of fractions concept is based on two main operations: partitioning and quantification. In this regard, the overall goal for the division of fractions is to determine number of divisor groups through partitioning a given dividend quantity. Therefore, one needs to understand that in a given division of fractions problem, a given quantity needs to be partitioned based on a second quantity and then this partitioning needs to be quantified.   \nThis study also shows that the participants did not have an abstraction of divisor as an intensive quantity that connects the two extensive quantities, the dividend and the quotient. Lacking such an abstraction caused the participants not be able to coordinate the quantitative relationship between the divisor, remainder and fractional part of the quotient under the guidance of the overall goal they set for the given division of fractions problems. \nWhat also arises from this study is a developmental trajectory for creating an algorithm that is based on the participants\u2019 spontaneous activity. This algorithm is common denominator algorithm as opposed to the commonly known invert-and-multiply algorithm. Using diagrams for thinking about the common denominator algorithm helped the participants make conceptual advances in their thinking. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2428], "author_name_tesi": "Zembat, Ismail Ozgur", "last_name_ssi": "Zembat", "middle_name_ssi": "Ozgur", "first_name_ssi": "Ismail", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Martin A Simon", "Glendon Wilbur Blume", "Thomas M Dana", "James Edward Martin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Martin A Simon, Committee Chair", "Glendon Wilbur Blume, Committee Member", "Thomas M Dana, Committee Member", "James Edward Martin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Division of fractions", "understanding", "conceptual development", "teacher knowledge", "prospective elementary teachers"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS USING RADAR MICRO-DOPPLER SIGNATURES ", "id": "wp988j80x", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12606", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents the results of our experimental investigation into how different environments impact the classification of human motion using radar micro-Doppler (MD) signatures.

Among others,\ncyber-security is one of the cornerstones of the digital world. The reality is that everyday\nnumerous computer systems are compromised, and that sensitive information is leaked,\ncorrupted or forged. It does not only cause massive loss, but also hurts the confidence\nof people over digitized information processing, such as electronic commerce, digital\nhospitals, and online banking.\n\nIn order to enhance software security, the status of program execution is usually\nchecked and verified, aiming at detecting anomalies and cyber-attacks in their early\nstages. Once an intrusion is detected, the service provider needs to diagnose the attack\nand fix the issue promptly.\n\nAlthough the procedure of monitoring, diagnosing, and fixing is widely adopted when\ndealing with software failures as well as security incidents, there exist many unresolved\nissues in each of the actions. First, security checking and verification interleave with\nfunctional code, and thus slow down program execution; in reality, security is frequently\nsacrificed for the sake of speed. Second, enterprise software is complicated, comprising\nmillions of lines of code and a whole stack of intricate components. Once an anomaly is\ndetected, it is like looking for a noodle in a haystack to diagnose an attack and figure out\nthe root cause. Third, after a software vulnerability is reported, patch generation by the\nsoftware company is a lengthy process, which leaves the system vulnerable to attacks for\na long time.\n\nOur work is devoted to making the procedure of monitoring, diagnosing and fixing\nmore efficient and intelligent. We thus proposed, built, and evaluated techniques towards\nconcurrent monitoring, automated diagnosis, and instant defense generation.\n\nFirst, in order to resolve the tension between security checking and performance\noptimization, we propose a novel concurrent monitoring technology, named software\ncruising, which separates security checking from program functionality computation\nand runs them on separate processors or cores. It enforces monitoring in a concurrent\nand non-blocking fashion, and is featured with high efficiency and scalability. Unlike\nconventional security techniques, which usually trade effect for efficiency, software\ncruising satisfies both the monitoring effect and efficiency needs.\n\nNext, one of the main reasons that diagnosis is time-consuming is the lack of critical\ninformation in logs. Among a variety of runtime information, the calling context, i.e., the\nsequent of functions on the call stack, is especially useful; it provides precise information\nabout which components are connected to the anomalies. While some techniques have\nbeen proposed to track calling context efficiently, they lack a reliable and precise decoding\ncapability; or they work only under restricted conditions, that is, small programs without\nobject-oriented programming or dynamic component loading. These shortcomings have\nlimited the application of calling context tracking in practice. We propose an encoding\ntechnique, named DeltaPath, without those limitations: it provides precise and reliable\ndecoding, supports large-sized programs, both procedural and objected-oriented ones,\nand copes with dynamic class/library loading. The technique thus enables calling context\ntracking in a wide variety of scenarios.\n\nFinally, We present a new form of defense generation for implementing self-shielding\nsoftware. Given an instance of exploitation of a software vulnerability, a defense can be\ngenerated (without resorting to the software company) instantly and automatically. We\nhave applied the technique to dealing with buffer overrun bugs, such as the Heartbleed\nvulnerability. Our insight is that, given a buffer overrun bug, the buffers that can be\noverrun share the same calling context when they were allocated. Based on the obser-\nvation, we creatively utilize the calling context encoding technique to characterize and\ndistinguish heap buffers that can be exploited by attacker, and apply costly enhance-\nment precisely to those problematic buffers. We present HeapTherapy, a heap memory\nallocator that performs the characterization and installs defenses automatically. Our\nexperiments illustrate that by applying HeapTherapy Nginx server becomes immune to\nthe Heartbleed attack. Moreover, HeapTherapy defeats various other real-world overflow\nattacks and the slowdown averages only 6% on SPEC CPU2006.\n\nBy leveraging rich computation resources in multicore architectures as well as tech-\nniques such as virtualization, software cruising performs non-blocking monitoring with\nminimal performance penalty. Due to the availability of critical runtime information,\ndiagnosis becomes directed and precise. The instant defense generation represents a\npromising direction for implementing self-shielding software. The evaluation shows\nthat software security can be significantly enhanced through concurrent monitoring,\nintelligent anomaly diagnosis, and instant defense generation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10318], "author_name_tesi": "Zeng, Qiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Zeng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu", "Thomas La Porta", "Sencun Zhu", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas La Porta, Committee Chair", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Software security", "software cruising", "automated diagnosis", "self-patching", "calling context", "buffer overflow"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Acoustics of Ducted Rotors", "id": "10383", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3027", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, ducted rotors have become increasingly important to rotor craft for performance and safety reasons.

The general objectives of this research were: 1) to elucidate how early life contributed to global biogeochemical cycles and co-evolved with earth surface chemistry; and 2) to examine potential resulting biomarkers. \nProgressive oxygenation of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere has forced changes in the redox state of the oceans through geologic time. These fluctuations in ocean redox chemistry have altered the availability of bioactive trace metals necessary in microbial metabolisms. Genomics and phylogenetic investigations suggest that the use of metals in biology has evolved along with changes in metal availability, and different metals have responded in different ways. Furthermore, metal use in extant prokaryotes shows some predictable patterns, especially with metabolism, that could provide metal biosignatures in natural populations. Laboratory experiments recreating ancient ocean metal concentrations indicate that an increase in Mo availability resulting from the initial rise in atmospheric O2 at the end of the Archean (~3.45 Ga) could have stimulated rates of N2 fixation to modern levels. Furthermore, N2 fixation under enhanced Fe availability associated with widespread anoxia in the Archean and some Phanerozoic oceans could contribute to negative &#948;15N biosignatures preserved in the rock record.

The ITMM abandons the repetitive mesh sweeps of the traditional source iterations (SI) scheme in favor of constructing stored operators that account for the direct coupling factors among all the cells and between the cells and boundary surfaces. The main goals of this work were to develop the algorithms that construct these operators and employ them in the solution process, determine the most suitable way to parallelize the entire procedure, and evaluate the behavior and performance of the developed methods for increasing number of processes. This project compares the effectiveness of the ITMM with the SI scheme parallelized with the Koch-Baker-Alcouffe (KBA) method.\n\n\nThe ITMM is applicable to any spatial discretization of the first-order form of the transport equation. For simplicity, a majority of the testing was performed using the well-known diamond difference spatial discretization. The ITMM has also been implemented with the AHOT-N discretization. Likewise, an isotropic treatment of the scattering term was used for primary testing of the new approach, and anisotropic scattering was implemented to demonstrate ITMM capabilities.\n\n\nThe primary parallel solution method involves a decomposition of the domain into smaller spatial sub-domains, each with their own transport matrices, and coupled together via interface boundary angular fluxes. Each sub-domain has its own set of ITMM operators and represents an independent transport problem. Multiple iterative parallel solution methods have investigated, including parallel block Jacobi (PBJ), parallel red/black Gauss-Seidel (PGS), and parallel GMRES (PGMRES).\n\n\nThe number of global iterations is a reflection of the coupling among the sub-domains. Tight coupling means that the transport effects of one sub-domain have significant impact on the flux of another sub-domain, and many iterations are needed for convergence. Loose coupling means effects are more localized. Increasing the scattering ratio c decreases neutron absorption, allowing them to travel farther through the domain and tightening the sub-domain coupling. Decreasing cell dimension h (or alternatively decreasing the total interaction cross section) decreases the optical thickness of the medium, meaning fewer neutron interactions and again longer distances between the neutron\u2019s birth and death locations.\n\n\nThe fastest observed parallel solution method, PGS, was used in a weak scaling comparison with the PARTISN code. Compared to the state-of-the-art SI-KBA with diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA), this new method without acceleration/preconditioning is not competitive for any problem parameters considered. The best comparisons occur for problems that are difficult for SI DSA, namely highly scattering and optically thick. SI DSA execution time curves are generally steeper than the PGS ones. However, until further testing is performed it cannot be concluded that SI DSA does not outperform the ITMM with PGS even on several thousand or tens of thousands of processors. The PGS method does outperform SI DSA for the periodic heterogeneous layers (PHL) configuration problems. Although this demonstrates a relative strength/weakness between the two methods, the practicality of these problems is much less, further limiting instances where it would be beneficial to select ITMM over SI DSA.\n\n\nThe results strongly indicate a need for a robust, stable, and efficient acceleration method (or preconditioner for PGMRES). The spatial multigrid (SMG) method is currently incomplete in that it does not work for all cases considered and does not effectively improve the convergence rate for all values of scattering ratio c or cell dimension h. Nevertheless, it does display the desired trend for highly scattering, optically thin problems. That is, it tends to lower the rate of growth of number of iterations with increasing number of processes, P, while not increasing the number of additional operations per iteration to the extent that the total execution time of the rapidly converging accelerated iterations exceeds that of the slower unaccelerated iterations.\n\n\nA predictive parallel performance model has been developed for the PBJ method. Timing tests were performed such that trend lines could be fitted to the data for the different components and used to estimate the execution times. Applied to the weak scaling results, the model notably underestimates construction time, but combined with a slight overestimation in iterative solution time, the model predicts total execution time very well for large P. It also does a decent job with the strong scaling results, closely predicting the construction time and time per iteration, especially as P increases.\n\n\nAlthough not shown to be competitive up to 1,024 processing elements with the current state of the art, the parallelized ITMM exhibits promising scaling trends. Ultimately, compared to the KBA method, the parallelized ITMM may be found to be a very attractive option for transport calculations spatially decomposed over several tens of thousands of processes. Acceleration/preconditioning of the parallelized ITMM once developed will improve the convergence rate and improve its competitiveness. Moreover, while a combination of spatial and energy decomposition can currently exploit even the largest system\u2019s full resources, this new method may offer the desired scalability for future architectures that could greatly increase the number of processing elements, demonstrating a yet to be seen utility.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5197], "author_name_tesi": "Zerr, Robert Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Zerr", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Yousry Y Azmy", "Yousry Y Azmy", "Seungjin Kim", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Lyle Norman Long", "Randal S Baker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Yousry Y Azmy, Dissertation Advisor", "Yousry Y Azmy, Committee Chair", "Seungjin Kim, Committee Chair", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member", "Randal S Baker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neutron transport", "discrete ordinates", "within-group", "massively parallel", "spatial domain decomposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Promoting Probabilistic Reasoning: The Interplay of Learner, Task, and Text\n", "id": "8621", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2509", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     This dissertation was an investigation of misconceptions in probabilistic reasoning. Existing research cites misconceptions in probability as being common and pervasive (Shaughnessy, 1977). Moreover, research suggests that altering misconceptions in probability is an undertaking of paramount proportions (Konold, 1995). Specifically, the purpose of this study was to investigate mechanisms for enhancing college-age students\u2019 probabilistic reasoning and decreasing their inappropriate use of the representativeness heuristic when reasoning about the outcomes of uncertain events. Representativeness is defined as a heuristic often used in situations concerning an object belonging to a class, an event originating from a process, or the probability that a process will bring life to an event (Hirsch & O\u2019Donnell, 2001). \n\t\tThe sample for this dissertation study included graduate and undergraduate students from two introductory educational psychology courses. The two methods employed as interventions for decreasing the inappropriate use of the representativeness heuristic were anchored scenarios and a text. While the anchored scenarios served as a potential intervention for this purpose, the text employed in this study appeared to have a more potent effect on the participants\u2019 inappropriate use of the representativeness heuristic over time. For instance, the participants in the Text condition demonstrated larger gains in scores on the representativeness instrument from the preintervention to the immediate postintervention and while all three conditions experienced decreases in scores from the immediate to the delayed postintervention times the participants in the Text condition experienced the slightest decrease. Results of the data analyses suggest that a two-sided refutational text is a viable method for decreasing the inappropriate use of the representativeness heuristic in college-age students.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2491], "author_name_tesi": "Zeruth, Jill Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Zeruth", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Jill", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pricilla Karen Murphy", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich", "Rayne Audrey Sperling", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pricilla Karen Murphy, Committee Chair", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich, Committee Member", "Rayne Audrey Sperling, Committee Member", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["conceptual change", "probabilistic reasoning", "probability", "misconceptions"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A Micro-Simulation Study of the Individual Welfare Effects of the Affordable Care Act for Previously Uninsured Adults", "id": "2f75r8013", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12792", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Objective: To evaluate the net effect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for the individual welfare of adults who were uninsured before implementation of the law. The ACA improved individuals\u2019 wellbeing by expanding public coverage and subsidizing and reforming the private individual market. The ACA also penalizes those who remain uninsured and establishes a standard private policy that charges premiums and cost sharing expenses. This paper evaluates the welfare implications of the confluence of ACA coverage provisions for previously uninsured individuals and policy-relevant demographic groups.\nData: Health and demographic data are from the 2007-2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), supplemented by wealth and state-of-residence data imputed from the 2007-2011 Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The primary analytic sample includes nonelderly, full-year uninsured adults in the MEPS. Average private insurance premiums by state and median deductible for the second-lowest-cost silver-tier exchange plan are each published by the Kaiser Family Foundation and adjusted for ACA subsidies. \nStudy Design: The change in individual welfare one year after implementation of the ACA is evaluated as a function of health and non-medical consumption. Post-ACA insurance status is simulated from Medicaid eligibility (adjusted for self-rated health status) and survey-based take-up rates by income for private exchange insurance. \nThe short-term change in health-related welfare is the difference in the expected value of medical care consumed by each individual with and without the ACA, with everyone remaining uninsured in the latter scenario. Parameter values for a three-parameter generalized gamma distribution, estimated from a sample of individuals with all three types of insurance, are used to project percentile intervals of the random distribution of ex ante medical consumption for each person. \nThe monetized welfare change related to non-medical consumption resulting from the ACA is the difference in the certainty equivalents of expected utility in each policy environment, assuming CARA risk preferences. \nPrinciple Findings: The ACA generates a small net improvement in the individual welfare of previously uninsured adults (+$29) on average. Individuals with incomes below 250% FPL realize an average welfare gain (+$337), two-thirds of whom realize a welfare improvement; on the other hand individuals with incomes above 250% FPL realize an average welfare loss (-$603). A majority of previously uninsured adults remain uninsured after the ACA (64%); their welfare loss corresponds to the penalty for being uninsured (-$244). Medicaid beneficiaries realize a substantial average welfare improvement (+$1,637). The newly privately insured realize a loss on average (-$223) with just over one in five (22%) realizing any improvement. The chronically ill realize substantial average gains (+$1,178); the majority without a chronic illness (72%) realize an average loss (-$425). \nExchange enrollees with chronic illnesses have a much higher average probability of receiving paid claims that exceed their premium payments, compared to enrollees without a chronic illness (40% vs. 7%). Paid claims for the average enrollee are concentrated in catastrophic medical scenarios, where they are likely to have some relief in the form of charity care or bankruptcy if they remain uninsured. \nConclusions: The ACA improves the individual welfare of some sub-groups of previously uninsured adults, including low-income and chronically ill individuals on average. Medicaid generates unequivocal welfare gains for its beneficiaries. Most of the previously uninsured remain without health insurance, despite the ACA, and many are required by the law to pay a fine. Private insurance enrollees who receive more income-based subsidies realize welfare gains on average. For most adults who were uninsured before the ACA, the benefits of a standard private plan from an ACA exchange are outweighed by its subsidized cost.

The overall technical objective is to develop an intelligent multi-parameter optical fiber sensor system for real-time temperature, pressure, vibration or chemical concentration monitoring in high temperature (above 1000 \u00a1\u00e3 C) harsh environments. \n\nFemtosecond laser pulses have opened up a new phase in the exploration and applications of optical breakdown, revealing new physical processes and scenarios behind the laser damage of materials on the femtosecond timescale. The fiber gratings inscribed by femtosecond laser illumination have annealing characteristics similar to type II fiber gratings and demonstrate stable operation at much higher temperature than conventional UV laser induced gratings on photosensitive fibers.\n\nIn this dissertation, six types of fiber Bragg grating sensors were fabricated via femtosecond laser inscription and their applications were investigated \u00a8C single mode silica fiber Bragg grating sensor (SMFBG), multi-mode silica fiber Bragg grating sensor (MMFBG), ultra thin multi-mode silica fiber Bragg grating sensor (ThMMFBG), polarization maintaining single mode silica fiber Bragg grating sensor (PMFBG), ultra thin polarization maintaining silica fiber Bragg grating sensor (ThPMFBG) and multi-mode sapphire single-crystal fiber Bragg grating sensor (SaFBG).\n\nThe SMFBG sensor shows good distributed sensing capability and excellent long term thermal stability in high temperature environment (up to 1000 \u00a1\u00e3 C). The novel multi-parameter (temperature, strain, vector bending) sensor based on asymmetric Bragg gratings fabricated in MM silica fiber and PM fiber have more than one resonant dip in the transmission spectrum. Bending and ambient temperature fluctuations affect the shapes of multiple transmission dips in different ways. In bending, different dips have different sensitivities. Temperature fluctuations tended to influence the dips uniformly across different dips. By analyzing the changing spectra of the dips, one can distinguish the changes induced by bending or temperature fluctuations. \n \nTHMM and THPM grating sensors are also investigated for liquid pressure sensing applications. After etching away most of the cladding, both MM and PM fiber grating spectra become sensitive to ambient refractive index changes, and their sensitivity to bending and strain is also enhanced. This enables the application for multi-parameter chemical/bio and pressure sensing. Furthermore, an ultrahigh temperature harsh environment sensor with operation temperature higher than 1500 \u00a1\u00e3 C is developed by fabricating higher-order mode rejected fiber Bragg gratings in sapphire crystal fiber. This unique in-fiber grating in single crystal sapphire fiber is very promising in extreme high temperature environmental sensing applications.\n\nThe fabrication method and grating writing mechanism is described in Chapter 2, then in Chapters 3 and 4, a detailed discussion about their applications in harsh environments multi-parameter sensing such as temperature, bending, pressure, bio and chemical sensing etc. is conducted. Finally, extremely high temperature sensing using higher-order-mode rejected sapphire single-crystal fiber is demonstrated in Chapter 5. The grating was tested in a high temperature furnace up to 1600 \u00a1\u00e3 C. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1188], "author_name_tesi": "Zhan, Chun ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shizhuo Yin", "Iam Choon Khoo", "Qiming Zhang", "Karl Martin Reichard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shizhuo Yin, Committee Chair", "Iam Choon Khoo, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member", "Karl Martin Reichard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fiber Bragg grating", "sensor", "harsh environment", "femtosecond laser"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF SOFT MATERIALS FOR FLEXIBLE ELECTRONICS AND LITHIUM ION BATTERY", "id": "14285puz103", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14285", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Organic semiconductors and solid polymer electrolytes are promising soft materials for the realization of future electronics and better batteries. Both series of materials demonstrate considerable advantages over the current materials used in application. For example, organic semiconductors such as poly(3-alkylthiophene)s (P3ATs) and 2,7-dioctyl-benzothenobenzothiophene (dC8-BTBT) demonstrate significantly higher mechanical flexibility over inorganic semiconducting materials. These organic materials dissolve in various organic solvents and can be printed on plastic substrates, thus decreasing the processing cost. Replacing silicon with organic semiconductors not only increases the flexibility and lowers the cost, but also makes the device smaller and lighter. In Lithium ion battery, polyethylene oxide (PEO) based solid polymer electrolytes are an attractive alternative to the flammable and toxic liquid/gel electrolytes currently used in rechargable lithium ion batteries. The higher mechanical modulus of solid PEO can slow the growth of dendrites (Li metal that grows through the electrolyte and causes battery failure) and prolong battery life. Because the membrane is mechanically stable, a hard casing is not required and thus the battery is lighter and flexible.\nIn polymer semiconductors, side-chains are added to increase the solubility of the conjugated polymer in common solvents. However, our study of amorphous materials suggested adding side-chains can harm the charge transport. It is well established that structure is a critical factor for charge transport. In amorphous materials, side-chains length has minimal effect on structure. We suspect the polymer dynamic is influenced by side-chain length. Although the role of molecular motion on charge mobilities is still not well understood. We experimentally measured the dynamic in amorphous conjugated polymers poly(3-alkylthiophene)s (P3ATs) with quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS). The analysis of the QENS data shows that longer side-chains relax faster compared with shorter side-chains and our further analysis of the elastic incoherent structure factor (EISF) suggests that the amplitude of proton motion on the thiophene rings increases by a factor of 3 as the side-chain length increases from 6 to 12, demonstrating that longer side chains lead to enhanced motion of conjugated rings.\nTo fully understand the effect of side-chain on dynamic of charge transport unit, we expand our investigation to highly ordered crystalline material. The lattice vibration of benzothinobenzothiophene (BTBT), 2-octyl-benzothionbenzothiophene (mC8-BTBT), and 2,7-dioctyl-benzothionbenzothiophene (dC8-BTBT) is measured with inelastic neutron scattering (INS). The charge mobility of BTBT and its alkylated derivatives has shown an increase upon the addition of alkyl side-chains and INS experiment shows a suppressed vibration in the sample with two alkyl side chains. We hypothesize the lattice vibration can influence the charge transport via electron-phonon interaction and lattice dynamics should be another factor to be taken into consideration in future material design.\nIn solid polymer electrolyte, crystalline PEO6LiX complex has shown to be more conductive than amorphous counterparts. Since its discovery in 1999, it has attracted tremendous amount of attention in the field of solid polymer electrolyte. However, as of now, none of commercialized electrolyte is based on this complex structure. This is because the original study used low molecular weight PEO that is liquid at room temperature. Increasing the molecular weight of PEO introduces higher degree of disorder to the complex which sacrifices the PEO6LiX crystallinity and decreases the conductivity. In this study, the PEO molecular weight we use is 600K Da. We use acidic cellulose nanowhisker to assist the nucleation of PEO6LiX crystalline complex at room temperature.  These polymer-cellulose composite electrolytes have demonstrated room temperature conductivity higher than 10-5 S/cm and low Li+ transport activation energy. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows high cellulose surface acidity increases the PEO6LiX crystallinity and promotes the conduction around the room temperature. The energy barrier for Li+ hopping through PEO6 channel decreases significantly as the cellulose nanowhisker surface acidity increases. With quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) we demonstrate ion transport is decoupled with polymer relaxation time, suggesting PEO6 is likely the conduction media. To fully take advantage of the conduction mechanism of PEO6, the channel should be aligned. In this work, we investigate different options for alignment and proposed a device design for this purpose.\nAnother important salt concentration in PEO-salt mixture is the eutectic concentration. From many polymer electrolyte studies, the conductivity maximized at eutectic concentration. To understand the influence of eutectic concentration on conduction, we select a series of PEOxLiX electrolytes with eutectic concentrations (ester oxygen to Li+ ratio) that vary from 7 to 100. We demonstrate that conductivity directly correlates to the distance from the eutectic concentration. We demonstrate the maximum gain when these electrolytes are filled with \u03b1-Al2O3 nanoparticles is at the eutectic concentration.

In general, these data sets do not conform to the classical framework of statistical inference, because the number of predictors observed is large compared with the sample size. Research in these areas has gained tremendous momentum due to the rise of big data. In this dissertation, we mainly focused on some nonparametric methods for the high-throughput data using a kernel machine framework. Kernel machine methods have become rather popular many areas, such as in biostatistics, bioinformatics, and machine learning. These methods formulate learning and estimation problems in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of functions on the data domain, expanded in terms of the kernel machine function. The application of the kernel machine methods is flexible and makes few assumptions and allows for complicated relationship, which makes it desirable in practice. In this dissertation, we developed an adaptive genetic association test for detecting the effect of a gene pathway in presence of noisy gene, where the adaptive test is a two-step procedure using double kernel machines. Next, we developed and stabilized a prediction model using combinations of kernel machines to incorporate auxiliary information. And we also explored a kernel machine-based score test in a metabolite differential expression analysis, in which new kernel machines were designed to take the special pattern in metabolomics data into account.

Moreover, seeking extra financial benefit, the nuclear energy suppliers up-rate their plants, which takes away a lot of original design margin and pushes the fuel and core design very close to the design limits. In such environment, it is more and more important to reduce the uncertainty of the calculations and improve the accuracy of the design codes in both global solution and detailed local distribution such as fuel rod (pin) power predictions so that the reactor capabilities and operation behavior can be precisely predicted and simulated.\nAt the same time, in the new generation PWR core designs such as AP1000\u2122, the role of the control rods has been completely changed since the control rods are heavily involved in the core operation. The use of control rods for normal operation has brought significant challenges to the current PWR methodologies. One of the most affected methodologies is the conventional pin power calculation. The insertion of the control rods dramatically changes the heterogeneity of the fuel assemblies, which in turn leads to completely different pin power distribution. The accumulation effect of this re-distribution is a history modeling problem of the conventional pin power recovery methodology since the actual strategy of control rod insertion and withdrawal is not available in advance. Therefore it is difficult to generate pin-wise data at the core design phase to simulate the actual operation condition.\nThe main objective of this PhD research is to develop a novel Pseudo Pin-by-Pin Calculation (P3C) methodology for pin power recovery, which can be directly applied in the Westinghouse core design code ANC. The P3C methodology should be robust enough to simulate all control rod insertion scenarios for all different fuel types and provide accurate pin power predictions. In addition, compared to direct pin-by-pin embedded calculation, this method is more efficient so that the methodology is fast enough to be used in the current code system for routine design calculation and core monitoring.

Urban freight transportation supports the economic and social development of an urban area. However, there are negative externalities associated with urban freight transportation such as emission, noise and congestion. We consider that there exists a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) that is responsible for reducing the congestion caused by freight transportation on the urban road network. In this study, based on different assumptions on the MPO\u2019s capability to influence freight truck traffic, we develop two dynamic game-theoretic models to support the MPO\u2019s goal of reducing congestion caused by freight transportation. Heuristic algorithms are developed to solve the proposed models. We conduct numerical analyses to derive optimal urban freight transportation plans. Our analyses show that the congestion caused by urban freight transportation can be effectively reduced by properly controlling the freight truck traffic. This can provide insights to the MPO into urban freight traffic regulation.\n(2) Truckload service procurement under uncertainty. Truckload (TL) transportation is a necessary component of a shipper\u2019s logistics system and the associated procurement expenditure accounts for a significant portion of the shipper\u2019s overall cost. In this study, we argue that a shipper\u2019s TL service procurement cost can be reduced by appropriately handling the uncertainty during the procurement process. In particular, based on different assumptions on the availability of distributional information of the uncertain shipping demand, we propose two robust models to reduce the shipper\u2019s cost. We develop new solution approaches and conduct numerical tests on real-world sized instances of TL service procurement to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed robust models. Our analyses show that the solutions to robust models yield a lower procurement cost than the solution to a deterministic model.

The relative preference for reactive personalization is likely due to the greater human agency it affords than proactive personalization.

One potential solution to this problem may be the affordance of customization, which is known to ensure a positive user experience by providing a strong sense of control. Can customization of privacy settings alleviate privacy concerns arising from personalization?\nThis study delineates differences in privacy concerns raised by different personalization mechanisms (reactive vs. proactive) in a recommender system, and investigates the role played by customization of privacy settings\u2014either through user action or as an interface cue\u2014in influencing users\u2019 privacy-related perceptions, their disclosure behaviors, and their evaluations of personalized recommendations. To test this, we conducted a 2 (Personalization: Reactive vs. Proactive) X 3 (Customization: Action vs. Cue. vs. Absence) factorial online experiment (N = 299) with a movie recommender system. Findings provide more evidence for the personalization-privacy tradeoff phenomenon, and show that interface cues suggesting customization are quite effective in enhancing user experience, even in the presence of proactive personalization. In addition, users\u2019 previous memory of privacy intrusion and disposition to value privacy were found to play a significant role in their experience interacting with different personalization mechanisms and customization modes.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11947], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Bo ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["S.

Inexpensive and readily available, glass materials possess exceptional properties that include excellent electrical insulation, broad optical transparency, and biocompatibility. Glass substrates are highly in demand in Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) but their use is not as widespread due to the limited availability of microfabrication processes. The focus of this dissertation is to develop glass microfabrication processes and their applications for MEMS sensors development.\nPlasma etching processes on three compositions of glass substrates are explored using a modified inductively couple plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) system for high etch-rate, high aspect ratio, smooth etching performance, and understanding the fundamental plasma glass etching mechanism. Using SF6 as the plasma source gas and NF3 and H2O gases introduced downstream near the surface of the wafer through a diffuser gas inlet, etch rates as high as 1.06 \u03bcm/min, 1.04 \u03bcm/min, and 0.45 \u03bcm/min with surface smoothness of ~2 \u00c5, ~67 \u00c5, ~4 \u00c5 are achieved for fused silica, borosilicate glass, and aluminosilicate glasses respectively after 5 minutes etches. High aspect ratio etch of 5.2:1, 10:1 and 2:1 are obtained for fused silica, borosilicate glass, and aluminosilicate glass respectively. Glass etching mechanism is further understood by analyzing the etch rates and corresponding partial pressure of plasma species detected by in-situ residual gas analyzer (RGA) with various position of the diffuser gas inlet. Statistical analysis indicates etch rate is critically influenced by ion flux. Fluorine based radicals and molecular fragments influence both the etch rate and surface smoothness of fused silica whereas they primarily influence the surface smoothness for borosilicate glass. The large fraction of impurity atoms of Ca and Al in aluminosilicate glass form non-volatile fluorides on the etch surface and therefore the etch rate and surface smoothness of aluminosilicate glass is primarily influenced ion flux and very little by the fluorine chemistry. We also examine the role of the layout of the metal mask layer on how it influences the charging of glass substrates during etching and therefore the etch rate.\nIn the second half of the thesis, chip scale glass blowing technique is explored for novel sensing and packaging applications. Arrays of on-chip spherical glass shells of hundreds of micrometers in diameter with ultra-smooth surfaces and sub-micrometer wall thicknesses have been fabricated and have been shown to sustain optical resonance modes with high Q-factors of greater than 50 million. The resonators exhibit temperature sensitivity of -1.8 GHz K-1 and can be configured as ultra-high sensitivity thermal sensors for a broad range of applications. By virtue of the geometry's strong light-matter interaction, the inner surface provides an excellent on-chip sensing platform that truly opens up the possibility for reproducible, chip scale, ultra-high sensitivity microfluidic sensor arrays. As a proof of concept we demonstrate the sensitivity of the resonance frequency as water is filled inside the microspherical shell and is allowed to evaporate. By COMSOL modeling, the dependence of this interaction on glass shell thickness is elucidated and the experimental results of the sensitivity of two different shell thicknesses is explained.\nIn the last chapter, chip-scale blown, glass microbubbles are explored for encapsulation of ferrofluid atop a micromachined quartz resonator configured as a magnetometer. The concept of a ferrofluid based magnetometer has been previously reported where the viscoelastic response of a thin interfacial ferrofluid layer loaded atop a high frequency shear wave quartz resonator to applied magnetic field is monitored. The magnetic field can be sensitively quantified by the changes in the at-resonance admittance characteristics of the resonator. However, under open conditions, continuous evaporation of the ferrofluid compromises the long term performance of the magnetometer. In this work, we integrate glass hemispherical microbubbles, used as vessels of ferrofluid, on the resonator chip to seal and prevent the evaporation of the ferrofluid liquid and drying out. Using these improvements, a minimum detectable field of 600 nT at 0.5 Hz is achieved. Moreover, comparing with the unsealed ferrofluid device, the lifetime of the glass microbubble integrated chip packaged device improved significantly from only few hours to over fifty days and continuing.

In order to output high quality imaging and spectroscopy results, which is critical for diagnosis accuracy, optical devices have been extensively explored. In this dissertation, I present several novel optical devices for biomedical imaging and spectroscopy. They are all capable of promoting the performance of existing imaging and spectroscopy applications or enabling new applications.\nIn Chapter two, I present a laser based light source which is ultrafast, multi-line, dual polarization, broadly tunable, and power scalable. This light source could be an ideal source for nonlinear optical imaging. We combine soliton self-frequency shift and pulse division method together to achieve these features. Specifically, power scalable is achieved through pulse division and recombination, which provides a general solution for conventional soliton self-frequency shift source whose pulse energy is limited. Also, benefited from the pulse division, divided pulses can be shifted individually, which enables multi-wavelength and dual polarization capability. Simultaneous dual-polarization second-harmonic generation imaging is demonstrated based on these features. \nIn Chapter three, I present a biodegradable step-index optical fiber, which is suitable for light delivery under in vivo condition. The fiber has desirable mechanical and biological properties which are superior to traditional silica optical fiber. This is attributed to the programmable citrate-based material platform we use to fabricate the fiber. The fiber has a 0.4dB/cm loss, with a 1/e length longer than 10cm. By using this fiber, successful light delivery in tissue as well as fluorescence excitation and collection are accomplished, which prove the fiber\u2019s usefulness for in vivo applications. Further, successful image delivery verifies the fiber\u2019s ability for image transmission, which can potentially enable endoscopy applications. \nIn Chapter four, I demonstrate two smartphone based detection devices, suitable for spectroscopy applications. Both of them benefit from the smartphone, which is ideal for point-of-care applications. Specifically, we developed a G-Fresnel smartphone based spectrometer. Successful protein concentration measurement using Bradford reagents demonstrates its ability for general spectroscopy applications. In additional to the smartphone spectrometer, we also developed a smartphone chloridometer based on a citrate chloride sensor. Through clinical verification, the device shows high accuracy and broad measurement range, which can potential serve as a device for cystic fibrosis diagnosis. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15727], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Chenji ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "first_name_ssi": "Chenji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhiwen Liu", "Zhiwen Liu", "Iam-Choon Khoo", "Chris Giebink", "Siyang Zheng"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhiwen Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Chair", "Iam-Choon Khoo, Committee Member", "Chris Giebink, Committee Member", "Siyang Zheng, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Optics", "Optical spectroscopy", "Biomedical", "Ultrafast Optics", "Nonlinear Optics", "Optical fiber", "Optical imaging", "Bio-sensing"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "CONTROL PROBLEMS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT", "id": "23652", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10693", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation presents applications of mathematical control theory to better under- stand and prevent infectious disease transmission in epidemiology.

They are insulating inside the bulk, but conducting at the surface or edges. This peculiar behavior is characterized by an insulating bulk energy gap and gapless surface or edge states, which originate from strong spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry. The spin and momentum locked surface states not only provide a model system to study fundamental physics, but can also lead to applications in spintronics and dissipationless electronics. While topological insulators are interesting by themselves, more exotic behaviors are predicted when an energy gap is induced at the surface. This dissertation explores two types of surface state gap in topological insulators, a superconducting gap induced by proximity effect and a magnetic gap induced by chemical doping.\n\nThe first three chapters provide introductory theory and experimental details of my research. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the theoretical background of topological insulators. Chapter 2 is dedicated to material synthesis principles and techniques. I will focus on two major synthesis methods: molecular beam epitaxy for the growth of Bi2Se3 thin films and chemical vapor deposition for the growth of Bi2Se3 nanoribbons and nanowires. Material characterization is discussed in Chapter 3. I will describe structural, morphological, magnetic, electrical, and electronic characterization techniques used to study topological insulators.\n\nChapter 4 discusses the experiments on proximity-induced superconductivity in topological insulator (Bi2Se3) nanoribbons. This work is motivated by the search for the elusive Majorana fermions, which act as their own antiparticles. They were proposed by Ettore Majorara in 1937, but have remained undiscovered. Recently, Majorana's concept has been revived in condensed matter physics: a condensed matter analog of Majorana fermions is predicted to exist when topological insulators are interfaced with superconductors. The observation of Majorana fermions would not only be fundamentally important, but would also lead to applications in fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. By interfacing topological insulator nanoribbons with superconducting electrodes, we observe distinct signatures of proximity-induced superconductivity, which is found to be present in devices with channel lengths that are much longer than the normal transport characteristic lengths. This might suggest preferential coupling of the proximity effect to a ballistic surface channel of the topological insulator. In addition, when the electrodes are in the superconducting state, we observe periodic magnetoresistance oscillations which suggest the formation of vortices in the proximity-induced region of the nanoribbons. Our results demonstrate that proximity-induced superconductivity and vortices can be realized in our nanoribbon geometry, which accomplishes a first important step towards the search for Majorana fermions in condensed matter.\n\nIn Chapter 5, I will discuss experiments on a magnetically-doped topological insulator (Mn-doped Bi2Se3) to induce a surface state gap. The metallic Dirac cone surface states of a topological insulator are expected to be protected against small perturbations by time-reversal symmetry. However, these surface states can be dramatically modified and a finite energy gap can be opened at the Dirac point by breaking the time-reversal symmetry via magnetic doping. The interplay between magnetism and topological surface states is predicted to yield novel phenomena of fundamental interest such as a topological magneto-electric effect, a quantized anomalous Hall effect, and the induction of magnetic monopoles. Our systematic measurements reveal a close correlation between the onset of ferromagnetism and quantum corrections to diffusive transport, which crosses over from the symplectic (weak anti-localization) to the unitary (weak localization) class. A comprehensive interpretation of data obtained from electrical transport, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, and scanning tunneling microscopy indicates that the ferromagnetism responsible for modifications in the surface states occurs in nanoscale regions on the surface where magnetic atoms segregate during sample growth. This suggests that some aspects of the observed magnetoconductance may indeed originate from surface transport despite the non-ideal nature of the samples. These observations are consistent with the prediction of a time-reversal symmetry breaking gap, which is further supported by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7465], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Duming ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Duming", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth", "Moses Hung Wai Chan", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth, Dissertation Advisor", "Moses Hung Wai Chan, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["topological insulator", "superconductivity", "ferromagnetism", "proximity effect", "Majorana fermions", "Bismuth Selenide (Bi2Se3)", "nanoribbon", "MBE thin film"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Electronic Circuit for Ultrasound Modulation", "id": "15281exz15", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15281", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recently, lots of experiments of Non-invasive brain stimulation has been carried out in small animals.

Advances in STF technology will eventually lead to the development of a new family of CP photonic devices that are efficient, compact, and fully integrable into optical/optoelectronic chips for a wide range of applications of CP light.\n\nIn addition, chiral STFs and columnar thin films (CTFs) are imperative to the development of proposed CP photonic devices.

Rather than adding a current collector to a cathode material such as carbon cloth, we constructed the cathode around the metal mesh itself, thereby avoiding the need for the carbon cloth or other supporting material. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) was used as diffusion layer material, preventing water leakage, limiting oxygen transfer through the cathode and improving coulombic efficiency. Multiple PDMS/carbon layers were applied in order to optimize the performance of the cathode. Two PDMS/carbon layers achieved the highest maximum power density of 1610 \u00b1 56 mW/m2 (normalized to cathode projected surface area; 47.0 \u00b1 1.6 W/m3 based on liquid volume). The coulombic efficiency of the mesh cathodes reached more than 80%, and was much higher than the maximum of 57% obtained with carbon cloth. These findings demonstrate that cathodes can be constructed around metal mesh materials such as stainless steel, and that an inexpensive coating of PDMS can prevent water leakage and lead to improved coulombic efficiencies. \n\nTo further reduce the cost of MFC, an inexpensive activated carbon (AC) air cathode was tested as an alternative to a platinum-catalyzed electrode for oxygen reduction in a MFC. AC was cold-pressed with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder to form the cathode around a Ni mesh current collector. Tests with the AC cathode produced a maximum power density of 1220 mW/m2 (normalized to cathode projected surface area; 36 W/m3 based on liquid volume) compared to 1060 mW/m2 obtained by Pt catalyzed carbon cloth cathode. The coulombic efficiency ranged from 15% to 55%. These findings show that AC is a cost-effective material for achieving useful rates of oxygen reduction in air cathode MFCs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1966], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Fang ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fang", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["microbial fuel cell", "current collector", "cathode", "poly(dimethylsiloxane)", "activated carbon"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Development of novel cathode materials and optimization of electrode performance towards scaling-up applications of microbial fuel cells", "id": "15220", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7711", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) represent an emerging approach for bio-electricity production. Mesh current collectors made of stainless steel (SS) can be integrated into MFC cathode structure with a Pt catalyst and a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) diffusion layer (DL). It is shown here that the mesh properties of these cathodes can significantly affect performance. Cathodes made from the coarsest mesh (30-mesh) achieved the highest maximum power of 1616\u00b125 mW m\u20132 (normalized to cathode projected surface area; 47.1\u00b10.7 W m\u20133 based on liquid volume), while the finest mesh (120-mesh) had the lowest power density (599\u00b157 mW m\u20132). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that charge transfer and diffusion resistances decreased with increasing mesh opening size. Oxygen permeability increased with mesh opening size, accounting for the decreased diffusion resistance. At higher current densities, diffusion became a limiting factor, especially for fine mesh with low oxygen transfer coefficients. These results demonstrate the critical nature of the mesh size used for constructing MFC cathodes.\n\nPDMS was further investigated as an alternative to Nafion as an air cathode catalyst binder. Cathodes were constructed around either SS mesh or copper mesh using PDMS as both catalyst binder and diffusion layer, and compared to cathodes of the same structure having a Nafion binder. With PDMS binder, copper mesh cathodes produced a maximum power of 1710\u00b11 mW m\u22122, while SS mesh had a slightly lower power of 1680\u00b112 mW m\u22122, with both values comparable to those obtained with the Nafion binder. Cathodes with PDMS binder had stable power production of 1510\u00b122 mW m\u22122 (copper) and 1480\u00b156 mW m\u22122 (SS) over 15 days at cycle 15, compared to 40% decrease in power with the Nafion binder. Cathodes with PDMS binder had lower total cathode impedance than Nafion. This is due to a large decrease in diffusion resistance, because hydrophobic PDMS effectively prevented catalyst sites from filling up with water, improving oxygen mass transfer. The cost of PDMS is only 0.23% of that of Nafion. These results showed that PDMS is a very effective and low-cost alternative to Nafion binder that will be useful for large scale construction of these cathodes for MFC applications.\n\nActivated carbon (AC) air-cathodes are inexpensive and useful alternatives to Pt-catalyzed electrodes in MFCs, but information is needed on their long-term stability for oxygen reduction. AC cathodes were constructed with DLs with two different porosities (30% and 70%) to evaluate the effects of increased oxygen transfer on power. The 70% DL cathode initially produced a maximum power density of 1214\u00b1123 mW m\u22122 (cathode projected surface area; 35\u00b14 W m\u20133 based on liquid volume), but it decreased by 40% after one year to 734\u00b118 mW m\u22122. The 30% DL cathode initially produced less power than the 70% DL cathode, but it only decreased by 22% after one year (from 1014\u00b12 mW m\u22122 to 789\u00b168 mW m\u22122). Electrochemical tests were used to examine the reasons for the degraded performance. Diffusion resistance in the cathode was found to be the primary component of the internal resistance, and it increased over time. Replacing the cathode after one year completely restored the original power densities. These results suggest that the degradation in cathode performance was due to clogging of the AC micropores. These findings show that AC is a cost-effective material for oxygen reduction that can still produce ~750 mW m\u22122 after one year.\n\nIn a separator electrode assembly MFC, oxygen crossover from the cathode raises the anode potential and inhibits current generation by exoelectrogenic bacteria, resulting in difficulties in reactor startup. In order to improve startup performance, MFCs with flat carbon mesh anodes were acclimated at set potentials (\u20130.2 V or +0.2 V versus standard hydrogen electrode), compared with no set potential control. Performance of these reactors inoculated with wastewater was also compared to those inoculated with cell suspensions from existing MFCs under the same conditions. Anodes inoculated with wastewater and acclimated to \u20130.2 V produced the highest power (1330\u00b160 mW m\u20132) but they had the longest startup time (20 days). With inoculation using transferred cell suspensions, consistent and reproducible results in terms of faster startup (10 days) and high power production were obtained. Additional electrochemical analyses confirmed that inoculation with a transferred culture consistently improved anode performance, with the best activity obtained for anodes acclimated at \u20130.2 V. These results imply that rapid startup of larger-scale reactors will require inoculation with pre-acclimated cultures, and that acclimation at \u20130.2 V could improve power production compared to a more positive potential (+0.2 V) or a lack of set potential.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7644], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Fang ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "John Michael Regan", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Dissertation Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Chair", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microbial fuel cells", "poly(dimethylsiloxane)", "electrochemical impedance spectroscopy", "current collector", "activated carbon", "set anode potential", "separator electrode assembly", "pre-acclimated culture inoculum"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Toward Obfuscation-resilient Plagiarism Detection", "id": "21856", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10012", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the field of software development, plagiarism is an act of violating intellectual property rights. Plagiarists either illegally copy others' source/binary code (also known as software plagiarism) or steal others' algorithms and covertly implement them (called algorithm plagiarism). Code obfuscation techniques are often applied by plagiarists to evade detection. Plagiarism has become a serious concern for honest software companies and the open source community. Besides, along with the wide use of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets and the rapid growth of mobile application (app) markets, mobile app repackaging, as a new kind of software plagiarism, has emerged. It not only harms the health of app markets but also hurts the security of mobile users. As a result, computer-aided, automated plagiarism detection is desired. There are two common requirements for a good plagiarism detection scheme: (R1) Capability to work on suspicious executables without the source code; (R2) Resiliency to code obfuscation techniques.\n\nIn this dissertation, we propose an obfuscation resilient plagiarism detection architecture, which satisfies the above requirements. It contains three components: LoPD, a program logic-based approach to software plagiarism detection, ValPD, a dynamic value-based approach to algorithm plagiarism detection, and ViewDroid, a user interface-based approach for Android application repackaging detection.\n\nLoPD is a program logic-based software plagiarism detection method. Instead of directly comparing the similarity between two programs, LoPD searches for any dissimilarity between two programs by finding an input that will cause these two programs to behave differently, either with different output states or with semantically different execution paths. As long as we can find one dissimilarity, the programs are semantically different; otherwise, it is likely a plagiarism case. We leverage symbolic execution and weakest precondition reasoning to capture the semantics of execution paths and to find path dissimilarities. LoPD is resilient to current automatic obfuscation techniques. In addition, since LoPD is a formal program semantics-based method, we can provide a formal guarantee of resilience against most known obfuscation attacks. Our evaluation results indicate that LoPD is both effective and efficient in detecting software plagiarism.\n\nIn the ValPD component, we propose two dynamic value-based approaches, namely N-version and annotation, for algorithm plagiarism detection. Our approaches are motivated by the observation that there exist some critical runtime values which are irreplaceable and uneliminatable for all implementations of the same algorithm. The N-version approach extracts such values by filtering out non-core values. The annotation approach leverages auxiliary information to flag important variables which contain core values. We also propose a value dependence graph-based similarity metric to address the potential value reordering attack. A prototype is implemented and evaluated. The results show that our approaches to algorithm plagiarism detection are practical, effective and resilient to many automatic obfuscation techniques. \n\nLastly, we propose ViewDroid, a user interface-based approach to smartphone application repackaging detection. Android applications are user interaction intensive and event dominated; the interactions between users and apps are performed through user interface (i.e., views). This inspired the design of our new birthmark for Android applications, namely, feature view graph, which captures user's navigation behavior across application views. Our experimental results demonstrate that this birthmark can characterize Android applications from a higher abstraction, making it resilient to code obfuscation. It can detect repackaged apps in large-scale scenarios both effectively and efficiently. Manual verification for the reported pairs shows that the false positive rate and false negative rate of ViewDroid are very low.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9721], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Fangfang ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fangfang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu", "Peng Liu", "Guohong Cao", "David Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Peng Liu, Committee Member", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "David Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Plagiarism detection", "Smartphone app repackaging", "Program birthmark", "Obfuscation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Search for new optical, structural and electronic properties: from photons to electrons", "id": "8763", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1999", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the development of modern computers, scientific computation has been an important facet in designing materials with desired properties. This thesis is devoted to predicting novel optical, structural and electronic properties from first-principles computation, by solving the fundamental governing Maxwell equations for photons and Schr{\"o}dinger equation for electrons.\n \nIn Chapter 1, we introduce a method of gradient-based optimization that continuously deforms a periodic dielectric distribution to generate photonic structures that possess any desired figure of merit expressible in terms of the electromagnetic eigenmodes and eigen-freqencies. The gradient is readily available from a perturbation theory that describes the change of eigenmodes and eigen-frequencies to small changes in dielectric pattern. As an example, we generate 2D forbidden regions between specified bands at very low dielectric contrast and very large gaps at a fixed dielectric contrast corresponding to a real material GaAs.\n\nIn Chapter 2, we demonstrate  that well-defined $pi$ bonds can also be formed in two prototypical {it crystalline} Si structures:  Schwarzite Si-168 and dilated diamond. The sp$^2$-bonded Si-168 is thermodynamically preferred over diamond silicon at a modest negative pressure of -2.5 GPa. Ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations of Si-168 at 1000 K reveal significant thermal stability. Si-168 is metallic in density functional theory, but with distinct $pi$-like and $pi^*$-like valence and conduction band complexes just above and below the Fermi energy. A bandgap buried in the valence band but close to the Fermi level can be accessed via hole doping in semiconducting Si$_{144}$B$_{24}$. A less-stable crystalline system with a silicon-silicon triple bond is also examined: a rare-gas intercalated open framework on a dilated diamond lattice. \n\nIn Chapter 3, we propose that microstructured optical fibers could be an attractive candidate for the imposition of negative pressure on materials deposited inside them.  The silicon nanowire inside the fiber has already been under tensile strain due to the differential thermal expansion of Si and SiO$_2$ between deposition and room temperatures. DFT total energy calculations show that only hydrostatic tension can account for the observed 2 cm$^{-1}$ Raman downshift. We also propose a potential application of controlling magnetic properties of palladium based on the phenomenon that the ferromagnetism of hcp Pd can be turned off by practical uni-axial extension. \n\nIn Chapter 4, we predict that germanium goes direct-gap for uniaxial tensile strain along $langle 111\rangle$, under conditions achievable in nanowire geometries. Although a symmetry-breaking singlet/triplet band splitting lowers the conduction band edge at $L$, a direct gap of 0.34 eV at $Gamma$ can still be achieved at 4.2\\% longitudinal strain through an unexpectedly strong supra-linear decrease in the conduction band edge at $Gamma$ for strain along this axis. These strains are well within the mechanical limits of single-crystal Ge nanowires. Stretching along $langle 100\rangle$ does not work equally well since the tetragonal strain anisotropy upshifts the conduction band edge at $Gamma$ relative to $L$.  Stretching along $langle 111\rangle$ could be a generic method of converting Ge$_x$Si$_{1-x}$ into direct-gap materials.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1982], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Feng ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Feng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi", "John V Badding", "Jainendra Jain", "David Weiss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Chair", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Member", "David Weiss, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["photonic crystals", "photonic bandgap", "unsaturated silicon", "direct-gap germanium", "ferromagnetism/paramagnetism transition"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "GROWTH AND TEM INVESTIGATION OF TWO DIMENSIONAL TRANSITION METAL DICHALCOGENIDES AND THEIR HETEROSTRUCTURES", "id": "13923fqz5056", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13923", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, a systematic study on the synthesis, transfer and TEM characterization of 2D TMDs is done to provide an understanding for growth approaches aiming to obtain high quality TMDs film and defect-engineering, which can greatly facilitate the exploration of fundamental phenomena and novel applications in these fascinating 2D systems.

It may arise because of differences in goals, differences in ways of working, or interpersonal dissonance. The specific focus for this research is the conflict in distributed teams. As opposed to traditional teams, participants of distributed teams are geographically dispersed and rely heavily on computer-mediated communication. Understanding and managing conflict is a crucial task in these settings because it is at the crux of many other managerial issues (e.g., trust, leadership, and knowledge transfer). Conflict in distributed teams hides in asynchronous communication among team members. While this causes extra burdens in detecting and understanding conflict, it also makes it possible to rebuild conflict scenarios for the purpose of making sense of, and managing conflict in these teams. \n\nThe objectives of this study are to make progress toward an initial design theory in the form of a novel conflict detection and analysis approach; to implement a faithful instantiation of this evolving theory; and to employ it to gain insight about the conflict phenomenon in the new setting. The work is organized and reported in three essays.\n\nEssay 1 develops a meta design of the approach (CM2) and describes its implementation as a novel conflict management system. The design builts on a new construct \u2013 the Vignette (vivid yet analytical, theory-laden descriptions of past experiences) \u2013 that describes conflict situations. A meta-model developed on basis of prior kernel theories underpins the conflict vignettes (the proposed conflict management approach) and CM2 (the implementation). The essay also describes an initial empirical pilot investigation that serves as the impetus for the study, and demonstrates the anticipated use of CM2 with a detailed use scenario.\n\nEssay 2 is aimed at automating the process of extracting conflict information from computer-mediated communication (CMC) data, such as emails and instant messages.

The evaluation results show that the model achieves higher accuracy and recall in detecting arguments in message sets compared to baseline models. \n\nEssay 3 extends prior design efforts to explore the conflict phenomenon in distributed settings.

Decision-makers have a great need to identify and choose the most cost-effective measures when managing stormwater runoff, and this has become particularly important in today\u2019s economic downturn. The last decade has witnessed a transformation of stormwater management concepts from the traditional centralized approach to the low impact development (LID) approach. The LID approach, while potentially having hydrologic benefits over the traditional approach and quickly gaining popularity among the stormwater community, lags behind in consistent hydrologic assessment methods due to its relatively recent emergence. The lack of methods to quantify the LID scenario hydrologic benefits, in turn, prevents the development of optimization algorithms that can help identify cost-effective LID implementation scenarios at the watershed level.   \n\nIn this study a generic LID scenario optimization framework was developed to provide a consistent approach for identifying cost-effective LID implementation alternatives in post-development watersheds. The developed LID scenario optimization framework consisted of three major components: a U.S. Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) stormwater management model (SWMM) for hydrologic simulations, a representation scheme for simulating LID scenarios in SWMM, and an integration algorithm that links the LID-SWMM representation to the optimizer of &#949;-non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (&#949;-NSGAII). The objective of the optimization framework was to minimize the total cost and the total runoff volume from the post-development watershed, while using the pre-development peak runoff rate as a constraint. The optimization framework was then tested for applicability for the Fox Hollow Watershed (FHW) in central Pennsylvania. \n\nThe U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) was used for simulating hydrologic runoff conditions from the pre-development, post-development, and LID scenarios of the case study watershed. The SWMM model was parameterized for the FHW and then calibrated and verified against two monitoring stations within the watershed. Representation schemes for the integrated management practices (IMPs) of green roof, bio-retention, and porous pavement were developed within SWMM, using existing components of flow divider, storage unit, weir, and orifice. The representation schemes for bio-retention and porous pavement were tested against the long-term monitoring data from the University of New Hampshire Stormwater Center (UNHSC). The results showed that the average peak flow reduction percentages of the SWMM representation schemes were within 10% of the UNHSC observed peak flow reduction percentages for bio-retention and porous pavement. \n\nThe case study watershed of FHW in this study is a small watershed in central Pennsylvania. Averaged verification results of the SWMM model in FHW showed that the calibrated model over-predicted peak flow by 33% at Station #1 and under-predicted peak flow by 19% at Station #2. Post-development scenarios were assumed for the Mitchell Tract and Flower Garden areas within the watershed. The IMPs of green roof, bio-retention, and porous pavement were used to create an assumed LID scenario in the post-development watershed. Runoff conditions from the LID scenario were compared to those from the pre-development watershed. The results indicated that the assumed LID scenario was capable of maintaining the pre-development peak flow rate from the watershed for 1-, 2-, 10-, and 100-year 24-hour design events.\n\nThe LID optimization framework was created by building the SWMM model as a subroutine into the optimizer of &#949;-NSGAII. The optimization framework was capable of searching through various IMP combinations and identifying the tradeoff front between total runoff volume and the total LID scenario cost. The pre-development peak flow rate was built into the optimization framework as a constraint to be in accordance with local stormwater ordinances. When implemented to the case study watershed of FHW, the developed LID optimization framework was ran for 10,000 scenario evaluations for 1-, 2-, 10-, and 100-year 24-hour design events. A total number of 27, 20, 23, and 23 near-optimal LID scenarios were identified for the four design events, respectively. \n\nThe developed LID optimization framework could help stormwater associates to evaluate, compare, and optimize various LID scenarios. The LID representation scheme in the optimization framework accounted for physical processes such as infiltration, percolation, ponding, and underdrains in a LID scenario. The SWMM based representation schemes for bio-retention and porous pavement were compared to the long-term monitored data at the University of New Hampshire Stormwater Center (UNHSC), and both representations had a difference of less than 10% as compared to the observed average peak flow reduction percentages. The distributed SWMM model took into account the spatial-variability of the LID implementations (and thus the timing of the convoluted hydrographs) within a watershed.

Over recent decades, one of the research focuses has been utilizing these functional features in device applications, which requires a deeper understanding of the material science and also advances in thin film deposition in order to tailor these properties. \nThe binary vanadium dioxide has drawn much attention due to its orders of magnitude change in resistivity during the MIT near room temperature, opening up the possibilities to use this material as next generation transistors, memory devices and radio frequency switches in communication applications. However, to bridge the gap between the frontier of fundamental research in VO2 films and their realization in commercial products, wafer scale growth of the oxide thin films with \u2018electronic grade\u2019 is necessary. This task requires precise control over the valence state of normally multivalent transition metal cations, while the device performance will be largely derogated if the valence state is not well controlled. To deposit the VO2 with precise valence state control on wafer scale, a combinatorial approach was used to establish a valence state gradient of vanadium cation, from which the optimal condition for stoichiometric VO2 was extracted. Under the optimal growth condition, a high quality 30-nm thick VO2 film was grown on 3 inch sapphire wafer, showing the highest MIT resistivity ratio for ultrathin films on wafer scale, which is relevant for modern device applications.\nBesides the growth of high quality MIT thin films on wafer scale, a novel strategy to optically write and erase complex circuitry into VO2 thin films was also developed. We\u2019ve successfully demonstrated the optically induced MIT in VO2 which is persistent after the light source is turned off. We use this method to optically imprint local conductive areas into an otherwise insulating VO2 film. In contrast to conventional thin film patterning techniques that require chemical etching of patterns defined through lithography steps, the optical imprint is performed by irradiating single crystalline VO2 thin films with focused ultraviolet light in a nitrogen atmosphere. A conductive pattern is sketched into the resistive VO2 matrix, resulting in a close to 4 orders of magnitude increase in electrical conductivity at room temperature. Significantly, the inscribed pattern, which is permanent, can be completely erased by a few minutes thermal annealing process at moderately elevated temperature.  This development can potentially find its application in reconfigurable optical elements. It can also be harnessed as rewritable bottom electrode material for back-gating structures by inscribing complex contacting schemes using UV radiation.  \nBeyond the binary vanadium oxides, Mott insulators such as LaVO3 have recently been suggested as promising solar cell materials with suitable band gap, high absorption coefficient, as well as the potential to beat the Shockley-Queisser limit owing to their unique strong electron-electron correlation effect that is not present in conventional semiconductors.  However, the quality of strongly correlated oxides has been far inferior compared to conventional semiconductors. The high defect concentration of oxide thin films impedes the realization of Mott solar cells with competitive performance due to the lack of stoichiometry control. By taking advantage of the unique self-regulated growth mechanism available in hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, strongly correlated LaVO3 films were grown which revealed a record-low defect concentration. The optical and electrical properties of these films were studied as a function of stoichiometry and a more than two orders of magnitude improvement in defect-related properties compared to results reported in literature was demonstrated, showing that Mott insulators can indeed be synthesized with high perfection using hybrid molecular beam epitaxy.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16251], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Haitian ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "first_name_ssi": "Haitian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roman Engel-Herbert", "Roman Engel-Herbert", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Long-Qing Chen", "Chris Giebink "], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roman Engel-Herbert, Dissertation Advisor", "Roman Engel-Herbert, Committee Chair", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Long-Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Chris Giebink , Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Molecular beam epitaxy", "Thin film", "Strongly correlated oxides", "Transition metal oxides", "Metal to insulator transition", "VO2", "LaVO3"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "High Frequency Mri Rf Coil Design", "id": "17444", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8113", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "MRI is one of the major imaging techniques in the daily clinical routine.

They are\nreceiving increasing attention, due to the challenges to create \u201call natural\u201d and \u201cclean labels\u201d\nfoods. However, the application of EOs in foods is still limited by their hydrophobicity and strong\naroma. Therefore, researchers are developing methods to enhance the antimicrobial properties of\nEOs, resulting in lower amount of needed EOs. Lecithin is a mixture of different amphiphilic\nphospholipids. It has been used in a wide range of foods as an emulsifier (>100 mg/100 mL) to\nimprove the food physical stability without known bioactive effects. However, two preliminary\nstudies from our group demonstrated that lecithin phospholipids at concentrations below 10\nmg/100 mL increased the antimicrobial property of eugenol against bacteria, without affecting the\nphysical stability of EOs. The present study focused on demonstrating the ability of lecithin and\ndifferent individual lecithin phospholipid at low concentrations (<10 mg/100 mL) to enhance the\nantimicrobial activities of eugenol against three E. coli strains and to elucidate the underlying\nmechanisms.\nIn the first study, the effect of lecithin on the antimicrobial performance of a constant\neugenol concentration was tested against three E. coli strains (C600, 0.1229, and O157:H7 strain\nATCC 700728). For all three cultures, significant synergistic antimicrobial effects were observed\nwhen E. coli cultures were exposed to a constant eugenol concentration (ranging from 0.043 to\n0.050% w/w), together with lecithin at critical synergistic concentrations (CSCs) ranging from\n0.5 to 1 mg/100 mL. Increasing the concentration of lecithin above 1 mg/100 mL (up to 10\nmg/100ml lecithin) diminished the antibacterial effect to values similar to eugenol-only\ntreatments. The formation of aggregates (<100 nm) at the critical lecithin concentration was\nobserved using Cryo-TEM together with an increase of light absorbance at 284 nm. At CSC, the \niv\nformation of nano-scale aggregates was suggested to be responsible for improving eugenol\nantimicrobial activities.\nIn the second study, the effect of individual lecithin phospholipids on the antimicrobial\nproperties of eugenol against E. coli C600 was investigated. Five major phospholipids common in\nsoy or egg lecithin (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, DPPC; 1,2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine,\nDSPC; 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, DPPE;\n1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate sodium salt, DPPA and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-\nphospho-L-serine sodium salt, DPPS) and one synthetic cationic phospholipid (1,2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-ethylphosphocholine\nchloride salt, EPC 18:0) were tested. Among six phospholipids,\nDPPC, DSPC, DPPE, DPPA, and the cationic 18:0 EPC showed CSCs that significantly\nimproved the inactivation effect of eugenol against E. coli after 30 min of exposure. At CSC, an\nadditional ca. 0.4-1.9 log reduction (ca. 0.66-2.17 log CFU/mL reduction) in microbial\npopulation was observed when compared to eugenol-only (control) treatments (ca. 0.25 log\nreduction). In all cases, increasing the phospholipid amount above the CSC resulted in\nantimicrobial properties similar to eugenol-only (control) treatments. DPPS did not affect the\nantimicrobial properties of eugenol at the tested concentrations. The CSC of phospholipids was\ncorrelated to their critical micelle concentrations (CMC).\nIn the third study, the mechanisms of the synergistic antimicrobial effect between\neugenol and DSPC against E. coli were investigated. After exposing E. coli C600 to increasing\nlevels of DSPC-only samples for 30 min, E. coli C600 showed more than 20% additional uptake\nof hydrophobic fluorescence dye (1-N-phenylnaphthylamine, NPN) than that in the control\nsample (without DSPC). However, the subsequent eugenol-only (0.043% v/v) treatment did not\nshow any significantly different inactivation in control and DSPC-only pre-treated samples. The\nsolubility of eugenol in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was higher than 0.086% v/v, which \nv\nindicated that DSPC did not solubilize eugenol (applied at 0.043% v/v) to enhance its\nantimicrobial property. 1\nH-NMR signal of several eugenol protons revealed interaction between\neugenol and DSPC at CSCs, indicating the eugenol-DSPC complex formation. 0.043% v/v\neugenol together with 0.63 \u00b5M DSPC demonstrated similar synergistic antimicrobial effects (ca.\n1 log additional inactivation) against two E. coli strains with distinctly different charge on cell\nmembranes. Therefore, electrostatic attraction between eugenol-DSPC complex and E. coli was\nnot supported to be the reason for the synergistic effect.\nThe present work supports the bioactivity of lecithin phospholipids at low concentrations\n(<10 mg/100 mL) to improve the antimicrobial effects of eugenol, which will contribute to a\nrational design of EO-phospholipid delivery systems.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16670], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Haoshu ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "first_name_ssi": "Haoshu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Federico Miguel Harte", "Federico Miguel Harte", "Edward G Dudley", "John Neil Coupland", "Yong Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Federico Miguel Harte, Dissertation Advisor", "Federico Miguel Harte, Committee Chair", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member", "John Neil Coupland, Committee Member", "Yong Wang, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lecithin", "essential oil", "e. coli", "synergistic"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Study of the Crystal Structure of Y3cd9zn2 Using X-ray Powder Diffraction", "id": "24810", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10986", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The thesis describes the determination of crystal structure of the intermetallic compound Y3Cd9Zn2.

Recent studies have shown the importance of turbulence and turbulence-chemistry interactions on emissions from laboratory flames and compression-ignition engines.\nConstant-volume, high-pressure spray combustion is an important intermediate step for model validation and scientific understanding of combustion in direct-injection compression-ignition engines. The Engine Combustion Network (ECN) provides a series of well-documented experimental data for spray combustion under typical diesel-engine conditions, and this serves as a good resource for simulation and validation purposes. Here simulations for the ECN constant-volume, n-heptane spray configuration have been performed using OpenFOAM, an object-oriented C++ based code. The effects of exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR), ambient temperature and density on combustion were investigated computationally. The simulations demonstrate that the CFD model is capable of predicting sprays, mixing, ignition and combustion, quantitatively, for engine-relevant conditions reasonably well. The numerical results show that the ignition delay and lift-off lengths are strongly influenced by EGR, ambient gas temperature and ambient gas density, in agreement with measurements. Results from a model using a transported probability density function (PDF) method that\nexplicitly accounts for turbulence-chemistry interactions have been compared to those from a model that simplistically accounts for turbulence-chemistry interactions, including mixture fraction profiles, ignition delays, lift-off lengths and flame structures under various ambient conditions. Significant differences between these two models have been observed, whichshows the importance of turbulence-chemistry interactions. The turbulent flame structure predicted by the PDF method is more realistic than that obtained from a simplistic model to account for turbulence-chemistry interactions. The choice of chemical mechanism also plays a strong role.\nNext, the high-fidelity CFD-based models have been used to simulate fuel effects and complex interactions between turbulence and gas-phase chemistry on emissions for biodiesel combustion and hydrogen-assisted diesel combustion in common-rail diesel engines. The sensitivity of predicted NOx emissions to variations in the physical properties of the fuel (density and viscosity) has been explored to determine the origins of the so-called biodiesel-NOx effect: the increase in NOx emissions that has been observed when petroleum-based diesel fuel is replaced with biodiesel fuel. Interactions between turbulence and gas-phase chemistry have been found to be important in the fuel density effect on NOx emissions. CFD also has been used to explore the changes in NOx emissions with hydrogen substitution that have been observed experimentally in hydrogen-enriched diesel combustion over a range of operating conditions. In spite of the significant simplifications and approximations, the model is able to reproduce the experimentally observed trends for some operating conditions. A model using a transported PDF method that explicitly accounts for turbulence-chemistry interactions does somewhat better than a model using well-stirred reactor model which ignores turbulence-chemistry interactions, in low-speed conventional diesel combustion cases. The CFD results are consistent with the hypothesis that in-cylinder HO2 levels increase with increasing H2, which enhances the conversion of NO to NO2.\nIn close collaboration with engine experiments, this research shows that fuel physical properties and complex interactions between turbulence and chemistry have important effects on emissions. It has provided new physical insight into in-cylinder processes, which in turn allows better understanding for advanced engine development.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8007], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Hedan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hedan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Connell Haworth", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Stephen R Turns", "James Gordon Brasseur", "Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Connell Haworth, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Chair", "Stephen R Turns, Committee Member", "James Gordon Brasseur, Committee Member", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["turbulence-chemistry interactions", "probability density function", "diesel engine", "NOx", "n-heptane"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on Firm Productivity in Industrial Organization and International Trade", "id": "18411", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8830", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation focuses on the measurement of productivity at the firm level and the implication of firm-level heterogeneous productivity in industrial organization and international trade. Chapter 1 studies the interaction between firm productivity and importing decision and quantify the static and dynamic gains from importing intermediate inputs. Chapter 2 develops a new way to estimate the production function consistently when some of the input prices are missing. Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 are based on the Hicks-Neutral technology assumption. Chapter 3 studies the biased technology change over time and biased technology dispersion across firms.\n\nChapter 1: Static and Dynamic Gains from Importing Intermediate Inputs: Theory and Evidence\n\n This paper constructs a dynamic structural model to characterize firms' decisions to buy imported inputs or rely exclusively on\ndomestically-supplied inputs and quantifies their effects on firm value and productivity. The model provides a unified framework to analyze the determinants of firms' import decisions and to empirically decompose the\ngains from importing into a static effect and a dynamic effect. Empirical results using Colombian plant-level data show that more productive plants tend to import intermediate inputs and that the total gain from importing is\nlarge. The decomposition shows importing is important mostly because it dynamically generates higher future productivity growth.\n\nChapter 2: Production Function Estimation with Unobserved Input Price Dispersion\n\nWe propose a method to consistently estimate production functions when intermediate inputs are not observed in the presence of input price dispersion. The traditional approach to dealing with unobserved input quantities---using deflated expenditure as a proxy---requires strong assumptions for consistency.\nIn particular, we show that the traditional approach tends to underestimate\nthe elasticity of substitution and bias estimates of the distribution parameters. Our\napproach applies to a general class of production functions with a mild identification restriction. As a demonstration, we apply our approach to the CES production function. A Monte Carlo experiment illustrates that the omitted price bias is significant in the traditional approach, while our method consistently recovers the production function parameters. We apply our method to a firm-level data set from Colombian manufacturing industries. The empirical results are consistent with the predictions that the use of expenditure as a proxy for quantities biases the elasticity of substitution downward. Moreover, using our preferred method, we provide evidence of significant input price dispersion and even wider productivity dispersion than is estimated using traditional methods.\n\nChapter 3: Biased Technology and Contribution of Technological Change to Economic Growth: Firm-Level Evidence\n\nThe increasing mean wage-interest ratio and decreasing mean capital-labor ratio observed in some Chinese manufacturing industries suggest that technological change is factor-biased. In order to study the nature of technological change and its contribution to economic growth, this paper builds and estimates a structural model of firms' production decisions with\nbiased technological change. This model allows me to identify and estimate the firm-time-specific factor-biased technology using micro data. The basic idea of the estimation is that the choice of inputs contains information\nabout the unobserved productivities; therefore we can invert the inputs demand function to recover the unobserved productivities. I estimate the model from a firm-level data set of four Chinese Manufacturing industries. The empirical results provide firm-level evidence of biased technological change over time and biased technological dispersion across firms. The\nestimation results show that technological change contributes to the growth of gross output by 1.81%-3.10% annually and value added by\n12.67%-21.16%, which is higher than the combined contribution of capital and labor. Capital efficiency grows much faster than labor efficiency in China, and the contribution of technological change to economic growth is\nmainly due to the change of capital efficiency. The results also show that large firms have a higher capital-labor efficiency ratio and that biased technological dispersion explains a large part of the dispersion of capital-labor ratio across firms.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8677], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Hongsong ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hongsong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts", "Mark John Roberts", "James R.

We develop a unified framework and theory that can be used to derive and analyze different algebraic multigrid methods in a coherent manner.  Given a smoother $R$ for a matrix $A$, such as Gauss-Seidel or Jacobi, it is well-known that  the optimal coarse space of dimension $n_c$ is the span of the eigen-vectors corresponding to the first $n_c$ eigen-values of $\\bar RA$ (with $\\bar R=R+R^T-R^TAR$).  We prove that this optimal coarse space can be obtained by a constrained trace-minimization problem for a matrix associated with $\\bar RA$ and demonstrate that coarse spaces of most of existing AMG methods can be viewed some approximate solution of this trace-minimization problem.  Furthermore, we develop a general approach to the construction of a quasi-optimal coarse space and we prove that under appropriate assumptions the resulting two-level AMG method for the underlying linear system converges uniformly with respect to the size of the problem, the coefficient variation, and the anisotropy. Our theory applies to most existing multigrid methods, including the standard geometric multigrid method, the classic AMG, energy-minimization AMG, unsmoothed and smoothed aggregation AMG, and spectral AMGe.

One of the counter measures is synthetic polymer antimicrobials. Both chapter 2 and 3 of this dissertation talk about using different synthetic strategies to produce different polymer antimicrobials for specific applications. The general antimicrobial mechanism of these polymers are discussed and the limitation of current research in this area is also mentioned. A detailed investigation on the antimicrobial activity and in vitro toxicity of both materials are carried out. In addition, the structure and property relationship of both materials are discussed which shows the possible directions in the future to improve the antimicrobial activity and/or minimize the toxicity. \nThe second interesting issue this dissertation covers is to utilize the stimuli responsive chemical reaction of synthetic polymers to power microscale devices to various application such as micro analytical devices, particle assembly control and drug delivery system. Previously, our group have demonstrated that we can harness the catalytic reaction of inorganic systems to fabricate self-powered micromotors and micropumps. However, the potential of polymer systems have not been studied yet. From chapter 4 to chapter 8 in this dissertation, different stimuli responsive polymer systems have been discussed and several self-powered micropumps and micromotors are built based on the polymer materials. Chapter 4 explores the possibility to use rapid depolymerization reaction to build the first example of self-powered micropump. Chapter 5 further demonstrates that dissociation of chemical bonds on the polymer side chains can also power these micropump devices. In the following chapter 6 and chapter 7, more practical application of these self-powered micropumps for intelligent drug delivery is proposed and studied. Particularly, using more bio-friendly stimuli such as glucose to trigger, this pumping action helps to create a glucose responsive drug delivery system. This system shows distinct advantages over traditional drug delivery system which operates on simple diffusion mechanism. Chapter 7 emphasizes another important yet barely studied feature of drug delivery system.

The objective of this thesis is to develop a surface contact model as a theoretical platform upon which to carry out the boundary lubrication research with a balanced consideration of all the four key aspects of the contact process. The modeling consists of three successive steps \u2013 (1) elastoplastic finite element analysis of frictional asperity contacts, (2) modeling of contact systems with friction, and (3) modeling of a boundary lubrication process.\n\n\tFinite element analysis of frictional asperity contacts \u2013 A finite element model is developed and systematic numerical analyses carried out to study the effects of friction on the deformation behavior of individual asperity contacts. The study reveals some insights into the modes of asperity deformation and asperity contact variables as functions of friction in the contact. The results provide guidance to analytical modeling of frictional asperity contacts and lay a foundation for subsequent work on system contact modeling.\n\n\tModeling of contact systems with friction \u2013 Analytical equations are developed relating asperity-contact variables to friction using contact-mechanics theories in conjunction with the finite element results. A system-level model is then derived from the statistical integration of the asperity-level equations. The model is a significant advancement of the Greenwood-Williamson types of system models by incorporating contact friction. It also serves as the platform in the final step of model development for the boundary lubrication problem.\n\n\tModeling of a boundary lubrication process \u2013 On the basis of the above mechanical modeling, an asperity-based model is developed for the boundary-lubricated contact by incorporating other key aspects involved in the process. Four variables are used to describe an asperity contact under boundary lubrication conditions, including micro-contact area, friction force, load carrying capacity and flash temperature. In addition, three probability variables are used to define the interfacial state of an asperity junction that may be covered by various types of boundary films. Governing equations for the seven key asperity-level variables are derived based on first-principle considerations of asperity deformation, frictional heating, and formation/removal of boundary lubricating films. These coupled asperity-level equations, some of which are nonlinear, are solved iteratively and the solution is then statistically integrated to formulate the contact model for boundary lubrication systems. \n\n\tThe results obtained from the model suggest that it may provide a framework for future investigation of the boundary lubrication process by integrating research advances in contact mechanics, tribochemistry, and other related fields.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2368], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Huan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Liming Chang", "Marc Carpino", "Seong H Kim", "Richard Benson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Liming Chang, Committee Chair", "Marc Carpino, Committee Member", "Seong H Kim, Committee Member", "Richard Benson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Boundary Lubrication", "Contact Mechanics", "Physicochemistry", "Statistical Surface Model", "Frictional Modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF MG BASED ALLOYS BY CALPHAD APPROACH COUPLED WITH FIRST-PRINCIPLES: APPLICATION TO MG-AL-CA-CE-SI SYSTEM", "id": "11434", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2316", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the last few decades, first-principles quantum mechanics technique based on density functional theory has progressed significantly and demonstrated in many cases, e.g., the accurate predictions of thermodynamic properties. Within the similar time frame, computational thermodynamics based on CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagram) technique is emerging as a key technology, which is used to predict the phase equilibrium, phase stability, and phase transformation. In order to accelerate the understanding and design of magnesium alloys, an integrated first-principles calculations and CALPHAD modeling approach is used to study the elastic and thermodynamic properties of Mg-containning alloys.\n  The present project predicted the thermodynamic properties of Mg-based binary alloys from first-principles calculations. The obtained enthalpies of formation at 0 K were discussed for the Mg-X systems with X being the elements of As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cu, Dy, Ga, Ge, La, Lu, Ni, Pb, Sb, Si, Sn and Y. By considering the phonon and thermal electronic contributions, first-principles are extended to predict the properties at finite temperatures. In the preset thesis, the phonon properties and the temperature dependent elastic and thermodynamic properties are also presented for the technically important \u00e3-Al12Mg17 phase. \n  The thermodynamic description for the Ce-Mg binary system was updated using the CALPHAD approach by incorporating additional experimental data. The resulting thermodynamic description for the Mg-Ca-Ce system was then developed by combining the derived databases of the Ca-Ce and Ce-Mg systems from the present work with that of the Ca-Mg system in the literature.\n  We obtained the equilibrium structural properties of Mg, Si, beta-Mg2Si, beta\u2019-Mg18Si10 and beta\u2019\u2019-Mg5Si6 as well as the enthalpies of formation of beta, beta\u2019 and beta\u2019\u2019 in Al-Mg-Si ternary system. Using frozen-phonon calculations, we also ascertained the vibrational entropies of formation for each phase. The phase boudaries of beta, beta\u2019 and beta\u2019\u2019 were thus predicted for Al-Mg-Si ternary system.\n  To better understand the alloying behavior of Ca on Mg-Al alloys, the thermochemical properties of the Laves phases in the Mg-Al-Ca system are evaluated from both first-principles and CALPHAD modeling. First-principles provided insight into the understanding of phase stabilities of Laves phases, and herein developing self-consistent thermodynamic database of this ternay system by CALPHAD modeling. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2301], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Hui ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Zi Kui Liu And Dr Long Qing Chen", "Zi Kui Liu", "Long Qing Chen", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Digby D Macdonald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Zi Kui Liu And Dr Long Qing Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Chair", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Digby D Macdonald, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mg alloys", "Intermetallics", "First-principles", "Calculation of phase diagram"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES AND DESIGN OF BIOREACTORS USED FOR PERCHLORATE REMEDIATION AND BIOHYDROGEN PRODUCTION", "id": "6493", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2383", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A chemolithoautotrophic bacterium (strain HZ) was isolated from biofilm samples in an unsaturated-flow, packed-bed reactor treating perchlorate-contaminated groundwater.  Dilution-to-extinction method was used for isolation.  Purity was initially examined microscopically, and confirmed by identical intergenic ribosomal RNA spacer sequences from multiple clones.  Strain HZ is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped facultative anaerobe that can use oxygen, perchlorate, chlorate, or nitrate as an electron acceptor and hydrogen gas or acetate as an electron donor.  Growth on hydrogen gas was coupled with complete perchlorate (10 mM) reduction to chloride with a maximum doubling time of 8.9 hours.  Autotrophic growth with carbon dioxide as the sole carbon source was confirmed by demonstrating that biomass carbon (100.9%) was derived from 14CO2. Phylogenetic analysis based upon the 16S rRNA sequence indicated that strain HZ belongs to the genus Dechloromonas within the b subgroup of the Proteobacteria.\nBiofilm samples from a pilot-scale, fixed-bed, perchlorate-reducing reactor were analyzed for microbial species from inoculated and indigenous populations.  The bioreactor was inoculated with Dechlorosoma sp. strain KJ and fed groundwater containing indigenous microorganisms.  The reactor was flushed weekly to remove accumulated biomass.  Perchlorate was reduced to non-detectable levels (< 4 &#61549;g L-1) after 26 days of operation and remained so during proper reactor operation in a six-month long test.  Plastic media in the reactor were collected from top, middle, and bottom locations.  Genomic DNA was extracted from successive washes of thawed biofilm material for PCR-based community fingerprinting by 16S-23S ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA).  No DNA sequences closely related to that of strain KJ were recovered.  The most intense bands yielded DNA sequences with high similarities (> 98%) to Dechloromonas spp.  Other sequences from RISA fingerprints indicated presence of the low G+C Gram-positive bacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) group.  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was also used to examine biofilms using genus-specific 16S ribosomal RNA probes.  Numbers of bacteria hybridizing to the Dechloromonas probe were most abundant at the biofilm surface (23% of all cells), and decreased as biofilm depth increased.  The bacteria hybridizing to Dechlorosoma probes constituted less than 1 % of all cells in the biofilms examined, except in the deepest portions where they represented 3-5%. \nBiological hydrogen production was investigated using a laboratory-scale, trickle-bed biofilm reactor.  The reactor was inoculated with Clostridium acetobutylicum and fed mineral medium with glucose as the sole carbon and energy source.  The flowrate was 1.6 mL/min (0.096 L/h), producing a hydraulic retention time of 2.1 min.  Continuous hydrogen production rates were 14, 20, 25, and 27 mL/h at influent glucose concentrations of 1.0, 3.3, 4.5, and 10.5 g/L, respectively.  Gas-phase hydrogen concentrations of 70-79% were obtained at influent glucose concentrations of 1.0, 3.3, 4.5, and 10.5 g/L.  The major fermentation byproducts were acetate and butyrate.  The measured hydrogen yields indicated an overall conversion efficiency of 15-26% based on a theoretical stoichiometry of 4 moles hydrogen from 1 mole of glucose.  The normalized hydrogen production rate was 676 to 1265 (mL-H2)(g-glucose)-1(L-reactor)-1, which is within the range of values reported using continuously stirred tank reactors.\nAnother H2-producing bioreactor was operated at four hydraulic retention times (HRT) (10, 5, 2.5 and 1 h) and four glucose concentrations (10, 7.5, 5, and 2.5 g/L).  Biomass suspensions were analyzed by Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (RISA) to obtain qualitative information on bacterial populations at each condition.  Results showed that microbial species composition responded more to influent glucose concentration than to HRT.  Populations detected at 2.5 g/L glucose concentration were taxonomically more diverse than at 5, 7.5, and 10 g/L glucose concentrations.  The most intense band in RISA profiles at 10, 7.5, and 5 g/L glucose yielded sequences with high similarity (> 97%) to Clostridium acidisoli. At 2.5 g/L glucose, a Selenomonadaceae spp. was identified as being present in the reactor.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2367], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Husen ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Husen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "John Michael Regan", "William D Burgos", "Andrew Scanlon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Chair", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "Andrew Scanlon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Perchlorate/Hydrogen/Bioreactors"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Development of Automated Neuro-Simulation Protocols for Pressure and Rate Transient Analysis Applications", "id": "14670juz155", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14670", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Traditional rate and pressure transient analysis apply simplified analytical models to calculate the reservoir characteristics. The analytical models are based on ideal assumptions which are hardly satisfied in practice, and the analysis process also relies on well-trained human experts and their valuable experiences. The traditional rate and pressure transient analysis approaches demand extensive resources in terms of personnel and time. \nInstead of relying on analytical models and human experts, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) tools, as an analog of the neural systems in human brains, are developed for rate and pressure transient analysis. The ANN tools developed are proved successful in processing complex problems with much less cost. \nDifferent from analytical models, however, each ANN tool developed is only applicable in analyzing problems of certain types of reservoir and well conditions. If the problem is not within the specification or range of the parameters of the existing ANN tools, a new ANN tool is required to be developed from the scratch. The development process of the ANN tools is called the \u201cNeuro-Simulation\u201d protocol. It applies numerical reservoir simulators to generate randomly distributed data sets and train an ANN to analyze the transient data. This protocol relies on well trained and experienced researchers and commercial numerical reservoir simulator and ANN development software. \nIn this study, an automated Neuro-Simulation protocol is developed to assist and accelerate the development process of ANN tools for rate and pressure transient analysis. The protocol has the capability of automating the major processes in the Neuro-Simulation protocol. The protocol is implemented into a comprehensive toolkit. In this toolkit, a comprehensive and generalized in-house numerical reservoir simulator is implemented. The rectangular and radial-cylindrical grid systems are implemented based on the framework, and the black oil, compositional and naturally fractured system fluid flow models are developed into the simulator. An ANN development tool is developed with multiple built-in activation functions and learning algorithms. The automated Neuro-Simulation protocol based on the communication and cooperation between the in-house numerical reservoir simulator and ANN development tool is established. The toolkit also contains a user-friendly GUI and mini PC to provide convenience. The toolkit is designed to be general, flexible and independent. A tight gas reservoir system with dual-lateral horizontal well is studied to illustrate the capability of the protocol and toolkit. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15608], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Jian ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "first_name_ssi": "Jian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Turgay Ertekin", "Sanjay Srinivasan", "Li Li", "Kultegin Aydin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Chair", "Sanjay Srinivasan, Committee Member", "Li Li, Committee Member", "Kultegin Aydin, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Neuro-Simulation", "Machine Learning", "Neural Network", "Numerical Reservoir Simulation", "Pressure Transient Analysis", "Rate Transient Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Essays on Mutual Funds and Bond Markets", "id": "18137", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8730", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation contains two essays on mutual funds and one essay on Treasury bonds.\nIn the first essay, I investigate the value of active fund management by examining the performance of their aggregate trades, using a novel holdings database of corporate bond mutual funds. I find that the junk bonds bought by fund managers underperformed those they sold by 2.98% over the following year, while the investment-grade bonds they bought outperformed those they sold by 0.54% over the following two quarters. The underperformance in trading junk bonds cannot be explained by the story of asset fire sales driven by investor money outflows or bond rating downgrade, nor by the story of price pressure driven by fund herding or positive-feedback trading. Instead, the results are more consistent with the hypothesis that fund managers possess inferior ability in selecting junk bonds and superior ability in selecting investment-grade bonds.\nIn the second essay, I conduct performance attribution analysis for the U.S. actively managed equity mutual funds from 1980 to 2008.

In order to reduce it, a growing trend is to make the storage system self-managing. This thesis investigates two important topics for self-managing storage system design: (1) workload characterization and generation; (2) online QoS enforcement and self-tuning.\n\nUnderstanding workloads is critical for a self-managing storage system design. This thesis presents a synthetic workload generator for TPC-H, an important decision-support commercial workload, by completely characterizing the arrival and access patterns of its queries.  The synthesized block-level traces for 22 TPC-H queuries are shown to accurately mimic the behavior of a real trace in terms of response time characteristics for each TPC-H query.\n\nSelf-tuning is an important aspect of self-management. For a self-tuning storage system, adaptive resource management plays a critical role. One issue is to provide performance virtualization for multiple applications to share a consolidated storage utility in order to meet their Service Level Objecives (SLOs). This thesis presents a 2-level scheduling framework. This framework uses a low-level feedback-driven request scheduler, called AVATAR, that is intended to meet the \nlatency bounds determined by the SLO. The load imposed on AVATAR is regulated by a high-level rate controller, called SARC, to insulate the users from each other. Using extensive I/O traces\nand a detailed storage simulator, it is demonstrated that this 2-level framework can simultaneously meet latency and throughput requirements imposed by an SLO, without \nrequiring extensive knowledge of the underlying \nstorage system.\n\nBusiness continuance requires non-disruptive \ndata migration, which is another important issue in resource management. In such situation, a migration task utilizes spare bandwidth left by client applications, in order to minimize the impact on them. However, a migration task also has its own requirements. Especially, it is desirable to complete a migration task in a specified time period. This thesis presents an opportunistic data migration scheme with an adaptive rate controller.

This technique yields advantages of high-throughput analysis and low consumption of reagents. Microfluidic devices are now entering the market and focusing on flexibility and usefulness in various applications, but spatial control over biological molecules and micro-/nano-size structures in fluid environment with simple instruments is still a problem. External optical fields, magnetic fields, and electric fields have been explored to be compatible with microfluidic devices to provide sufficient forces in order to control motion of micro-/nano-size molecules and structures. However, the complex fabrication process and associated instrumentation still limit their practical applications. In this thesis, chemically powered channelless microfluidic devices were designed, fabricated, and characterized. Bimetallic devices consisting of silver and gold catalytic junctions can generate a proton gradient and an associated electric field which in turn drives electroosmosis, and electrophoresis when a charged particle is present in the vicinity of the field during the reaction of hydrogen peroxide decomposition. The influences of patterned regions of different surface zeta potential, device geometry and size on the motility of negatively charged carboxyl-functionalized microspheres were evaluated. Carboxyl-functionalized microspheres were chosen in part to simulate negatively charged biomolecules. Rectangular silver features patterned on a gold thin film with different surface zeta potentials were used to evaluate the impacts of bimetallic feature geometry on the motility of carboxylated spheres. The width of silver features was held constant at 50 \u00b5m and the lengths were 200 \u00b5m and 300 \u00b5m. Amine terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM) was used to modify the surface zeta potential, which in turn controlled the direction and magnitude of electroomostic fluid flow. This manifested itself as a depletion region around both the silver feature and the area where the SAM had been assembled. On the gold surface without SAM modification, the depletion region extended to ~ 15-20 \u00b5m away from the edge of silver features, while on the gold surface with SAM modification, it extended to ~ 85 \u00b5m as electroosmotic fluid flow was aligned with electrophoretic force for negatively charged particles. Velocities of microspheres increased in the case where a larger silver catalyst area was implemented. In addition, velocities of microspheres decreased gradually as distance to silver edge became larger. In addition, some practical channelless microfluidic devices were designed and demonstrated. In particular, a device exhibiting a circular silver-gold bimetallic catalytic junction fabricated on a silicon dioxide surface is capable of focusing particles into a defined region on the surface, where their density was ultimately increased by a factor of 10. Velocity of tracers in the region of 0-50 \u00b5m away from the silver edge was 45 \u00b1 5 \u00b5m/min, which was twice as large as that at the region of 50-100 \u00b5m. Little variation in velocities were observed when the dimension was larger than 50 \u00b5m. This device and other similar devices may open the possibility of integrated chemically powered channelless microfluidic devices. The efficiency and ease of the fabrication suggest the possibility of versatile applications. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3285], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Jiayun ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiayun", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Jeffrey M Catchmark"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark, Thesis Advisor", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Catalysis", "Electroosmosis", "Electrophoresis", "Microfluidics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "ACQUISITION OF THE CHINESE RESULTATIVE VERB COMPLEMENTS BY\nLEARNERS OF CHINESE AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE: A LEARNER CORPUS\nAPPROACH\n", "id": "12516", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3122", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Chinese resultative verb complements (RVCs) are an important and challenging verb\ncompound structure for English-speaking CFL learners to acquire.

Specifically, it looks at the learners' lexical, syntactic and semantic choices of the different types of RVCs, and identifies learners\u2019 sources of difficulty in acquiring the different types of RVCs.\nTo address the research questions, a learner corpus of CFL learners was constructed. The\ncorpus consisted of essays written by CFL learners at three proficiency levels: lower-intermediate (LIL), higher-intermediate (HIL), and advanced (AL). A collection of essays written by Chinese native speakers was used as baseline for learner performance. All instances of RVCs were identified and annotated. All deviations of RVCs were tagged. The findings show that although\nRVCs were found to be not particularly frequent in the learners\u2019 data, the frequency of RVCs\ngrew steadily as the learners\u2019 overall language proficiency improved.

The acquisition of the different types of RVCs reveals very different\ndevelopmental pattens in terms of lexical diversity, syntactic complexity, semantic\nexpressiveness, and linguistic accuracy. Different sources of difficulty in acquiring the different types of RVCs are identified. Although the three types of RVCs have developed differently in the learners, some important commonalities emerged from the analysis. It suggests that the syntactic and semantic features of the RVCs can be mastered fairly early on, whereas the lexical diversity of the RVCs seems to be a difficult area for acquisition. This shows that in the acquisition of the\nChinese RVCs, the mastery of the lexical dimension is not developed hand in hand with that of the syntactic or semantic dimensions. The acquisition of the lexical dimension is much more\nchallenging and takes longer to acquire than the syntactic or the semantic dimension. \nThe dissertation contributes in important ways to a deeper understanding of the Chinese RVCs and Chinese compound structures in general. Instructional approaches are discussed that\ncater to the characteristics of the different types of RVCs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3111], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Jie  ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jie ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Lantolf", "James Lantolf", "Karen E Johnson", "Xiaofei Lu", "Matthew Edward Poehner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Lantolf, Dissertation Advisor", "James Lantolf, Committee Chair", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Member", "Xiaofei Lu, Committee Member", "Matthew Edward Poehner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["learner corpus analysis", "resultative verb complements", "Chinese language acquisition", "learners of Chinese as a foreign language"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "AN INVESTIGATION OF TECHNOLOGY DESIGN FEATURES FOR SUPPORTING REAL-TIME COLLABORATIVE PROGRAMMING IN AN EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT", "id": "15158jvz5262", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15158", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Courses that introduce concepts and skills for object-oriented programming (OOP) are very common across educational establishments, even in middle and high schools. In many such courses, collaboration in small teams on OOP projects is a necessary and important element.\nTeam programming allows educators to assign more challenging problems, while at the same time providing practice on programming collaboration that is common in industry. In these projects, real-time (synchronous) collaboration is often critical, as it gives students the opportunity to view, build and check on each other\u2019s code as it is being developed. However, despite the value in such real-time collaboration, it is currently only partly supported by tools, with students often relying on independent tools for different aspects of their work (e.g., code editors, compilers, online chat). There are no technologies that would be most appropriate for students to use while completing OOP project collaboratively in real-time. Moreover, educators also use a mix of methods when grading OOP assignments. There is no effort to analyze technologies that would be most appropriate for their grading method. \nMy thesis studies this gap in tool support using two primary methods: 1) working from a scenario-based analysis of a state-of-the-art shared programming tool (Cloud9), I designed and mocked-up enhancements to Cloud9, so I could explore how it might support common team programming scenarios; and 2) I conducted interviews of OOP students and instructors to learn about their background and expectations for team projects, as well as react to my design ideas. \nIn this thesis, I report my methods for design analysis and empirical study, and interpret my results to propose new design directions for tools that might better support real-time collaborative programming in an educational environment.

It consists of a PZT disk sandwiched between two \"cymbal\" shaped metal end caps that provide the name. First proposed as an actuator, whose performance fills the gap between the multilayer and bimorph actuator, the cymbal was later developed by Newnham and coworkers to be used as an underwater transducer. This thesis describes the design, characterization, modeling and optimization of miniaturized flextensional transducers and arrays. \nThe underwater behavior of the cymbal transducer was modeled using the finite element analysis code ATILA. It was found that the underwater response is strongly affected by the boundary conditions imposed by the testing fixtures. The PC boards used in the initial experiments partially clamp the motion of the transducer, leading to distorted beam patterns and spurious peaks in the measured TVR curve. Excellent agreement between the calculated and experimentally measured transmitting voltage response and directivity patterns was later obtained with a potting technique in which \"free\" mechanical boundary conditions were maintained for the transducer. The type of PZT, cap material and geometry on the underwater response of cymbal was investigated using finite element analysis code ATILA. In general, individual cymbal transducers have a high Qm and low electrical acoustic efficiency because of poor radiation efficiency, but much more promising results were obtained with cymbal arrays. \nFour different array assembly techniques were proposed and compared. The potting technique, which allows the transducers to vibrate freely, gives a higher and flatter TVR than the PC board technique. The resulting beam patterns are symmetric and in good agreement with a simple point source model. Two mounting techniques using pressure release materials, the copaco ring and corprene sheet, were also tested. Of the four techniques, the potting method appears to be the most successful. Therefore, a prototype 5x20 array was built by potting the cymbals in polyurethane. The array has a thin profile and low weight, making it superior to the 1-3 composites and tonpilz transducers for certain applications. The potted array is flexible and its conformability was demonstrated by mounting it on a curved shell.  \nTwo methods were used to analyze the acoustic loading effect in the array. The equivalent circuit model is straightforward and can provide a qualitative understanding of the array interactions. By coupling finite element analysis to the well developed boundary element method, a more accurate and quantitative prediction of the acoustic loading effect can be achieved. Even though the transducers in the array are driven with the same voltage and phase, they behave differently because of mutual interactions. In a 3x3 array, the central transducer has twice the displacement of the surrounding transducers. In addition to the displacement difference, the vibration velocities of the transducers show a significant phase difference. As a consequence, the resonance is strongly damped, resulting in a broader bandwidth. The TVR and beam pattern are affected by the element spacing in the array. The calculation has also shown that the detrimental effect of array interaction can be minimized by varying the resonance frequencies of the individual transducers in the array.\nThis work has resulted in two new designs: the double-dipper and the double-driver. The double-dipper consists of a ceramic ring bonded between two inverted cap shaped caps, therefore also called \"concave cymbal\". The double-dipper significantly increases the pressure tolerance of the cymbal-type transducer while maintaining a high sensitivity. The use of a ceramic ring allows several poling configurations for the double-dipper that were investigated using ATILA. The double-driver consists of two ceramic disks glued back to back with a common ground electrode. The two disks are sandwiched between two metal end caps and are driven differently. While most flextensional transducers have an omnidirectional beam pattern, a directional beam pattern can be obtained from a double-driver by exciting the driving element into a bending mode.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3230], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Jindong ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jindong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Jack Hughes", "Kenji Uchino", "Leslie Eric Cross", "Robert E Newnham"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Jack Hughes, Committee Member", "Kenji Uchino, Committee Member", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member", "Robert E Newnham, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["metal-ceramic composite", "transducer array", "actuator", "acoustic transducer", "finite element analysis", "transducer modeling", "transducers", "underwater transducers", "cymbal"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "PHASE-FIELD SIMULATIONS OF MICORSTRUCTURES INVOLVING LONG-RANGE ELASTIC, MAGNETOSTATIC AND ELECTROSTATIC INTERACTIONS\n", "id": "8106", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3296", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The phase-field approach is one of the most powerful methods for modeling microstructure evolution processes.

It was demonstrated that the spontaneous polarizations, domain structures, and domain wall stabilities of BiFeO3 thin films could be effectively controlled by choosing the substrates with appropriate lattice parameters and orientations.

However, the spatial and temporal occurrence of SLF remains poorly understood because of the complex subsurface heterogeneity and the lack of appropriate tools to identify such heterogeneity.   The overall goal of this study is to develop an integrated hydrologic and geophysical database that can elucidate spatial and temporal patterns of SLF at the Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (CZO). Specifically, this study assembles a large database of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) images and real-time soil moisture monitoring, which is used to address the following four research objectives: 1) to identify spatial and temporal occurrence of SLF, 2) to investigate flow patterns in two contrasting soils-landform units, 3) to study the effect of soil horizonation on the seasonal change of GPR signals, and 4) to develop a new software to process, display, and interpret time-lapsed GPR data.\nUnder objective 1), the direct evidence of SLF was revealed by comparing real-time soil moisture storage change in each monitored soil horizon at each site with rainfall inputs. Results indicated that SLF was ubiquitous across all the monitoring sites and 52% of 97 rainfall events from 2007 to 2009 produced SLF. However, individual monitoring site showed spatial and temporal variation in the occurrence of SLF, which was related to soil type, hillslope location, rainfall characteristics, and initial soil moisture.  The results also clearly showed a rainfall threshold to initiate SLF, which increased from 1.1 to 2.3 mm from wet to dry seasons. Although SLF occurred at each site, only 9 out of the 97 rainfall events analyzed showed the connectivity from the hilltop to the valley floor.  Under wet condition, only 1.1~ 2.3 mm rain could connect SLF from the hilltop to the valley floor, while under dry condition, 14.6 mm rain was needed to deliver water from the hilltop down to the valley floor.  In addition, we found that the layers where SLF most likely to occur also varied among different hillslope locations that had different soil types: SLF in the shallow Weikert soil occurred mostly in the R horizon, while in the deep Rushtown soil SLF frequently occurred in the Bw and C horizons. This study enhanced the understanding of the mechanism, actual location, and potential flow pathway of SLF in a forested catchment and can improve process-based hydrological modeling.\nUnder objective 2), time-lapsed GPR imaging was combined with real-time soil moisture monitoring to identify SLF pathways in two contrasting transects of soils. The real-time soil moisture monitoring showed that SLF occurred in top 20-cm soil after artificial water infiltration into the shallow Weikert soil in a planar hillslope (30% slope), whereas vertical flow dominated in the deep Rushtown soil located in a concave hillslope (swale) with 15% slope. The time-lapse GPR radargrams revealed the general infiltration wetting front and preferential flow pattern that were significantly different between the two types of soils and hillslopes, which were then confirmed by simulation modeling results. Through comparing simulated radargrams generated from four conceptual flow models with the field observed GPR data, we were able to confirm that subsurface lateral macropore flow was dominant in the shallow Weikert soil, while a combination of vertical macropore flow and lateral matrix flow was dominant in the deep Rushtown soil under the experimental conditions of this study.  Time-lapsed GPR is proved to be a useful methodology for improved understanding of hydrologic connectivity in the subsurface, which can facilitate the formulation and test of different conceptualizations of subsurface network modeling.  \nUnder objective 3), GPR was combined with high resolution real-time soil moisture monitoring to examine seasonal changes of GPR signals at the interfaces of soil layers in two different soils. The results indicate that in the deep Rushtown soil reflection in the BC-C horizon interface became clearer as soil became wetter. High resolution real-time soil water monitoring and field observations indicated that this increased reflection may be due to SLF above and below the BC horizon, which increased the contrast along the interface. In contrast, in the shallow Weikert soil, reflections at the soil -bedrock interface and weathered-unweathered rock interface became intermittent as soil became wetter. This was likely caused by non-uniform distribution of water into the fractures of the shale bedrock, which created locally strong contrasts between soil and bedrock thus leading to point scatter of GPR reflection. The results also indicated optimal time to detect soil horizons in the two soils studied. Wet condition without rainfall event is optimal for detecting the BC-C interface in the Rushtown soil, while dry condition is optimal for detecting the soil-bedrock and weathered-unweathered interface in the Weikert soil. Our results also indicated that seasonal GPR survey with high resolution real-time soil water content monitoring is a promising methodology for understanding, explaining and conceptualizing hydrologic processes in the hillslope.\nUnder objective 4), MATLAB-based software called Time-lapsed GPR (TGPR) has been developed as an alternative to expansive commercial software to process, display, and interpret GPR data collected in the Shale hills catchment. The TGPR can process both 2D and 3D GPR survey data and has ability to batch process surveys containing several profiles instead of single file as the commercial software usually does.  With user-friendly interfaces, the TGPR can allow users to interactively edit radargrams and manually or automatically correct topography. The TGPR also provides several utilities to enhance 2D and 3D visualizations of GPR data. These utilities include trace view, wiggle view, and image view of 2D data; slice view, cube view, and transparent view of 3D data; ten built-in color table to enhance image display quality; layer editing on 2D image. Furthermore, with structured programming, TGPR can be easily expanded and customized.\nOverall, high temporal resolution real-time soil moisture monitoring data can be used to identify the occurrence of SLF, analyze SLF processes, and seasonal soil moisture change at the point scale. Combined with high spatial resolution GPR survey, spatial flow pattern can be identified, flow mechanism can be confirmed, and flow pathways can be traced at the hillslope scale. Such an integrated approach that combines the point and hillslope scales investigations provides valuable insights into the understanding of the complex and dynamic subsurface heterogeneity and how it impacts hydrologic processes.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3238], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Jun ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hangsheng Lin", "Hangsheng Lin", "Guoray Cai", "John Earl Watson", "Gary Walter Petersen", "Maxim J Schlossberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hangsheng Lin, Dissertation Advisor", "Hangsheng Lin, Committee Chair", "Guoray Cai, Committee Member", "John Earl Watson, Committee Member", "Gary Walter Petersen, Committee Member", "Maxim J Schlossberg, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["soil layer", "soil moisture content", "GPR", "subsurface flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "IDENTIFICATION OF ANTI-ATHEROGENIC AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS OF WALNUTS AND PISTACHIOS\n", "id": "10288", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3297", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tree nuts are low in saturated fatty acids and high in unsaturated fatty acids, and are rich sources of other nutrients including fiber, vitamin E, folate, phytosterols and potassium.  While most tree nuts are rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), walnuts contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), both \u00a6\u00c1-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA).  In addition, walnuts skins contribute 6.5 mmol antioxidants based on a one-ounce serving size, which is higher than other commonly consumed tree nuts.  Pistachios, on the other hand, are relatively high in phytosterols compared with most other nuts.  However, little is known about the effects of consuming tree nuts on the development of atherosclerosis, which is characterized by the formation of fatty streaks in the artery walls as well as a localized inflammation.  In the in vitro and ex vivo studies presented herein, mouse and human macrophage cell lines were used as a model for foam cells to study the effects of walnuts, walnut components, and individual nutrients present on cholesterol storage and transport.  ALA, a predominant n-3 fatty acid in walnuts, increased cholesterol efflux in the presence of various acceptor molecules.  During gene expression profile studies, stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), a rate-limiting enzyme in MUFA synthesis, was decreased by ALA at both mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner.  Repressing SCD1 by short interfering RNA vector led to a significant decrease in intracellular total cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and free cholesterol.  The converse was observed when SCD-1 expression was increased using an ectopic expression vector.  After macrophage-derived foam cells were treated with lipid extracts from walnut skins, walnut oil, and whole walnuts, SCD1 expression was decreased with walnut oil treatment.  In an ex vivo study, serum samples from subjects participating in a walnut components postprandial feeding study were applied as treatment to investigate the effects of bioactive molecules present in the nut on cholesterol efflux and gene expression.  In foam cells treated with postprandial serum samples, regardless of the walnut component consumed, SCD1 mRNA was decreased.  Bioactive compounds present in the serum from the walnut oil treatment were most efficacious.  This ex vivo effect on SCD-1 expression was greater when subjects were categorized with low baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) (\u00a1\u00dc 3 mg/L) compared to those who had high CRP (> 3 mg/L).  A similar finding was observed during the cholesterol efflux assay, where serum from the walnut oil treatment (with lower basal CRP) had a significantly higher efflux than that of serum from the high basal CRP group.  ALA and walnut extracts significantly activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which in turn interfered with liver X receptor (LXR) and its ability to affect sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and ultimately SCD1.  After cholesterol was transported and incorporated into the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle, the effects of walnut extracts on uptake and internalization of HDL in the hepatocyte was studied.  Walnut extracts increased internalization of HDL collected from the efflux medium of foam cells.  This effect was due to an activation of hepatocyte membrane receptor expression through a FXR-dependent pathway.  Thus, bioactive molecules present in walnuts favorably decrease intracellular cholesterol storage and increase the removal of cholesterol out of lipid laden foam cells by inhibiting SCD1 through an FXR-dependent pathway.  To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of pistachios, lipopolysaccaride (LPS) was applied as an inflammation inducer to study the regulation of pistachios on inflammatory biomarker expression.  Administration of pistachio oil (PO) to cultured macrophages affected a variety of genes associated with immune function.  A novel biomarker, interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (Ifit-2), was identified as being repressed by PO.  A lipid extract of PO (PE) decreased LPS-induced Ifit-2 expression the most, compared with changes in TNF-\u00a6\u00c1, IL-6, and IL-1\u00a6\u00c2.

Based on the increasing evidence that concussion can disrupt multiple brain functional networks, including the oculomotor control network, a series of classic saccadic and smooth pursuit tasks are adopted during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. The behavioral/neurological testing sessions contain reflexive saccades, anti-saccades, memory-guided saccades, self-paced saccades, sinusoidal smooth pursuit, circular and random smooth pursuit. Nine concussed athletes and nine age and sex matched healthy subjects are recruited for this study. Among them, Seven were tested twice around 7 days and 30 days post injury, and 2 patients missed the second test. \nBoth behavioral/neurological and imaging (fMRI) data revealed differential results between the healthy controls and concussed patients. Concussed patients have longer latency time in the saccadic tasks, worse position errors and fewer number of self-paced saccades compared to control subjects. Marginal trends of longer pursuit lag and greater end position errors are observed in concussion group. Specifically, at day 7: Firstly, concussion group had additional brain regions and larger activation sites as evidenced by fMRI images. Moreover, functional connectivity analysis on the default mode network (DMN) deactivation demonstrated failure of complete deactivation in concussed subjects. Additionally, graph theory analysis revealed disrupted whole brain network properties in concussed subjects. At day 30: Most of neurological measures returned to those observed in normal controls. However, fMRI patterns of the antisaccades task remained to be abnormal, that appeared to be matched with the relatively worse behavioral results. It can be concluded that concussed patients have persistent oculomotor deficits far beyond 7 days post-injury and compromised neural network, even though after they were clinically cleared for return to sports activities. Our findings are consistent with \u201ccompensatory\u201d hypothesis that latent brain resources may allow the concussed patients to reach a comparable level performance. That is being said, their behavioral results cannot match those of healthy controls, especially during anti-saccades and self-paced saccades oculomotor tasks. Therefore, collective examination of saccadic task and brain functional connectivity analysis have the potential to be considered as a sensitive assessing tool for assessment of concussion in acute and sub-acute phases of injury.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9240], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Kai ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Semyon Slobounov", "Semyon Slobounov", "Karl Maxim Newell", "Frank Gerard Hillary", "Wayne Joseph Sebastianelli", "David E Conroy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Semyon Slobounov, Dissertation Advisor", "Semyon Slobounov, Committee Chair", "Karl Maxim Newell, Committee Member", "Frank Gerard Hillary, Committee Member", "Wayne Joseph Sebastianelli, Committee Member", "David E Conroy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Concussion", "Neuroimaging", "fMRI", "DMN", "Graph Theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Effects Of Peer-Controlled Or Externally Structured And Moderated Online Collaboration On Group Problem Solving Processes And Related Individual Attitudes In Well-Structured And Ill-Structured Small Group Problem Solving In A Hybrid Course\n\n\n\n", "id": "6275", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3672", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-01-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT<br>\nThe primary purpose of the study is to investigate the relative effects of two approaches to peer online collaboration (peer-controlled and externally structured and moderated) on the group problem solving processes during well-structured and ill-structured problem solving tasks. The secondary purpose is to examine the effects of the two approaches on individual learners'related attitudes.<br>\nVygotsky (1978) states that social interactions play a very important role in learning and recent research demonstrates that working in small groups facilitates learning (Johnson & Johnson, 1975; Hamm & Adams, 1992; Bosworth & Hamilton, 1994; Bruffee, 1999). As a result, collaborative learning has become increasingly popular in both face-to-face and distance education settings. Computer technologies, as demonstrated in research and practice, can support collaborative learning and benefit learning in different ways (e.g., Harisim, 1990; Bonk & Cunningham, 1998; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1994). Currently two approaches are dominant in the practice of peer online collaborative learning: peer controlled and externally moderated. In a peer controlled online collaboration the instructor does not play an active role in the collaboration process, providing little or no structuring or moderating efforts. In externally moderated and structured peer collaboration processes the instructor, or another qualified person from outside of the group, provides structuring and moderating efforts as needed. <br>\nA previous study (Zhang & Peck, 2003) found that externally structured and moderated online collaborative groups achieved significantly higher scores in reasoning during problem solving tasks when compared to the peer-controlled collaborative groups. The study (Zhang & Peck) also showed that the two different approaches to collaboration led to differences in related individual attitudes. However, very little has been done to further examine the relative effects of these two different approaches on group problem solving processes during varied problem solving tasks. In her more recent research, Zhang (2003) found that these two approaches led to significant differences in group achievements on both well-structured problem solving and ill-structured problem solving, favoring externally structured and moderated collaboration. This study intends to take one step further and re-examine the relative effects of the two approaches and also to investigate the possible effects on individual learners' related attitudes.<br> \nThus this study investigates the following major research questions:<br>\nQuestion 1.\tWhich approach to peer online collaboration is more effective, peer-controlled or externally moderated, in promoting college students group problem solving process during well-structured problem solving?<br>\nQuestion 2.\tWhich approach to peer online collaboration is more effective, peer-controlled or externally moderated, in promoting college students group problem solving process during ill-structured problem solving?<br>\nQuestion 3.\tDo the two approaches lead to differences in individual students attitudes related to online collaboration?<br>\n3.a\tDoes the approach to collaboration lead to differences in students perception of the difficulty of online collaboration?<br>\n3.b\tDoes the approach to collaboration lead to differences in students perception of the value of online collaboration?<br>\n3.c\tDoes the approach to collaboration lead to differences in students' willingness to use a similar tool in the future?<br>\n3.d\tDo the two approaches to collaboration lead to different amounts of time spent in collaboration or the use of different media for collaboration (e.g. email, telephone, face-to-face, etc.)?<br>\nQuestion 4.\tDo students prior experiences (i.e., statistics background, teamwork experiences, and online learning experiences) lead to differences in the problem solving processes?<br> \nDesign:<br>\nA randomized post-test only experiment was used to investigate Questions 1 and Question 2. Seventy two groups, in size of 3-5, were randomly assigned to one of the two treatments. ANOVA was conducted to test the null hypotheses and thus to answer the first two research questions. Individual surveys were conducted to collect data to answer Question 3 and Question 4. <br>\nResults:<br>\n\u2022\tGroups assigned to the externally structured and moderated online collaboration displayed significantly higher scores in well-structured problem solving process than those in the peer-controlled condition. <br>\n\u2022\tGroups assigned to the externally structured and moderated online collaboration displayed significantly higher scores in a) the use of statistical knowledge, b) the use of strategic knowledge, c) communication and d) overall problem solving process during ill-structured problem solving than those in the peer-controlled condition. <br>\n\u2022\tThe two approaches did not lead to different amount of time spent on the collaborative task or the use of any of the communication media reported.

This dissertation is composed of four essential topics on mining economics, including evaluation of a gold mine with uncertainty in price and operational flexibility, the assessment of how critical the rare earth element-Yttrium is to the US\u2019 economy, the determination of economic cutoff grade for a two-mineral metal mine, and a theoretical model for stockpiling and processing the intermediate grade ore. \n\tTraditional evaluation technics, such as discounted cash flow approach, fails to address the uncertainties in commodity\u2019s price and mining cost, as well as operational flexibility. In the first chapter, a real option model is set up to evaluate a gold mine incorporating the uncertainties, and determine the optimal price threshold to trigger the mining investment. By extension of the model, the research examines the effects of postponing the delivery of commodity to market. The results show that the real option value by virtue of operational flexibility can be significant and should not be ignored when valuing a mine.\n\tThe vulnerability of the US\u2019 economy to restrictions in the supply of various rare earth elements have been of great concern in recent years.  The second chapter examines how critical Yttrium is to US\u2019 national economy, by considering its supply sources, China\u2019s export quota and tax, relevant uses, possible substitution in use, and recycling. Its production, however, causes a variety of environmental harms, making the supply stream vulnerable to more stringent environmental regulation. Yttrium is difficult to replace in compact fluorescent lights (CFL), its largest use.  The high short-run demand for CFLs increases the criticality of Yttrium. In the longer run, however, the demand for CFLs is expected to decline gradually.  \n\tNormally, there is variability in ore\u2019s quality for metal mines. The third chapter introduces a net present value maximization algorithm for a by-product mining project. The algorithm accounts the time value of money effect for the cash flows. A rare earth case study is illustrated contingent on the algorithm. It is found the optimal economic cutoff grade of the primary product can be significantly impacted by the changes in economic variables related to the by-product.\n\tThe fourth chapter follows the problem of varied quality in ore, by establishing a theoretical two-stage model for a mining system with production from the stockpiled material. In a metal mine, the intermediate grade material between economic and breakeven cutoff grades is typically stockpiled for future processing after depletion. By deriving the first order condition for objective profit function and parameterized analysis, this research finds the profit from processing the stockpiled material contributes to a mine\u2019s profit significantly; processing the stockpiled also shifts the optimal mining strategy; in addition, the research measures how responsive the optimal mining rate is to input variables\u2019 change, and finds the impact of some of the variables is diminishing. The intrinsic advantages of the theoretical model compared to numerical approaches in interpreting the economic intuitive of stockpiling management and optimal mining strategy are discussed. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9454], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Kuangyuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kuangyuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Nathan Kleit", "Antonio Nieto", "Andrew Nathan Kleit", "Antonio Nieto", "George Young", "Shimin Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Nathan Kleit, Dissertation Advisor", "Antonio Nieto, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Nathan Kleit, Committee Chair", "Antonio Nieto, Committee Chair", "George Young, Committee Member", "Shimin Liu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mining Economics", "Real Option Evaluation", "Mean-reverting of Commodity Price", "Material Criticality", "Yttrium", "China\u2019s Rare Earth P"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Phase field model for the nucleation in solid state phase transformations: Theories, Algorithms and Applications", "id": "9433", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3941", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nucleation takes place when a material becomes thermodynamically meta-stable with respect to its transformation to a new state or new crystal structure. Very often, the nucleation process dictates the microstructure of a material. Predicting the shape of a critical nucleus in solids has been a long-standing problem in solid state phase transformations. It is generally believed that nucleation in solid is the most difficult process to model and predict. \n\nThe main focus of this dissertation is the development of mathematical models and numerical algorithms for various nucleation phenomena in solid state phase transformation. Motivated by a general phase field framework with a diffuse interface description of the phase transformation, we develop a new computational approach to predict the morphology of a critical nucleus in solids under the influence of both interfacial energy anisotropy and long-range elastic interactions. The approach can help us uncover the wealth of fascinating topics in the solid states.\n\nThe dissertation is organized as follows: In Chapter 1, we give an overview of the nucleation in the solid states and existing nucleation theories, including the classical nucleation theory and the diffuse interface theory. Then we introduce some numerical methods to compute the saddle point and the Minimum Energy Path (MEP). \n\nIn Chapter 2, we investigate a phase-field model for finding the critical nucleus morphology in the homogeneous nucleation of solids. We analyze the mathematical properties of a free energy functional that includes the long-range, anisotropic elastic interactions. Based on a minimax technique and the Fourier spectral implementation, the numerical algorithms is developed to search for the saddle points. We demonstrate that the phase-field model is mathematically well defined and is able to efficiently predict the critical nucleus morphology in elastically anisotropic solids without making a priori assumptions. \n\nIn Chapter 3, we present numerical simulations of the critical nucleus morphology in solid state phase transformations. A diffuse interface model combined with the minimax technique is implemented to predict the morphology of critical nucleus during solid to solid phase transformations in both two and three dimensions. We use a particular example of cubic to cubic transformation within the homogeneous modulus approximation and study the effect of elastic energy contribution on the morphology of a critical nucleus. The results show that strong elastic energy interactions may lead to critical nuclei with a wide variety of shapes, including plates, needles and cuboids with non-convex interfaces. It is found that strong elastic energy contributions may lead to critical nuclei whose point group symmetry is below the crystalline symmetries of both the new and the parent phases.\n\nIn Chapter 4, we develop a constrained string method to solve the saddle-point problem with general constraints. Based on the description of the string method, a smooth curve is evolved with intrinsic parametrization whose dynamics takes the string to the most probable transition path between two metastable regions in configuration space. Then Lagrange multiplier is applied for the extra constraint and numerical algorithm of the constrained string method is implemented to find the constrained MEP and saddle points. Numerical analysis includes the conservation of the constraint and the energy law. We also propose a simplified approach to implement the constraint by the Augmented Lagrangian method.\n\nBy using the constrained string method, we investigate the morphological evolution during precipitation of a second-phase particle in a solid along the entire transformation path from nucleation to equilibrium in Chapter 5.  We show that a combination of diffuse-interface description and a constrained string method is able to predict both the critical nucleus and equilibrium precipitate morphologies simultaneously without a priori assumptions. Using the cubic to cubic transformation as an example, it is demonstrated that the maximum composition within a critical nucleus can be either higher or lower than that of equilibrium precipitate while morphology of an equilibrium precipitate may exhibit lower symmetry than the critical nucleus resulted from elastic interactions.\n\nIn Chapter 6, we present more applications for the nucleation in solids, including cubic to tetragonal transformation, and nucleation for two order parameters in solids. Our works on the mathematical modeling and computational algorithms open some new research directions and provide useful tools for the analysis of the nucleation phenomenon in general, for instance, we will consider the dynamic simulation of the nucleation process, inhomogeneous nucleation, and heterogeneous nucleation in the near future.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3914], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Lei ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiang Du", "Qiang Du", "Long Qing Chen", "Chun Liu", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov", "Xiantao Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiang Du, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiang Du, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Chun Liu, Committee Member", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov, Committee Member", "Xiantao Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Phase field", "nucleation", "critical nucleus", "solid state"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ANGEL: A HYBRID CONTENT-BASED FILTERING TOOL FOR PROTECTING TEENS\u2019 SAFETY IN ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORK", "id": "9005", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3944", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since its emergence in 1997 [1] , online social networks have experienced dramatic evolution\nand played an increasingly important role in our life.

Regeneration of neurons in the CNS when injured or under pathological conditions remains a major challenge for functional recovery.\n Current efforts largely focus on cell replacement therapy with exogenous cells derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate neurons (Sahni and Kessler, 2010; Takahashi et al., 2007; Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). In spite of the great promise, cell transplantation approaches face significant hurdles, such as poor survival rate, immunorejection, tumorigenesis and differentiation uncertainty (Lee et al., 2013; Lukovic et al., 2014). \nGlial cells represent a large reservoir for generating neurons locally. In response to CNS injury, glial cells (e.g., astrocytes, NG2 cells and microglia) are activated to proliferate and become hypertrophic to occupy the injured CNS area, thus limiting the spreading of injury in the acute stage (Pekny and Nilsson, 2005; Robel et al., 2011; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010). On the other hand, long-term occupancy of the injury sites by reactive glial cells will result in the secretion of neuroinhibitory factors that prevent neuronal growth, eventually forming glial scars inside the CNS (Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010). Reactive glial cells have been widely reported after brain injury, spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) (Burda and Sofroniew, 2014; Gwak et al., 2012; Pekny and Nilsson, 2005; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010; Verkhratsky et al., 2012).\n Recent studies, including our own, have demonstrated that astroglial cells can be directly converted into functional neurons in vitro (Guo et al., 2014; Heinrich et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2015) and in vivo (Grande et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2014; Heinrich et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013; Torper et al., 2013) by ectopic overexpression of neural transcription factors (TFs). So far, conversion of glial cells into neurons has been largely achieved using viral-based expression of TFs, but clinical applications might be hampered due to complex brain surgery and genetic alteration. \nHere we report a novel technology, chemical reprogramming that uses defined small molecules to reprogram cultured human astrocytes into functional neurons with high efficiency. Chemically converted human neurons can survive in long-term culture and in the mouse brain. Moreover, they form elaborate neuronal networks in culture and can integrate into mouse neural circuits. \nWe further examined the mechanisms underlying small molecule-induced glia-to-neuron conversion. Our results suggest that human neurons can be directly generated by conversion of human astrocytes without a transient stem cell stage. Intriguingly, epigenetic silencing of glial genes and transcriptional activation of neural TFs, such as NEUROD1 and NGN2, are involved in chemical reprogramming. In addition, we evaluated the functional role of each individual small molecule included in the cocktail and identified the core molecules that are essential for highly efficient glia-to-neuron reprogramming. \nTowards future therapeutic applications, we also tested the effect of a small-molecule cocktail on neurogenesis in vivo. Interestingly, the small molecules injected into mouse brains induced stem cell properties in cortical and striatal astrocytes. Moreover, adult neurogenesis was significantly enhanced by local injection of small molecules in adult mouse hippocampus. \nIn conclusion, our study opens a new avenue using chemical compounds to reprogram reactive glial cells into functional neurons for CNS repair. Our chemical reprogramming method may potentially be translated into clinical therapy to help patients suffering from CNS disorders. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12632], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Lei ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lei Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lei Zhang, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Small molecule", "Neuron", "Astrocytes", "Reprogramming", "CNS repair"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Correlated metals as transparent conductors", "id": "14388lzz123", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14388", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The first section of this dissertation work discusses a new designing paradigm for transparent conductors which are widely used in energy and information technology. Most of previous efforts of developing high performance transparent conductors were given to the heavily-doped wide-bandgap semiconductors, which strike a delicate balance between electrical conductivity and optical transparency. However, the ideal conductors, metals, are much less considered and studied due to their nature of high reflection and high absorption in the visible spectrum (1.75~3.25 eV), making them unsuitable for the application as transparent conductors. \n\tHere a sizeable electron-electron correlation effect and a favorable band structure of perovskite oxide-based correlated metal give arise to a much higher transparency and largely maintain the electrical conductivity. The test bed materials in this thesis are SrVO3 and CaVO3. Both materials are made of earth-abundant elements and have electron mean free paths that are less than ~5 nm, which enables the possibility of transferring to a scalable process with the polycrystalline form. High quality materials are successfully grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) using an adsorption-controlled growth mode. By combining a DFT calculation of magnitude of interband transitions and a combined experimental approach of high-resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), spectroscopic ellipsometry and electrical transport measurements, the analysis of the materials is given in term of transparent conductor figure-of-merit. Both materials demonstrate a figure-of-merit that is on par with epitaxial ITO, the most widely used material in industry. \n\tBeyond intrinsic correlated metals, a new strategy utilizes the aliovalent substitution of divalent element Sr with a trivalent element La in SrVO3\u00ac is discussed. By carefully controlling the substitution level of La (x), a blue-shift of absorption peak at UV-range was observed and an increase of electrical conductivity was found. The optimal substitution level for the highest figure-of-merit (~20% higher than that of SrVO3) and the highest optical transparency are found, indicating that correlated metals are quite robust with extrinsic charged substitution.\n\tThe second section of this dissertation work discusses the monolithic integration of epitaxial complex oxide with Si using hybrid MBE. The monolithic integration of epitaxial complex oxide with Si could augment various functions that inherent to oxide, such as ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, colossal magnetoresistance, superconductivity and multiferroic with industry work-horse Si. Hybrid MBE has advantages over thermal MBE in growing a thicker oxide template on Si, such as a higher growth rate and a better control of cation stoichiometry. The preparation of a high-quality SrTiO3 buffer layer is the key that enables hybrid MBE growth of SrTiO3 on Si substrate. A five-monolayer SrTiO3 buffer layer was deposited on Si without oxygen at low temperature and subsequently annealed in vacuum at slightly high temperature. The temperature for the buffer layer growth must neither be too high to expedite the kinetic process of Si oxidization which would terminate the epitaxial growth or too low to prevent the decomposition of metal-organic precursor into TiO2. \n\tA two-step thermal anneal was then introduced. A high temperature anneal was employed to further reduce the rocking curve FWHM down to 0.2\u00b0 while preserving a smooth film surface morphology. The sheet resistance of as-grown and post-annealed samples was increased by five orders of magnitude exceeding 107 Ohm/sq using a lower temperature anneal. This two-step annealing method provides an easy and effective way to improve the crystalline quality of SrTiO3 thin films on Si, providing a path towards the development of electrically insulating virtual perovskite substrates.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14818], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Lei ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "first_name_ssi": "Lei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roman Engel-Herbert", "Roman Engel-Herbert", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Clive A Randall", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Joan Marie Redwing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roman Engel-Herbert, Dissertation Advisor", "Roman Engel-Herbert, Committee Chair", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Outside Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Transparent Conductors", "Perovskite Oxide", "Complex Oxide", "Molecular Beam Epitaxy"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "GUIDED WAVE FOCUSING POTENTIAL IN HOLLOW CYLINDERS\n", "id": "6847", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3876", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation is generally used in industry because of its excellent defect detection potential. The ultrasonic waves propagating in a bounded waveguide are called guided waves. Long range ultrasonic guided waves have intrigued investigators for years because of an ability to test structures over a long distance from a single sensor position. Guided waves have much more complex wave behavior than bulk waves in infinite media. Plane-strain guided waves in a single layer plate with traction free boundaries are Lamb waves. The Lamb type guided waves in hollow cylinders spread out and wrap around the circumference when propagating in an axial direction. Therefore, except for the guided waves with axisymmetric energy distributions in a tube, there are an infinite number of non-axisymmetric wave modes called flexural modes that have similar particle behavior as the axisymmetric mode in the same group. \n\nFocusing at a certain point in a hollow cylinder is implemented by utilizing the non-axisymmetric energy distributions of flexural wave modes. There are two types of focusing in pipes: natural focusing and phased array focusing. When a partially loaded excitation is used to generate guided waves in cylindrical shells, the excited flexural modes lead to ultrasonic energy naturally focused at certain positions. This special natural focusing phenomenon can be used to improve guided wave inspection results in hollow cylinders. \n\nBy applying input time delays and amplitudes for a multi-channel ultrasonic signal generation system, one can focus the guided waves at a pre-selected position. The input parameters of the ultrasonic phased array are calculated by implementing a deconvolution computation of the displacement angular profiles excited by one excitation channel. Because the angular profiles of the circumferential displacement distributions in a hollow cylinder are decided by the excitation sources, focusing results are strongly affected by the excitation conditions.\n\nA source influence for focusing potential in pipes must be considered. Research shows that excitation focusing potential in hollow cylinders depends highly on the frequencies and sizes of the excitation transducers. An infinitely long transducer along the axis only generates axisymmetric guided waves, although a short axial transducer length has little influence on the focusing results. A transducer with a small circumferential length usually leads to drastic variations of energy distributions in the circumferential direction. These sharp angular profiles could lead to a failure of the phased array focusing technique. If a low frequency guided wave group propagates in a pipe with a small diameter, the flexural modes may be cut-off or have much different velocities from the axisymmetric mode. A single axisymmetric mode can never achieve focusing. Hence, contour charts of focusing potential at different frequencies and with various circumferential excitation lengths are used as directories of the focusing procedures.\n\nBecause the geometry changes or material inhomogeneities in a hollow cylinder could affect the angular profiles and focusing potential, three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) was employed to simulate guided wave propagation and scattering in these regions. Numerical simulations show that guided waves are successfully focused beyond small defects and anisotropic welds.  However, seam welds and elbows have extreme effects on the angular profiles: ultrasonic guided waves often tend to concentrate in a seam weld and elbows force a guided wave group to be separated into different groups. Therefore, a time reversal technique is utilized to achieve focusing through these media. For the phased array used as a time-reversal mirror (TRM), the input signal is the time reversed signals, which are then received from a transmitter or reflector at a predetermined focal position. \n\nTheoretical and experimental results show the power of focusing in the long range ultrasonic guided wave inspection of pipe. Therefore, the research of focusing potential in hollow cylinders becomes a significant achievement for applying pipeline integrity evaluations. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3850], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Li ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Li", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Nicholas John Salamon", "Edward C Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Nicholas John Salamon, Committee Member", "Edward C Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pipe inspecton", "Guided wave", "phased array", "focusing"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "GENETIC DIVERSITY AND TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF VENTURIA INAEQUALIS POPULATIONS FOLLOWING TWO APPLE SCAB EPIDEMICS IN PENNSYLVANIA", "id": "11414", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3878", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Apple scab, caused by the ascomycete Venturia inaequalis, is one of the most important diseases in apple production worldwide, mainly due to increasing challenges in disease management. Populations of the pathogen continue to develop resistance to nearly every fungicide used, and there is a limited availability of resistant cultivars with desirable agronomic characteristics. V. inaequalis possesses a characteristic mixed reproduction system, which provides an ideal model to study temporal dynamics of population structure. Understanding temporal changes of population diversity and composition of local V. inaequalis populations may shed light on the evolutionary potential and key evolutionary forces shaping V. inaequalis populations, and it is also an important step in the improvement of apple scab management.\nIn this study we intensively investigated population diversity and temporal dynamics of local Venturia inaequalis populations in a research orchard of the Fruit Research and Extension Center in Biglerville, PA. Sampling was conducted on two cultivars differing in their resistance to apple scab: \u2018Golden Delicious\u2019 (susceptible but carrying resistance gene Vg) and \u2018Rome Beauty\u2019 (highly susceptible without no known resistance genes), at the beginning (May) and near-end (September) of two epidemic years, 2008 and 2009. Seven hundred and sixty-five single-spore V. inaequalis isolates were obtained and genotyped using seven microsatellite markers. The results showed that the overall genetic diversity of the local V. inaequalis populations was very high with Shannon-Wiener\u2019s Index values ranging from 3.67 to 4.02, suggesting V. inaequalis is a pathogen of high risk with high evolutionary potential considering the fact that V. inaequalis undergoes annual sexual recombination. Overall, we observed a significant reduction of genotypic diversity and a dramatic shift in genotypic composition in V. inaequalis populations from \u2018Rome Beauty\u2019, whereas population structure of V. inaequalis from \u2018Golden Delicious\u2019 maintained stable throughout the epidemics.

Specifically, the first objective is to gain a better understanding of intrahousehold welfare distribution and the intrahousehold sharing rule through labor time allocation. The second objective is to understand the underlying individual rural farm household\u2019s decision-making structure under the impact of rural-to-urban migration. The third objective is to explore the dynamics surrounding household decision-making, related to the formation of land and labor markets. For the third objective, potential scenarios are simulated using agent-based modeling to address the impacts of growing off-farm work opportunities, new agricultural technology adoption and diffusion, and land policy reform at the village level. \nThis dissertation uses a baseline socioeconomic face-to-face household survey and key informant interviews undertaken for a project funded by the McKnight Foundation on phosphorous-efficient soybean cultivars being developed and now being released in south China; the survey and KI interviews were conducted in rural south China in summer, 2006. The survey was designed to provide an initial understanding of crop production (including soybean production decisions and anticipated P-efficient soybean adoption decisions), food consumption preferences, labor time allocation, land holding behaviors, and soybean and soybean product markets in the south China region. The KI interviews were designed to understand local trends in agriculture, soybeans, and the strong trend toward labor out-migration observed in the south China region.     \nLabor migration issues have been of great interest in development economics. Past studies of labor migration in China have largely focused on rural migrants to urban areas, while little attention is typically given to those who remain behind in the villages. More young adult and mid-age laborers flowing to exurban and urban regions for higher-wage off-farm employment may leave women, the elderly and very young household members behind, with more farm land available for cultivation in the village. Those left behind in the villages in China are responsible for agricultural production to secure the food supply for the most populated country in the world; and many are, at the same time, seeking jobs in nearby rural labor markets with the hope of bringing in extra income to improve their living conditions. Since off-farm work opportunities in urban, exurban and rural areas provide alternative sources of income to farm households, this is likely to affect intrahousehold resource allocation, labor time allocation, and farm production decisions of those who stay behind. Further, the entire household decision-making structure also may be affected such that the younger \u2018next generation\u2019 \u2013 having migrated for off-farm jobs \u2013is no longer involved in making decisions influencing the farm and ultimately influencing food production for China.   \nIn this dissertation, a collective modeling framework is used to analyze rural farm household labor supply behaviors in south China. Labor time allocation is modeled, while the imperfect wage labor market imposes constraints on off-farm labor supply and requires proper measurement of the farm shadow wage. The marginal product of labor (MPL) of on-farm production is estimated based on Jacoby\u2019s shadow wage method, which is essential to provide appropriate estimation of labor supply functions. Using labor time allocation as an assignable good, the intrahousehold nonlabor income sharing rule is derived. Furthermore, the impacts of the intrahousehold sharing rule, work participation behaviors, and other household characteristics are examined to analyze intrahousehold decision-making structure. \nThe results show that husband\u2019s labor supply is affected by his own and his wife\u2019s wage.  Nonlabor income also has a significant effect on his labor supply. Wife\u2019s labor supply behavior does not change with changes in own wage or nonlabor income. Being less responsive in labor supply, wives are found to be more altruistic than husbands in transferring nonlabor (pooled) income to the spouse, when wage income increases. Labor income, nonlabor income, and local out-migrant sex ratio by county and by age category all show significant impacts on the intrahousehold sharing rule. \nThe estimation results also suggest that an increase in her share of nonlabor income yields a greater likelihood of the wife being engaged in marketing and in multiple production and innovation decisions, but no effect was found for most day-to-day farm production or household consumption decisions. This provides empirical support that transferring nonlabor income from husband to wife will likely increase her engagement in household decision-making but the effect is likely limited to certain decision-making categories. A higher wife\u2019s off-farm wage increases her involvement in making joint decisions for the household with her husband, relative to her husband making these decisions alone.  Husband\u2019s home production participation predicts a more balanced husband-wife joint decision-making structure, relative to a more traditional husband-dominant decision-making structure. Husband\u2019s off-farm employment influences on-farm production decision-making, and especially increases wife\u2019s chance of making decisions alone or making joint decisions with her husband. Household males making joint decisions on soybean cultivar adoption is negatively affected by the off-farm work distance of the husband, but positively affected by the work distance of the wife. The likelihood of the wife making decisions alone is not found to be influenced by the distance that her husband needs to travel to his off-farm job. However, remittances are found to positively effect on males within the household making joint decisions as a group, and a greater schooling gap between husband and wife means that she is less likely to make decisions on her own relative to her husband making the household\u2019s decisions alone.\n Finally, agent-based modeling simulations are incorporated with a classical game-theoretic approach. The simulation results demonstrate that, first, under the assumption of perfect labor and land markets, the initial ratio for agents\u2019 participation in a land-leasing strategy determines the development speed of the land-leasing market. The higher the initial ratio of land-leasing (to labor-hiring) agents, the less time required for land-leasing market formation. This implies that, with other factors kept constant, policies to relax land rental restrictions will strongly encourage farm households to participate in the land-leasing market and speed up the land-leasing market formation process. Second, imperfect off-farm labor markets in surrounding areas cast negative effects on land-leasing market development within the villages. The greater the difference between farm and nonfarm payoffs, the lower the incentives for farmers to invest in farm production. The land-leasing market formation process is delayed as a result. From a policy point of view, in addition to the considerable efforts of removing farm land rental barriers needed at the village level, another focus for policy-making should be to further develop labor markets in surrounding areas and reduce transaction costs associated with off-farm employment.  Third, when land value increases as a result of new agricultural technology adoption and diffusion, households can be expected to switch to a land-leasing strategy despite land policies restrictive to land-leasing. However, an isolated approach of new technology adoption and diffusion (only) provides limited impacts on land-leasing market development, with other policies still needed to further speed up the process. Finally, land policies that focus on offering proper protection in land-leasing transactions will encourage farm households participating in the land-leasing market. With proper land-leasing policies in place to secure land use rights and transactions, the land market emerges rapidly even without significantly increasing the land value. Such policies will also lead to robust growth of the land-leasing market despite labor market imperfection effects.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3849], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Lin ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis", "David Gerard Abler", "Jill Leslie Findeis", "Leif Jensen", "Rhonda Belue"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis, Dissertation Advisor", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Jill Leslie Findeis, Committee Chair", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "Rhonda Belue, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["labor migration", "labor time allocation", "intrahousehold decision-making", "agricultural land leasing", "household collective models", "agent-based models"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "FLOW DYNAMICS AND SCALAR MIXING OF TRANSVERSE JETS INTO CROSSFLOWS\n\n\n", "id": "11676", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3943", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research focuses on the simulation of turbulent jets into crossflows under both subsonic and supersonic conditions. The primary objectives are: 1) to establish an efficient numerical framework for treatment of flows at moderate and high Mach numbers; 2) to deepen an understanding of the physical mechanism governing the behavior of transverse jets; 3) to explore the mixing processes in such flows; 4) to study the effects of inlet conditions on flow structures; and 5) to investigate the response of\nflow dynamics and mixing process to external excitations.\n\nThe theoretical formulation applied here is based on three-dimensional conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy and species. The turbulence closure is achieved using a large-eddy-simulation technique. A hybrid scheme combining a lower-dissipation central scheme and a shock-capturing upwind scheme is employed for\nspatial discretization of the convective terms. Temporal integration is achieved using the Runge-Kutta scheme. The finite-volume approach is used to solve governing equations and associated boundary conditions. The density-based in-house code is paralleled by a domain decomposition method in conjunction with the Message Passing Interface library.\n\nThe numerical framework is validated by reproducing the mean flow and turbulent statistics in experiments. The coherent structures and shock waves are captured\nand their dynamic evolutions are examined according to time-accurate calculations. Findings show the jet shear-layer vortices contribute to the crossflow entrainment in the\nnear field. The hanging vortices break down and account for the early formation of the counter-rotating vortex pair. The deflected crossflow separates and induces upright wake vortices. Spectral and proper-orthogonal-decomposition analyses extract shear-layer instability in the near field and suggest transverse jets with current velocity ratios are globally unstable. External low-amplitude excitations have no apparent influence on the flow and mixing fields; moderate and high magnitudes of variations in the crossflow velocity yield strong vorticity generation and subsequent breakdown. The jet core decreases and the gravity center in the mixing field falls, accompanied by an elongated and narrowed jet plume in any transverse planes downstream. In the case of a sonic ethylene jet into supersonic air crossflow, the salient shock structures are presented in the time-averaged field and further elaborated using instantaneous data. The mixing process is closely related to a stretching-tilting-tearing mechanism of shedding eddies. Results also reveal one low-speed, high-temperature zone ahead of the jet with a flame-holding capability, and one subsonic region in the wake providing a potential pathway for the\ndisturbances downstream to travel back to the near field and impact the injection and mixing processes.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3916], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Liwei ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Liwei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vigor Yang", "Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Vigor Yang", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Robert John Santoro", "Robert Francis Kunz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vigor Yang, Dissertation Advisor", "Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Chair", "Vigor Yang, Committee Chair", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member", "Robert Francis Kunz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["large eddy simulation", "jet in crossflow", "turbulent mixing", "jet stability", "external excitations", "supersonic flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The relationship between job resources and work engagement in an international context", "id": "19107", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9012", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between job resources (performance feedback, autonomy, development opportunities, and task variety) and work engagement in an international context.
