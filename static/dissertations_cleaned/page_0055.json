In the 21st century, the Internet has played host to a number of debates about what online identity is, as well as its relationship to the offline self.  This thesis investigates rhetoric and deliberation in three case studies in which online identities are linked to offline identities in various political or public scenarios.  The case studies are grounded by three theoretical issues: the divide between public and private behavior; the dichotomy of appearance and reality; and the mechanics of praise and blame in epideictic rhetoric.  I first investigate the case studies of Colleen Lachowicz, a candidate for the Maine GOP attacked for her World of Warcraft character.  Next, I explore the mourning of Sean Smith, a US Foreign Service member and EVE Online player, remembered for both his offline life and his online avatar, Vile Rat.  Finally, I analyze Ars Technica\u2019s revealing of Edward Snowden\u2019s online identity, TheTrueHOOHA.  In total, rhetoric about the link between online and offline identity is shaped by political forces and the constraints of rhetorical purpose.  Public perspectives are conflicting and contradictory as regards appropriate moments to link digital and offline identities.

Increasingly, algorithms shape social interaction and political change by arranging material and symbolic phenomena. This dissertation studies the patterns that emerge as algorithms and humans operate together in networked ecologies. Centrally, this project asks how algorithms exhibit agency and how human power intersects with algorithmic arrangement. The project opens by revisiting ancient Greek writings, many of which feature kosmos, roughly translated as \u201corder.\u201d Kosmos\u2019s social and material patterns complement posthumanism and new materialism, which assert that the world unfolds through human and non-human interactions. I argue that algorithms exhibit agency in arranging kosmos, though their control is circumscribed by human power. \n\nThe project then traces algorithmic agency and power in three platforms: Google search, YouTube, and Facebook. Google\u2019s algorithms are responsible for ordering relevance, ranking the best results at the top of its search pages. Humans \u201cGoogle bomb\u201d to alter algorithmic arrangement, manipulating sites to the top of search results pages for political purposes ranging from defaming Rick Santorum to promoting Holocaust denial. On YouTube, algorithms judge whether content should remain on the site, removing or demonetizing both copyrighted works and \u201coffensive content.\u201d Unfortunately, as LGBTQ+ members of YouTube have found, this algorithmic judgment can damage communities and endanger lives. Finally, on Facebook, algorithms infer racial identity and offer \u201cethnic affinity advertising\u201d that can target individuals perceived to align with racial categories such as \u201cAfrican American\u201d or \u201cHispanic.\u201d Facebook also employs algorithms for moderation, with both machine algorithms and human-executed algorithms searching for hateful and offensive speech. Problematically, Facebook\u2019s inference schemes and moderation practices stunted the growth of #BlackLivesMatter and #Ferguson, and otherwise disproportionately harmed black communities, instead of protecting them from hate speech and discrimination. \n\nThis dissertation traces algorithmic rhetorics through attention to the ethical dynamics of algorithms, to power and discrimination in algorithmic systems, and to the material arrangements of public discourse and performance. Critical attention, public awareness, and swift action can mitigate some of the harms of algorithmic arrangement. This project offers a critical move in developing rhetorical critiques of algorithms by reflecting on the socio-political impacts of algorithmic world-making.

Research on entrepreneurship has traditionally focused on characteristics of the entrepreneur, but as with many other areas of research, there is now a move toward a better understanding of process. Additionally, as we begin to understand just how many factors influence the ultimate success or failure of an entrepreneurial venture, the field is in need of good theory to organize the diverse perspectives. In recent decades, much similarity has been noted between the study of entrepreneurship and leadership, and just as it has made inroads with the more general field leadership study, the three-factor model of leadership, and the CIP (charismatic, ideological, pragmatic) approach to leadership might also be interesting frameworks for sorting out some of the chaos in the research on entrepreneurship. The current study aimed to further our understanding of the relationships between leadership, entrepreneurship, individual differences and gender, as well as the role of followers. This paper describes a study in two parts. A qualitative pilot study consisted of semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs. The qualitative data was used to create an overall picture of the entrepreneurial context, and then as interesting trends began to emerge, qualitative responses were used to inform a second general quantitative portion which was designed to provide a more detailed understanding those trends. Results obtained from the quantitative questionnaire (administered to a larger group of entrepreneur-follower pairs from additional organizations) suggest that relationship-focused behaviors are more strongly tied to venture success than are task and change oriented behaviors. Additionally, the effective application of the CIP leadership approach to entrepreneurship will require improved conceptual development and measurement. Definitions of success and the keys to achieving success varied both by leadership style and individual differences.  Of particular note was the significant difference in the importance of profit/revenue to definitions of success for male and female entrepreneurs. Finally, the role of followers in entrepreneurial ventures appears to be as strong complements to the entrepreneurs themselves; both entrepreneurs and followers highlighted the importance of working with people who complement your own skills and abilities. Future research and practical implications are discussed. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2650], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Johanna Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Johanna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rick R Jacobs", "Rick R Jacobs", "James Lewis Farr", "Sam Hunter", "Charles C Snow", "Stephanie A Shields"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rick R Jacobs, Dissertation Advisor", "Rick R Jacobs, Committee Chair", "James Lewis Farr, Committee Member", "Sam Hunter, Committee Member", "Charles C Snow, Committee Member", "Stephanie A Shields, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["entrepreneurship", "leadership", "gender", "interviews"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "AN EVALUATION OF APPLICATION TIMING AND HERBICIDES TO CONTROL AILANTHUS ALTISSIMA\n\n", "id": "12605", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2864", "abstract_tesi": "Ailanthus (Ailanthus altissima [Mill.] Swingle) has become naturalized across the continental United States.  Along roadside right-of-ways it can be a visual hindrance and road hazard if left untreated.  When mechanically cut by roadside crews this plant sprouts quickly and aggressively from the stump and root system adding to routine maintenance costs.  Previous research has indicated that treating cut stumps with herbicide limits sprouting and that treatment timing may further enhance sprout control.  The focus of my research was to study the control of this tree species by evaluating (1) cut stump and herbicide treatment timing, (2) a series of herbicide modes of action on cut stumps, and (3) basal bark herbicide application timing.  Measurements of surviving growth including root and stump sprouts were used to determine levels of control.  All timing and herbicide treatments were effective in controlling the emerging stump sprouts with cut surface treatments.  Herbicide-treated stumps showed 84 to 99% stump mortality compared to 41 to 52% for cut but untreated stumps.  Root sprout numbers far exceeded the number of originally cut trees for all herbicide and timing treatments.  Basal bark treatment, which is much more economical to perform, provided 100 percent control of treated stems, but resulted in root sprout numbers greater than the number of originally treated trees.  This work increases our understanding on the role of application timing, treatment methods, and herbicide selection on the sprouting response of Ailanthus.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2860], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Jon Maynard", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "Maynard", "first_name_ssi": "Jon", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James C Sellmer", "James C Sellmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James C Sellmer, Thesis Advisor", "James C Sellmer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cut stump", "cut surface", "basal bark", "herbicide treatment timing", "Ailanthus altissima"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE INFLUENCE OF SCHOOL CONNECTEDNESS AND ACADEMIC SELF EFFICACY ON SELF REPORTED NORM RELATED PRO-SOCIAL BEHAVIOR\n\n", "id": "12054", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3416", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study took a strength based approach in exploring school connectedness, academic self-efficacy, personal variables and how they influence a new concept called norm related pro-social behavior (NRPB).

Reproductive technology is an important aspect of our culture to examine sociologically because it intervenes and disrupts what are often taken-for-granted processes. In this project, I focused on gamete donation and the US fertility industry. Although there has been a great deal of public and scholarly discourse on these topics, there is still a lack of empirical insight that I think is needed in order to further discussions on how these technologies are actually being used and some of the implications of these uses. In this project, I address four major research questions that speak to some of the more controversial social and ethical issues raised by the NRTs: 1) How do organizations in the fertility industry help to create and delineate families? 2) Do they facilitate particular definitions of family? 3) Do egg and sperm donors, as men and women involved in analogous reproductive decision-making, have similar control over donating their reproductive cells? 4) What issues are posed by gamete donation in the context of a medical marketplace?  My major research design was based on a content analysis of organizational materials from ART clinics, egg donation agencies, and sperm banks across the US. I chose this approach, as opposed to in-depth interviews with practitioners, in order to gain a more meso-level perspective on the structure and organization of the NRTs. \nTo address the first question, I examine organizational boundary work in creating families out of donors, recipients, and donor-conceived children. I argue that organizations carefully regulate these relationships even as the industry is adopting more open policies. Regarding the second research question, I focus on access to services for lesbian and single women. Although explicit gate keeping is in the past, implicit barriers appear to persist through heteronormative framing of reproductive services. Next I turn to differences between egg and sperm donors in terms of their decision-making autonomy. I find differences in expected partner and family involvement in the donation process, suggesting that egg donors have less control over disposal of their gametes than sperm donors. I argue that this has broader repercussions for women\u2019s bodily and reproductive control. Finally, regarding my fourth question, I examine characteristics associated with two particularly controversial practices in the medical market for human eggs: increasing donor compensation and selective donor recruitment. My results suggest that these practices are influenced by contextual factors, such as local competition, and organizational practices indicative of the increasing commercialization of egg donation. Notably, industry self-regulation does not appear to deter ethically questionable practices.\nOverall, I stress the need to analyze \u2018on the ground\u2019 practices in order to provide a clearer agenda for possible regulation as well as the need for feminist and other scholarly attention to this vast and growing medical industry. \n  ", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3496], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Katherine ", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Johnson", "Francis Dodoo", "Michael Paul Johnson", "Chloe Silverman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "Francis Dodoo, Committee Member", "Michael Paul Johnson, Committee Member", "Chloe Silverman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gamete donation", "postmodern families", "reproduction", "sociology", "gender", "feminist research", "medical markets"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "\"Finding yourself in a foreign country\":  The Subjective Learning Experiences of Students in an Embedded Short-Term Study Abroad Program", "id": "13956kmj191", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13956", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the subjective learning experiences of students on an embedded short-term study abroad program.

They cast changes in proportional reasoning as transitions or \u201cshifts\u201d in students\u2019 thinking and these shifts can serve as tools to \u201cevaluate [a] student\u2019s current thinking\u201d (p. 61).  Lobato and Ellis (2010) suggested that one needs to make the following transitions or shifts in his or her thinking in order to develop proportional reasoning:  (1) from reasoning with one quantity to reasoning with two quantities, (2) from reasoning additively to reasoning multiplicatively, (3) from reasoning with composed-units to reasoning with multiplicative comparisons, and (4) from iterating a composed unit to reasoning with a set of infinitely many equivalent ratios. \nTwenty-five pre-service teachers, who were either elementary education majors or secondary mathematics education majors, completed a questionnaire consisting of problems that were meant to elicit the four shifts identified in the model.  Based on the questionnaire responses, these twenty-five were placed into four groups.  Eleven of these pre-service teachers (2 from Group 1, 3 from Group 2, 3 from Group 3 and 3 from Group 3) were then interviewed to examine how their reasoning related to the shift model.  \nThe analysis of the data suggests that model was hierarchical for those in Group 1 (participants who seemed to exhibit all four shifts) and Group 4 (participants who only provided evidence of shift 1). For those in Groups 2 and 3, the model did not appear to remain hierarchical given that the participants in these groups seem to inconsistently exhibit characteristics of the shifts.  This means that when solving some proportional problems they would provide evidence of making all four shifts and on other problems they would revert back to evidence of making shifts 2,3, and 4.  Groups 2 and 3\u2019s reasoning was inconsistent with the shifts because they were in the process of making the transitions as they learned to be proportional reasoners.  \n\tThe findings in this study provide teacher educators with knowledge about the nature of pre-service teachers\u2019 proportional reasoning.   In particular, this study highlights four assumptions and misconceptions about proportional reasoning seem necessary for pre-service teachers to transform.  These four assumptions include:  reasoning quantitatively, recognizing ratios as measurement, misconceptions about the concept of ratio and fraction, and the obstacle of linearity.  Mezirow\u2019s theory requires a disorienting dilemma in order to help individuals engage in rational discourse and critical reflection about previous assumptions.  This study illustrates how four problems (Lemon/Lime problem, Dog/Cat problem, Housing problem and Track problem) were able to provide pre-service with a disorienting dilemma causing them to engage in rational discourse with the researcher and critically reflect on their previous assumptions in order to revise their strategies for solving these problems.  By helping these pre-service teachers become aware of the assumptions they have about ratio, proportion and proportional reasoning through these disorienting dilemmas (i.e., thought-provoking problem solving tasks) they were able to think about proportional problems in new ways and make shifts in their proportional reasoning. This knowledge can be used to develop courses that can transform pre-service teachers\u2019 understandings of ratio and proportion and enhance their proportional reasoning so that future teachers can ultimately improve their students\u2019 learning.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8791], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Kim Helene", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "Helene", "first_name_ssi": "Kim", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rose Mary Zbiek", "Andrea Vujan Mccloskey", "Mary Kathleen Heid", "Nona Ann Prestine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rose Mary Zbiek, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrea Vujan Mccloskey, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Kathleen Heid, Committee Member", "Nona Ann Prestine, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["proportional reasoning", "pre-service teachers", "ratio", "problem solving"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Haunted Democracies and the Politics of Possibility: A Deconstructive Analysis of Truth Commissions\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "6904", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3815", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study is a deconstructive analysis of the contemporary political innovation known as the \u201ctruth commission.\u201d  As such, it has a two-fold aim: first, to demonstrate the relevance and force of deconstruction for political analysis through an explication of key concepts and insights in the work of Jacques Derrida and, second, to reinforce this interpretive claim by applying deconstructive analysis to the study of contemporary truth commissions.  With regard to the first aim, I argue that political concerns are evident in Derrida\u2019s entire corpus, from his earliest work in Of Grammatology, Writing and Difference and Margins of Philosophy, through his later (more explicitly ethical and political) work in Specters of Marx, The Politics of Friendship, Monolingualism of the Other and Rogues.  Using three dominant deconstructive tropes\u2014autoimmunity, the aporia, and specters/ghosts (or the critique of the metaphysics of presence)\u2014I show the implicit consonance between the philosophical methodology of deconstruction and the theory and practice of democracy.  This consonance is further elaborated in my analysis of two key concepts employed by truth commissions (most especially, the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission)\u2014truth and forgiveness/reconciliation.  I argue that not only is deconstruction helpful for understanding the work of truth commissions, but that the work of truth commissions is helpful in concretizing and making real the implications of deconstruction.  Using the examples of recent political transitions (in Argentina, Chile and South Africa, among others), I characterize these transitional polities as \u201chaunted democracies\u201d attempting to reckon with the memory of gross violations of human rights.  Their attempts to do so in the form of a truth commission, I contend, offers historical evidence of what I call the \u201cpolitics of possibility,\u201d that is, the attempt to rethink and refigure democracy as something that is pursued, rather than achieved.  In the end, I address the important relationship between memory and the future (or what Derrida calls the a venir) for emergent or extant democracies\u2014a relationship, I argue, which is essential to understanding both the full implications of deconstruction and the possibility for successfully executing the truth commission form.  \n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3792], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Leigh M.", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Leigh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Shannon Sullivan", "John Philip Christman", "Vincent M Colapietro", "Dr Paul Tiyambe Zeleza", "Dr John Caputo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Shannon Sullivan, Committee Chair", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Member", "Dr Paul Tiyambe Zeleza, Committee Member", "Dr John Caputo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rogues", "metaphysics of presence", "democracy to come", "hospitality", "Emmanuel Levinas", "Soren Kierkegaard", "Chile", "Uganda", "Argentina", "deconstruction", "specters", "postcolonial", "truth commissions", "apartheid", "South Africa", "South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission", "Jacques Derrida", "democracy", "reconciliation", "forgiveness", "transitional justice", "autoimmunity", "Desmond Tutu", "aporia", "Politics of Friendship", "The Gift of Death"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Course of Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms from Early to Middle Adolescence:\nthe Roles of Parent-youth Relationships and Youth Gender\n", "id": "14499", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7226", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rates of depression begin to rise markedly in early adolescence and are often accompanied by anxiety.

To better understand these phenomena the aims of the current study were three-fold:  1) to examine the developmental patterns of symptoms of depression and anxiety from early to middle adolescence in a community sample, 2) to examine the role of gender as a predictor of the level and growth of depression and anxiety symptoms, and 3) to examine parenting and parent\u2019s own depression and anxiety as predictors of the level and growth of youth depressive and anxiety symptoms. Parenting factors included Warmth/Support, Anger/Conflict, and General Child Management Additionally, associations between change in parenting and change in symptoms were examined. The sample consisted of 808 7th graders from 28 rural communities in Iowa and Pennsylvania that were part of the PROSPER Project. Families participated in yearly home visits with youth, mothers (n=787), and fathers (n=556) reporting on their own symptoms as well as the quality of parenting.  Growth curve analyses indicated an increase in depressive symptoms over time for females and a small decrease for males; anxiety symptoms increased notably for girls and slightly for boys over the three-year period. Overall, the findings indicate several general patterns:  a) there were more significant findings for maternal parenting than paternal parenting, suggesting that relationships with mothers may be more salient than relationships with fathers to youth internalizing symptoms; b) when found, gender differences suggested greater salience of parenting to internalizing symptoms for girls than for boys and c) of the three parenting constructs, Anger/Conflict emerged as the most relevant, followed by General Child Management and Warmth/Support.

Though a few studies have used the CCRT as a measure for coding countertransference manifestations, most have used the CCRT as a means to an end (to examine therapist attachment, to compare therapist reactions to patients with different diagnoses, etc.) and none have held validating the CCRT as a viable countertransference coding method as their central focus. Thus, this study sought to answer three central research questions: First, can the CCRT coding system be used to identify a therapist\u2019s countertransference template? Second, once extracted, will a therapist\u2019s CCRT become evident throughout the course of therapy? Third, in regard to Gelso and Hayes\u2019 (2007) integrative definition of countertransference, will a therapist\u2019s CCRT only be activated with certain types of clients who provide an activating unresolved conflictual issue stemming from the therapist\u2019s past and/or a therapy related event that provoked a countertransference manifestation? Results suggested that using the traditional RAP interview to extract the therapist\u2019s transference template worked regarding the therapist\u2019s transference template, but the form that the CCRT took during 14 audio-recorded therapy sessions was extremely limited and perhaps more socially acceptable, given the therapeutic context, than those seen in more intimate relationships. This finding could support Freud\u2019s premise that transference templates manifest \u201cwith respect to the individual\u2019s external circumstances, and the nature of what the available love objects will sanction\u201d (1912/1958a p. 312-313). Additional results suggested that partial expressions of the CCRT may become active during the therapeutic session, specifically wishes (W) and responses to self (RS). Finally, the identification of origins, or unresolved conflictual issues was possible through the utilization of the CCRT coding method expressed in the manner of wishes (Ws), but there was little evidence that the identification of therapy related events that \u201ctriggered\u201d countertransference manifestations, in the form of responses from others (ROs), were expressed or captured using the method. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10897], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Matt Christian", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "Christian", "first_name_ssi": "Matt", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counseling Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Hayes", "Kathleen Bieschke", "Louis Georges Castonguay", "Joyce Karen Illfelder Kaye"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Hayes, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathleen Bieschke, Committee Chair", "Louis Georges Castonguay, Committee Member", "Joyce Karen Illfelder Kaye, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Countertransference", "CCRT", "Core Conflictual Relationship Theme", "Transference", "Coding", "Therapist Reactions"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Failure is an option: Reactions to failure in elementary engineering design projects", "id": "28775", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12291", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent reform documents in science education have called for teachers to use epistemic practices of science and engineering researchers to teach disciplinary content (NRC, 2007; NRC, 2012; NGSS Lead States, 2013).

While framers of the Next Generation Science Standards (NRC, 2012; NGSS Lead States 2013) focused on the similarities of the practices of science researchers and engineering designers, some have proposed that engineering has a unique set of epistemic practices, including improving from failure (Cunningham & Carlsen, 2014; Cunningham & Kelly, in review). While no one will deny failures occur in science, failure in engineering is thought of in fundamentally different ways. In the study presented here, video data from eight classes of elementary students engaged in one of two civil engineering units were analyzed using methods borrowed from psychology, anthropology, and sociolinguistics to investigate: 1) the nature of failure in elementary engineering design; 2) the ways in which teachers react to failure; and 3) how the collective actions of students and teachers support or constrain improvement in engineering design. I propose new ways of considering the types and causes of failure, and note three teacher reactions to failure: the manager, the cheerleader, and the strategic partner. Because the goal of iteration in engineering is improvement, I also studied improvement. Students only systematically improve when they have the opportunity, productive strategies, and fair comparisons between prototypes.

The continuum perspective suggests that the spatial and temporal variability of atmospheric teleconnection patterns occur through the changes in the frequency distribution within the continuum of these patterns.  This dissertation demonstrates that two similar methods, self-organizing map (SOM) analysis and k-means clustering combined with linear unidimensional scaling (LUS), provide an attractive framework for this perspective because each method provides a visualization of the continuum in a spatially ordered manner.  \n\nA SOM analysis of daily, wintertime Northern Hemisphere sea level pressure (SLP) reveals that the interdecadal variability of the NAO arises from changes in the frequency distribution of the NAO-like SOM patterns within the NAO continuum.  In particular, this analysis shows that the secular, eastward shift of the NAO that began in the 1970s may be understood as arising from a change in dominance from westward-displaced, negative NAO-like patterns to eastward-displaced, positive NAO-like patterns, although westward- and eastward-displaced NAO-like patterns existed during all time periods and for both phases.  \n\t\nThe application of k-means clustering with LUS to North Pacific SLP reveals that the intraseasonal, interannual, and interdecadal variability of the PNA similarly arises from changes in the frequency of the cluster patterns that compose the PNA continuum, each of which has a timescale of about 10 days.    A SOM analysis of coupled SLP and outgoing longwave radiation data shows that many of these patterns are associated with convection in the tropical Indo-Pacific region. On intraseasonal timescales, the frequency distribution of the North Pacific SLP patterns, in particular the PNA-like patterns, is influenced strongly by the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).  On interannual timescales, the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impacts the North Pacific continuum, with warm ENSO episodes resulting in the increased frequency of easterly displaced Aleutian low pressure anomaly patterns, and cold ENSO episodes resulting in the increased frequency of southerly displaced Aleutian high pressure anomaly patterns. In addition, the results of this analysis suggest that the interdecadal variability of the North Pacific SLP field, including the well known \u201cregime shift\u201d of 1976/77, also results from changes in the frequency distribution within the continuum of SLP patterns.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4600], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Nathaniel Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Nathaniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Johannes Verlinde", "Johannes Verlinde", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux", "Steven B Feldstein", "Jerry Y Harrington", "David Pollard", "Hampton Nelson Shirer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Johannes Verlinde, Dissertation Advisor", "Johannes Verlinde, Committee Chair", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Committee Member", "Steven B Feldstein, Committee Member", "Jerry Y Harrington, Committee Member", "David Pollard, Committee Member", "Hampton Nelson Shirer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pacific/North American pattern", "North Atlantic Oscillation", "continuum perspective", "self-organizing maps", "teleconnection patterns", "linear unidimensional scaling"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A Survey of Rural Hospitals' Perspectives on Health Information Technology Outsourcing", "id": "22625", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10464", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two rounds of surveys of rural hospitals were conducted in order to better understand their perspectives on health information technology (HIT) outsourcing and the role that hospital-to-hospital HIT partnerships (HHPs) can play as an outsourcing mechanism.

To date, there has been relatively little work studying how strain might be used to modify these common phase transitions, especially in materials with complex tilt systems. This work aims to gain a fundamental understanding of the relationship between tilt and strain.\n   The first objective of this dissertation was to obtain structural details on relaxed epitaxial Ag(TaxNb1-x)O3 (ATN) films. These results provided a baseline for measurements on strained films. Ag(Ta0.5Nb0.5)O3 films grown on (001) oriented SrRuO3/LaAlO3 and LaAlO3 substrates were characterized by electron diffraction and high resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was found that the ATN films exhibited octahedral rotations characteristic of the Pbcm space group, similar to those seen in bulk materials; however, the temperature of the M3-M2 phase transition was suppressed by ~250 K due to the fact that the correlation length for rotations about cpc was significantly reduced (pc = pseudo-cubic). The average off-center B-cation displacements, which signify the degree of long-range order for these local cation positions, were negligibly small compared to bulk materials, as inferred from the near-zero intensity of the \u00bc(00L)-type reflections. On cooling, pronounced ordering of B-cation displacements occurred at ~60 K, which is significantly below bulk (~310 K). The onset of this ordering coincides with a broad maximum in relative permittivity as a function of temperature.  It is believed that point and planar defects in thin ATN films disrupt the complex sequence of in-phase and anti-phase rotations around cpc, thereby reducing the effective strength of interactions between the tilting and cation displacements. \n   The second objective was to perform structural studies on compressively strained Ag(Ta0.5Nb0.5)O3 films. Phase transitions in coherent Ag(Ta0.5Nb0.5)O3 films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates were characterized by high resolution X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The compressively strained films were found to undergo the same phase transition sequence as bulk materials: cubic (C) &#8596; tetragonal (T) &#8596; orthorhombic (O) &#8596; orthorhombic (M3). However, the biaxial in-plane strain stabilized the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases, expanding these phase fields by a total of ~280 \u00b0C. The compressive strain state also favors domain states in which the c-axis is directed out-of-plane. Consequently, unit cell quadrupling in the M3 phase and the in-phase tilt of the T phase both occur around the out-of-plane direction. In contrast, bulk materials and relaxed films are poly-domain, with the complex tilt system occurring along all three of the orthogonal axes. Compressively strained films are in the M3 phase at room temperature rather than in the M2 phase as is observed in bulk. These results demonstrate unambiguously that strain engineering in systems with complex tilt sequences such as Ag(Ta0.5Nb0.5)O3 is feasible and open up the possibility of modifying properties by manipulation of the pertinent octahedral tilt transition temperature in a wide range of functional ceramics.\n   The third objective was to examine coherent Ag(Ta0.5Nb0.5)O3 films under tensile strain that had been deposited on (Ba0.4Sr0.6)TiO3/LaAlO3 (001) and KTaO3 substrates. Unlike the poly-domain nature of bulk materials or relaxed films, these films exhibited a domain structure with the c-axis aligned primarily along the in-plane axes. In addition, it is believed that the tilt angle of the oxygen octahedra was significantly reduced, as was evidenced by the weaker superlattice reflection intensity. It was determined that films under tensile strain undergo the same phase transition sequence as bulk materials and other thin films. Similar to films under compressive strain, an expansion of the tetragonal and orthorhombic phase fields was observed in ATN/(Ba0.4Sr0.6)TiO3/LaAlO3 due to the closer lattice match between the film and the pseudosubstrate in these temperature regimes. These films under tensile strain showed T and O phase fields that were collectively ~ 270 \u00b0C wider than that of bulk materials. In addition, it was found that the films were in the M3 phase at room temperature rather than M2 observed in bulk. This work demonstrates that, in addition to compressive strain, tensile strain can be used to strain engineer materials with complex tilt systems and complicated phase transition sequences.      \n   The fourth objective was to develop a measurement technique for the \u201croto\u201d-electric effect and then test AbNbO3 as a candidate rotoelectric. In perovskite materials, the tilting of the oxygen octahedra can lead to new symmetries that include such rotations. This, in turn, can introduce new properties related to these symmetries. For example, in the \u201croto\u201d-electric effect the rotation of the oxygen octahedra is altered by an applied electric field. An experiment was developed to test this relationship using AgNbO3 as a model system. The intensity of superlattice reflections were measured at the Advanced Photon Source as a function of electric field for a pure AgNbO3 single crystal, a (Ag0.95Li0.05)NbO3 single crystal, and an AgNbO3 thin film. Model calculations demonstrated that if the tilt angle was modified by the electric field, a change in superlattice peak intensity should have been observed. However, in the samples tested, no change was observed, suggesting that the octahedra in AgNbO3 do not undergo a substantial change in tilt as a function of electric field. This experiment provides a foundation for similar measurements on other material systems.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5220], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Raegan ", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Raegan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Susan Trolier Mc Kinstry", "Leslie Eric Cross", "Clive A Randall", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Ian Reaney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Susan Trolier Mc Kinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Chair", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Ian Reaney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dielectrics", "thin film", "octahedral tilting", "perovskite"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Efficacy of Fe3O4 Nanoparticles as a Robust and Effective Alternative to Gold Nanoparticles as Photothermal Agents to Drive High-Barrier Reactions", "id": "13588rjj159", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13588", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The photothermal effect of gold which depends on the excitation of the surface plasmon has recently become an exciting area of research.

This leads to the inability to conduct systematic studies which depend on surfactant identity or size effect. However, Fe3O4 nanoparticles have been shown to exhibit a photothermal effect and offer an attractive alternative to gold nanoparticles.  Within this thesis, I show that Fe3O4 nanoparticles are able to drive the high-barrier decomposition reaction of poly(propylene carbonate), near the efficiently as gold nanoparticles.

It was also essential to statistically determine the reliability of alternative tests as compared to current ASTM testing methods. Biodiesel quality assurance is a major cost issue for many small scale producers, while being a major concern for engine manufacturers. The critical tests for biodiesel fuel quality, defined by BQ-9000, were deemed the most necessary to develop alternative testing methods which would benefit the biodiesel industry as a whole. \n\nThe commercial analytical methods evaluated in this study include QTA, i-Spec and the pHLip test. In addition, methods based on spectrophotometry, dielectric spectroscopy and ultrasonic velocity were developed and explored as potential methods for assessing biodiesel quality. Of all the tests evaluated, most had the potential of acting as a firewall against poor biodiesel quality fuel, but none were found to be capable of predicting whether the fuel would meet ASTM specification consistently.  While the QTA FT-IR rapid testing unit can measure most of the critical parameters designated by BQ-9000, it was found that results for key biodiesel quality parameters did not adequately reproduce ASTM results. Yet, the QTA shows promise for potentially carrying out nearly full-range biodiesel analysis in one test. The other commercial apparatus, the i-SPEC Q-100, showed highly insignificant results overall. While the test claims to have high potential, there were no valid results which indicated so. The spectrophotometer test for total glycerin was found to have mediocre results but has the potential to be a highly inexpensive method to produce reliable results.  Dielectric spectroscopy measurements of biodiesel did not establish usable trends, but set the foundation for carrying out experiments in-situ for the monitoring of biodiesel either in the facility or as a standalone method for total glycerin, methanol and free glycerol. The ultrasonic velocity measurements provided potentially accurate data for monitoring the biodiesel reaction, but may be limited by being very feedstock dependent. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5072], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Ryan A.", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Joseph Manuel Perez Sr.", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Matthew Kropf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor", "Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor", "Joseph Manuel Perez Sr., Thesis Advisor", "Sarma V Pisupati, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew Kropf, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["biodiesel", "analytical", "quality", "alternative fuel"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Design and Testing of a Small, Semi-span, Prop-rotor Model for Whirl Flutter Stability", "id": "21714", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8452", "abstract_tesi": "Modern tiltrotor aircraft are capable of e\u000ecient hover as well as high-speed forward\n\night.

The impacts of these land uses were profound, and identifiable in historic records.  In this study, vegetation and soil characteristics from archaeological sites and off-site areas were quantified on three United States Department of Defense installations and one protected archaeological site in the eastern U.S. to determine if this legacy of Native American land uses exists on present day landscapes.  \n     Vegetative indicator species were identified through ethnobotanical literature review to determine which species were highly important in the diet and life of Native American groups of interest.  This research defined two major vegetation indicators, white oak (Quercus alba L.) at MCB Quantico, Virginia and the oak-pine-blueberry (Quercus-Pinus-Vaccinium) association of a sandy glacial outwash moraine at Fort Drum, New York.  At both of these installations, forested archaeological sites were shown to be distinctly more open (decreased trees per acre) than off-site plots.  Soil charcoal, while showing higher incidence on archaeological sites than on off-site areas, was fairly abundant across all surveyed areas, possibly indicating the influence of widespread Native American burning.\n     This research also suggests that Native Americans may have had an influence on soil characteristics in areas with intensive habitation and inherently low fertility soils.  At Fort Drum archaeological sites presently have soils that display darker color and higher over-all fertility. Native American influences were less discernible at study sites that exist along waterways.  This may be due to their inherently more fertile soils, which would not require amendments to facilitate agriculture, or increased importance of fresh or brackish water resources, decreasing the need for intensive agriculture.\n     Present-day vegetation and soils associated with Late Woodland and Mississippian archaeological sites show different overall trends, influenced by settlement patterns, available resources, and baseline soil fertility.

Abbreviated atATAD for atmospheric air thermophilic aerobic digestion, the process represents a paradigm shift in sludge treatment from batch to continuous processing that utilizes a multi-stage countercurrent setup to achieve pasteurization temperatures within prescribed residence time. Beyond validating the patent\u2019s concept, atATAD was accomplished with less than half the patents\u2019 modeled solids content (4-5%). Intensive real-time data collection and post-run sample processing using CHN analysis and bomb calorimetry were used to begin definition of the parameters for a dynamic model. Specifically, a single-stage proxy for the full multi-stage countercurrent system was run as a batch reaction in an attempt to establish the mass and energy balances; the batch runs reached pasteurization temperatures but did not close the mass and energy balance. This initial success of reaching thermophilic temperatures motivated a pilot-scale (1650 gallons) continuous phase reaction with 4-day residence time. This comprehensive pilot-scale demonstration conducted on-site at the local wastewater treatment authority, included far more extensive data sets and verified the use of air and countercurrent flow to yield pasteurization conditions. The goal of biohazard reduction from pasteurization temperatures exceeding 50 \uf0b0C through aerobic consumption of solids is met. \nThe rapid transition to a real-world pilot implementation introduced significant operational constraints that prevented steady operation.

These concepts are simple and are composed of bistable devices that act as coupling structures between an actuator and the rotor blade.   Bistable or \u201csnap-through\u201d mechanisms have two stable equilibrium states and are a novel way to achieve large actuation output stroke at relatively modest effort for gross rotor morphing applications.  This is because in addition to the large actuation stroke associated with the snap-through (relative to conventional actuator/ amplification systems) coming at relatively low actuation effort, no locking is required in either equilibrium state (since they are both stable).  The first concept that is presented in this dissertation is a that is composed of a bistable twisting device that twists the tip of helicopter rotor blades.  This work examines the performance of the presented bistable twisting device for rotor morphing, specifically, blade tip twist under an aerodynamic lift load.  The device is analyzed using finite element analysis to predict its load carrying capability and bistable behavior.  \nThe second concept that is presented is a concept that is composed of a bistable arch for rotor blade chord extension.   The bistable arch is coupled to a thin flat plate that is supported by rollers.  Increasing the chord of the rotor blade is expected to generate more lift-load and improve helicopter performance.  In this work, a methodology is presented to design the bistable arches for chord morphing using the finite element analysis and pseudo-rigid body model method.  This work also examines the effect of different arches, arch hinge size and shape, inertial loads and rigidity on arch performance.  Finally, this work shows results from an experiment that was conducted to validate the developed numerical model and demonstrates how the arch can be actuated using a Nitinol Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wire to extend the chord of a helicopter rotor blade.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6158], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Terrence ", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Terrence", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi", "Farhan Gandhi", "Mary I Frecker", "Edward A Smith", "Eric M Mockensturm"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi, Dissertation Advisor", "Farhan Gandhi, Committee Chair", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Chair", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bistable", "morphing", "rotor blades"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "SCALING CLIFFS AND CROSSING CHASMS: UNPACKING THE MICRO-PROCESSES OF INCLUSION THROUGH THE LENS OF AUTISM JOB COACHES", "id": "q524jn76v", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12979", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this two essay dissertation, I explore the challenges faced by organizations trying to create inclusive workplaces by addressing two sets of questions involved in the important process of \u2018building bridges\u2019 between different groups:  1) the process of \u2013 and challenges associated with- bringing together members of marginalized and dominant groups in the workplace; 2) how organizations select and socialize individuals to engage in the process of bringing these two groups together.

Despite a growing body of research on such collaboration, considerable gaps remain in our understanding of how teachers make collective decisions that affect their instruction and\nassessment of students. In particular, relatively little is known about how group members use the\nresources of talk-in-interaction to reach collective decisions or make their social and cultural backgrounds relevant to their deliberations. The present study addresses these gaps in the literature by adopting the theory and methods of conversation analysis to create a fine-grained analysis of spoken interaction among a group of instructors at a Chinese university\u2019s English language program. By analyzing two transcribed episodes drawn from the group\u2019s face-to-face meetings, the study highlights a range of interactional resources members employed in the accomplishment of group decisions. In the first episode, members use resources that express\ndisagreement while working to limit direct expressions of conflict among members, while in the second episode, members used person-reference resources to frame divergent positions alternately in cultural or personal terms. An implication of both analyses is that teachers making collective decisions have both the incentive to disagree with each other and the interactional resources allowing them to pursue disagreement without destroying group cohesion. The study and its findings helps outline ways in which attention to the phenomenological details of talk-in-interaction can be used by teachers, administrators, and teacher educators to create more effective forms of collaboration among pre- and in-service instructors.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1579], "author_name_tesi": "Johnston, Duff ", "last_name_ssi": "Johnston", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Duff", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kelly M Hall", "Joan Kelly Hall", "Karen E Johnson", "Athelstan Canagarajah", "Steve L Thorne", "Xiaoye You"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kelly M Hall, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan Kelly Hall, Committee Chair", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Member", "Athelstan Canagarajah, Committee Member", "Steve L Thorne, Committee Member", "Xiaoye You, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["conversation analysis", "English as a foreign language education", "organizational decision making", "teacher collaboration", "Chinese higher education"]}, {"year_isi": 2000, "title_ssi": "Illusory Correlation in Children: Cognitive and Motivational Biases in Group Impression Formation", "id": "5814", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3391", "defended_at_dtsi": "2000-03-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite the ubiquity and sometimes devastating consequences of stereotyping, we know little about the origins and development of these processes.   The current research examined one way in which false stereotypes about minority groups may be developed, which is called illusory correlation.  Research with adults has shown that when people are told about behaviors associated with majority and minority social groups where no relationship between social group and behavior exists, people overestimate the number of infrequent (usually negative) behaviors associated with the minority group.  Thus, they form an illusory correlation between group membership and behaviors.  This effect appears to be due to the enhanced salience of infrequently-occurring information, which is remembered better and therefore estimated to occur more frequently than less salient information.  Furthermore, the minority group is evaluated relatively more negatively or positively than the majority group based on the perceived correlation between group membership and behaviors.  When participants are members of one of the groups, people further exaggerate the illusory correlation such that their own group is more strongly associated with positive characteristics. \n      \nThe current research examined whether illusory correlation occurs in second- and fifth-grade children, and whether there are developmental changes in illusory correlation formation.  Study 1 investigated illusory correlation formation in the absence of self-involvement in the target groups using a minimal groups paradigm.  Children were presented with pictorially represented behaviors of a majority and minority group.  The majority group consisted of 12 target children, and the minority group consisted of 6 target children.  Participants completed attributions of each behavior to a group, a frequency estimation task in which they indicated the number of members of each group who performed the infrequent class of behaviors, and evaluations of the two groups.  Children were assigned to either a Negative Behavior-Infrequent condition, in which negative behaviors were less frequent than positive behaviors, or a Positive-Infrequent condition, in which positive behaviors were less frequent.  If infrequent behaviors associated with the minority group become more salient, children should overestimate the frequency with which the behaviors occur in the minority group.  Thus, children should form an illusory correlation between the minority group and infrequent behaviors.  Results showed that children overestimated the proportion of infrequent behaviors in the minority group, regardless of whether the infrequent behaviors were negative or positive.  Children in the Positive-Infrequent condition also evaluated the minority group more positively than the majority group, consistent with their estimations of a larger proportion of positive behaviors in the minority group.  Children in the Negative-Infrequent condition did not evaluate the groups differently, despite the fact that they estimated more negative behaviors in the minority group than the majority group.  However, children's illusory correlations predicted differences in evaluations of the majority and minority groups for the Negative-Infrequent and Positive-Infrequent conditions, indicating that group evaluations were based to some extent on the illusory correlations children formed.  There were few age differences.  Thus, Study 1 suggests that children do show an information processing bias that leads to illusory correlations between a minority group and infrequent behaviors.    \n  \nStudy 2 investigated the relative influence of self-involvement in the minority or majority group and information processing biases using a minimal groups paradigm.  Children were told that they were members of either a majority or minority group, and their group perceptions were measured as in Study 1.   Results indicated that children overestimated the proportion of negative behaviors in the minority group, and this trend was the same for children assigned to the majority group and minority group.  On the group evaluations, however, children rated their own group more positively than the other group.  Illusory correlations also predicted differences in evaluations of the majority and minority groups, indicating that perceiving an association between the minority group and negative behaviors moderated the relative evaluations of the groups. \n \nStudy 3 explored these relative influences using real social stimulus groups of girls and boys.  Results were the same as in Study 2, with one exception.  Fifth-graders in the majority group did not evaluate the groups differently, whereas second-graders in the majority group, and second- and fifth-graders in the minority group evaluated the ingroup more favorably than the outgroup.  These results suggest that children are indeed susceptible to illusory correlations, and that there are few consistent age effects.  Furthermore, ingroup favoritism motivations are not sufficient to prevent minority group members from perceiving an illusory correlation between their own group and negative behaviors, although minority group children did evaluate the ingroup more favorably.  Again, however, differences in evaluations of the majority and minority groups were predicted by children's illusory correlations.  These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for stereotype formation, minority children's group perceptions, and strategies for counteracting illusory correlation effects. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3379], "author_name_tesi": "Johnston, Kristen E.", "last_name_ssi": "Johnston", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Kristen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janis Jacobs", "Kelly Madole", "Janet Swim", "Jeffrey Glenn Parker", "Susan Mc Hale"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janis Jacobs, Committee Chair", "Kelly Madole, Committee Chair", "Janet Swim, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Glenn Parker, Committee Member", "Susan Mc Hale, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["illusory correlation", "social judgment", "judgment biases", "stereotypes", "minorities"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The role of poroelasticity during disequilibrium compaction and hydrocarbon generation on horizontal stress in the Devonian section of the Appalachian Basin", "id": "23755", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10793", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A borehole in McKean County, Pennsylvania, provides input information on detailed stress measurements; this is added to previous data from three boreholes near South Canisteo, New York (Evans et al., 1989a).

A discontinuity at the base of the Rhinestreet Shale separates an upper package of rocks with a high stress gradient, from a lower package with a low stress gradient.  To explain the stress discontinuity I explore the palaeo-overpressure drainage hypothesis proposed by Evans et al., 1989b, in the light of the new data and 1D basin modeling.  Both modeling and in-situ stress measurements support a four-step stress evolution for the lower package:\n1.\tSedimentation rates in the late Devonian/early Mississippian must have been high enough to cause disequilibrium compaction;\n2.\tCementation and lithification must have occurred while the lower section was overpressured to maintain under-compaction below the base-Rhinestreet Shale;\n3.\tAt the time of maximum hydrocarbon generation, cracking of oil to natural gas must have generated a pore fluid volume increase (Tian et al., 2008).  The fluid volume increase would have supplemented the initial compaction-related overpressure; and finally\n4.\tThe pore pressure must have bled off during erosional unroofing from 270 Ma to present.  Pore pressure reduction then must cause a decrease of Shmin due to poroelastic relaxation.\n\nA plot of stress versus depth shows close agreement between observed data and model runs in the four boreholes.  Where the data and model runs do not match perfectly, the separation of the upper, high stress package; and lower, low stress package is still corroborated.  Therefore the palaeo-overpressure drainage hypothesis is further supported with this work.\n\nExtrapolating these local, well-scale models through reservoir-scale, to the basin-scale for the Appalachian Basin could allow better prediction of in-situ stress magnitudes.  Furthermore, the Appalachian Basin four-step stress evolution may be a model for other gas shales in the world, and thereby lead to a better understanding of in-situ stress for gas shales.

Of interest here are electrons in two dimensions placed in a strong perpendicular magnetic field, which exhibit fascinating transport phenomenon called fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). The FQHE has been successfully explained by Composite-Fermion (CF) theory. <br /><br />\n\nElectrons at the edge of a FQHE state behave as a <em> chiral</em> (unidirectional) one dimensional system of strongly interacting particles, and constitute an example of a class of liquids known as the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs).  The theory of TLL is based on a bosonization formalism which exploits a bijective mapping between the fermionic and the bosonic Fock spaces in one dimension. Attempts to describe the FQHE edge through bosonization have had limited success. One such approach, pioneered by X. G. Wen in the early 1990s,  predicted certain  topological exponents in the electron correlation functions. However, measurement of these exponents showed significant  discrepancy with theory, which has been a puzzle for the quantum Hall community for more than a decade, and has served as the motivation for the work performed in the thesis. More specifically, the following issues were investigated:<br /><br />\n\n\n1. <b> Role of the range of interaction </b>: We have studied the edge excitations and certain matrix elements of electron operator, called spectral weights, for the physical Coulomb interaction as well as for a model short range interaction. We use various methods, such as quantum Monte-Carlo, exact diagonalization and the CF approach, which enables us to study large systems and obtain accurate thermodynamic limits. We find that Wen's effective field theory predictions agree with numerical results for short range interactions, but not for Coulomb interactions.<br /><br />\n\n\n2. <b> Validity of CF approach for the FQHE edge </b>:  We have found a close agreement between the edge spectrum predicted by the CF theory  and the exact edge spectrum (as determined by diagonalization) for the <i>&#957;=1/3</i> FQHE state. \n<br /><br />\n\n3.<b> Edge reconstruction</b>: When certain parameters of the FQHE system, such as the setback distance <i>d</i> between the electron sheet and the background charge, are varied,  the competition between electron-electron and the electron-background interaction causes edge reconstruction. We study this physics through the use of the  Composite-Fermion diagonalization (CFD) technique and find, consistent with  previous numerical studies, that edge reconstruction occurs beyond a critical setback distance d>d<sub>c</sub>.  To accommodate counter propagating boson modes that result from edge reconstruction, we have constructed an effective field theory model with three coupled chiral Luttinger liquids to make predictions for a reconstructed edge.<br /><br />\n\n\n4.<b> Nonlinearity of spectra </b>:  We obtain the thermodynamic dispersion of the edge modes from the CF theory and find that it deviates from linearity in the experimentally measurable energy range, and also exhibits an `edge magnetoroton' structure in the dispersion relation. We have calculated a transport exponent using the calculated dispersion and find that it is surprisingly insensitive to the nonlinearity as well as to the presence of the edge roton. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5472], "author_name_tesi": "Jolad, Shivakumar ", "last_name_ssi": "Jolad", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shivakumar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain", "Jainendra Jain", "Richard Wallace Robinett", "Kenneth O Hara", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain, Dissertation Advisor", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Chair", "Richard Wallace Robinett, Committee Member", "Kenneth O Hara, Committee Member", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["composite Fermions", "emergent behavior", "quantum Hall effect", "condensed matter physics", "quantum Monte-Carlo", "Low dimensional physics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A sensitivity-based approach to optimize the surface treatment of a low-height tramway noise barrier", "id": "18886", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8878", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Transportation noise has become a main nuisance in urban areas, in the industrialized world and across the world, to the point that according to the World Health Organization 65% of the European population is exposed to excessive noise and 20% to night-time levels that may harm their health.

Tramway noise barriers are especially studied since the noise sources are in this case close to the ground and would be attenuated more by the barrier. The acoustic behavior of the surface treatment is modeled via its admittance. It can be itself described by a few parameters (flow resistivity, geometrical dimensions...), which can then be optimized. It is proposed to couple porous layers and micro-perforated panel (MPP) resonators in order to take advantage of their different acoustic properties. Moreover, the optimization is achieved using a sensitivity- based method, since in this framework the gradient of the attenuation can be evaluated accurately and efficiently.\nSeveral shapes are considered: half-cylinder, quarter-cylinder, straight wall, T-shape and square shape. In the case of a half-cylindrical geometry, a semi-analytical solution for the sound field in terms of a series of cylindrical waves is derived, which simplifies the sensitivity calculation and optimization process. The boundary element method (BEM) is used to evaluate the attenuation for the remaining shapes, and in this case the sensitivity is evaluated using the adjoint\nstate approach.\nFor all considered geometries, it is found that placing an absorbing treatment close to the source is indeed necessary to attenuate the multiple reflections happening between the tramway and the barrier, and that a tuned MPP resonator on the top of the barrier can yield better performance than an uniform absorbent treatment. More advanced numerical modeling and scale model measurements seem to confirm these results.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8722], "author_name_tesi": "Jolibois, Alexandre ", "last_name_ssi": "Jolibois", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alexandre", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor Ward Sparrow", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "John Brian Fahnline", "Ashok D Belegundu", "Denis Duhamel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor Ward Sparrow, Dissertation Advisor", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Chair", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Member", "John Brian Fahnline, Committee Member", "Ashok D Belegundu, Committee Member", "Denis Duhamel, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tramway noise", "low-height noise barrier", "admittance optimization", "boundary element method", "scale model measurements"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "PUBLIC CULTURE, PRIVATE BIRTH:\nSOCIAL PATTERNS OF AMISH DOMESTIC SPACE\n", "id": "7816", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4704", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation research project I argue that birth plays a significant role in the lives of Amish women and men.

The prevalence of obesity has almost tripled in the past three decades among children and adolescents in the US. Thus, preventing childhood obesity has become a national concern that requires better understanding of the \u2018obesogenic environment\u2019 in which children live. Researchers and policy makers are addressing school environments as primary settings for preventing childhood obesity. In an attempt to address the problem of childhood obesity, the federal government passed the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 that mandated each Local Education Agency (LEA) participating in the school meal programs to develop a Local Wellness Policy (LWP) and to involve a number of stakeholders in the development process. Research supports student involvement in nutrition programs and school-based interventions that promote healthy lifestyle behaviors as this may increase buy-in for changes occurring in schools to promote nutrition. In the present study, we investigated student involvement in the development of LWPs and policy goals addressing student involvement. We also explored policy and demographic characteristics of LEAs as predictors of student involvement. LWPs from all traditional LEAs in Pennsylvania (n=721; including 539 public LEAs and 182 private LEAs) were abstracted and analyzed. We observed that LEAs with comprehensive and strong policies were more willing to engage students in nutrition-related policies and activities regardless of their sponsor type (public or private), enrollment, location, and socioeconomic status of their students. In addition, LEAs that met the policy development team membership requirements and have involved students on the wellness committees that developed LWPs were more likely to sustain their participatory approaches and involve students on the ongoing wellness committees that follow-up on the implementation of the LWPs. We also found significant differences between public and private LEAs in half of the student involvement goals explored in our analysis. This is an area in need of further investigation. Future studies are needed to investigate \u2018best practices\u2019 for student involvement in LEAs and to explore other predictor variables of student involvement in school nutrition policies. In addition, our field requires further exploration of the impact of student engagement initiatives on the dietary and physical activity behaviors of youth, as well as the potential changes in the knowledge,behaviors, and attitudes of students when actively involved in addressing the challenges and solutions of childhood obesity within the school settings.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3833], "author_name_tesi": "Jomaa, Lamis Hassan", "last_name_ssi": "Jomaa", "middle_name_ssi": "Hassan", "first_name_ssi": "Lamis", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Claudia Kay Probart", "Claudia Kay Probart"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Claudia Kay Probart, Thesis Advisor", "Claudia Kay Probart, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["local education agencies", "local wellness policies", "nutrition school policies", "student involvement", "Pennsylvania schools"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Implementation of Local Wellness Policies in Pennsylvania School Districts: Student Involvement and Process Factors Associated with Positive Changes in the School Wellness Environment\n", "id": "11041", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13258", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Childhood obesity is an epidemic in the United States. Numerous health and nutrition policies at the national and state levels have been developed and adopted by various sectors to address this problem. Schools represent one of the primary settings targeted by federal and state policies to prevent and reverse childhood obesity. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 is the most recent federal mandate that required schools sponsoring school meal programs across the country to develop local wellness policies (LWPs) in order to address this serious problem. The purpose of this study is to assess the progress of Pennsylvania public schools in implementing their local wellness policies, mainly the implementation of student involvement goals and changes in nutrition education, physical activity, and the competitive food environment after the establishment of wellness policies. A web-based survey was developed, pilot-tested, and administered to all Pennsylvania public school districts that developed LWPs at the beginning of the 2006/2007 school year. The 39-item survey included 9 components to assess process areas that were developed and followed by school districts to implement their LWPs and the progress of schools in implementing wellness policy goals. \nPennsylvania school districts met the main requirements of the wellness policy mandate; however schools varied in implementing their policy goals and in enforcing and measuring these policies. Pennsylvania school districts are involving students in wellness-related areas in a variety of ways. In our study, student involvement was associated with positive changes in nutrition education and physical activity opportunities. In addition, student involvement was associated with healthier foods and beverages sold and offered in competitive food venues. Two clusters of school districts in Pennsylvania were identified based on processes that schools have followed in implementing LWPs. Student involvement, receiving external funding, and measurement of LWP implementation are among the processes identified in our study that distinguish between school districts in Pennsylvania. No demographic differences were observed between the two clusters. However, clusters differed on steps taken to plan the implementation of policy goals, the allocation of internal funds, and the existence of ongoing wellness committees and the frequency of their meetings. School districts that were more process-committed reported more positive changes in nutrition education, physical activity, and much healthier changes in competitive foods and beverages compared to less process-committed SDs. In conclusion, our findings highlight some of the main processes that distinguish school districts and can contribute to positive changes taking place in schools with the implementation of LWPs. These processes include involving students in the implementation of policy goals, mobilizing internal and external funds to support LWP-related activities, adopting an organized systematic approach in planning for the implementation of policy goals, and measuring school progress in implementation. Findings from our study have a number of implications for policy makers, nutrition professionals, researchers, and local school authorities involved in preventing childhood obesity through school nutrition and wellness policies. These implications may serve as good recommendations for future re-authorizations of the Child Nutrition Programs and the local wellness policy mandate.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12805], "author_name_tesi": "Jomaa, Lamis Hassan", "last_name_ssi": "Jomaa", "middle_name_ssi": "Hassan", "first_name_ssi": "Lamis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Claudia Probart", "Terryl Hartman", "Katarzyna Kordas", "Leif Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Claudia Probart, Committee Chair", "Terryl Hartman, Committee Member", "Katarzyna Kordas, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["student involvement", "schools", "Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 200", "local wellness policies", "childhood obesity", "nutrition education", "physical activity", "competitive foods and beverages"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Cosolvent Effects in Polymer-Solvent Systems\n", "id": "7653", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "388", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Devolatilization of polymers is important to industrial applications such as film drying, foam production, microelectronics manufacturing, and bulk plastics processing. The mass transport and thermodynamics within such systems often limits production throughput. For example, a common method of foam devolatilization is ambient pressure desorption. In this situation, the diffusion of residual species from the foam to the surrounding air is the limiting step in the manufacturing process. Therefore, the use of a cosolvent to affect the solubility and diffusion favorably is an area of interest to industry.  However, little data exist and few models are capable of predicting the influences that occur when a cosolvent is added to a system. \nThis thesis focuses on measuring and describing cosolvent effects in polymer-solvent systems. Inverse gas chromatography was used to test the influence of CO2 and ethylene at high pressures on the solubility and diffusion of several solvents in poly(vinyl acetate) and poly(styrene). Through testing at multiple conditions it was possible to determine which gas had the largest effect on the polymer-solvent behavior. In addition, influences due to solvent size were examined. \nA ternary experiment was designed to probe the effect of water on the solubility and diffusivity in a poly(ethylene)-ethylene system. The experiment is a simple gravimetric technique for measuring mass uptake of penetrants in polymers.\nLastly, several thermodynamic models are applied to a phase equilibria problem of predicting anomalous solubility behavior in copolymer systems. In certain systems, solvents have been observed to have higher solubility in copolymers compared to the two respective homopolymers. The goal was to determine which, if any, models could predict such behavior without experimental data for parameterization. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [383], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Adam T.", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "T.", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong H Kim", "Ronald Paul Danner", "Andrew Zydney", "John V Badding"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seong H Kim, Committee Chair", "Ronald Paul Danner, Committee Chair", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["high pressure", "polymer-solvent systems", "cosolvent"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A MATTER OF MOTIVE: THE ROLE OF AUTONOMY IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR AND WORK-FAMILY CONFLICT", "id": "10027", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "272", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research on the effects of helping behaviors in the workplace has mainly focused on various positive organizational- and individual-level outcomes.

Unfortunately, operating in this mode greatly increases the flame\u2019s susceptibility to self sustained combustion instabilities.  It is vital to understand flame dynamics in order to better predict the onset of such instabilities.  At low velocity forcing amplitudes, there are two local flame response mechanisms that affect lean premixed flames: vorticity fluctuations  affecting local flame wrinkling, and velocity fluctuations affecting the mean flame surface area.  No experimental studies investigating the interaction of these mechanisms and their affect on the global flame response have been reported in the literature.\n\tAn experimental study was conducted to determine the effect of the interaction of these two flame response mechanisms on the global turbulent flame response in a lean premixed, swirl-stabilized gas turbine combustor.  Premixed natural gas and air were modulated with a siren type modulation device at frequencies between 80 Hz and 360 Hz.  Overall chemiluminescence intensity was recorded with photomultiplier tubes equipped with filters for CH*, CO2*, and OH*, and used as a measure of the global flame heat release rate.  Hot wire anemometry was used to measure the inlet velocity fluctuation.  To characterize flame structure, flame length and shape, CH* chemiluminescence images were recorded at forced and unforced conditions.  From chemiluminescence images synchronized in phase with the inlet velocity fluctuation, it was possible to characterize the role of the two flame response mechanisms.\n\tFlame transfer function (FTF) measurements, which quantify the ratio of  the flame\u2019s heat release rate response to inlet  velocity fluctuations, were made for mean flow velocities of 20 m/s, 25 m/s, and 30 m/s, and equivalence ratios of 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80 with a normalized velocity forcing amplitude of 5%.  It was found that the FTF gain and phase depend on mean velocity, flame length, and flame shape.  Particularly interesting, a forcing frequency, defined as fmin, was observed at which there was minimal heat release rate response. This frequency changed with the same parameters that influence the FTF measurements.\n\tChemiluminescence images revealed two general flame shapes: a typical \u201cV\u201d flame shape and a longer length \u201cV\u201d flame shape with an extension into the corner recirculation zone.  Images phase synchronized with the input velocity fluctuation were taken for operating conditions representative of the two flame shapes.  For a typical \u201cV\u201d flame, it was revealed that high FTF gain forcing frequency conditions exhibited a constructive interaction of the two flame response mechanisms.  Operating conditions with forcing frequencies of minimal gain, fmin, exhibited a destructive interaction of the two mechanisms.  For the longer \u201cV\u201d flame shape with an extension into the corner recirculation zone, it was found that the relative magnitude of the two flame response mechanisms, in addition to the phase relationship, significantly impacted the global flame heat release rate response.  The vorticity disturbance mechanism was the preferred flame response mechanism for this flame shape.\n\tChemiluminescence measurements were also made at variable velocity forcing amplitudes.  At a forcing frequency of fmin, it was shown that the heat release rate response would linearly increase above a null response once a normalized velocity forcing amplitude threshold was reached, starting at 10%.  Vortex shedding was observed for amplitudes greater than 20%.    \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [704], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Brian Keith", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "Keith", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Domenic Adam Santavicca"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca, Thesis Advisor", "Domenic Adam Santavicca, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["premixed", "flame", "instabilities", "lean", "combustion", "gas turbine"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Clusters:  Addressing Material and Environmental Issues", "id": "9245", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "970", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present thesis work is part of a continuing effort in the Castleman group to study the physical and chemical properties of clusters as they relate to materials and the environment.  With regards to materials, metal-based clusters are synthesized in the gas phase in order to identify uniquely stable species.  Just as atoms or molecules are the building blocks of matter in nature, our group envisions the synthesis of future cluster-assembled materials (CAMs) built with clusters.  By varying the size and composition of a cluster by even one atom, the electronic properties can be dramatically changed.  A general introduction of the cluster chemistry and physics pertinent to this thesis work is presented in Chapter 1.\nAnion photoelectron spectroscopy is the experimental technique utilized in this work to study metal and metal-based clusters.  A home-built instrument was employed, and descriptions of its components are presented in Chapter 2.  This instrument was used to study a series of AlnBi- (n = 1-5) clusters.  As explained in Chapter 3, experimental data was combined with theoretical work from our collaborators in order to show that the introduction of a bismuth atom to aluminum clusters creates uniquely stable clusters.  One of these, Al3Bi, is demonstrated be an all-metal aromatic cluster.  Another cluster, Al5Bi, is shown to be stabilized by the jellium model.  The findings are a practical example of how small changes in size and/or composition of a cluster give rise to exciting properties.  Based on the results, a relationship is drawn between the aromatic and jellium models herein, and potential for use in CAMs is briefly discussed.\nIn Chapter 4, niobium carbide clusters of the form Nb3Cn- (n = 5-10) are investigated with similar methods in order to elucidate the formation of larger metal-carbon clusters, most notably the niobium Met-Car (Nb8C12).  When the experimental data is merged with theory from our collaborators, isomers with various structural motifs are identified.  Structures of tri-niobium carbide clusters are proposed to follow two general trends.  One structural trend of Nb3Cn- clusters features a triangular niobium unit at the cluster core.  The second structural motif entails a single carbon atom that links to all three metal atoms, and C2 units that bridge the individual niobium atoms.  Nice agreement between the experimental and computational results is shown, lending credence to our findings.  Comparisons are drawn between the results presented here and previous theoretical and experimental studies of small niobium carbide clusters.\nThe last study presented in this work does not deal with materials, but rather environmental chemistry.  In Chapter 5, reactions of formic acid (HCOOH) and protonated water clusters of the form H+(H2O)n (n = 3-27) are examined in a fast-flow reactor under well-defined thermal conditions.  The product distributions of H+(H2O)n(HCOOH)m show that nucleation occurs with these clusters on a molecular scale more easily than both pure water and methanol-water clusters do under similar conditions.  Calculations are performed using the Thompson liquid drop model to interpret the experimental results.  The findings are also in good agreement with recent theoretical work regarding a \u201ccooperative bonding\u201d effect with formic acid molecules and water.  The atmospheric implications of this study are briefly discussed.

I investigate venture capitalists\u2019 role as information conduits in mergers and acquisitions, specifically, their role while serving on the board of directors of acquiring firms, target firms, or both.  Chapter 1 finds that the information sharing between a VC and a firm\u2019s management results in value-enhancing acquisitions of VC-backed private targets, especially when the acquirer and target share a venture capital board member. I also document that this holds true with public targets, which is evidence in support of the information sharing hypothesis rather than the cheap targets hypothesis.  Chapter 2 shows that VC-backed firms are significantly more likely to receive bids and get acquired following their initial public offering.  I also find that they receive higher premiums while the venture capitalist sits on the board of directors.

H2S oxidation in sulfidic caves causes rapid carbonate dissolution and aggressive speleogenesis, and provides chemical energy for diverse communities of chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms. At the cave watertable, the fate of dissolved sulfide is controlled by three processes that independently influence cave formation: degassing of H2S(g) to the cave atmosphere, biological oxidation in sulfur-oxidizing stream biofilms, and abiotic sulfide oxidation. In contrast to previous research, we found that H2S(g) degassing accounts for the majority of sulfide disappearance from Frasassi streams and that little to no acid is produced in the microaerophilic stream communities.\nOn the cave walls and ceilings, extremely acidic (pH 0-1.5) biofilms known as \u2018snottites\u2019 form where gypsum corrosion residues isolate microbial sulfide oxidizers from limestone buffering. We used a combination of metagenomics and other culture-independent methods and found that Frasassi snottites are dominated by Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, with smaller populations of an archaeon in the uncultivated \u2018G-plasma\u2019 clade of Thermoplasmatales, a bacterium in the Acidimicrobiaceae family, and several rare taxa. The Acidithiobacillus population is autotrophic and oxidize sulfur by the sulfide-quinone reductase (SQR) and sox pathways, while the archaeal and Acidimicrobiaceae populations are likely heterotrophic.\nWe sampled sulfidic cave snottites at spatial scales ranging from meters to 1000s of kilometers to test whether geographical barriers affect microbial biogeography. Given the extreme geochemistry and subsurface location of the biofilms, we hypothesized that snottites from different locations could contain genetically isolated populations and distinct community structures. By (i) sequencing 16S rRNA genes, (ii) sequencing 16S-23S intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, and (iii) multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST), we found that the dominant Acidithiobacillus populations are genetically divergent, but also identified recent long distance dispersal. We then used a combination of 16S rDNA cloning and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to investigate snottite community structure, and found that at a global scale, communities from different caves are significantly different and the major axes of variance in the dataset are related to cave location.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1551], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Daniel Seth", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "Seth", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Macalady", "Jennifer Macalady", "Matthew Scott Fantle", "Mark E Patzkowsky", "Christopher Howard House", "Brian Dempsey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Macalady, Dissertation Advisor", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Chair", "Matthew Scott Fantle, Committee Chair", "Mark E Patzkowsky, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biogeography", "sulfide oxidation", "acidophile", "karst", "Hydrogen sulfide", "Acidithiobacillus"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ALTERED WATER CHEMISTRY AND BROOK TROUT POPULATIONS IN TWO NORTHERN APPALACHIAN PLATEAU STREAMS BETWEEN 1988-90 AND 2005-07: EPISODIC ACIDIFICATION CONTINUED\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "11615", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1631", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two second order streams on the northern Appalachian Plateau of Pennsylvania were sampled during higher flows between August 2005 and March 2007 for numerous stream chemistry parameters, including pH, acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC), total dissolved sulfate (SO4), total dissolved aluminum (AlTD or Al) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Samples were collected during or immediately following precipitation events of rain or snow-melt events. Chemistry data for Stone Run, a documented low ANC acidic stream, and Benner Run, a higher ANC control stream, were evaluated with reference to discharge rate (m3/s/km2) and compared to historical episodic stream chemistry data collected between October 1988 and June 1990 to determine the extent of recovery from episodic acidification due to reductions in atmospheric deposition of sulfur oxides (SOx).\nMy first hypothesis was that decreased air emissions and deposition of sulfur dioxide (SO2), which have been documented following implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990, have caused a corresponding decrease in dissolved sulfate (SO4) in stream waters. As a consequence of decreased acid precipitation and SO4 deposition, my second hypothesis was that less AlTD would be leached from forest soils and found in streams, inferring reduced mortality of fish and other aquatic species sensitive to inorganic aluminum toxicity. My third hypothesis was that new equations would be required to predict total aluminum concentrations in these streams.\nResults indicate that the following stream chemistry changes occurred on Benner Run from the 1988-90 study period to the 2005-07 study period: the median sulfate concentration increased 21% (from 4.7 to 5.7 mg/L); the median aluminum concentration increased 223% (from 42 to 94 ug/L). The following changes occurred on Stone Run between the same study periods: the median sulfate concentration decreased 14% (from 9.6 to 8.3 mg/L); the median aluminum concentration decreased 9% (from 200 to 173 ug/L). Comparing medians using Mann-Whitney tests, three of these four differences were found to be statistically significant, with only the aluminum decrease in Stone Run not statistically significant.  The percentage of samples with > 0.2 mg/L dissolved aluminum increased from 1.2% to 10.0% on Benner Run and decreased from 50.2% to 48.3% on Stone Run. Based on these findings, slight recovery of Stone Run and biologically significant degradation of Benner Run has occurred on these watersheds between the two study periods.\nOther stream chemical parameters were compared: conductivity, chloride (Cl), nitrate (NO3-N), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), sodium (Na), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); and regression equations were developed for all parameters to predict aluminum concentrations. Although the correlations between dissolved sulfate and aluminum concentrations are believed to explain some of the observed stream chemistry changes as hypothesized, these were not the highest correlations on either stream. The two streams were found to have distinctly different concentration ranges of sulfate and DOC correlated with higher flows and with higher AlTD (> 0.1 and > 0.2 mg/L).\nNew regression equations were developed to predict AlTD from flow (m3/s), discharge (m3/s/km2) and the chemical parameters measured to obtain: R2, adjusted R2, PRESS and predicted R2. These equations show DOC (R2 = 0.749) was the strongest single predictor of AlTD on Benner Run. ANC (R2 = 0.458) was the best single predictor of AlTD on Stone Run, slightly better than pH (R2 = 0.403) then SO4 (R2 = 0.298), consistent with episodic acidification theory. DOC did not contribute significantly to predictions of AlTD (R2 = 0.000) on Stone Run.\nEffects of varying beaver activity and a series of beaver dams and ponds complicate the explanation of some of the altered water chemistry on Benner Run, including AlTD highly correlated with DOC, which would be expected to have low toxicity if chelated by organic matter. But brook trout population estimates by the Pennsylvanian Fish and Boat Commission (PFBC) above the beaver dams declined 72.6% from 1982 to 2004, with a maximum biomass of 72.40 kg/ha in 1984 and a minimum biomass of 19.81 kg/ha in 2004. This data, along with increased SO4 and AlTD concentrations below the dams, supports a conclusion of continued episodic acidification and biologically significant change on this watershed despite decreasing SO4 emission and deposition trends. It is likely that at least several more decades will be required to confirm significant recovery on both Benner Run and Stone Run.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1613, 1614, 1615, 1616, 1617, 1618], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, David Wayne", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "Wayne", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Pollution Control", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Russell Dewalle", "William Edward Sharpe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Russell Dewalle, Thesis Advisor", "William Edward Sharpe, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["water quality", "trout", "sulfate", "sculpin", "Stone run", "recovery", "monitoring", "ERP", "fish", "episodic", "emissions", "deposition", "chemistry", "dam", "Benner Run", "brook", "beaver", "aquatic", "Appalachian Plateau", "aluminum", "acidic episode", "acidifcation", "stream"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Doping Of Semiconducting Polymers For Electronic Applications\n", "id": "22705", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10407", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One branch of modern electronics requires avoiding the high processing costs associated with inorganic semiconductors in order to create novel low-cost, mechanically flexible, and low-profile devices for the next generation of consumer devices.

Measurements of doped thiophene-based polymers were conducted in organic thin-film transistor geometries to measure the charge carrier densities.

The first is an examination of Haudenosaunee population trends from AD 1500 to AD 1700. In this research, I map the boundaries of all known Haudenosaunee villages occupied during this period. The combination of settlement size and ratios of site area-per-person generate population estimates for each village. With existing chronological data, I combine these estimates to create population curves for the Haudenosaunee nations. The analysis of associated archaeological and ethnohistoric data provides explanations for the observed trends. \n\nThe second is an analysis of the natural and sociopolitical factors that influenced Haudenosaunee settlement locations and abandonment. In this research, I analyze the spatial correlation of Haudenosaunee village locations with various natural and sociopolitical landscape features in a geographic information system. When compared to a control group, the deviations of the village locations from the control locations reveal features that attracted settlements. Finally, I employ event history analysis to examine the factors that most strongly influenced the decision to abandon Haudenosaunee villages.\n\nThe results of the population research reveal significant diversity in trends across the five nations. They also support the proposition that European-introduced diseases did not affect Native American populations in the Northeast and Great Lakes until the mid-seventeenth century and the idea that diseases spread irregularly through regions populated by geographically and socially buffered middle-range societies. There also appear to have been frequent migration events in this region that help to explain highly variable pre-contact population changes, shifts in settlement distribution, and sociopolitical development in the region. The identification of these events may help the development of population curves in other regions. This research also highlights effective methods for using archaeological settlement remains to study population sizes and trends in North America and elsewhere. \n\nThe settlement ecology research takes a new approach to studying the factors behind Haudenosaunee settlement locations. In the past, research has focused on finding primary factors. This dissertation argues, following recent settlement ecology theory, that settlement distribution and location should be viewed as the result of a complex system of relationships between settlement, subsistence, and sociopolitical organization. The results show that the interaction of agricultural needs, ease of transportation, and sociopolitical factors like political alliances, communication, and warfare significantly influenced Haudenosaunee settlement location choices. Further, population size and agricultural resources were factors in the abandonment rate of villages.\n\nThese results have interesting implications for our understanding of Haudenosaunee population and culture, the development of Native American societies in the eastern Great Lakes and Northeast, and the swidden agricultural adaptation in temperate climates.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1734], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Eric E.", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dean R.

Le Guin offers the Reader of <em>The  Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia</em> a utopian vision that balances flux with  stability. With the novel\u2019s textual structure, ideological underpinnings, and  imagined worlds, Le Guin teaches the Reader ways to change the world, and  through rhetorical criticism, I explore how rhetoric, anarchism, and feminism  articulate possibilities for socio-political transformation in her novel. <em>The Dispossessed</em> features a society  informed by Taoist principles, anarcho-syndicalist organization, and open and  changing relational structures. More specifically, Le Guin imagines new ways of  being in the world by using Taoist paradox and contradiction to guide the  Reader down a new path, weaves in Kropotkin\u2019s anarchism to re-work how society  functions and labors, and, although she did not call her suggestions feminist, performs  feminist politics to re-relate the individual to institutions, identities, and  places.<br />\n  Textually, Le Guin strikes a balance  between opening and closing the text. The novel opens outward to the Reader,  with uncertainty and flux characterizing the reading experience. The cognitive  estrangement that drives science fiction separates the Reader from the novel\u2019s  setting but encourages the Reader to seek answers to real-world problems in the  novel\u2019s fictional environment. Le Guin trains her Reader to look for  connections, to participate in creating the argument, and to craft  relationships. To prevent the Reader from wandering endlessly, however, Le Guin  closes the text using a spiraling structure, similar to a spinning skater, to  turn the Reader back toward the central points. Recurring symbols, such as  prisons and light, guide the Reader through these twists, keeping the text in  motion as the Reader navigates the turns. Le Guin provides additional guidance using  iconicity to unite content and form. <br />\n  Le Guin draws on paradox, ambiguity, and  confusion to encourage her Reader not to share her protagonist\u2019s journey but to  embark on one of her or his own, informed by Taoist philosophy. The Reader  learns, through the novel, how to navigate dialectic, contradiction, and  paradox. Those paradoxes help both the main character and the Reader to  appreciate how truths might emerge from the tension created by contradiction. <br />\n  The re-working of the workplace that Le  Guin performs in <em>The Dispossessed</em> offers the Reader a view of how anarcho-syndicalism could change how work functions.  Workers in Kropotkin\u2019s workplace enjoy their work, administer and organize  themselves, and depend on other syndicates to help them to create a balanced  society. The society that Le Guin forms in the novel applies Kropotkin\u2019s  decentralized government to separate the means of distribution from the means  of production and his syndical and interdependent societal organization and  work structure. The motives driving characters to work form a balanced social  organism that eliminates government and maximizes individual freedom. <br />\n  Le Guin uses the novel to alter not only  how people work but how people relate to one another, to institutions, and to  vectors of identity. To avoid socio-political dystopia, the Reader can turn to  the new relationships that Le Guin offers in <em>The Dispossessed</em>. The novel offers new ways to relate to  institutions, identities, and the planet. Each new relationship option helps to  stabilize the protagonist, and the Reader, in the midst of a fluctuating  political world and reading experience. The Reader is left with the need to  re-form her or his own relationships, to the social order, to the nation, to  identity and the self, to the planet, and to other people.</p>\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2153], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Hillary A", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Hillary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Walter Benson", "Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Nancy A Tuana", "Rosa A Eberly", "Stephen Howard Browne", "Thomas Walter Benson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Walter Benson, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Paul Mcallister, Committee Member", "Nancy A Tuana, Committee Member", "Rosa A Eberly, Committee Member", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Member", "Thomas Walter Benson, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Kropotkin", "The Dispossessed", "Rhetoric", "Anarchism", "Feminism", "Taoism", "Le Guin"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Intelligent Design and Educational Policy: The Case in Kansas\n", "id": "7910", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3252", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Advocates of an alternative explanation of life\u2019s origins, Intelligent Design, have lobbied hard since the 1987 Edwards v.

For the first study of the thesis, I implemented the Physical Activity Guidelines for Fitness into a 30-week multi-modal intervention to evaluate how a multi-modal program influences cardiovascular disease risk factors.  I hypothesized that the group fitness program would produce beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors by decreasing body weight, fat body mass, total cholesterol concentration, triglycerides concentration, blood pressure, and also by increasing lean body mass and HDL-C concentration.  In the second study, I investigated heart rate intensity in order to determine whether moderate- or vigorous-intensity activity has a greater effect on the reduction of body mass.  I hypothesized that there would be a greater reduction in body mass when a higher percentage of time during the workout is spent in vigorous-intensity.  For the third and final study, I evaluated how to incorporate moderate- and vigorous-intensity hill intervals into treadmill walking workouts in order to maximize metabolic cost.  I hypothesized that continuous hill intervals and random hill intervals would result in the same metabolic cost in a 20-minute treadmill workout.  This thesis will provide evidence about strategies to both meet the Physical Activity Guidelines for Fitness and reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7554], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Justin Laird", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "Laird", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jinger Gottschall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jinger Gottschall, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cardiovascular disease", "risk factors", "physical fitness"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "COMPLIANT MEDICAL TOOL DESIGN FOR SOFT TISSUE CUTTING", "id": "14021jpj5243", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14021", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Needles are some of the most commonly used medical devices in minimally invasive procedures. Examples of these procedures include drug delivery, biopsies and brachytherapy cancer treatment. The efficacy of these procedures is highly dependent on the ability for precise placement of the needle. However, high insertion forces can lead to complications resulting in poor needle placement and possibly a poor outcome for the patient. Ongoing concerns for physician include the needle diverging from the target path and deformation or rotation of the soft tissue, both the result of high insertion forces. Several studies have been carried out to reduce the insertion force in the needle insertion procedure. These include geometry studies, the speed of insertion, the use of vibrational insertion, and more recently the use of a novel compliant hinge to act as a cutting mechanism, however, the work with the novel compliant hinge was limited to the exploration of the concept. This research advances knowledge in tissue cutting using a novel compliant needle design. The properties of the compliant needle design are empirically derived and used to determine the cutting motion of a dynamically inserted needle. By understanding how the compliant mechanism aids in transverse cutting motion an improved needle can be achieved.\nFinite element analysis is used to determine empirical compliant equations for varying hinge geometries. Polynomial regression equations are generated to create the empirical equations for each directional stiffness. The limitation to the empirical equations are determined to be a function of the distance between the hinges and the thickness of the hinge. It was found that if the distance between the hinges is less than 1.68 times the thickness than the cross hinge is a primary flexible member. After this, its contribution to the compliance quickly diminishes. To verify the compliant equations the models are compared to FEA results. The percent error for a distance ratio of 1.04, 1.57, 3.15, and 4.72 was 4.7, 23, 164, and 438 percent respectively. This research allows for the compliant mechanism's design to be simplified for these ranges. Outside of these ranges, it is possible to use compliant equations developed by Lobontiu et al.[1] found in Appendix A. \u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14359], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Justin Adam", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "Adam", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jason Z.

The researcher was interested in two broad areas: inquiry science in the elementary classroom and the need/desire for professional development opportunities for elementary teachers related to science education, and specifically professional development focused on inquiry science.\nA cross sectional survey design was prepared and distributed in May 2005 and usable responses were received from 228 elementary teachers from the south-central area of Pennsylvania which was a representative sample of socio-economical and geographical factors.\nAreas of particular interest in the results section include:\n\t1.\tThe use of Science Kits which is popular, but may not have the desired impact since they are \u201cadjusted\u201d by teachers often removing the opportunity for evidence-based discourse by the students.  This may be partly based on the lack of time dedicated to science instruction and, secondly, the teachers\u2019 lack of comfort with the science topics.  Another issue arising from science kits is the amount of preparation time required to utilize them. \n\t2.\tTeachers demonstrated understanding of the high qualities of professional development but, when it came to science content professional development, they were more inclined to opt for short-term opportunities as opposed to long-term learning opportunities.  Since elementary teachers are generalists and most schools are not focusing on science, the lack of attention to a subject where they are least comfortable is understandable, but disappointing.  \n\t3.\tThere is a great need for more training in evidence\u2013based discourse so teachers can implement this needed skill and increase students\u2019 understanding of science content so they are more able to compete in the international science and math measurements.\n\t4.\tProfessional development, especially in the science area, needs to be a long-term, grass-roots effort in all schools.  We need to dedicate funding, and make time available for teachers to participate in long-term collaborative learning opportunities.  Teachers want to observe each other and collaborate on lessons but, unless it becomes a priority of the school, it will not happen.  Time must be dedicated throughout the day that allows small groups of teachers across the board to get together and share, learn, attempt new approaches, reflect and revise.  Various forms of professional learning are available, and each school must choose the one that works for them.\n\t5.\tThe principal as the educational leader in the school needs to be more fully engaged with the learning process of the teachers and the students.   The principal should not be viewed only as the evaluator of teachers, but as a collaborator of learning and teaching.\n\tSuggestions for further research include longitudinal studies of the impact on students of long term professional development of the teachers that specifically targets science content, inquiry and evidence\u2013based discourse.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3495], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Kathleen Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James F Nolan Jr.", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Carla Zembal Saul", "Denise Gaspari Meister"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James F Nolan Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Chair", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Member", "Denise Gaspari Meister, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["elemenatary teachers and science", "science inquiry", "prfessional development in science education"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Black Greek-letter Organizations: A Legacy of African American Adult Education", "id": "16036", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8082", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The education of African American adults evolved in response to the changing social, economic, and political needs of the Black community.

Research has shown that the ability of clad building structures to resist damage greatly depends on the high-strain rate behavior of the cladding wall and the subsequent load transfer from the panels to their structural support frames. Cladding panels have the potential to significantly absorb the blast energy, mitigating loads imparted onto the frame. However, as the panels absorb energy, high-velocity fragmentation of the cladding can pose a significant threat to bystanders and the structure itself. Fragmentation is especially prevalent for brittle, granite cladding. To aid in enhancing energy absorption and limiting fragmentation, many researchers have studied the use of polyurea as a coating or interlayer system for metal and concrete structural components. Due to its viscoelastic behavior, polyurea exhibits beneficial mechanical properties at high strain rates. This study evaluates the effectiveness of applying polyurea coating to granite cladding panels with the hopes of reducing blast loading effects on buildings, namely the level of fragmentation and load transfer from the cladding to the support structure. Finite element analyses of polyurea-coated granite cladding walls were performed in LS-DYNA using constitutive models for the granite cladding and polyurea. The modeling approach and analysis method was validated against published blast studies to ensure that reliable results were obtained in the parametric study, where the blast resistance of granite cladding was computationally assessed. The blast size, panel and polyurea coating thickness, and coating location were varied according to construction practice and parameters evaluated in similar studies. The results of the parametric study show that the polyurea coating was effective in limiting the fragmentation of the granite cladding with minimal detrimental effect on load transfer into support connections.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8414], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Kendra Diana", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "Diana", "first_name_ssi": "Kendra", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Daniel Linzell", "Tong Qiu", "Zoltan Ivan Rado"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Daniel Linzell, Thesis Advisor", "Tong Qiu, Thesis Advisor", "Zoltan Ivan Rado, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["blast", "explosive", "granite cladding", "polyurea", "polymer", "high-strain rate", "fragmentation"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "An Assessment of Perceptions and Experiences in Community-Based Youth-Adult Relationships", "id": "6430", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3544", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the perceptions and experiences of youth and adults engaged in various types of youth-adult relationships involving community projects (e.g., civic, service, service-learning, and fundraising). The objectives of the study were to: (1) examine perceptions of individuals engaged in youth-adult relationships at the community level; (2) examine experiences of youth and adults participating in various youth-adult relationships while working together as partners; and (3) identify critical elements that characterize various youth-adult relationships.\nA concurrent triangulation design utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data sources (e.g., involvement and interaction rating scale, observations, and interviews) was employed. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and analyses of variance (ANOVA). Involvement and interaction rating scales were completed by 108 participants in groups from 10 states and 12 communities (10 rural, two urban). The rating scale measured three constructs: youth involvement, adult involvement, and youth-adult interaction. Qualitative data were analyzed using techniques including observations, semi-structured interviews of individuals, and multiple-case study analyses.\nAppropriate statistical procedures (t-tests) were used to analyze differences between youth and adult participants. Differences by gender were also analyzed. Although the model indicated no significant difference between youth and adult participants, adults were more positive on the youth involvement, adult involvement, and youth-adult interaction constructs. There was a significant difference in perceptions between male and female participants, with females being more positive on all three constructs.\nAnalyses of variance were used to analyze differences between participants by ethnicity, location (i.e., rural, urban, and suburban), and relationship type (i.e., Adult-Led Collaboration, Youth-Adult Partnership, and Youth-Led Collaboration). There was no significant difference between Whites/European Americans and African Americans, although Whites were more positive on all three constructs. There was a significant difference between rural and urban participants. The statistical model indicated that rural participants were more positive than urban participants towards youth involvement. There was a significant difference between all participants in Adult-led Collaborations and Youth-Led Collaborations, with those participants in Youth-Led Collaborations being more positive towards youth involvement. Adults in Youth-Adult Partnerships were significantly more positive towards youth involvement and youth-adult interaction than those adults in Adult-Led Collaborations. There was no significant difference between youth in the various types of relationships, although the youth in Youth-Adult Partnerships were less positive on all three constructs than their adult counterparts.\nMulti-case study analysis was deemed appropriate for investigating the experiences of the participants. Four of the 12 groups were included in the qualitative analysis. Based on observations and interviews conducted by the researcher, Adult-Led Collaborations had lower levels of youth involvement with the youth being dependent on adult guidance. The youth seemed reluctant in taking on responsibilities and lacked confidence in making some decisions. Most of the youth in these groups were younger and inexperienced in working as partners with adults. The Youth-Led Collaboration had high youth involvement, with youth being very independent in making decisions. These youth tended to be older, having some previous experience in working with adults. Both groups had high levels of adult support, although adult involvement and responsibility were higher among Adult-Led Collaborations than Youth-Led Collaborations.\nCase studies also revealed critical elements that characterize the two observed youth-adult relationships. Those critical elements of Adult-Led Collaborations tended to be: high levels of adult involvement and adult support (in the form of soliciting youth decision-making and valuing of youth and their ideas); high levels of civility and mutual respect among participants; moderate to low level of community obligation among some youth and adults; low levels of decision-making among youth; little, if any, mutual learning between youth and adults; low to fair amount of youth responsibility on certain tasks, but few tasks initiated by youth; and youth voice solicited and considered by adults. The critical elements of Youth-Led Collaborations were: high levels of adult support; adult support valued by youth; high levels of civility and mutual respect among participants; at least a moderate level of community obligation on behalf of youth and adults; high levels of youth decision-making; little, if any, mutual learning among youth and adults; high level of youth responsibility and youth involvement; youth voice utilized by youth and solicited/highly-valued by adults. Although some of the elements appear to be unique to specific relationships, several of these elements (e.g., adult support, civility, mutual respect, and youth voice) emerged as characteristics of the positive interactions that must exist between youth and adults, regardless of the type of relationships. Thus, these characteristics can serve as a guideline for practitioners to assess the strength of meaningful youth-adult relations within programs. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3525], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Kenneth Ray", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "Ray", "first_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Francis Perkins", "Constance A Flanagan", "Dana Lynn Mitra", "Rama B Radhakrishna"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Francis Perkins, Committee Chair", "Constance A Flanagan, Committee Member", "Dana Lynn Mitra, Committee Member", "Rama B Radhakrishna, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Youth-Adult Relationships", "Youth-Adult Partnerships", "Community Youth Development"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Grounds for change: Assessing the efficacy of participatory research and development of agricultural innovations\n", "id": "12586", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3471", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent spikes in food prices and subsequent shortages in many developing countries has increased the attention placed on international agricultural research for development.  Agricultural programs have followed the general trends in development practice over the past several decades, beginning with a market-based, top-down approach to technology creation and diffusion.  However, alternative approaches to development, which focus on participation as both means to social change and an end goal for social organization, have long been championed by both theorists and practitioners as more just and durable than conventional development practice.  Perceptions of participation by all actors in a given project or social space often vary, however, raising questions of how to understand different types of action and engagement within the same participatory spaces, as well as their effects on the community.  This paper explores the experiences of farmers and researchers involved with participatory plant breeding projects in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, West Africa.  Semi-structured interviews were conducted with both farmer and researchers participants in the projects, asking questions of what each individual learned and taught during the projects, as well as how their access to and sharing of information has changed as a result of the collaboration.  Based on themes that emerged during the interviews, the paper argues for a typology of participation that is two-fold and dynamic.  Participation can be functional or empowering, meeting practical or strategic goals.  Farmers\u2019 experience with the participatory plant breeding projects suggest that functional participation occurs in situations of knowledge sharing between researchers and farmers, where information moves vertically and meets immediate, material needs.  In contrast, exchanges among farmers themselves, facilitated by the project, result in increased weak ties and the ability to make future choices, a more empowering aspect of the participatory process.   Researchers, in contrast, emphasized the two-way communication and sharing of ideas between themselves and farmers, seeing their interactions as moving toward a strategic goal of community-based change.  Critics of participation as a means to social change have suggested that this mismatch is precisely the problem with participation \u2013 it never occurs on a level playing field, and there will always be certain actors with more institutional power or social status whose knowledge will dominate the collaboration.  Nonetheless, this paper suggests that participation is an important first step in moving beyond the top-down research for development paradigm, and explores alternative diffusion models, beyond a classic market-based system, that can build upon and validate the social ties and knowledge created through participatory plant breeding. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3458], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Kristal ", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kristal", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leland Luther Glenna", "Leland Luther Glenna"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leland Luther Glenna, Thesis Advisor", "Leland Luther Glenna, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["agricultural development", "participatory research", "West Africa"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Emerging seed markets, substantive seed economies and integrated seed systems in West Africa: A mixed methods analysis", "id": "21110", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9758", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Current approaches to the second Green Revolution in sub-Saharan Africa focus on incorporating the needs of smallholder farmers and environmental concerns into a market-based approach to technology development and diffusion.  This dissertation analyzes the experiences of farmers in the West African countries of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger with the recent creation of input markets for improved variety seeds, as a specific example of the interactions between market-oriented agricultural development activities and traditional agricultural production systems.  Sahelian West Africa presents a particularly timely example of the initial changes and impacts associated with the establishment of markets for agricultural inputs not previously considered something to be sold.  Sorghum and pearl millet are native grain crops integral to the cropping systems of the Sahel, and are crop species that have not been emphasized by private agricultural research.  Public national and international agricultural research centers in the region have ongoing research projects to identify, breed and select improved varieties of sorghum and pearl millet, activities into which farmers have been incorporated through participatory plant breeding approaches.  With an influx of interest and resources in promoting technology diffusion through market-oriented development approaches, there is now a push to create the formal systems and structures necessary to diffuse these seeds through input markets.  These efforts have included establishing seed certification laws to ensure quality at the national level, support for farmer organizations and seed producer unions at the regional level, and the establishment of points of sale through agro-dealers and other local input sellers.  \t\nThe dissertation uses a theoretical framework of substantive economies and economic habitus, which understands economic actions and institutions as conditioned by their specific social motivations and natural context, to characterize the distinct seed systems present in Sahelian West Africa.  Mixed methods, including thematic analysis of qualitative data, growth curve modeling of a panel data set and visual representation of seed diffusion, are used to analyze seed access activities at different scales, from individual actions to community and regional systems.  Themes emerging from qualitative data analysis suggest that there are exchange-based and provisioning-based seed systems present in the region, and that these systems are based on distinct organizing principles but are connected by individual seed access actions.  Statistical analysis shows that characteristics of the social and natural context condition individuals\u2019 seed access decision making over time, with significant differences in seed access decisions between men and women, as well as among individuals with different spatial relationships to social infrastructure like weekly markets.  Visual data, both digital maps and those drawn by research participants, depict the scale and points of connection of seed systems in the region.  By providing mixed methods analysis of which individuals are engaged with which seed systems, and how connections among those systems support seed diffusion, this dissertation project contributes to sociological literature on substantive economies and international agricultural development, and provides feedback for future program development.

She bears a mark of the feminine that is not biologically determined. Girl as a sociological category is relatively new, following the birth of childhood itself in the eighteenth century and coming to life in the mid-twentieth century as a breakaway subset of the \u201cteenager.\u201d She occupies the odd position of being the most desirable of objects and being the most invisible of subjects.

Girl here functions as a conceptual persona, and as such is not necessarily a correlative or representative of actual girls.

The disorder has a genetic component and affects nearly 2 million American children.  An imbalance between dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems has been implicated in ADHD and Tourette's syndrome, a common comorbid condition.  Indeed, many drugs used to treat hyperactivity act on both dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems.  However, the mechanism(s) through which these two transmitters interact is not well understood.  The subsequent doctoral work examines the role of norepinephrine in the regulation of locomotor hyperactivity.  The research is on the forefront of expanding our knowledge of catecholaminergic regulation of motor activity, which may lead to development of better pharmacological treatments for hyperactivity disorders.\t\nWe have identified the mouse mutant coloboma as an animal model for examining the neurological basis of hyperactivity with a well-defined genetic abnormality; these mice carry a mutation that includes the Snap  gene.  The mouse mutant exhibits spontaneous locomotor hyperactivity that is on average 3 times greater than control mice; this hyperactivity is a direct result of a reduction in SNAP-25 protein and occurs naturally without physical or chemical induction.  Administration of amphetamine produces a paradoxical reduction in locomotor activity in coloboma mice that is similar to the ameliorative response seen in ADHD children taking psychostimulants.\n\tThe reduced SNAP-25 expression contributes to a region and neurotransmitter-specific deficiency in coloboma mice.  The regional concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and their metabolites were determined using HPLC analysis.\nIn striatum and nucleus accumbens it was revealed that dopamine was slightly, but not significantly reduced in coloboma, while HVA and DOPAC (dopamine metabolites) concentrations in coloboma mice were significantly decreased.  This suggests a reduction in dopamine turnover, consistent with a reduction in dopamine release observed by others.  By contrast, the norepinephrine concentration was significantly increased in coloboma mice in both striatum and nucleus accumbens but unchanged in other brain regions.  Also, norepinephrine release was increased as assayed by superfusion in striatum and nucleus accumbens slices.  Further molecular characterization of the increased norepinephrine in this mutant mouse has shown an upregulation in the tyrosine hydroxylase and a2A adrenergic receptor mRNA expression in the locus coeruelus.  The norepinephrine reuptake transporter receptor density and maximal velocity were unchanged.  Thus, the elevated release and concentration of norepinephrine are most likely the products of increased synthesis.\t\nThe functional role of norepinephrine in the expression of locomotor hyperactivity in adult coloboma mice was examined by specifically depleting noradrenergic innervation using the neurotoxin DSP-4.  Depletion of norepinephrine by DSP-4 either through systemic or intracerebroventricular administration significantly reduced the aberrant locomotor activity of the coloboma mouse by 50%, suggesting that norepinephrine plays an important role in the expression of hyperactivity.  \n\tExperiments examining the interaction between norepinephrine and dopamine traditionally use gross pharmacological or surgical manipulations to alter catecholamine levels, whereas the catecholaminergic imbalance in coloboma mice occurs endogenously.  Thus, the coloboma mutant mouse is an unprecedented model for understanding the biochemical and behavioral relationship of norepinephrine and dopamine, which may shed a more realistic light on human dysfunction.  Ultimately, by examining the role of norepinephrine in locomotor hyperactivity in a murine model we hope to identify novel approaches to the treatment of hyperactivity disorders in humans.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4462], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Michelle Denise", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "Denise", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Andrew Ewing", "Robert J Milner", "Ellen Hess"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member", "Andrew Ewing, Committee Member", "Robert J Milner, Committee Chair", "Ellen Hess, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["catecholamines", "Tourette's syndrome", "ADHD", "SNAP-25"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Expression of uridinediphosphate glucuronosyltransferase genes: focus on alternative splicing and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that contribute to interindividual differences in drug and carcinogen metabolism", "id": "13184", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7097", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors that determine inter-individual differences in disease disposition and therapeutic response.  Drug metabolism pathways have been a major focus of pharmacogenetic studies because inter-individual differences in the expression and activity of these enzymes may cause clinically significant effects on the kinetic properties of various drugs.  Because of their role in the metabolism of chemical toxins and carcinogens, genetic differences in drug metabolizing enzymes are also associated with risk of diseases such as cancer.  There are many factors governing inter-individual variation in drug-metabolizing enzymes including SNPs, epigenetics, alternative splicing events, transcriptional regulation, and post-translational modifications.  \nUDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) play an important role in the metabolism and excretion of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds including drugs and carcinogens.  UGT enzymes mediate the phase II conjugation of glucuronic acid to their substrates, thereby increasing substrate polarity and facilitating their excretion.  Variations in UGT genes are associated with altered drug metabolism and cancer risk.  Some of the genetic factors underlying these associations have been discovered, but often there is wide variability in phenotype within a given genotype.  The liver is the organ most commonly associated with metabolism, and most UGTs are expressed in the human liver.  Expression in extrahepatic tissues has been less well characterized, even though tissues that form a barrier with the environment, such as aerodigestive and gastrointestinal tract tissues represent an important first line of defense against exposures to xenobiotic compounds.  \nA better understanding of the inter-individual variability and relative abundance of UGT gene expression in different tissues is important as this helps determine the physiological relevance of each UGT enzyme.  While many previous studies have used qualitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for determining which UGT genes are expressed in different tissues, some quantitative analysis of UGT expression has been performed    In studies described in this thesis dissertation, real-time PCR was used to quantify the expression of 16 UGT enzymes in multiple specimens of various normal human tissues including lung, liver, larynx, brain, tongue, floor of mouth, tonsil, esophagus, endometrium, and pancreas.  Substantial inter-individual variability in expression was observed in both hepatic and extrahepatic tissues.  In extrahepatic tissues, unpredictable expression patterns were frequently observed, in which UGT enzymes expressed in some individuals were not expressed in others. \nIn the liver, there was a high degree of correlation between the expression levels of many UGT enzymes within the same individual, suggesting a common mechanism of transcriptional regulation.  The hepatic expression of UGTs is known to be transcriptionally regulated by ligand-activated and liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs).  The hepatic transcriptional regulation of several UGTs has been partially described, with UGT2B10 a notable exception.  UGT2B10 exhibits glucuronidation activity against pharmacological substrates (olanzapine), toxins (nicotine), and carcinogens (NNAL), suggesting that inter-individual variability in the expression of this gene may affect both drug metabolism and cancer risk. We hypothesized that transcriptional regulatory mechanisms contribute to the observed interindividual variability in UGT2B10 mRNA expression levels.  Through luciferase assays and DNaseI footprint analysis, a region between -180 bp and -250 bp upstream from the transcription start site was identified as the UGT2B10 core promoter element.  Subsequent gel shift and supershift analyses determined that the Oct-1 and HNF3\u03b1 proteins were capable of binding to these elements.  Mutation of the HNF3\u03b1 site in the +27bp/-1948bp UGT2B10 promoter construct led to a 49% decrease in promoter activity, and mutation of the Oct-1 site led to a 61% decrease (p=0.0095 and p=0.0004, respectively).  The Oct-1/HNF3\u03b1 double mutant further reduced UGT2B10 promoter activity to 18% of the WT construct (p=0.0002).  The HNF3\u03b1 protein is an LETF, and future studies will be conducted to determine whether variants of HNF3\u03b1 are associated with UGT2B10 expression levels in human liver, as this may be an important contributor to the observed inter-individual differences in expression.\nIn addition to LETFs, UGTs are also regulated by ligand-activated transcription factors.  In particular, UGT genes are known to be regulated by antioxidant response elements (AREs).  Phase II enzyme inducers such as L-sulforaphane (SFN) have been shown to induce transcription of UGTs through the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (nrf2)/ARE pathway.  The UGT2B10 enzyme detoxifies carcinogens, making it important to understand how it is being regulated in response to phase II enzyme inducers s as this could influence the carcinogenicity of these compounds.  In the current studies, several putative ARE sites were identified in the UGT2B10 promoter and were hypothesized to be regulated by the nrf2/ARE pathway.  UGT2B10 expression was found to be significantly decreased in response to SFN treatment (52%, p=0.008).  The repression effect was present even after siRNA knockdown of nrf2, indicating that this effect was occurring via an nrf2-independent mechanism.  Using luciferase assays, the promoter element responsible for the repression was localized to a 976 bp region between -973 bp and -1948 bp upstream of the transcription start site.  Future studies will be needed to elucidate the regulatory factors that are binding and initiating this repression.  The repression of UGT2B10 expression via SFN may represent an additional mechanism that is contributing to inter-individual differences in expression.  \nAnother potential regulator of inter-individual differences in glucuronidation is alternative splicing.  An alternative exon 5 in the common region of the UGT1A gene cluster leads to the expression of 18 additional mRNA species from this locus.  The alternative splice isoforms have a dominant-negative effect on the wild type (WT) isoforms in vitro.  We hypothesized that inter-individual variation in the relative abundance of WT and splice variant expression affects glucuronidation capacity in human liver, which could carry important pharmacogenetic implications.  In these studies, it was determined that UGT1A splice variants, on average, represent less than 7% of the total UGT1A transcript profile in human liver for all hepatic UGT1A species, with relatively low inter-individual variability in expression between different individuals.  A consistent pattern was observed in several extrahepatic tissues as well.  UGT1A WT and splice variant expression were both correlated with glucuronidation activity.  Sequence alignment of the UGT1A alternative exon 5 with the primate-specific alu transposable element revealed that it is a recent evolutionary event, and it displays a low inclusion rate characteristic of similar exons.  Alu-derived exons are usually neutral or only slightly deleterious because the novel, alternatively spliced product represents only a small percentage of the total mRNA species.  For this reason, the proteins they encode have often been characterized as nonfunctional, evolutionary intermediates.\nThis dissertation research has contributed to the understanding of mechanisms underlying UGT gene expression.  Studies examining the inter-individual expression patterns of UGT enzymes in human tissues, an analysis of the importance of UGT1A alternative splice variants and how they affect glucuronidation capacity in human liver, and an assessment of the transcriptional regulation of the UGT2B10 promoter by LETFs and SFN were performed in this work. Together these data have improved our knowledge of how inter-individual differences in the expression of metabolizing enzymes are manifested and how these differences may potentially play a role in drug and carcinogen metabolism, personalized medicine, and cancer risk assessment. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7088], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Nathan Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Nathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip Lazarus, Ph D", "Philip Lazarus, Ph D", "Jong Kak Yun", "John Peter Richie Jr.", "Thomas E Spratt", "Richard Robert Young"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Philip Lazarus, Ph D, Dissertation Advisor", "Philip Lazarus, Ph D, Committee Chair", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member", "John Peter Richie Jr., Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member", "Richard Robert Young, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["UDP-glucuronosyltransferase", "expression", "transcriptional regulation", "alternative splicing", "pharmacogenetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "PERCEPTIONS OF TRUSTWORTHINESS IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A SMALL\nCOMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER: IMPLICATIONS FOR ORGANIZATIONAL DIRECTION\n\n\n", "id": "12103", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4662", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Trust is a topic that has evolved from more of a psychological phenomenon associated primarily with personal relationships to a more broadly understood variable in development and maintenance of workplace relationships.

These themes were synthesized into four areas of discussion: 1) its strategic focus areas as articulated in the current plan, 2) community impact, 3) leadership at the administrative level, and 4) opportunity for more intentional work around interpersonal trust development.  The results reflect important connections and disconnections in the reflections of the senior leadership team, the executive director, her peer, and the chair of the board.  The identification of these connections and disconnections become even more important in the context of the Center\u2019s aspiration to become a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) and reflect the opportunity for further qualitative research into trust development and its implication on organizational direction. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4628], "author_name_tesi": "Jones, Norm Jay", "last_name_ssi": "Jones", "middle_name_ssi": "Jay", "first_name_ssi": "Norm", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William J Rothwell", "William J Rothwell", "Judith Ann Kolb", "Keith B Wilson", "Wesley Edward Donahue"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William J Rothwell, Dissertation Advisor", "William J Rothwell, Committee Chair", "Judith Ann Kolb, Committee Member", "Keith B Wilson, Committee Member", "Wesley Edward Donahue, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["interpersonal trust", "organizational leadership", "leadership", "organizational direction", "organizational culture", "trust and strategic planning", "trust"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A Newly Discovered Compositional Approach to Birdsong: La Fauvette Passerinette of Olivier Messiaen", "id": "14904qmj5010", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14904", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "        While working with Messiaen\u2019s birdsong notebooks in 2012, Peter Hill discovered a new birdsong composition for solo piano, spread out over three separate notebooks (Mss 23020, 23023, 23072).

First, research has shown that emergency crisis management (ECM) work involves teams and \u201cteams of teams\u201d.  Yet, there are few models of naturalistic decision systems (i.e., crisis-management) that allow multiple teams to work collectively.  Research efforts in modeling the ECM work domain typically involve single team-based simulations.  However, few simulations have been designed to study multiple teams operating simultaneously.  \n\nSecondly, previous efforts in supporting teamwork have involved the development of decision-aids; however, a prevalent problem with team decision aids is the requirement of rigid and stable information needed to make decisions.  The ECM work domain is highly dynamic with incomplete and ambiguous information.  Consequently, decision-aids within the ECM domain oftentimes make inaccurate and erroneous recommendations.  An alternative design that makes use of contextualized information could be more effective. \n\nThe aforementioned problems are addressed by 1.) the development of a simulation studying teams operating in an ECM work domain, and 2.) the conducting of an experiment to investigate the effect a decision-aid has on teamwork.  The first objective of the research involved designing a simulation that effectively mimics ECM operations.  Hence, the research constructed NeoCITIES as a crisis management scaled world to study team decision-making for a variety of examinations related to HCI and CSE suppositions.  \n\nThe second objective of the research included the development of a decision-aid that utilizes contextualized information.  Specifically, a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) that handles dynamic and incomplete information was developed to function as a decision-aid supporting teams operating within the NeoCITIES simulation.  \n\nLastly, the research includes an examination of the efficacy of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) decision aid on teamwork within NeoCITIES. The study measures whether the presence of a FCM improves decision-making involving resource allocation amongst teams. Experimental sessions using undergraduate students enrolled at Pennsylvania State University provided data to measure team performance and team cognition.  \n\nThe contributions of the research are threefold.

Secondly, the research assesses the functional use of fuzzy cognitive mapping to serve as a decision-aid for teams.

HBV replicates a DNA genome through reverse transcription of a pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) by using a multi-functional viral polymerase (HP). A critical function of HP is its specific association with a viral RNA signal termed \u03b5 (H\u03b5) located on pgRNA, which is required for specific packaging of pgRNA into viral nucleocapsids and initiation of viral reverse transcription. HP initiates reverse transcription by using itself as a protein primer (protein priming) and H\u03b5 as the template. HP is made up of four domains including the terminal protein (TP), the spacer, the reverse transcriptase (RT), and the RNase H domains. We purified HP from human cells that retained H\u03b5 binding activity in vitro. Furthermore, HP purified in a complex with H\u03b5, but not HP alone, displayed protein priming activity using Mg2+ as a required co-factor. In contrast to H\u03b5-dependent protein priming in the presence of Mg2+, we discovered a Mn2+-dependent transferase activity of HP that was independent of H\u03b5 but required HP as a protein primer. Both the H\u03b5-dependent and \u2013independent in vitro protein priming assays were used to demonstrate that the majority of the HP sequences was required for protein priming. Specific residues within TP, RT, and the spacer were identified as critical for HP-H\u03b5 binding and/or protein priming. The newly developed priming assay can also be used to identify antiviral compounds that inhibit priming and study their mechanisms of action. All but two of the current antiviral drugs for the treatment of chronic HBV infection are nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) that inhibit the DNA synthesis activity of HP.

The proposed mechanism of metastasis involves aggressive, free-floating spheroid-like cellular aggregates that shed from the primary tumor, survive for some time in anchorage independence and eventually invade the omentum of the peritoneal cavity and nearby organs. Preliminary data revealed an upregulation of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD2) in ovarian cancer spheroids and confirmed its recently emerging, dichotomous role as a tumor promoter. We hypothesized that sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a key regulator of SOD2, would similarly be increased in spheroids and help to promote ovarian cancer metastasis. While we observed the SIRT3 protein increase in ovarian cancer spheroids, we unexpectedly saw \u2013 upon generating SIRT3 shRNA-mediated knockdown cells \u2013 an increase in metastatic functions such as migration and proliferation. These data point to a tumor suppressive function of SIRT3 in ovarian cancer, as previously established in breast cancer. Interestingly, bioenergetics analysis characterized SIRT3 knockdown cells as having increased rates of glycolysis and glucose-dependent mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, they displayed a dependency on glucose for cell survival, while those cells with SIRT3 expression were able to survive in glucose-depleted conditions. These results may hint at clues as to why ovarian cancer spheroids increase expression of SIRT3 during the anchorage-independent stage of metastasis in the ascites fluid-containing peritoneal cavity. Efforts are underway to establish if a transient increase in SIRT3 during this anchorage-independent spheroid stage enhances cellular metabolic flexibility to rely on alternate fuel sources in situations of glucose deprivation, as may be the case in the ascites fluid.

However, little is known about these spouses\u2019 (almost exclusively women) experiences and the challenges they face.  This study provides insight into these experiences and challenges by developing an Expatriate Frame Management Theory of Acculturation.  The theory is grounded in the experiences of 37 American expatriate spouses (all women) living in The Netherlands.  In-depth interviews and on-site observations enabled the women to explore their experiences of expatriation in The Netherlands.  This study was an inductive approach to determining the key domains of expatriate experience and how these domains influence the acculturation of the women.  Three key, first-order domains of experience for the expatriate spouse emerged: Cultural Challenges, Coping Strategies, and Identity.  Each domain encompassed subcategories and concepts deriving from the narratives of the expatriate spouses.  As these domains emerged, an on-going second-order analysis led to the identification of the core variable, Frame Management.  This core variable formed the foundation of Expatriate Frame Management Theory.  Expatriate Frame Management Theory captures important dimensions of the process of acculturation.  The theory builds from three central constructs derived from the first-order domains: frame incongruencies, frame management strategies, and personal adaptation.  Frame incongruencies are misalignments among the expatriate spouses\u2019 frames and those enacted by the host country nationals.  These incongruencies create uncertainty and dissonance for the spouse which, if salient, she will want to alleviate.  This may spark the need for her to alter, or manage frames so she can achieve a sense of fit, or personal adaptation, in the new culture.  Thus, this study offers both a typology of expatriate issues and a process theory of how expatriate spouses manage these issues through the management of their frames.

The current ethos surrounding sports is one of individualism, instrumentalism, and market efficiency.  This perspective led to a morally troublesome hyper-competitive orientation toward sports.  Characterized by a win-at-all-costs, individualistically motivated attitude, our instrumental perspective of sports caused their morally educative potential (if indeed any exists at all) to be inadequately realized. This study constitutes a reassessment of sport\u2019s potential to act as a resource for promoting moral education employing perspectives provided by virtue ethics in general and \u2018existential\u2019 authenticity and civic virtue specifically.\nFollowing an introductory chapter outlining the sequence of my overall argument, the second chapter will provide a snapshot of moral life for modern Americans, effectively substantiating the need for my research.  Relying on the work of prominent social theorists and commentators, chapter two will be a brief analysis of American morality, noting the rise, entrenchment, and consequences of our individualistic commitment to private gain and personal success.  Chapter two will conclude with a discussion of the previous efforts in American history to appropriate sports as a technology to help articulate and institute a shared moral philosophy.  Although never fully realizing their aim, these previous attempts to utilize sports as a form of social and moral development show the necessity, and provide a precedent, for investigations into the intersections between American moral and sporting lives.  \nHowever, my efforts to review the historical practice of using sports as a vehicle for teaching core moral values, such as hard-work, determination, and perseverance, represents only the beginning of the discussion.  Thus in chapter three I will identify and review three foundational theoretical approaches relating to the \u2018sports as a moral laboratory\u2019 metaphor that have been developed within the philosophy of sports literature, namely: (1) Sports as Equality and Justice, (2) Sports as a Domain of Play, and (3) Sports as the Mutual Quest for Excellence.  Taken together, these opening three chapters will form the theoretical framework within which I will situate my own approach.  \nChapter four will outline the ethical theory I used to substantiate my claim that sports promote the development of authenticity and civic virtue as I have described them.  I will begin by showing the utility of virtue ethics in general, and finish the chapter by examining the cogency of a specifically \u2018existential\u2019 virtue ethics, where existential authenticity is considered the primary virtue, and civic virtue the primary mode of expression in practice.  Assuming an existential understanding of the human condition \u2013 as being intersubjectively constituted \u2013 I will explain how existential authenticity can be considered the cardinal virtue in an existential virtue theory, and why the practice of civic virtue, or engagement, should be considered its fullest expression.\nChapter five comprises perhaps the most important contribution in this discussion: my analysis of sports and MacIntyrean virtue ethics, and their convergence with existential authenticity and civic virtue.  Following an evaluation of how MacIntyrean virtue ethics inform the quest for morally educative experiences in sporting situations, the first half of the chapter will conclude with a sketch of certain characteristics, attributes and dispositions displayed by the MacIntyrean athlete, in direct reference to the characteristic of virtue ethics outlined in chapter four.  \nThe second half of chapter five begins with a description of the convergence of sports and the existential principles introduced in chapter four, laying the groundwork for the argument that sports represent a valuable social practice in the promotion and development of an athlete\u2019s moral excellence. In order for sports to promote the choice of authenticity, and demonstration of civic virtue, caution and precision must be exercised in the way these concepts are presented, taught, learned and played.  In order to provide interested participants of sporting practices with a sense of how the arguments might be used in practical applications I will complete my analysis in this final chapter with a brief sketch of the characteristics and attributes that a virtuous existential athlete would exhibit in their ongoing development of their existential virtues.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16547], "author_name_tesi": "Jonsrud, Jarrod Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Jonsrud", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Jarrod", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["R.

The new method is found to perform dramatically better than conventional methods when projecting to 1999 from selected base years in the past. Projecting forward from 1999, the research estimated the cumulative contribution of Mexican immigrant fertility from the 1980s to 2040 of 36 million births, including 25% to 50% more births after 1995 than are projected using conventional methods. The second paper consists of a decomposition analysis of the recent U.S. TFR into fertility and composition effects of Mexican-born and other foreign-born immigrants. The results show that 6% of the U.S. TFR is attributable to a higher ASFR of immigrant women. About 63% of the foreign-born effect in 1990 and 71% in 2000 is attributable to Mexican-born woman. Approximately 11% of the Mexican-born contribution to the TFR is due to an age composition of the Mexican-born that favors the high-ASFR ages. The large increase in the size of the foreign-born population in the U.S. from 1990\u20132000 is mostly offset by reduced TFR of both the foreign-born and the native-born population. Finally the dissertation explores the usability of vital rates in combination with registered number of vital events to estimate the Mexican-born population in the U.S. The results show that the intuitively simple and mathematically sound method is unsuitable for population estimates when mortality rates are bias and sampling error reduces the preciseness of fertility rates. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5597], "author_name_tesi": "Jonsson, Stefan  Hrafn", "last_name_ssi": "Jonsson", "middle_name_ssi": "Hrafn", "first_name_ssi": "Stefan ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Lynne Van Hook", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa", "Gordon F De Jong", "Suet Ling Pong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Dissertation Advisor", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Committee Chair", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa, Committee Member", "Gordon F De Jong, Committee Member", "Suet Ling Pong, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Foreign-born", "Mexican-born", "immigration", "Fertility"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "FACTORS IMPACTING STUDENT REPORTING BULLYING OR CYBERBULLYING TO SCHOOL PERSONNEL", "id": "14230huj130", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14230", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine if school personnel-student relationships (supportive teachers and adults at school) are associated with student reporting of bullying or cyberbullying incidents to school personnel after controlling for individual characteristics (sex, race, grade level, and academic achievement), seriousness of victimization (frequency, multiple victimization, fear, and avoidance), and school environment (school rule clarity and fairness, school guideline on safety, and school neighborhood safety).

Optimal Pareto solution sets are obtained for each system.  Finally, the application of ATSV to more complicated continuous thrust spacecraft maneuvers is considered.  The identification of a known optimal solution is followed by modification of the equations of motion to include a discrete hardware-side design variable, namely, engine type.  Optimal solutions are located for each corresponding design variable option.  A study is performed to understand the sensitivity of optimal trajectories to perturbations of the initial orbit.

Using Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), this thesis examines the structure of variability of the gait cycle in human locomotion.  Three experiments were carried out to address several issues: 1) are long range correlations present in the fluctuations of the running gait,  2) are long range correlations present in gait variables other than the stride interval, 3) what is the influence of speed of locomotion on the scaling behavior of the gait cycle fluctuations, and, 4) what is the relationship between stability and long range correlations?  Experiment 1 examines the fluctuations in a range of kinematic and kinetic gait cycle variables in walking at 60 through to 140% of preferred walking speed, while Experiment 2 investigates gait cycle fluctuations in running from 80 to 120% of preferred running speed.  The results reveal the presence of fractal-like scaling behavior in all variables investigated.  For many of both the walking and running gait variables, long range correlations follow a U-shaped function with speed and were minimized at preferred speeds of locomotion.  Thus, at preferred speeds, there are a larger number of timescales present in the motor out put which is suggestive of greater adaptability.  Experiment 3 examines the relationship between local dynamic stability, stability of the movement pattern, and the long range correlations of the gait cycle while walking and running at speeds close to preferred transition speeds.  The results suggest that the scaling behavior of gait cycle fluctuations relates to the stability of the gait cycle.  Collectively the findings indicate that DFA is revealing about the number of degrees of freedom available under given conditions, or conversely the degree of constraint that results from a set of conditions.  An alternative but not mutually exclusive possibility is that the correlations are related to the degree of active control associated with locomotion under different circumstances.

In comparison, the rate of meaningful information extraction has been rather slow. One of the key reasons is that digital data usually comes in multiple modalities or media forms (i.e. text, images, video), thus making it difficult for\ngeneric information extraction methods to be used across multiple media. Moreover, extraction of precise semantics from multimedia largely remains an open problem. A large amount of multi-dimensional and multi-spectral data is being acquired and used in specialized domains such as medical science, surveillance and astronomy. The\npresence of multiple dimensions and multi-spectral information poses yet another challenge for certain special kinds of image analysis\napplications. In spite of the challenges there is a growing demand for computer intervention in all these aspects. In this thesis, I present\nmy research in multi-dimensional image modeling and multimedia information integration. I begin by characterizing image retrieval in the real world from a user and system perspective. Next, I will\npresent a conceptually clean hidden Markov model based framework to model multi-dimensional image data. Extension of the Markovian property to a third dimension dramatically increases the computational challenge for estimation of model parameters. I have developed a locally optimal but scalable parameter estimation algorithm for two\nand three dimensional hidden Markov models (2-D and 3-D HMMs).

In a special scenario, the process of image ranking bears an interesting analogy to obtaining the stationary distribution of a\nrandom walk performed in the image similarity space.

The force field parameters for Al/Si/O interactions were trained against a DFT data set consisting of equations of states and heats of formation of bulk zeolite crystal phases. The accuracy of trained force field parameters was tested by comparing ReaxFF activation energies with QM calculations for the most important chemical reactions that occur during catalytic cracking of alkanes and alkenes. Before simulating hydrocarbon cracking reactions at elevated temperatures, MD calculations were performed to investigate the effect of temperature and dopants on the stability and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite. The simulations indicate that iron and aluminum doped HZSM-5 zeolite is stable below 3500K on MD time-scale. Beyond 3500K, the framework starts melting; this melting process is characterized by sudden inward collapse of the framework.  The acidity of the framework is temperature dependent and heating HZSM-5 zeolite above 1000K can significantly alter the hydrocarbon cracking chemistry. Adsorption energies of linear alkanes inside the pores of HZSM-5 zeolite were evaluated using MD-base energy minimizer. The current set of force field parameters accurately predict that adsorption energy increases with the increase in the alkane chain length. MD simulations were performed to evaluate diffusion coefficients of butane, hexane, octane and decane molecules inside MFI and TON zeolite. For fast moving shorter alkanes, ReaxFF\u2019s predictions of diffusion coefficients are in good agreement with experimental results.

(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is an economically important internal fruit-feeding pest of apples. It causes significant damage to apples, and if populations are not managed, the infestation in apples can be as high as 100 percent. In Pennsylvania, while it has been a significant pest in all apple growing regions across the state, it began to re-emerge as a serious pest and causes significant fruit damage in the late 1990\u2019s.\nEffectiveness of different types of commercial sex-pheromone- and kairomone-based lures for attracting codling moth adults may vary under different pest management practices. The attractiveness of four types of codling moth lures (CM L2 Long-Life\u00ae, CM 10X Megalure\u00ae, Pherocon CM DA\u00ae, and Pherocon CM-DA Combo\u00ae) was evaluated in commercial apple orchards either treated with sex pheromone mating disruption (MD) or only conventional insecticides (non-MD) in Adams County, Pennsylvania in 2006 and 2007. On the basis of mean seasonal weekly moth capture as well as mean cumulative moth capture, the CM DA Combo and CM L2 lures were found significantly more effective for monitoring CM adults in both MD and non-MD orchards. In contrast, the CM DA and CM 10X lures were not as effective in either type of orchard.\nAccurately predicting the timing of CM adult flight and egg-hatch allows growers to understand and control local populations of this pest in their orchards. Currently, the PETE (prediction extension timing estimator) model is used to predict life cycle events for many fruit pests across different fruit growing regions. Experimental results revealed that the currently used CM-PETE model does not accurately predict CM adult flight in apple orchards of Pennsylvania. The flight curves of CM for first and second generations predicted by the PA constrained and unconstrained models showed significant differences in flight patterns from the CM-PETE model. The newly developed PA CM flight models predicted delays in moth emergence for both generations. In other findings, the flight patterns of females were different between commercial and abandoned orchards. Concurrent estimates of azinphosmethyl insecticide effectiveness (adult topical assays) on trapped moths showed increased levels of resistance in individuals captured in commercial orchards than abandoned orchards.\nPredicting the timing of egg hatch events for CM will allow growers to effectively optimize their use of insecticides that are directed towards this most vulnerable life stage. The results of a series of field and laboratory observations conducted in 2007 and 2008 on oviposition and daily egg hatch of CM in apple orchards of Pennsylvania showed significant deviation from the predicted egg hatch generated by the CM-PETE model. The new PA unconstrained model showed a delayed cumulative percent egg hatch when compared to the old model (CM-PETE) for both generations. \nLaboratory results of no-choice and multiple-choice tests for oviposition preferences of adult moths revealed that CM preferred \u2018Golden Delicious\u2019, \u2018Fuji\u2019 and \u2018Stayman\u2019 over other cultivars, viz. \u2018Arlet\u2019, \u2018Honeycrisp\u2019, \u2018Pristine\u2019, and \u2018Sunrise\u2019 for oviposition. Based on the oviposition preferences from these bioassays, a CM oviposition susceptibility index for each cultivar was developed. This index may be used as a standard measure in cultivar evaluations and may assist fruit growers and consultants to select the most appropriate cultivar(s) for monitoring and detecting the initial signs of fruit injury from this pest in an apple orchard planted with mix-cultivars.  \nA comparative study of pest management and extension services in Pennsylvania (USA) and Uttarakhand (India) revealed similar basic concepts of pest management, pest phenology model development and model implementation process, but different implementation channels as well as differences in the basic framework of extension systems designed for the pest management practices in apple growing regions of these two different geographic regions.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4639], "author_name_tesi": "Joshi, Neelendra K", "last_name_ssi": "Joshi", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Neelendra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edwin George Rajotte", "Edwin George Rajotte", "Larry Allen Hull", "Grzegorz Krawczyk", "Dennis D Calvin", "James Rawlinson Schupp", "Thomas Henry Bruening"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edwin George Rajotte, Dissertation Advisor", "Edwin George Rajotte, Committee Chair", "Larry Allen Hull, Committee Chair", "Grzegorz Krawczyk, Committee Member", "Dennis D Calvin, Committee Member", "James Rawlinson Schupp, Committee Member", "Thomas Henry Bruening, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["susceptibility index", "apple cultivars", "phenology", "codling moth", "pheromone lures"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Morphological Changes in Goethite during Atom Exchange with Aqueous Fe2+", "id": "25092", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11219", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Iron (Fe) (oxyhydr)oxides play important, dynamic roles in the biogeochemical cycling of trace elements, nutrients, and radionuclides, especially under reducing conditions. Recent work has shown that when goethite, a common Fe hydroxide, is exposed to aqueous Fe2+, it undergoes extensive atom exchange, as evidenced by Fe isotope tracer experiments. The effect of Fe atom exchange on the goethite is currently unclear - some studies observed no differences between the original and final exchanged goethite, while others saw evidence of particle growth. Here, we hypothesized that Fe2+-goethite atom exchange does indeed result in detectable changes.  To test this hypothesis, we reacted nanoscale goethite, (rod-like crystals, 107 nm by 20 nm) with aqueous Fe2+ at pH 7.0 over 60 days and used high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) to see changes in particle shape, size, and structure at intermediate time points. Over 60 days, we observed that goethite nanoparticles became smaller and then regrew, while forming oriented aggregates. At the start of atom exchange, goethite nanoparticles dissolved to produce much smaller particles (<30 nm long, <3 nm wide) until 40 days. As exchange proceeded, particles started regrowing and approached their original dimensions. Dissolution and regrowth occurred over both the length and width of the nanoparticle. Using cryo-TEM, we observed that as goethite nanoparticles regrew, they aggregated along the longitudinal edge, forming \u201cbundles\u201d of attached nanorods. These time-resolved changes in size and aggregation behavior show that goethite-aqueous Fe2+ atom exchange occurs via both dissolution-reprecipitation and oriented aggregation. To see if these particle changes affect the crystal coordinate chemistry of Fe in goethite over the course of atom exchange, we used M\u04e7ssbauer spectroscopy. M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of the original, reacted and control goethite were indistinguishable at t = 10 days suggesting that there is no mineralogical change in goethite during couple shrinking regrowth and oriented aggregation. In addition to microscopy, we used a 55Fe isotopic tracer method to quantify the fraction of goethite involved in atom exchange. We found that nanoscale goethite undergoes 6.3% exchange over 30 days at pH 7.0. Our observations suggest that Fe atom exchange proceeds via dissolution followed by a combination of coarsening and oriented aggregation.

Recent work has found that iron oxides such as goethite and magnetite, previously thought to be stable, may recrystallize in reducing redox conditions without undergoing overt changes in morphology, structure, and reactivity as measured by chemical dissolution rates. This process, referred to as Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization, can result in the release/uptake of ions (e.g, Cu or\nU) into/from the surrounding water, thus affecting water quality. Recrystallization may also affect the use of iron oxides as paleoenvironmental proxies due to the alteration of the oxides\u2019 isotopic and elemental composition post formation. The goal of this dissertation was to elucidate the kinetics and mechanisms of recrystallization in order to account for this process in the fields of water quality and paleoenvironmental reconstructions.\n\nIn Chapter 2 of this dissertation, I examined the morphological changes in goethite nanoparticles over the course of recrystallization. Previous studies observed no substantial changes between goethite before and after recrystallization. Here, I investigated if changes were occurring in the morphology and aggregation of goethite nanoparticles at intermediate time points during the goethite-aqueous Fe2+ reaction using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryogenic-TEM. The goethite particle morphology changed anisotropically over 30 days, suggesting that multiple transformation mechanisms may  be  occurring.\n\nIn chapters 3 and 4, I investigated the kinetics of recrystallization. Based on a multiple tracer addition experiment, goethite was observed to become less susceptible to recrystallization over time. Box models were constructed to infer the kinetics of recrystal-\n \nlization; the results of the fitting suggested that <20% of goethite recrystallized over 60 days, which was a much lower estimate that previous studies. These two studies together suggested that Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization may be important only over short time pe- riods. Using box models, a better constrained approach to quantification of the extent and rate  was developed.\n\nChapters 5 and 6 focused on the mechanisms of recrystallization. In Chapter 5, I proposed that recrystallization was driven by mineral crystallinity. To test this hypothesis, I reinterpreted the isotopic data reported by previous studies that varied mineral structure on the basis of aging, metal substitution, and the isotopic data reported for hematite and magnetite. The results of fitting indicated that the kinetics of recrystallization were inversely related to the crystallinity of the unrecrystallized mineral. In the final chapter of this dis- sertation, halite was developed as a model system to further investigate the mechanisms and controls on stable mineral recrystallization using a combined isotopic and microscopic approach.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16548], "author_name_tesi": "Joshi, Prachi ", "last_name_ssi": "Joshi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Prachi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Aaron Gorski", "Christopher Aaron Gorski", "Matthew S Fantle", "William D Burgos", "Peter J Heaney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Aaron Gorski, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Aaron Gorski, Committee Chair", "Matthew S Fantle, Committee Member", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "Peter J Heaney, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Iron oxides", "Iron chemistry", "Geochemistry", "Mineral processes", "Nanoparticles"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Effect of Environment on The Transport Properties of Graphene Devices\n", "id": "11024", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4970", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis discusses the effect of environment on the transport properties of graphene devices. A process for making contacts to graphene, that is free of lithography protocols, has been devised. It has been shown that it is possible, using this process, to make two and four terminal graphene devices (chapter 2). \n\nIn-vacuo investigation of the transport properties of graphene field effect devices show surface states of SiO2 can transfer electronic charge to graphene and it is expected that graphene devices on clean SiO2 surfaces be n-type. This is a view that is also supported by ab-initio molecular dynamic and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Based on these experimental and theoretical results, a simple electrostatic model for graphene on SiO2 is presented (chapter 3).\n\nGate voltage dependent hysteresis has been studied on graphene devices in which the SiO2 surface has been given different surface treatments that remove H2O molecules from the SiO2 surface. Two kinds of hysteresis are observed, charge neutrality point (CNP) hysteresis (due to loosely bound dipolar adsorbates) that gets suppressed upon dehydration, and transconductance hysteresis (due to near surface electron traps) that depends on the gate voltage sweep rate and is not suppressed upon dehydration of the devices (chapter 4).\n\nWhen n-type graphene devices are exposed to inert gases such as N2, Ar, He, Xe and Kr, the CNP is seen to shift to positive gate voltages, without much change in the minimum conductivity. The time scale of observation is of the order of days. Inert gases are not expected to dope the graphene devices. The CNP shift can be reversed by annealing the devices in vacuum. It is hypothesized that water molecules get trapped between the graphene and SiO2 and give rise to the CNP shift. A coverage of ~0.06 H2O molecules per hexagon is calculated based on the CNP shift (chapter 5).\n\nGraphene devices are exposed to dilute mixtures of NH3 in He. Upon exposure to NH3, the CNP of these devices are found to shift to negative gate voltages, indicating that NH3 is an electron donating molecule. Based on the CNP shift and themodynamic data for NH3 adsorption on graphite, a weak charge transfer of ~0.06e per NH3 molecule is calculated. Desorption of NH3 from the graphene device, as seen by recovery of the CNP, shows a double exponential behavior that resembles 1-D Fickian diffusion of NH3 at the graphene - SiO2 interface.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4947], "author_name_tesi": "Joshi, Prasoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Joshi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Prasoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Suman Datta", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Jun Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Dissertation Advisor", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Chair", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member", "Jun Zhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Substrate Effects", "Chemical Sensing", "Nanotechnology", "Graphene", "Low - Dimensional Systems"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "EVALUATING THE DETERMINANTS OF A SUCCESSFUL ORGAN DONOR\nPROCESS IN A MULTI-HOSPITAL SYSTEM\n", "id": "7215", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4332", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\n   The disparity between the demand for cadaveric organs and the number of available organs in the United States remains significant.

Opponents of perfectionism warned that it generated far-reaching collateral damage by shoring up dogmatism, delusions of infallibility, servile conformity, and false narratives about the commensurability of discrete life plans. Beyond these side effects, they cautioned that perfectionism inherently abrogates valuable conditions of a flourishing human life: receptivity to beauty, the capacity to express choice, and the importance of dynamic transformation. Even these anti-perfectionism arguments, however, were prone to concealing the perils of perfectionism because their abstract level of argumentation evaded the contingencies and contradictions that arose when actualized in experience. Nineteenth-century novels fleshed out these problems. William Makepeace Thackeray\u2019s Vanity Fair shows how perfectionism spawns obsessional attachments that ultimately corrode self-respect and enervate ambition. George Eliot portrays perfectionism as fortifying egoism and deflecting recognition of irreconcilable conflicts. Oscar Wilde\u2019s novel and prison letter depict the devastating effects of being locked in the stasis of perfection. Even outside of canonical texts, Victorian pornography explores the anti-utopian realities of bodily decay.  Taken together, these works invite a recognition of the vulnerability of human life and recommend an ethics that responds to and ameliorates suffering, rather than aspiring to flawlessness.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10981], "author_name_tesi": "Joudrey, Thomas Jau", "last_name_ssi": "Joudrey", "middle_name_ssi": "Jau", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Lougy", "Nicholas A Joukovsky", "Robert Lawrence Caserio Jr.", "Emily Harrington", "Martina Kolb"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Lougy, Dissertation Advisor", "Nicholas A Joukovsky, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Lawrence Caserio Jr., Committee Member", "Emily Harrington, Committee Member", "Martina Kolb, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Victorian", "Perfection"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Scaling, complexity, and stochasticity of urban watersheds", "id": "14027txj155", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14027", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Urban watersheds are complex coupled natural-human (CNH) systems. One general approach to studying and understanding CNH systems is through the identification, characterization, and modeling of emergent properties, i.e., properties that appear at the larger, integrated spatial and/or temporal scale. Such an approach serves as an alternative to modeling the governing human processes in the CNH system which are often intractable from a mathematical and quantitative perspective. My goal with this Ph.D. research was to study, identify, and assess key emergent properties of urban watersheds by focusing the analysis and exploration on temporal and spatial scaling, flow complexity, and hydroclimatic stochasticity. To achieve this goal, I used a variety of tools and perspectives involving data analytics, process-based modeling, and stochastic differential equations, keeping in mind that urban watershed response is dominated by nonstationarities, structural and spatial heterogeneities, and nonlinearities. Thus far, the role played by scaling, complexity, and stochasticity has been studied primarily in the context of natural watersheds. My Ph.D. research extended the interpretation and applicability of scaling, complexity, and stochasticity to urban watersheds, hoping that eventually they may be of utility to scientists, engineers and policy makers trying to improve the design, planning and monitoring of urban watersheds. I believe this is important since the sustainability of our planet is in no small measure tied to the sustainability of our cities.  \nWith this dissertation, I accomplished four distinct research objectives. For the first objective, I used data analytics to study and characterize the temporal scaling of urban watersheds, and assess the potential of temporal scaling to exhibit gradient behavior across urban watersheds. For the second objective, I used data analytics to quantify and characterize the statistical complexity of streamflow records from urban watersheds. For the third objective, I implemented a stochastic, mechanistic hydrological model, based on the theory of stochastic differential equations, to assess the relative importance of climate and urbanization in urban flow regimes. In the fourth objective, I developed and implemented a network-based hydrologic engineering model to study and model multicomponent (superdistributed) stormwater watershed systems. In particular, the goal here was to use the model to quantify and assess the spatial and dynamic properties of urban stormwater networks. \nBy viewing urban watersheds as CNH, sharing key properties associated with complex systems, I found that multifractality, scaling, complexity and stochasticity can be used to study and understand the hydrological behavior of urban watersheds. For example, I found that streamflow records in urban basins exhibit temporal scaling, and that temporal scaling in addition to complexity can be used as streamflow indicators of hydrological alteration. I have also shown that using a stochastic representation of urban streamflow dynamics can be useful to disentangling the impacts of climate from those related to urbanization in urbanizing watersheds. Finally, I found that urban watersheds can exhibit spatial scaling behavior. All of the analysis and modeling performed in this dissertation took a long-term perspective of urban watersheds, which is essential for informing environmental sustainability in urban watersheds. I hope that the analysis and methods developed in this dissertation may eventually be of utility to scientists, planners and engineers concerned with future of urban areas.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15417], "author_name_tesi": "Jovanovic, Tijana ", "last_name_ssi": "Jovanovic", "first_name_ssi": "Tijana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alfonso Mejia", "Alfonso Mejia", "Peggy Johnson", "Christofer Duffy", "Heather Gall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alfonso Mejia, Dissertation Advisor", "Alfonso Mejia, Committee Chair", "Peggy Johnson, Committee Member", "Christofer Duffy, Committee Member", "Heather Gall, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["urban hydrology", "urbanization", "temporal scaling", "spatial scaling", "complexity", "entropy", "stochasticity", "land use land cover change"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Third Parties and the Dynamics of War Expansion", "id": "8794", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3323", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project develops a theoretical model of war expansion to explain four interrelated puzzles: 1) Why do some interstate wars expand while others do not; that is, why and under what circumstances do third parties join ongoing wars?

First, I developed an agent-based computational model of war expansion, from which I ran computer simulations under different parameter configurations to generate the emergent behavioral patterns of war expansion. These emergent patterns served as theoretical predictions (or hypotheses) that should emerge in the world under parallel conditions. Second, I subjected the hypotheses derived from the agent-based model to empirical evaluation using statistical analysis in order to evaluate how well the predictions of the agent-based model withstood the empirical scrutiny of real world data.\n\nThe findings suggest: 1) third parties are most likely to join an ongoing war when they have a larger ability to influence the outcome of the war, 2) third parties are most likely to join the side they prefer to win the war, 3) third parties are most likely to join in the early stages of the war and less likely to join as a war persists, and 4) wars that expanded are characterized by balancing and counter-balancing dynamics, meaning that, third parties are more likely to balance (join the weaker side) in the early part of the war, then counter-balance (join the stronger side) in the middle part of the war, and then balance (join the weaker side) again towards the end of the war.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3309], "author_name_tesi": "Joyce, Kyle ", "last_name_ssi": "Joyce", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Bennett Jr.", "Douglas William Lemke", "Burt Monroe Iii", "Navin Bapat", "Tracy Mullen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Scott Bennett Jr., Committee Chair", "Douglas William Lemke, Committee Member", "Burt Monroe Iii, Committee Member", "Navin Bapat, Committee Member", "Tracy Mullen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["war expansion", "third party intervention", "agent-based modeling", "computational modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Simplifying Large Scale-free Networks by Optimizing The Information Content and Incomprehensibility", "id": "13006jpj5196", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13006", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Visualizations of networks are critical to gain insights into complex systems, however, a complex network, which contains billions of nodes and edges, is incomprehensible.

Despite this, isolated wetlands are rarely protected by federal and state legislation, and federal agencies do not assess their abundance when reporting national trends in wetland losses.  In this dissertation, I present the results from a field study that illustrates how the presence of small and isolated wetlands is important in maintaining populations of pond-breeding amphibians across the Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area located in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.  I found that stream connections at wetlands strongly influenced the occurrence patterns of five out of nine amphibian species studied, and species that bred earlier in the year were the most likely to occur at small and isolated wetlands.  I used occurrence patterns at surveyed wetlands to predict the presence of amphibian species across the entire study area, and estimated that two-thirds of all species would lose at least half of their breeding sites if either isolated wetlands or small wetlands (< 0.30 ha in size) were removed from this landscape.  I also characterized the abundance and sizes of isolated and non-isolated wetlands that could serve as amphibian breeding sites, and modeled the probability these wetlands were detected on wetland maps as a function of their size.  I found the majority of wetlands were small (< 0.5 ha) and isolated, and this trend was similar to several landscapes in the northeastern United States.  Thus, if these landscapes were to follow national trends in wetlands loss, approximately 21 wetlands smaller than 0.5 ha could be degraded or destroyed for every wetland larger than 0.5 ha.  Furthermore, I estimate this disparity could be twice as large because the rate small wetlands in this study area were included on wetland maps was considerably lower than inclusion rates for larger wetlands.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3028], "author_name_tesi": "Julian, James Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Julian", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Brooks", "Robert P Brooks", "Wayne Lawrence Myers", "Duane R Diefenbach", "Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Craig D Snyder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Brooks, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert P Brooks, Committee Chair", "Wayne Lawrence Myers, Committee Member", "Duane R Diefenbach, Committee Member", "Tracy Lee Langkilde, Committee Member", "Craig D Snyder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wetland loss", "occupancy model", "isolated wetlands", "amphibian", "landscape ecology"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "STRAIGHT VEGETABLE OIL AS A REPLACEMENT FUEL FOR DIESEL:  COMPARING TRACTOR PERFORMANCE AND FARM ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS\n", "id": "12582", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "945", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Straight vegetable oil (SVO) is a promising fuel alternative for diesel farm equipment and has the potential to replace petroleum diesel fuel in as little as one year for some farms. SVO is produced from oilseed crops, which can be grown and processed right on the farm, allowing farmers to have control over their fuel supply. While the feasibility of using vegetable oil as a fuel is well established, many questions remain regarding its power production, fuel efficiency, and cost effectiveness in comparison to petroleum diesel in full-scale agricultural equipment. \n\nUsing a New Holland T7060 tractor with an Elsbett fuel conversion kit for SVO, tests were run with a dynamometer and by performing field operations. The objectives of the dynamometer-testing phase were to compare the power production and specific fuel consumption (SFC) of the T7060 when operating on SVO to the tractor\u2019s performance on diesel. For the in-field testing, the objective was to compare the SVO and diesel fuel consumption rates for the T7060 as it performed two typical production tasks. The last objective was to create a computer model, using the program Stella, to determine the cost of producing a liter of straight vegetable oil on a small farm and to calculate some design parameters for a new SVO system.\n\nThe dynamometer tests revealed that the power output of the T7060 was statistically significantly higher for SVO when compared to diesel. This was due to the Elsbett system increasing the common rail fuel pressure and resulted in statistically significantly higher SVO SFC for power production levels above 115 kW when compared to diesel fuel. In the field, however, it was found that SVO fuel consumption was not statistically different from diesel or it was statistically significantly lower than diesel fuel consumption for the two operations tested. Lastly, based on the model, the cost of producing a gallon of SVO on a small farm was found to be competitive with the cost of diesel fuel. SVO is an exciting alternative energy solution and this tractor testing and modeling work will answer some important questions for farmers considering making the switch away from petroleum based diesel fuel.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [937], "author_name_tesi": "Julius, Collin Bruce", "last_name_ssi": "Julius", "middle_name_ssi": "Bruce", "first_name_ssi": "Collin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Paul Heinz Heinemann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Heinz Heinemann, Thesis Advisor", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Economic Modeling", "Tractor Testing", "Energy", "Diesel", "Straight Vegetable Oil", "Canola", "Stella"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Complexity by Nature | Simplicity by Design\n\nHow the Synchronicity of Complexity and Simplicity Informs Design", "id": "25694", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11194", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is a reality in the makeup of all natural systems that humans encounter every day.  The world is made up of systems which are complex.  By definition, these systems have emergent intricacies that results from the interactions between many parts.  Since humans are innately part of nature and because design is ultimately focused on enhancing the human condition, complexity is integral to design.  In architecture, complexity is particularly significant, as is the need to understand and manage complex information through the process of design.  Often seen as polar opposites, complexity and simplicity are much more valuable when seen for their contemporaneous presence.  Simplicity is not the opposite of complexity; rather, it is a product of design that carefully negotiates complexity.  This thesis investigates the question \u201cHow does the synchronicity of complexity and simplicity inform design?\u201d\n\nMuch of the way humans look at and make sense of the world is based on Cartesian reductionism, hence the traditional method of creating models has evolved as the main method of scientific study.  Through a critical examination of the work of Pedro Ferreira and Don Mikulecky on complexity theory, it can be understood that the interactions among the independent parts of a system cannot be formalized into a model without losing meaning.  A parallel study of John Maeda\u2019s work on simplicity theory showcases methods of achieving meaningful, simple results.  These investigations prove the dependency between complexity and simplicity.\n\nConsidering complexity in this manner parallels modern, postmodern, and contemporary digital ideas.  In each of these ideological brackets, it is evident that the early ideas have splintered into unique sets of beliefs and practices.

For example, questionnaire items pertaining to\nsensitive information (e.g., substance use, delinquency, etc) may show high rates of missingness. Participants who fail to respond may\ndo so for a variety of reasons, some of which could be strongly related to the underlying true values.\n\nData are said to be nonignorably missing if the probabilities of missingness depend on unobserved quantities. Traditional selection\nmodels for nonignorable nonresponse are outcome-based, tying these probabilities to partially observed values directly (e.g., by a\nlogistics regression). These methods are inherently unstable, because the relationship between a partially observed variable and\nits missingness indicator is understandably difficult to estimate. Moreover, with multivariate or longitudinal responses, the number of distinct missingness patterns becomes quite large, making traditional selection modeling even more unattractive. Information\nin the missing-data indicators is sometimes well summarized by a simple latent-class structure, suggesting that a large number of missing-data patterns may be reduced to just a few prototypes.\n\nIn this thesis, we describe the new method for imputing missing values under a latent-class selection model (LCSM). In the LCSM, the\nresponse behavior is assumed to be related to the items in question, and to additional covariates, only through a latent membership\nmeasured by the missingness indicators. We describe the LCSM and apply it to data from a school-based study of alcohol risk and\nexposure among adolescents in Pennsylvania, which has sensitive items with high rates of missingness.

Although the microphone techniques have evolved since their introduction, the most general form of the microphone technique employs two microphones in characterizing the acoustic field for one continuous medium. The shortcomings of determining the acoustic field based on only two microphones can be overcome by using numerous microphones. However, the use of a number of microphones requires a careful and intricate calibration procedure. This dissertation uses laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) to establish a new measurement technique which can resolve issues that microphone techniques have: First, it is based on a single sensor, thus the calibration is unnecessary when only overall ratio of the acoustic field is required for the characterization of a system. This includes the measurements of the characteristic impedance and the complex propagation constant of a system. Second, it can handle multiple positional measurements without calibrating the signal at each position. Third, it can measure three dimensional components of velocity even in a system with a complex geometry. Fourth, it has a flexible adaptability which is not restricted to a certain type of apparatus only if the apparatus is transparent. LDA is known to possess several disadvantages, such as the requirement of a transparent apparatus, high cost, and necessity of seeding particles.\nThe technique based on LDA combined with a curvefitting algorithm is validated through measurements on three systems. First, the complex propagation constant of the air is measured in a rigidly terminated cylindrical pipe which has very low dissipation. Second, the radiation impedance of an open-ended pipe is measured. These two parameters can be characterized by the ratio of acoustic field measured at multiple locations. Third, the power dissipated in a variable RLC load is measured. The three experiments validate the LDA technique proposed. The utility of the LDA method is then extended to the measurement of the complex propagation constant of the air inside a 100 ppi reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) sample. Compared to measurements in the available studies, the measurement with the 100 ppi RVC sample supports the LDA technique in that it can achieve a low uncertainty in the determined quantity. This dissertation concludes with using the LDA technique for modal decomposition of the plane wave mode and the (1,1) mode that are driven simultaneously. This modal decomposition suggests that the LDA technique surpasses microphone-based techniques, because they are unable to determine the acoustic field based on an acoustic model with unconfined propagation constants for each modal component.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3566], "author_name_tesi": "Jung, Ki Won ", "last_name_ssi": "Jung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ki Won", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony A Atchley", "Anthony A Atchley", "Robert Mitchel Keolian", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "Martin Wesley Trethewey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony A Atchley, Dissertation Advisor", "Anthony A Atchley, Committee Chair", "Robert Mitchel Keolian, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member", "Martin Wesley Trethewey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["acoustic power", "modal decomposition", "measurement technique", "laser Doppler anemometry", "impedance tube"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Design of a Smart Non-volatile Memory Controller: Architecture Modeling, Systems Analysis, Parallel I/o Processing and Scheduling Algorithms", "id": "18970", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8801", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "State-of-the-art Solid State Disks (SSDs) and Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) systems have undergone severe technology shift and architectural changes in the last couple of years, and, in parallel, SSD internal architecture has dramatically changed; modern SSDs now employ multiple internal resources such as NVM chips and I/O buses in an attempt to achieve high internal parallelism in processing I/O requests. In addition, to reduce intrinsic NVM system management overheads, SSD firmware employs advanced memory control strategies such as finer-granular address mapping algorithms and concurrency methods.  As a result of complex interactions among these different mechanisms, modern SSDs can be plagued by enormous performance variations depending on whether the underlying architectural complexities and NVM management overheads can be hidden or not.  \n\nDesigning a smart NVM controller is key hiding the architectural complexities and reducing the internal firmware overheads.  To this end, we first model a multi-plane and multi-die NVM architecture, which is highly reconfigurable and aware of intrinsic latency variation imposed by diverse state-of-the-art NVM systems. This NVM model has been implemented as a high fidelity open-source simulator, capable of capturing cycle-level interactions between the many components in an SSD, which can be used for various high-level and low-level NVM performance analyses. Based on this architecture model, we then explore twenty four different concurrency methods implemented in NVM controllers, geared toward exploiting both system-level and NVM-level parallelism. Further, we quantitatively analyze the challenges, faced by PCI Express-based (PCIe) SSDs in getting NVM closer to CPU and question popular assumptions and expectations regarding storage-class SSDs through an extensive experimental analysis.\n\nNext, we present and discuss the significance of read performance degradations and write performance variations by performing comprehensive empirical experiments using a diverse set of commercial SSDs and propose two novel schedulers in order to address these read/write performance challenges that modern SSDs face: 1) Physical Address Queuing (PAQ) scheduler and 2) NVM garbage collection scheduling algorithm. PAQ is a novel I/O request scheduling method that avoids resource contention resultant from shared SSD resources. Our proposed PAQ significantly improves read performance by exposing the physical addresses of requests to the scheduler and selecting groups of operations that can be simultaneously executed without major resource conflict.  In comparison, the novel garbage collection scheduler is an approach that removes garbage collection overheads of underlying flash firmware and provides stable write performance in SSDs during the I/O congestion periods. Our proposed garbage collection scheduler tries to secure free blocks and remove on-demand garbage collections from the critical path in advance or delay them to future idle periods, so that users do not experience garbage-collection-induced latencies during the I/O-intensive periods.  Overall, this thesis (1) presents a simulation infrastructure to conduct SSD/NVM research, (2) characterizes both system-level and device-level challenges faced by state-of-the-art SSDs, (3) presents a set of novel storage optimizations including various concurrency methods and scheduling algorithms design, and (4) points out future research directions.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8648], "author_name_tesi": "Jung, Myoungsoo ", "last_name_ssi": "Jung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Myoungsoo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Padma Raghavan", "Chitaranjan Das", "Long Qing Chen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Dissertation Advisor", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Chair", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Solid State Disks", "Non-Volatile Memory", "Memory Systems", "Embedded Systems", "Storage Systems", "Parallelism", "Scheduling Algorithms"]}]
