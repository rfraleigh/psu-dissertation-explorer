My research primarily focuses on Lyman-\u03b1 emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z \u223c 2, but to place the investigations in context, comparison samples of galaxies are also used. These galaxies present the opportunity to study formation and evolution of low-mass galaxies at this redshift, which is extremely difficult using continuum selection methods. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to LAEs and puts them in the context of galaxy formation and evolution.\nChapter 2 was originally published as Hagen et al. (2014), which studied the physical properties of LAEs at 1.9 \u2264 z \u2264 3.5 from the HETDEX Pilot Survey (Adams et al. 2011; Blanc et al. 2011). This paper found that LAEs span almost a three dex range in stellar mass and could be simply drawn for the star-forming galaxy mass function. We also found that, while most LAEs are dust poor, there were some objects that weren\u2019t. The Lyman-\u03b1 photons seem to experience the same dust opacity as the UV continuum, suggesting that in these galaxies Lyman-\u03b1 does not undergo significant scattering before escaping. This result, when matched with radiative transfer simulations, will help to constrain how Lyman-\u03b1 escapes\ngalaxies.\nChapter 3, originally published as Hagen et al. (2016), describes research that\nstudies how Lyman-\u03b1 emitters are drawn from star-forming galaxies. This work used galaxies identified via their optical emission lines (oELGs) as a comparison sample (Zeimann et al. 2015a). These oELGs have a mass range similar to LAEs and are an excellent comparison sample to LAEs. Previous comparison samples, such as LBGs, are two dex more massive than LAEs and thus do not represent galaxies in the same evolutionary state as LAEs. We compared ten physical and morphological properties between Lyman-\u03b1 and non-Lyman-\u03b1 emitting galaxies and found no statistically significant differences between these two populations. This null result is actually very exciting, as this suggests that LAEs \u2013 such as the 106 LAEs soon to be found by HETDEX \u2013 can be used as unbiased tracers of the star-forming galaxy population.\nChapter 4, originally Hagen et al. (2017), examines the rest-frame UV and rest-\nframe optical sizes of LAEs and oELGs from Zeimann et al. (2015a). We found that these morphological properties are indistinguishable between the samples, and that the galaxies are smaller in the rest-frame optical compared to the rest-frame UV. This suggests that low-mass galaxies are undergoing inside-out galaxy formation, which some papers had thought was only in higher mass galaxies.\nChapter 5 is a proof-of-concept to show that LAEs detected from HETDEX commissioning observations can be cross-matched to Hubble Space Telescope counter- parts, which then can be used to perform significant research into galaxy formation and evolution. This chapter will continue to be developed into a journal article.\nChapter 6 summarizes the findings of this work and discusses future research opportunities with HETDEX.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16165], "author_name_tesi": "Hagen, Alex Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Hagen", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Alex", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robin Bruce Ciardullo", "Robin Bruce Ciardullo", "Caryl Ann Gronwall", "Sarah Elizabeth Shandera", "Donald P Schneider"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robin Bruce Ciardullo, Dissertation Advisor", "Robin Bruce Ciardullo, Committee Chair", "Caryl Ann Gronwall, Committee Member", "Sarah Elizabeth Shandera, Committee Member", "Donald P Schneider, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Astronomy", "Astrophysics"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Swift/UVOT Observations of Star Formation and Dust Attenuation in both Local and High Redshift Galaxies", "id": "14900lmz5057", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14900", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) is uniquely suited to study star formation and dust extinction in both nearby and distant galaxies.

I combine the UV imaging with archival optical and infrared data to model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of individual regions of each galaxy, simultaneously fitting for the wavelength dependence of dust attenuation, total dust, stellar mass, and age.  I have created the first-ever maps of the UV dust extinction curve, which show previously-unconfirmed spatial variation: both the slope and 2175A bump vary considerably over the face of the three galaxies.  I use these maps to probe the the origin of the extinction curve variation and find correlations with physical properties -- including specific star formation rate (SFR), temperature, and presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -- in some, but not all, of the galaxies.  I then use UVOT observations of higher redshift galaxies (0.2 < z < 1.2) to derive the evolution of the SFR density.  Since the SFR is calculated from the dust-corrected UV luminosities of each galaxy, the adopted dust extinction curve has a significant impact on the SFR density over time.  I conclude by discussing an in-progress UVOT survey of over 400 galaxies in the local volume (D < 11 Mpc) and how modeling their SEDs will enable a more thorough understanding of UV dust attenuation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15943], "author_name_tesi": "Hagen, Lea May", "last_name_ssi": "Hagen", "middle_name_ssi": "May", "first_name_ssi": "Lea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Caryl Ann Gronwall", "Caryl Ann Gronwall", "Michael Hiram Siegel", "Robin Bruce Ciardullo", "Sarah Elizabeth Shandera", "John Andrew Nousek"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Caryl Ann Gronwall, Dissertation Advisor", "Caryl Ann Gronwall, Committee Chair", "Michael Hiram Siegel, Committee Member", "Robin Bruce Ciardullo, Committee Member", "Sarah Elizabeth Shandera, Outside Member", "John Andrew Nousek, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["star formation", "dust", "Swift", "ultraviolet", "UVOT", "galaxies", "astronomy", "Small Magellanic Cloud", "M33", "M31"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF AGED THROMBI THROUGH MRI AND HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF ERYTHROCYTE GHOST CLOTS", "id": "13915keh5461", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13915", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Every year about 735,000 people in the United States have a myocardial infarction (MI) and about 20% of post myocardial infarction patients develop left ventricular thrombus (LVT).1 A previous study by Niemann et al. found that older clots do not respond to certain anti-thrombotic therapy, illustrating the importance of knowing the thrombus age for doctors making treatment decisions. Despite advances being made in diagnostic imaging, current detection techniques are still lacking to determine the different characteristics of LVT.  The present study aims to improve upon distinguishing these characteristics in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by studying thrombi with varying levels of hemoglobin, because it is thought that aged clots have less hemoglobin in them. Ghost cells were used in this study because they are red blood cells with little to no hemoglobin. Ghost cells were made by incubating packed O- red blood cells and lysing solution overnight in a cold room, then placed in a water bath to reform the cells without hemoglobin. These ghost cells were separated by centrifugation, and then combined with plasma from a blood donor to create ghost cell blood. The thrombi in this study were created using a backwards-facing step (BFS) model to mimic the regions of disrupted flow in the left ventricle after a MI. The BFS was integrated into a closed flow loop that circulated human blood at 0.76 L/min (Re =490). Thrombi were formed using either ghost cell blood or whole blood, and were then imaged by MRI. Images of each thrombus were then post processed using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to determine their magnetic properties. A positive QSM indicates a paramagnetic substance, such as hemoglobin. After the thrombi were imaged, they were sectioned to conduct histology and assess cellular distribution. The results showed a significant positive correlation for red blood cell (RBC) content and QSM value for the whole blood thrombi, whereas for the ghost cell thrombi the correlation was not significant. This lack of correlation for ghost cells depicts how most of the hemoglobin was removed from the RBCs. The average QSM value of the ghost cell thrombi was then compared to the average QSM value of the whole blood thrombi, and the values were considered significantly different using a two-tailed T-test with 90% confidence. These results show that the variation in hemoglobin content between the two groups was able to be detected in MRI.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14157], "author_name_tesi": "Hagenah, Kristen E", "last_name_ssi": "Hagenah", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Kristen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Keefe Manning", "Dr. William Hancock", "Dr. Graham Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Keefe Manning, Thesis Advisor", "Dr. William Hancock, Committee Member", "Dr. Graham Thomas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ghost Cells", "Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping", "Left Ventricular Thrombus"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The New Northwest: The Transformation of Small-Town Economies in Northwest Arkansas Since 1960\n\n\n", "id": "9652", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4870", "abstract_tesi": "Major population growth in the recent past of the United States has occurred in metropolitan areas of the South and West.  However, northwest Arkansas, neither an urban region nor a suburb of another urban area, has experienced remarkable population growth and economic expansion since the 1960s.  Populations of Benton County and Washington County have exploded three- and five-fold.  The peripheral hill towns of Bentonville, Rogers, Springdale, and Fayetteville have morphed into a thirty-five mile long mini-megalopolis home to the Fortune 500 companies of Wal-Mart and Tyson.  The recent growth of northwest Arkansas is examined to assess how and why the region grew so quickly, and how the region achieved such economic transformation.  In addition, this pattern of development is scrutinized to determine if a general \u201cblueprint for urbanization\u201d for similar geographic regions actually exists.  Corporate histories and census data are used to compile a statistical and historical analysis of the development of northwest Arkansas.  Specific attention is paid to the geographical decision-making processes of the local corporate entities (Wal-Mart, Tyson, J.B. Hunt), transportation systems (interstate highway systems, railroads), and labor class (imported foreign workers, graduates from nearby universities).  Additionally, pre-existing layers of local culture, quality of life issues, regional politics, and regional macroeconomic structure are examined.  Creating an urban growth model for northwest Arkansas establishes a benchmark to compare the possible future development of historically rural areas.

These events led to an economic restructuring of the Delta, as that region subsequently transitioned away from hand-picked cotton, small plots of land, and tenant farming.  Before 1930, most cotton farms were worked by tenant farmers or day laborers, with mules the motive power for plow and wagon.  Government agricultural-support programs instigated during the Depression helped planters transition to more modern forms of farming, manifested in shifts to larger farms and adoption of mechanized equipment.  Between 1930 and 1970 the comparative advantages of the Delta cotton economy disappeared as cheaper, more efficient cotton production developed in the U.S. West and Asia.  By 1970, the Delta was a depopulated landscape (due to decades of outmigration by farmers and farm workers) dominated by large, mechanized commercial farms that increasingly cultivated crops other than cotton.  Land use, land ownership and settlement patterns are analyzed to understand the manner and method of the rural Delta\u2019s agricultural remaking.  Historical documents (county atlases, U.S. Census records) are used in comparative and time-series analyses.  Evidence suggests that external forces in national and global cotton markets, along with the resulting breakdown of local land systems of ownership, size, and parcel division affected twentieth-century economic change in the Delta: characteristics of local cotton production that served as comparative advantages of production in 1930 had become disadvantageous to cotton production by 1970.

In October-November 2005, when a localized tragedy in Clichy-sous-Bois sparked three weeks of nationwide civil unrest on a scale not seen since May 1968, the world took notice. Given the great intensity with which media outlets, both national and international, covered these riots, I argue that this historical moment marks a peak in the widespread mythology that depicts the banlieues as homogenous spaces of deterministic crime and violence simmering on French urban and social peripheries. Visual media, in particular, played a major role, as images of cars ablaze, buildings vandalized, and urban youths clashing with riot squads filled newspapers, magazines, and television screens. Once these images helped unleash long-standing negative stereotypes, staunch proponents of French republicanism fueled their flames to the point that questions arose both locally and abroad about the nation-state\u2019s ability to maintain cohesion.\n\nI take media and political discourses on the October-November 2005 riots as my point of departure. I first historicize media representations of the banlieues\u2019 fraught history to demonstrate how stereotypes about the French urban periphery adapt in order to endure. Since the 2005 events though, socially engaged photographers have been re-envisioning what it means to live in the banlieues, and alternative visual discourses that counter clich\u00e9s of disorder and delinquency are emerging. I contend that such projects reframe peripheral sites and marginalized groups as central to an evolving understanding of French society. I analyze the construction, function, and influence of visual narratives in photographs by Mathieu Pernot, Mohamed Bourouissa, JR, and France Keyser, as well as those present in a multi-artist photographic project funded by Clichy-sous-Bois. Interrogating configurations of gender, class, religion, ethnicity, and architectural space in the images, I demonstrate how the photographs transmit increasingly complex visual paradigms that destabilize monolithic depictions of dangerous banlieues and violent banlieusards that generally circulate in the French public sphere.

The primary technology considered is the stitch ripping device (SRD).  Development of analytical models for predicting SRD behavior is presented.  The models account for energy absorption due to webbing stretch, thread rupture and stitch slippage.  The models predict the force-displacement behavior of the device, the total amount of energy absorption, and the amount of absorption due to frictional losses from stitch slip.  Experimental testing conducted to validate model results exhibits close agreement for the applied load and displacement required to induce thread rupture.  Over multiple stitch breaks, the models slightly over estimate the amount of absorbed energy.  It is predicted that a lower amount of stitch slip decreases activation force as well as fluctuation of force in the plateau region of the force-displacement curve. Decreasing slip increases the amount of energy that can be absorbed for a given peak force and stroke distance.  In addition, the effectiveness of adhesive treatments in preventing stitch slippage and pull-out, and the role of stitch pattern and stitch density on energy absorption are examined.  Results indicate that certain adhesive treatments increase total energy absorption and reduce stitch pull-out.  However, decreases in specific energy absorption result due to increases in total mass from the addition of adhesive.  Hand-stitched thread tests show that altering stitch pattern and reducing pull-out increase rip force and energy absorption by 23% and 16%, respectively.  Finally, to assess the performance of SRDs under simulated crash conditions, an instrumented dynamic drop rig was constructed.  Tests were conducted with a drop sled moving at free-fall velocity, and a higher, elastic-cord-assisted velocity.  For velocities from quasi-static to 6 m/s, no significant trends or changes in SRD average activation force and energy absorption were observed in the experiments.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4148], "author_name_tesi": "Hagon, Matthew J.", "last_name_ssi": "Hagon", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles E Bakis", "Michael Andrew Yukish"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles E Bakis, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Andrew Yukish, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["textiles", "SEA", "load limiters", "energy absorption", "VEA", "stitch ripping device", "cargo restraints"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Behind the Mask: A Semiotic Analysis of William Bolcom's Songs of Innocence and of Experience", "id": "19865", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9570", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to utilize semiotic analysis as a method to determine the intended musical meanings within William Bolcom's Songs of Innocence and of Experience.

CNT-polymer nanocomposites are highly sought multi-functional materials for their tailorable properties. If integrated properly, CNT-polymer nanocomposites can deliver improved interlayer mechanical strength and fracture toughness, high electrical conductivity and current carrying capacity, anisotropic thermal management, and smart functions like actuation and sensing. Currently, the most commonly used commercial\naerospace structural material, carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), has high mass-specific mechanical strength, but is prone to delamination due to weak interlaminar strength and require additional heavy, metal mesh layers due to low electrical and thermal conductivities. Thus many studies have been conducted to integrate light-weight CNT-polymer nanocomposites with high performance in order to improve properties of CFRPs. However, bulk application of CNT-polymer nanocomposites is currently limited due to lack of scalable\nmanufacturing while maintaining organization of CNTs. Dispersion and organization of CNTs are difficult as CNTs tend to agglomerate due van der Waals forces and often entangle due to their high aspect ratios (>~100). These CNT agglomerates in polymer matrices cause voids and behave as defects rather than reinforcement, resulting in property degradation. Interfaces and interphases formed between CNTs and polymer matrices also need to be tuned to avoid functioning as defects or boundary layers. Thus, it is critical to develop a method to effectively disperse and organize CNTs within polymer matrices to improve and tailor the nanocomposite's multi-functional properties. Here, application of magnetic fields is a promising, scalable method to deliver bulk amount of nanocomposites while maintaining organized nanoparticle assembly\nthroughout the polymer matrix before the curing step. Previous studies showed effective alignment of nanoparticles with the small magnetic field (~10 G, an order of magnitude above the earth's natural magnetic field) for reasonable time (~1 hour). In addition, nanoparticle alignment spacing was successfully controlled by varying field oscillation frequency, enabling particle patterning and interface tuning. In this work, MWCNTs (~35 nm diameter and ~200 um length) were processed to be magnetic, so that they can function as additives that can be effectively organized with magnetic fields. MWCNTs, being diamagnetic as fabricated, are coated with a thin layer of Ni with high aspect ratio to exhibit anisotropic ferromagnetism. The process consisted of three steps. First, MWCNTs were synthesized with chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Second, these MWCNTs were treated with low temperature air plasma; the amorphous carbon present on the side walls and entangled CNT layers on the top surface were eliminated. The CNT surfaces were also functionalized, in order to increase adhesion with Ni coating and to improve dispersion and suspension within matrix solutions. The air plasma conditions (power and treatment time) were varied to ensure adequate cleaning, and to maximize functionalization of CNTs without overly damaging the CNT crystal structure. Treated CNTs and their dispersion degree were inspected visually with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and functional group attachment was quantitatively evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From these preliminary results, better CNT dispersion and suspension in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was observed with the plasma treatment with low (~6.8 W) power setting for moderate duration (~4 min), which can be attributed to most attachment of ether (C-O) functional groups. Third, thin Ni layers, with varying thickness from 20 nm to 100 nm, were e-beam evaporated on the functionalized CNTs. Anisotropic ferromagnetic properties,\nsuch as hysteresis, coercivity, and remanence were measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). With increasing thickness, magnetization increased but magnetic anisotropy decreased.

The mathematical model incorporates three-dimensional effects such as non-planar rotor bending and places little restriction on the system configuration. Special attention was placed on balancing mass interaction with other balancing masses and with the balancer track. The effects of balancing mass collisions and friction were modeled and tested.\n\n\nPassive balancing devices for rotary systems consist of masses that are free to move in concentric guides about the shaft axis. Under optimal conditions, notably at supercritical speeds, the balancing masses automatically assume new positions to counter any imbalance due to uneven mass distribution in the system. The balancing phenomenon occurs as a result of a 180 degree shift in the system response phase with respect to the imbalance phase when a natural frequency is traversed. Eccentric centrifugal loads on the balancing masses cause them to move in a manner that suppresses or diminishes rotor vibration. The problem is highly nonlinear and requires comprehensive modeling to achieve satisfactory prediction of the balancing behavior.\n\n\nIn this research, a test rig was fabricated to experimentally validate the presented mathematical model. A rotating shaft with an imbalanced hub and a passive balancing device was tested at 1600 RPM, a supercritical speed. The passive balancer performance in transient and steady states was investigated under various imbalanced configurations. In the experiment, the passive balancing device on average reduced shaft vibrations by 62% at steady state. In addition, the experiment demonstrated that the passive balancer exhibits suboptimal performance when the system had low imbalance. This is opposite to what is predicted by conventional models in which viscous damping is the sole interaction between the balancing masses and the balancer track.\n\n\nModels available in the literature predicted the results within 68% of the experimental values. The comprehensive balancing model developed in this thesis more accurately predicts the performance of the passive balancer. The increased accuracy was accomplished through the inclusion of rolling resistance friction between the balancing masses and the balancer track, as well as the inelastic collisions between the balancing masses. By incorporating inelastic collisions, the accuracy of the predictions was improved by a factor of 6.7 (3.7% margin of error vs. 24.7%) in high imbalance scenarios. By including friction, the model prediction accuracy was increased by a factor of 3.3 (17.6% vs. 58.1%). Overall, the model presented in this thesis improved the accuracy by a factor of 3.9 when compared to published models (17.6% vs. 67.7%). Ignoring the effects of friction and mass collisions reduces accuracy of predictions significantly.

Indicators such as crop yield and quality, weed and insect populations, nutrient conservation, greenhouse gas emissions, energy use and production, and overall farm profitability are commonly measured to assess the performance of these systems, but it is also important to consider the impact cropping systems may have on non-target organisms, especially those that play an important role in agricultural systems.  One such group of non-target organisms is the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We conducted two studies to examine the impact of cropping rotation and management on AMF within one such cropping systems trial that was developed to identify sustainable dairy cropping practices in the northeast United States. \n\tIn the first study, oats (Avena sativa L.) were planted as a mycorrhizal companion crop for fall planted canola (Brassica napus L.), a non-mycorrhizal crop, to determine if intercropping oats with canola was an effective method of maintaining AMF populations.  The colonization of corn (Zea mays L.) bioassay plants was assessed in plots of canola with and without oats as a companion crop after the canola was harvested.  The colonization of the two crops following canola in the crop rotation, rye (Secale cereal L.) and soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) respectively was also assessed.  There was no significant difference among treatments in the colonization of any crops assessed.  The lack of the effect of oats as a companion crop may have been due to the oats being winter-killed prior to establishing significant biomass, or the low planting density (22.4 kg ha-1) of the oats.  Alternatively, compounds produced by the canola plants, called isothiocyanates, may have suppressed the colonization of the oats by AMF.  Therefore, intercropping canola with a low density of winter-killed oats does not appear to be sufficient method of increasing mycorrhizal colonization in crops following winter canola.  \n\tAdditionally, in the first study, the oat companion crop treatment was nested within an herbicide treatment that compared reduced and standard herbicide practices.  The reduced herbicide treatment was tilled with a moldboard plow before canola was planted while the standard herbicide treatment was not tilled.  Colonization of the corn bioassay plants, planted after canola was harvested, was significantly reduced in the reduced herbicide (tilled) treatment.  There was no difference in the colonization of the subsequent two crops, rye and soybeans.  There was also no interaction between the herbicide management treatment and the oat companion crop treatment.  The rapid disappearance of the impact of tillage on AMF colonization in this cropping system suggests that sporadic tillage may have little consequence for mycorrhiza-dependent crops if they do not directly follow tillage in the rotation. \nThe second study focused on the overall effect of crop rotation and management in the dairy cropping system on AMF colonization of corn grown within three rotations, a six-year grain crop rotation with an herbicide management treatment, a six-year forage crop rotation with a manure management treatment, and a two-year corn-soy rotation with a manure management treatment.  The colonization of corn seedlings was assessed for all corn plots in the system when the seedlings reached the third leaf stage.  \nWithin the three rotations, I also made comparisons between management treatments including a manure management treatment (broadcast vs. injected manure), an herbicide treatment (reduced vs. standard herbicide), and a cover crop treatment (red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) vs. hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) and oats).  Overall there was no difference in the colonization of corn between manure management treatments, herbicide treatments, or cover crop treatments.  \nThree different varieties of corn were used in the three rotations: one conventional variety, one variety with a single transgenic trait for herbicide resistance, and another with three transgenic traits including one for expressing the insecticide protein Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).  To determine if corn variety impacted AMF colonization, the three corn varieties were grown in a greenhouse in sterile soil inoculated AMF spores.  There were no significant differences in the amount of mycorrhizal colonization of the three varieties.  \n\tAlthough there was no significant impact of corn variety or treatments within the rotations on AMF colonization, corn seedlings in the corn-soy and grain rotations were colonized significantly less than those in the forage rotation. The observed differences in the colonization of corn among the rotations may have been driven by the presence of a cover crop preceding corn in the rotation. Because AMF are dependent on their host plants for energy, long periods during which host plants are absent or only poor hosts are present are detrimental to their populations.  In the corn-soy rotation there was a fallow during the winter preceding corn, in the grain rotation there was a rye (a potentially weak AMF host) cover crop, and in the forage rotation there were alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and red clover/hairy vetch cover crops.  Based on these results, it appears that the prior crop has the largest impact on colonization of corn by AMF in this system, and that cover crops that for strong AMF associations should be used instead of fallows and plants that form weak AMF associations to promote the colonization of subsequent plants.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10135], "author_name_tesi": "Haider, Kristin Regina", "last_name_ssi": "Haider", "middle_name_ssi": "Regina", "first_name_ssi": "Kristin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Tai Koide"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Tai Koide, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi", "canola", "tillage", "cropping rotation"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Biobehavioral Responses to Caregiving in Very Low Birth Weight Preterm Infants\n\n\n", "id": "6559", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3458", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Life-sustaining medical care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may cause discomfort and stress in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants. Moreover, repeated exposures to unmitigated stress may contribute to illness and poor developmental outcomes. This study examined linkages between biological and behavioral responses to caregiving as predictors of health outcomes in preterm infants. The specific aims of the study were: (a) to examine hypothesized relationships between neuroendocrine responses, vagal tone, and behavioral responses within the context of nursing caregiving in the NICU, (b) to test whether early patterns of hormonal, heart rate, and behavioral responses in the first few days of life are predictors of health outcomes for very low birth weight infants at the time of discharge, and (c) to identify maternal perceptions of the NICU environment and the effects of these perceptions on maternal-infant interaction and subsequent parenting beliefs. The hypotheses were: 1 (a) there will be direct positive relationships between cortisol reactivity and autonomic parameters, (b) there will be direct positive relationships between cortisol reactivity and behavioral responses, (c) there will be direct positive relationships between heart rate variability (HRV) and behavioral responses, \n2 (a) infants with higher cortisol responses to handling will have poorer health outcomes than infants with lower cortisol reactivity, (b) infants with lower HRV at rest will have poorer health outcomes than infants with higher heart rate variability, 3 (a) infants with higher behavioral distress will have poorer health outcomes than infants with lower distress, (b) infants with higher cortisol levels post-handling (at 60 minutes) will have poorer health outcomes than infants with lower cortisol levels post-handling, 4 (a) mothers reporting higher stress will be less responsive to their infants than mothers with lower stress, and (b) mothers who are less responsive to their infants will rate themselves lower in parenting competency than mothers with high responsiveness. Thirteen preterm infants were enrolled in this prospective, observational study, with each infant serving as her/his own control. On day 4 - 5 of life, morning plasma samples were obtained for assessment of cortisol levels from an existing umbilical catheter while simultaneously measuring heart and respiratory rates, and oxygen saturations at baseline and 30 and 60 minutes post-handling during standard nursing care. Activity, state, and behavioral stress signals were quantified using the NIDCAP\u00d2 observational method. Resting HRV was measured on day five and one month postnatally. Health outcomes data were collected via chart audit. Maternal questionnaires and behavioral interaction ratings were administered during the first week of hospitalization and one month postnatally. The results of the analyses showed that cortisol reactivity was highly positively associated with visceral cues (p = 0.03) during handling and tachypnea (p = 0.04) post-handling. HRV was highly positively correlated with motor, facial, and attentional cues. Recovery (60 min) cortisol was highly positively associated with duration of ventilation (p = 0.03), duration of oxygen (p = 0.02), and length of stay (p = 0.005). Those infants with greater high frequency HRV (vagal tone) achieved oral feeding earlier (p = 0.048) and had improved health outcomes including: shorter ventilation (p = 0.03), lower incidence of retinopathy (p = 0.03), and shorter length of stay (p = 0.04). Infants demonstrating expression of facial distress cues (brow bulge, eye squeeze) had a higher incidence of nosocomial sepsis (p = 0.04), longer duration of oxygen therapy (p = 0.02), and longer length of stay identified by correlation and regression analyses (p = 0.02). Mothers of study infants reported high general stress levels during early hospitalization; however, maternal stress levels did not predict nurse-rated competency of mothers at one month of age. Mothers rated by NICU nurses as more competent and sensitive to their infants had higher self-ratings of competency in parenting at one month of age. All infants exhibited hormonal and behavioral reactivity to handling. The majority quieted and had lower cortisol levels at one hour post-handling in response to appropriate pacing of care and containment. Those infants with persistent tachypnea and higher cortisol levels post-handling had higher respiratory morbidity. Behavioral distress responses (facial and visceral cues) were associated with higher rates of nosocomial sepsis and longer oxygen duration; these indicators represented a uniquely vulnerable subgroup, more challenged by environmental stimulation. In contrast, more robust infants demonstrating high motor and attentional behaviors had greater high frequency HRV and improved outcomes. This study adds to the accruing evidence that vagal tone represents an important homeostatic mechanism that may be an independent measure of stress vulnerability. In addition, cue-based caregiving  was crucial in promoting infant stability. Further investigation with a larger sample of newborns is required to confirm the clinical significance of these findings.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3445], "author_name_tesi": "Haidet, Kim Kopenhaver", "last_name_ssi": "Haidet", "middle_name_ssi": "Kopenhaver", "first_name_ssi": "Kim", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Susman", "Sheila Grace West", "Douglas A Granger", "Keith Howard Marks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Susman, Committee Chair", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member", "Douglas A Granger, Committee Member", "Keith Howard Marks, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stress", "preterm infants", "psychobiology"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "DIMENSIONAL TRANFORMATION: A NOVEL METHOD FOR GAIN-SCHEDULING AND ROBUST CONTROL", "id": "7016", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2272", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis focuses on developing a technique of dimensional transformation to solve advanced controller design problems, specifically gain-scheduling and robust control methods. The developed technique reformulates the system representation in preferential dimensionless form that is more tenable for gain scheduling and robust control designs. The current work shows that the dimensionless formulation gives\nadvantage in terms of reducing complexity and conservativeness of the control synthesis as compared to the dimensional form.\n\nThe complexity of a gain scheduling control design increases exponentially with the number of scheduling parameters. This thesis presents a method called dimensional transformation that reduces the number of scheduling parameters by reformulating the dynamic representation in dimensionless form. The choice of dimensionless description is usually preferred because any transformation to dimensionless representation is\nguaranteed to reduce variable dependence: the number of dimensionless parameters is always less than or equal to that of the classical representation (a result of the classic Pi-theorem). However, dimensional transformations are not unique. Some transformations \u2013 while reducing the total number of system parameters, scheduled or unscheduled \u2013 may have a negative effect on a gain-scheduling control algorithm because they may inadvertently increase the number of scheduling parameters. This work explores in detail conditions necessary such that dimensional transformation are guaranteed to present the minimum number of gain scheduling parameters for a control system design.\n\nThe same principle of dimensional transformation is explored as a method to reduce the size of parametric uncertainty block in robust controller synthesis. This simplification is performed using the dimensional transformation by appropriate matrices followed by LFT reformulation in the dimensionless domain. This reduces the conservativeness of the robust control synthesis. For example, in the mu-synthesis framework, if the uncertainty block size is greater than three, then only the upper bound can be computed, and this upper bound can be arbitrarily larger than the actual structured\nsingular value resulting in a more conservative controller synthesis. Through the method\nof dimensional transformation, the size of a given uncertainty block can be reduced by up\nto three or more dimensions. Depending on the problem, this might allow for current techniques of robust control synthesis to be extended into significant new problems.\n\nThis thesis also discusses methods for a robust simultaneous control technique for systems whose system parameters are inherently coupled. The current work shows the potential of the proposed method for designing a unified robust controller that can be implemented through parametric adaptation. The goal is to obtain a robust, adaptive and modular controller for a group of systems. When considering collective group of systems, passenger vehicles for example, coupling is present due to optimization inherent in vehicles and engineering and natural systems. When such general coupling exists, the systems as a group can be represented in a more dense collection that gives advantage for robust controller synthesis. This approach is tested using a problem focusing on the lateral control of a scaled-vehicle-system on a rolling-roadway simulator.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2252], "author_name_tesi": "Hailu, Haftay ", "last_name_ssi": "Hailu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Haftay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean Brennan", "Christopher Rahn", "Mario Sznaier", "Barbara E Kulakowski", "Kon Well Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sean Brennan, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Mario Sznaier, Committee Member", "Barbara E Kulakowski, Committee Member", "Kon Well Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["robust control", "gain-scheduling", "dimensional transformation", "dimensional analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Effective Viscosity of Dilute Bacterial Suspensions", "id": "11996", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "737", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores the bulk (volume averaged) properties of\nsuspensions of microswimmers in a fluid. A microswimmer is a\nmicroscopic object that propels itself through a fluid. A common\nexample of a microswimmer is a bacterium, such as Bacillus subtilis.\nOur particular interest is the bulk rheological properties of\nsuspensions of bacteria -- that is, studying how such a suspension\ndeforms under the application of an external force. In the simplest\ncase, the rheology of a fluid can be described by a scalar effective\nviscosity. The goal of this dissertation is to find explicit formulae\nfor the effective viscosity in terms of known geometric and physical parameters\ncharacterizing bacteria and use them to explain experimental\nobservations. Throughout the dissertation, we consider bacterial\nsuspensions in the dilute limit, where bacteria are assumed to be so\nfar apart that interactions between them are negligible. This\nsimplifies calculations significantly and is the regime in which the\nmost striking experimental results have been observed.\n\nWe first study suspensions of self-propelled particles using a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) model. A\nbacterium is modeled as a disk in 2D with self-propulsion provided by a\npoint force in the fluid. A formula is obtained for the effective\nviscosity of such suspensions in the dilute limit. This formula\nincludes the two terms that are found in the 2D version of Einstein's\nclassical result for a passive suspension of spheres. To this, our main\ncontribution is added, an additional term due to self-propulsion which\ndepends on the physical and geometric properties of the suspension.\nThis work demonstrates how bacterial self-propulsion can alter the\nviscosity of a fluid and highlights the importance of bacterial\norientation.\n\nNext, we present a more realistic PDE model for dilute suspensions of\nswimming bacteria in a three-dimensional fluid. In this work, a\nbacterium is modeled as a prolate spheroid with self-propulsion once\nmore provided by a point force. Furthermore, the bacterium is subject\nto a random torque in order to model tumbling (random reorientation).\nThis model is used to calculate the effective viscosity of the\nsuspension from the microscopic details of the interaction of an\nelongated body with a prescribed background flow, once more in the\ndilute limit. Due to a bacterium's asymmetric shape (in particular,\nunlike the case of rotationally symmetric bacteria used in the first\nmodel), interactions with generic planar background flows cause the\nbacterium to preferentially align in certain directions. Due to the\nrandom torque, the steady-state distribution of orientations is unique\nfor a given background flow. Under this distribution of orientations,\nself-propulsion produces a reduction in the effective viscosity. For\nsufficiently weak background flows, the effect of self-propulsion on\nthe effective viscosity dominates all other contributions, leading to\nan effective viscosity of the suspension that is lower than the\nviscosity of the ambient fluid. This is in qualitative agreement with\nrecent experiments on suspensions of Bacillus subtilis.\n\nFinally, we present a method that can be used to rigorously justify our\neffective viscosity formulae. In particular, we present a mathematical\nproof of Einstein's formula for the effective viscosity of a dilute\nsuspension of spheres when the spheres are centered on the vertices of\na cubic lattice. This proof admits a generalization to other particle\nshapes and the inclusion of self-propulsion. We keep the size of the\ncontainer finite in the dilute limit and consider boundary effects.\nEinstein's formula is recovered as a first-order asymptotic expansion\nof the effective viscosity in the volume fraction &#966;. To rigorously\njustify this expansion, we obtain an explicit upper and lower bound on\nthe effective viscosity and show that they match to order &#966;^{3/2}.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [730], "author_name_tesi": "Haines, Brian Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Haines", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonid Berlyand", "Leonid Berlyand", "Alberto Bressan", "Helge Kristian Jenssen", "Anna L Mazzucato", "Jayanth R Banavar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonid Berlyand, Dissertation Advisor", "Leonid Berlyand, Committee Chair", "Alberto Bressan, Committee Member", "Helge Kristian Jenssen, Committee Member", "Anna L Mazzucato, Committee Member", "Jayanth R Banavar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rheology", "effective viscosity", "bacterial suspensions"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Morphology and Optical Properties of Aerosol Particles Coated with Palmitic Acid", "id": "25041", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11188", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The morphology of aerosol particles influences the reactions that occur during atmospheric aging, as well as altering their contributions to the direct and indirect effects.

Because these wires are grown in a region with partially depleted silane concentrations, this regime is described as silane-depleted vapor-liquid-solid growth. \nAlong with promoting growth in high energy growth directions, reactor temperature and pressure can be used to change the shape of <111> wires to pyramids. These pyramids have improved anti-reflective properties compared to vertical nanowire arrays, enabling black silicon textures to be grown on silicon substrates. Because the wires and pyramids are p-type, growth on n-type substrates enables black silicon solar cells to be fabricated in a process that combines texturing and junction formation into a single step.\nAluminum-induced crystallization of silicon thin films offers a unique method for producing highly (111) oriented polycrystalline thin films on amorphous substrates. Al and a-Si are deposited on glass or other substrates, and then annealed below the Al-Si eutectic temperature. For film thicknesses below 50nm, the a-Si diffuses through the Al film and nucleates at the Al/substrate interface. By using plasma surface treatments to change the surface energies of the fused quartz substrates, silicon crystallization rates and grain sizes can be manipulated. Furthermore, by combining multiple surface treatments on a single substrate, preferential crystallization at the low-energy interface can be realized, allowing for the formation of patterned AIC-films from uniform, continuous initial a-Si and Al layers.\nFinally, along with pattern formation, these AIC-Si films are able to act as seed layers for III-nitride semiconductor growth on fused quartz and other substrates. Through use of an AlN buffer layer, highly c-axis oriented GaN films can be grown using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition on AIC-Si substrates. Post growth characterization indicates that the GaN films follow the template provided by the AIC-Si films, with uniform surface normal orientation and random in-plane orientation. Defect analysis suggests that threading dislocation densities within grains are comparable to GaN grown on bulk Si (111) substrates. Additional studies have extended the GaN on AIC-Si process to other substrates, including oxidized Si (001) and polycrystalline diamond, with GaN films showing similar morphologies to those grown on AIC-Si on fused quartz.\nOverall, this thesis demonstrates how aluminum-mediated crystallization of silicon can be used to fabricate thin films and nanowires with a variety of orientations and morphologies. Furthermore, the initial demonstration of these wires and thin films in photovoltaic and electronic applications is also presented. Ultimately, aluminum-mediated silicon crystallization is demonstrated to be a flexible, controllable approach for producing a variety of technologically relevant nanowires and thin films.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15694], "author_name_tesi": "Hainey, Mel Forrest", "last_name_ssi": "Hainey", "middle_name_ssi": "Forrest", "first_name_ssi": "Mel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Joan Redwing", "Dr. Joan Redwing", "Dr. Roman Engel-Herbert", "Dr. Suzanne Mohney", "Dr. Jeffery Brownson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Joan Redwing, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Joan Redwing, Committee Chair", "Dr. Roman Engel-Herbert, Committee Member", "Dr. Suzanne Mohney, Committee Member", "Dr. Jeffery Brownson, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Silicon", "Aluminum", "Nanowire", "Thin Film", "Chemical Vapor Deposition", "Aluminum-induced Crystallization"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Homological Methods in Coarse Geometry\n", "id": "11327", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5685", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The field of coarse algebraic topology involves the application of principles of algebraic topology to coarse spaces, particularly the calculation of the so-called ``coarse homology\" and ``coarse cohomology\" of a space.

Development of complex oxide thin film materials is essential for realizing their integration into nanoscale electronic devices, where theoretically predicted multifunctional capabilities of oxides could add tremendous value.  Employing thin film growth strategies such as epitaxial strain and heterostructure interface engineering can greatly enhance and even unlock novel material properties in complex oxides, which will be the main focus of this work.  However, physically incorporating oxide materials into devices remains a challenge.  While advancements in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) of thin film oxide materials has led to the ability to grow oxide materials with atomic layer precision, there are still major limitations such as controlling stoichiometric compositions during growth as well as creating abrupt interfaces in multi-component layered oxide structures.  The work done in this thesis addresses ways to overcome these limitations in order to harness intrinsic material phenomena.\nThe development of adsorption-controlled stoichiometric growth windows of CaTiO3 and SrTiO3 thin film materials grown by hybrid MBE where Ti is supplied using metal-organic titatnium tetraisopropoxide material is thoroughly outlined.  These growth windows enable superior epitaxial strain-induced ferroelectric and dielectric properties to be accessed as demonstrated by chemical, structural, electrical, and optical characterization techniques.  For tensile strained CaTiO3 and compressive strained SrTiO3 films, the critical effects of nonstoichiometry on ferroelectric properties are investigated, where enhanced ferroelectric responses are only found for stoichiometric films grown inside of the growth windows, whereas outside of the optimal growth window conditions, ferroelectric properties are greatly deteriorated and eventually disappear for highly nonstoichiometric film compositions.  Utilizing these stoichiometric growth windows, high temperature polar phase transitions are discovered for compressively strained CaTiO3 films with transition temperatures in excess of 700 K, rendering this material as a strong candidate for high temperature electronic applications.  \nBeyond the synthesis of single phase materials using hybrid MBE, a methodology is presented for constructing layered (SrTiO3)n/(CaTiO3)n superlattice structures, where precise control over the unit cell layering thickness (n) is demonstrated using in-situ reflection high energy electron diffraction.  The effects of interface roughness and layering periodicity (n) on the strain-induced ferroelectric properties for a series of n=1-10 (SrTiO3)n/(CaTiO3)n superlattice films are investigated.  It is found that the stabilization of a ferroelectric phase is independent of n, but is however strongly dominated by the degree of interface roughness which is quantified by measuring the highest nth order X-ray diffraction peak splitting of each superlattice film.  A counter-intuitive realization is made whereby a critical amount of interface roughness is required in order to enable the formation of the predicted strain-stabilized ferroelectric phase, whereas sharp interfaces actually suppress this ferroelectric phase from manifesting.  It is shown how high-quality complex oxide superlattices can be constructed using hybrid MBE technique, allowing the ability to control layered materials at the atomic scale.  \nFurthermore, a detailed growth methodology is provided for constructing a layered n=4 SrO(SrTiO3)n Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase by hybrid MBE, where the ability to deposit single monolayers of SrO and TiO2 is utilized to build the RP film structure over a time period of 5 hours.  This is the first time that a thin film RP phase has been grown using hybrid MBE, where an a stable control over the fluxes is demonstrated during relatively long time periods of growth, which advantageously facilitates the synthesis of high-quality RP materials with excellent structural and chemical homogeneity.\nAdditionally, this work demonstrates some major advancements in optical second harmonic generation (SHG) characterization techniques of ferroelectric thin film materials.  The SHG characterization techniques developed here proved to be the \u2018bread-and-butter\u2019 for most of the work performed in this thesis, providing a powerful tool for identifying the existence of strain-induced ferroelectric phases, including their temperature dependence and polar symmetry. \nThe work presented in this dissertation will hopefully provide a preliminary road map for future hybrid MBE growers, scientists and researchers, to develop and investigate epitaxial strain and heterostructure layering induced phenomena in other complex oxide systems.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13510], "author_name_tesi": "Haislmaier, Ryan Cory", "last_name_ssi": "Haislmaier", "middle_name_ssi": "Cory", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkatraman Gopalan", "Roman Engel-Herbert", "Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry", "Long-Qing Chen", "Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Venkatraman Gopalan, Dissertation Advisor", "Roman Engel-Herbert, Committee Chair", "Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Long-Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Molecular beam epitaxy", "ferroelectrics", "superlattices", "thin films", "second harmonic generation", "complex oxides", "perovskites"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PARENTING SELF-EFFICACY, MOTHERS\u2019 EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONS, AND FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY\n", "id": "11200", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4661", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study aimed to add to the literature on parent emotion.

Built-in SHM methods are being researched that will allow for a condition-based inspection schedule, which increases operation time and reduces the need for periodic inspections.

However, since PVDF is a thermoplastic it is susceptible to temperature effects that can significantly reduce the accuracy of a damage feature. To address this issue, the thesis focuses on two main thrusts. The first is the development of a process by which a temperature-independent damage feature can be designed. The second is the efficient implementation of SAFE theory in a commercial FEM software, COMSOL. This would become a tool that allows dispersion curves and wave structures for composites to be accurately and quickly calculated to inform the process mentioned previously.\\\\\n\nThe investigation into developing a temperature-independent damage feature resulted in the demonstration of two possible processes by which such a damage feature could be designed. Both processes use a mode ratio and require that the modes used for the ratio have similar temperature dependence. The first process involves choosing modes for the mode ratio that undergo mode conversion from one mode to the other. The second process involves choosing modes for the mode ratio that have different sensitivities to the defect.\\\\\n\nThe implementation of the SAFE method in COMSOL's weak form PDE module resulted in accurate dispersion curves for most waveguides, but the wave structures were somewhat inconsistent with published solutions. Furthermore, when applied to a composite waveguide neither dispersion curves or wave structures matched published results. This discrepancy is attributed to a lack of enforcement of the traction continuity at the interface between layers. That being the case, an improved implementation that enforces this traction continuity is proposed for future work.

New tools like Building Information Modeling (BIM) allow architects to generate a single comprehensive building model which can share data with all participants of the design team. Energy simulation software (ESS) allow architects to analyze the energy efficiency of the design  from the initial design stage, thus better informing design decisions.\n\tArchitects are already using Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Energy Simulation Software (ESS). However, energy simulations are not  incorporated at  the early design stage (EDS)for site analysis and schematic design and are carried out at the end, thus making minimal design changes possible. This reduces the efficiency and overall quality of the design since the lack of initial energy analysis does not encourage sustainable strategies to be incorporated from the beginning.  In order to have a truly sustainable design it is essential that architects are able to carry out energy analysis from the very beginning of the design process, maximizing site potential, incorporating energy conscious strategies and optimizing energy conscious design early on. The simulation results also provide the architect with the ability to make quantitatively informed design decisions for energy efficiency. \n\tIntegrating BIM and ESS allows simulation data to be read with reference to the building model, thus making the energy analysis more comprehendible for designers and thus allowing design decisions based on it.

How do they compare to other countries with similar educational outcomes? Second, how are material, human, and curricular resources distributed across different types of students (girls vs. boys, richer vs. poorer, and public vs. private)? How do patterns of distribution differ across these groups?  I use nationally representative data from the 2007 Trends in Mathematics and Science Study to determine interregional and within country differences in school resources. Specifically, I use the eighth grade mathematics achievement data to determine what resource differences exist and to test whether those difference are statistically significant.  On average, compared to their OECD counterparts, Arab eighth graders experience shortages in several school resources, including instructional resources, instructional time, and teacher experience. Within the Arab region, eighth graders in the oil-rich countries around the Persian Gulf attend schools with less adequate instructional resources and school infrastructure, have less experience teachers, but spend a higher proportion of instructional time on math as compared to their counterparts in the Mashrek, the less rich Arab countries around the eastern Mediterranean.  The findings showed a reverse gender gap in achievement, benefitting girls, and few differences in resources by gender. Sectoral differences are a major source of inequality, explaining ten to twenty percent of the difference in achievement. Public school students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds attend schools with fewer material resources. Because it is often the most disadvantaged students who attend public schools, these findings cast doubt on the potential effect of schooling on social mobility and stratification.

A large number of conservative care interventions are available for this syndrome; however, the efficacy of these treatments has not been demonstrated through vigorous scientific investigation. Clinicians need both valid measures and effective interventions in order to efficiently manage this population. The purpose of this dissertation was to evaluate the quality of present reviews of specific stabilization exercises for chronic LBP, estimate the strength of the relationship between common abdominal muscle performance tests and surface electromyography activity and hip resultant joint moments (RJM), determine if these tests can detect change following core stabilization exercise training, and describe the treatment effectiveness of a specific stabilization program versus a generalized stabilization program for persons with LBP due to instability. Study 1 was a systematic review of systematic reviews of specific spinal stabilization exercises. In Study 2, surface EMG activity of the upper and lower rectus abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique muscles was obtained, while anterior superior iliac spine movement was simultaneously detected via motion analysis. Study 3 and 4 evaluated abdominal muscle performance in healthy participants and participants with low back pain respectively, in which double limb lowering test (DLLT) and lower abdominal muscle progression (LAMP) grades were determined by monitoring movement with a motion analysis system. Additionally, the Modified Oswestry Index and Visual Analog Scale were administered in Study 4. Both the DLLT and LAMP may be suitable for the examination of abdominal muscle performance as they have moderate to good correlations with abdominal muscle surface electromyography and hip RJM. The DLLT and LAMP do not correlate well with one another suggesting that they might measure different aspects of abdominal muscle performance.

Equally important, are questions of when and how countries peacefully negotiate their conflicts of interest.  Negotiations are seen as the most effective method of conflict management since they require active participation from both sides in a conflict in order to resolve their dispute.  Therefore, we need to understand why some negotiations attempts never get off the ground while others succeed.  My project examines decisions to negotiate and the outcomes of negotiations in a linked model.\n\nI make three key arguments in my dissertation.  First, I argue that the decision to negotiate and the outcome of negotiations are interdependent.  Most of the existing studies look only at negotiations that have succeeded, with little or no comparison to those that failed or those that never really started.  However, I maintain that in order to understand negotiation outcomes we need to consider negotiations as a two-stage process where in the first stage we explore what influences state leaders to want to negotiate, and then for those states that actually decide to negotiate we explore what factors lead them to reach agreements.  Also, I argue that factors affect each stage differently depending on how they influence decision makers.  Using the International Conflict Management Data, I find for instance, that we are more likely to see negotiations in high intensity conflicts, and between two democracies.  Also, negotiations are more likely to be successful if negotiating states are allies, have a territorial dispute, and/or are relatively equal in power.  In contrast, rivalry decreases the chance of having successful negotiations.  \n\nSecond, I argue that in order to understand negotiations we need detailed characteristics of all negotiations and not only those relating to disputes.  Data on negotiations are scarce.  However, what is common among them is that they identify conflict management attempts (i.e. negotiations) and/or outcomes with respect to the militarized conflicts identified in their data.  I collected information on all instances of negotiations between countries in Latin America and the Middle East that had territory, maritime, or river claims between 1990 and 2001. By focusing on claims, rather than open conflicts, I capture both militarized and non-militarized disagreements over several types of issues.  In addition, unlike most previous efforts, I trace several factors of the negotiation process including the timing of the diplomatic missions and how they may relate to violence, the rank of negotiating officials, the issues at stake, topics discussed, as well as the outcome of each negotiation event.\n\nThird, I argue that in order to understand the outcome of negotiations we need to take into consideration the characteristics of negotiations.  I also maintain that while contextual factors are more likely to influence the first stage i.e., whether states decide to negotiate, once states start negotiating, the interaction of the \u2018context\u2019 and \u2018process\u2019 will have more of an impact on whether states reach agreements.  I find, for example, that rivals who both initiate negotiations are more likely to witness a successful outcome even though rivalry was associated with a decreased probability of negotiations occurring in the first place.  Also, unequally powerful states negotiating on neutral territory are more likely to reach an agreement despite the fact that power preponderance decreased the probability of negotiation success. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1984], "author_name_tesi": "Halawi-Ghosn, Faten ", "last_name_ssi": "Halawi-Ghosn", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Faten", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Bennett Jr.", "Glenn Hunter Palmer", "Douglas William Lemke", "Gretchen G Casper", "Colin Flint", "Marie Hojnacki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Scott Bennett Jr., Committee Chair", "Glenn Hunter Palmer, Committee Chair", "Douglas William Lemke, Committee Member", "Gretchen G Casper, Committee Member", "Colin Flint, Committee Member", "Marie Hojnacki, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["conflict management", "negotiation", "international relations"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Investigating community norms and linguistic mechanisms in codeswitching: Bridging linguistic theory and psycholinguistic experimentation", "id": "13906lyp5028", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13906", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research into how bilinguals process codeswitched language is based largely on non-codeswitching bilinguals (i.e. Kootstra, van Hell, & Dijkstra, 2010), although there are exceptions (Guzzardo Tamargo, Vald\u00e9s Kroff, & Dussias, 2016; Vald\u00e9s Kroff, Dussias, Gerfen, Perrotti, & Bajo, 2016). Given links between language usage and language processing (Bybee, 2010; MacDonald, 2006), there is a glaring need to examine codeswitches in speakers who regularly engage in codeswitching. The present work helps fill this lacuna by examining both production and comprehension data by Spanish-English bilinguals for whom codeswitching is part of their linguistic repertoire.  \nTo study production, a corpus of naturalistic spoken codeswitched samples was created; to study comprehension, two experiments were conducted. Participants were recruited from Albuquerque, New Mexico, an area where bilingual communities engage regularly in Spanish-English codeswitching (Travis & Torres Cacoullos, 2013).  Crucially, participants (N=16) took part in both the production and comprehension studies, providing evidence on the processing of switched language from bilingual speakers for whom codeswitching is a discourse mode. \nFour codeswitched syntactic structures were targeted for investigation \u2013 estar \u2018be\u2019 + gerund, hacer \u2018do\u2019 + verb, NP + verb, and pronoun + verb. In Experiment 1, participants listened to a sentence containing a target codeswitch, completed a memory load task, and then repeated the sentence. The memory load component, consisting of a film description task, added a cognitive load, under the expectation that the changes participants made to the repetitions would be more aligned to their natural linguistic tendencies (Gullberg, Indefrey, & Muysken, 2009). Innovative in this research is the additional use of the film descriptions for the creation of a speech corpus consisting of spontaneous narratives. The corpus was then analyzed to determine the real usage patterns of the participants. Crucially, the codeswitches found in the corpus were used as the source materials in Experiment 2. Participants\u2019 eye movements were recorded while they read paragraphs aloud that contained the target codeswitched structures together with no-switch counterparts.\nThe driving question is whether habitual codeswitchers are sensitive to variation in bilingual speech. If so, switches that are preferred in production should be more easily processed than those that are not part of the linguistic repertoire of the speakers. Indeed, codeswitches that adhered to the usage patterns found in the spontaneous speech corpus were more easily repeated in the sentence repetition task, supporting the growing need to interpret lab-based findings by accounting for natural speech data. In the eye tracking study, while codeswitches led to longer reading durations compared to their no-switch counterparts, when dysfluencies were found in production, they were associated with only two of the target syntactic structures, suggesting that codeswitching preferences are modulated by syntactic structure. The findings indicate that codeswitching cost does not manifest in perceptible difficulties in real-life language and thus the construct should be reconsidered as gradient and multi-dimensional, to account for nuanced differences in language use. \nFindings are consistent with the conclusion that codeswitches that are part of the linguistic repertoire of the community are less costly to the processing mechanism during comprehension. Looking ahead, the data collection protocols put forward prove to be effective in eliciting valid codeswitching data. In sum, findings across the two experiments support a usage-based approach to the study of language in which production and comprehension are indelibly linked.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14262], "author_name_tesi": "Halberstadt, Lauren Perrotti", "last_name_ssi": "Halberstadt", "middle_name_ssi": "Perrotti", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paola Dussias", "Rena Torres Cacoullos", "John Lipski", "Matthew Carlson", "Carrie Jackson", "Damian Vergara Wilson", "Rena Torres Cacoullos", "Paola Dussias"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paola Dussias, Dissertation Advisor", "Rena Torres Cacoullos, Committee Chair", "John Lipski, Committee Member", "Matthew Carlson, Committee Member", "Carrie Jackson, Outside Member", "Damian Vergara Wilson, Special Member", "Rena Torres Cacoullos, Dissertation Advisor", "Paola Dussias, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["linguistics", "psycholinguistics", "sociolinguistics", "codeswitching", "bilingualism", "language science", "Spanish", "corpus", "eye tracking"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Study of Reconfigurability and Reconfigurable Products for Use in Design", "id": "10730", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2860", "abstract_tesi": "Reconfigurable systems are able to meet the increasingly diverse needs of consumers.

Examples of such diseases include obesity and non insulin dependent diabetes which are more prevalent in African American, Indigenous American and Latino populations compared to European Americans. Dementia and Osteoporosis are examples of diseases which are more prevalent in European Americans. It is obvious from these examples that the differences follow broad racial or ethnic categories and because of this correlation, medical research has focused extensively on investigating racial or ethnic differences in disease risk. The concept of \u2018Race\u2019 is multifaceted and any simplistic annotation is insufficient, may be even wrong, unless we make attempts to decompose the different aspects of race and use them appropriately in the context of biomedical research. Broadly speaking, race has two distinct components. The biological component referred to as Biogeographical ancestry; and the sociocultural component which reflects the ethnic heritage of an individual. Anthropological and genetic research in the past couple of decades has shown that the concept of typological races is scientifically obsolete yet the idea lives on and is used in biomedical research. Race/Ethnicity is still used as a classifier to establish and highlight population specific differences, while often inter-individual variation within a specific racial/ethnic category is ignored.\nAnthropological research has shown that anatomically modern humans originated in Africa, and migrated to different parts of the world. Over the course of time, continental populations were established and for a period, large scale interactions between continental populations were limited. Given the recent and common origin, most genomic regions in all continental populations are very similar. At some loci, however, there has been some change in allele frequencies in the time since the separation of populations. In the past few centuries, there have been large scale migrations, voluntary or forced, that gave rise to populations of \u201cmixed\u201d ancestry. And at those loci where allele frequencies differed between continental populations, this has resulted in long range non random association in the admixed population. Many US residents can trace their genetic ancestry to more than one continent. The European colonial period that started in the late 1400s brought together in the New World, populations that had been geographically isolated, namely, Europeans, West Africans and Indigenous Americans. The impact of this was two fold, biological, which resulted in genes from different ancestral populations coming together in varying proportions in the different admixed populations and also cultural, in that certain ways of life of one population were adopted by another. Thus, the differences in disease prevalence which appear to follow broad racial categories could have been influenced by both genetic and non genetic factors (including environmental, sociocultural and behavioral factors).\nSeveral resident US populations including European Americans, African Americans and Mexican Americans, which are classified as different races in the biomedical literature have been studied in this thesis. Populations with a recent history of admixture provide a unique opportunity for understanding the genetic bases of many common diseases. If ancestry of alleles at each locus can be established, then it will be possible to correlate the proportion of alleles inherited from an ancestral population to a phenotype and thus establish a genetic basis for the disease. This will help in decomposing the different sources (genetic and non-genetic) that contribute to the phenotype. Thus, estimating ancestry of alleles at a locus is important. Several factors influence the estimate, including nature and number of markers used, the method used for estimating ancestry and the model of admixture that is assumed.\nMitochondrial and Y chromosome segments only provide information regarding paternal or maternal lineage. Autosomal loci on the other hand represent all ancestors of an individual and these are the loci that have been studied in this thesis. The distribution of individual genomic ancestry in different populations has been estimated using several different methods and it is shown that wide variations exist among individuals who self identify as being from the same racial or ethnic category. In addition, significant overlap is seen between two of the racial categories, European Americans and Latinos which are described in this thesis. Modest amounts of geographic variation are also observed within the same racial category. Additional simulation studies have been done to investigate the effects of markers, model specifications and method choice on the reliability of the estimates of individual genomic ancestry obtained. \nAdmixture mapping is an approach that uses the ancestry of alleles at a locus in mapping genes for diseases that differ among populations. Several methods have been developed recently to use this approach. This method is suitable for complex diseases since it is unaffected by locus heterogeneity and allelic heterogeneity. In addition unknown gene-environmental interactions further complicate the study of such diseases. Preliminary admixture mapping of hypertension and obesity have been performed and are presented. One locus has been identified that shows strong linkage with obesity in an African American sample. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2465], "author_name_tesi": "Halder, Indrani ", "last_name_ssi": "Halder", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Indrani", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Shriver", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss", "Hiroshi Akashi", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Esteban J Parra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Shriver, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Committee Chair", "Hiroshi Akashi, Committee Member", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Member", "Esteban J Parra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Genomic ancestry", "individual ancestry estimation", "population stratification", "admixture mapping", "complex diseases", "racial/ethnic differences in disease risk"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Postural Control in Children and Young Adults", "id": "6376", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5477", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nPostural control is essential in functional performance from infancy through adulthood.  Despite the importance of postural control, researchers do not have a thorough understanding of postural control in school-aged children and young adults.  The purposes of these studies were to investigate age-related postural control differences and the efficacy of a balance intervention program in improving postural control among six and seven year old children.  \nSixty-two subjects participated.  They were classified into three age groups 1) 19-20 years (N=16), 2) 9-10 years (N=15), and 3) 6-7 years (N=31).  Subjects completed postural control testing including: 1) Center of Pressure Velocity (COPV), 2) Functional Reach, 3) Berg Balance Scale, 4) Pediatric Balance Scale, and 5) Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale.  The six-seven year old children were then assigned to a training group that completed a six-week balance intervention program (N=12), or a control group (N=14).  Following the intervention period, subjects repeated the testing.  \nAn analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare means at baseline among the three age groups.  A repeated measures ANOVA was performed to examine the efficacy of the intervention.  \nSignificant age-related differences were found for all measures.  Post hoc testing revealed that the young adults scored significantly better than the 9-10 year old children in all dependent variables except the Berg Balance Scale and Pediatric Balance Scale.  They scored better than the 6-7 year old children in all measures.  The 9-10 year old children scored better than the 6-7 year old children in all variables except left leg stance COPV and the ABC Scale.  \nFollowing the training program, no statistically significant differences were noted except for a main effect for time in the functional reach test.  Subjects reached further during post-testing than they did at baseline.  Despite the lack of statistically significant changes, there were moderate to strong effect sizes among the training group suggesting that more research is needed to examine the efficacy of balance training among healthy children.  \nThese results support previous reports of age-related postural control differences.  Despite the lack of statistically significant improvements associated with the training program more research in this area is warranted.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5469], "author_name_tesi": "Hale, Sheri Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Hale", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Sheri", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jay Hertel, Ph D, Atc", "Craig Denegar, Ph D, Pt, Atc", "Byron C Jones", "Karl Maxim Newell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jay Hertel, Ph D, Atc, Committee Chair", "Craig Denegar, Ph D, Pt, Atc, Committee Member", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member", "Karl Maxim Newell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["balance", "pediatrics", "training"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "YOU, ME, AND IT: MULTIMEDIA RELATIONSHIP MAINTENANCE IN THE 21ST CENTURY", "id": "11970", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3375", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The advancement of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has led to the re-conceptualization of relationships. Currently, multiple frameworks exist that detail the different behaviors individuals enact to maintain relationships. However, the only electronic media these relational maintenance typologies include is the telephone. This is a limitation of the literature: first, numerous ICTs exist and are being used for maintenance, and second computer-mediated communication (CMC) is being categorized only as a behavior and not also as a context. Previous research has demonstrated that computer-mediated interactions differ from in-person interactions. Therefore, a framework that incorporates CMC as a medium through which the maintenance of relationships occurs is merited. Analyzing data from 16 semi-structured interviews and 421 surveys, this study sought to overcome the limitations in the literature by examining interpersonal relational maintenance through the use of CMC. The overall research goals were (a) to explore how and why CMC is used to support the maintenance of non-platonic relationships that have been initiated in physical environments, (b) to examine the perceived influence of relational maintenance via CMC on relational attributes (i.e., commitment, control, liking, love, quality, satisfaction, stability, and trust), and (c) to explore whether the pre-existing relational maintenance model and typology could be applied to a CMC context, while classifying CMC as a medium. This study was composed of three phases: (a) interview data collection, (b) survey pilot, and (c) survey data collection. Participants in Phase 1 consisted of 16 adults who could report on their use of CMC in a current or past non-platonic relationship. A portion of these same adults participated in Phase 2 (N = 12) of the study. Phase 3 participants (N = 421) were adults who used CMC to maintain their pre-established, monogamous, heterosexual, non-platonic relationship that was initiated in a physical environment. \n\nUsing textual analysis, descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and multivariate analysis of variance, seven research questions were addressed. Findings indicated that the structure of the RMS did not hold when examined in the context of CMC. The frequency with which relational maintenance behaviors (RMBs) were utilized indicated that positivity was used the most and social networks were used the least. Additionally, the overarching reason CMC was used for relational maintenance was because of a desire/need to interact with one\u2019s partner (i.e., accessibility and connectedness). Overall, participants believed that using CMC for relational maintenance had a positive impact on their relational attributes. Finally, significant differences were found between RMBs enacted in CMC, the reasons individuals used CMC for relational maintenance, and the perception individuals had of the impact that RMBs enacted in CMC had on the relationship: These differences varied based on relational stage (seriously dating or married) and cohabitation status, but not gender. All of these findings have important implications for relational maintenance literature and relational maintenance execution. Avenues that future researchers may take as a step toward achieving the goal of understanding relational maintenance and how relationships are impacted by CMC enactments are detailed in this study. Ultimately, knowing and understanding this information may help determine how CMC and ICTs can be utilized to assist individuals in maintaining happy and healthy relationships.

Following the Kantian insight that the aesthetic is what awakens us to form, I argue that fictional discourse as such acts as a powerful access point for thinking structure, however incomplete the content of its representations\u2014\"realism\" of a certain sort, in other words, is to be found in form rather than content. Jean-Luc Nancy suggests that there is a homology between the structural characteristics of worlds and of works of art, that \"a world perhaps always, at least potentially, shares the unity proper to the work of art.\" As such, the way fictional narratives simultaneously imply and produce fictional worlds larger than themselves is homologous to the way our day-to-day experience simultaneously implies and produces the totality of the real world, which is to say in some way, ontology is a fundamentally aesthetic operation. Contrary to continued assertions over the last two decades that cultural production broadly and the novel in particular have lost their relevance in a world of systems and commodities in endless, dizzying circulation, I argue that fictional discourse of particular kinds, through the connections between form, narrative, worldness, and structure, allows us to start thinking the questions about the contemporary that otherwise seem insurmountably daunting.\n\nGiven the continued prominence of historical and future-speculative fictions on the marketplace and the theater marquees, given their increasing but under-remarked permeation into the literary mainstream, and given the apparent difficulty of the contemporary confronting its own structure head-on, I take as my corpus an array of speculative fictions\u2014past-oriented and future-oriented, popular and literary, prose and televisual, realist and otherwise\u2014that seem in some way to comment on the contemporary moment of their production by way of narrating and world-making in other times. In particular, The Speculative Present asks what contemporary culture's apparently frequent desire to colonize, analogize, and allegorize other temporal moments tells us about the contemporary, about the kinds of structure to which it is attuned, and about the possibilities and limits of its structural imagination. What structural realities or connections, that is, are made visible by these narrative journeys to past and future?\n\nIf there is an active strain of contemporary cultural production that seems to have a sort of negative theology of itself\u2014a version of the contemporary fitting a Saussurean model of \"a system of differences with no positive terms,\" defining itself against and alongside other moments that seem simultaneously more speculative (reassembling the past, projecting the future) and more solidly comprehensible\u2014then what is produced conceptually if we take this negative theology seriously? Insofar as something roughly describable as postmodernism has been arguably the cultural dominant of the last half century, the contemporary often seems to characterize itself in these kinds of negative terminologies: the literature of exhaustion, the end of history, the death of sincerity, post- this, the loss of that. To whatever extent a broad cross-section of the contemporary theorizes itself in these ways\u2014as an endlessly significant transitional moment, as always an ending and thus implicitly also a beginning\u2014I argue that these genres, far from being on the periphery of contemporary culture, are at its very heart.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8107], "author_name_tesi": "Haley, Adam Dunnington", "last_name_ssi": "Haley", "middle_name_ssi": "Dunnington", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Francis Berube", "Michael Francis Berube", "Jeffrey Nealon", "Brian Lennon", "Eric Robert Hayot"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Francis Berube, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Francis Berube, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Nealon, Committee Member", "Brian Lennon, Committee Member", "Eric Robert Hayot, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["contemporary American fiction", "speculative fiction", "science fiction", "history", "historical fiction", "apocalypse"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "DOSE-DEPENDENT EFFECT OF AEROBIC EXERCISE ON THE CONCENTRATION OF INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS IN A POPULATION OF WOMEN AT HIGH RISK FOR BREAST CANCER", "id": "15238jsh16", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15238", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Women who are carriers of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are at an increased risk of developing breast cancer.  In addition to BRCA, there are other mutations that also increase one\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer. BRCA and other BC-associated gene mutations have been shown to be integral components of the pathways that repair damaged DNA and arrest the cell cycle.  DNA damage occurs naturally by multiple mechanisms including oxidative stress.  Higher levels of oxidative stress can be caused by inflammation.  Therefore, a chronic inflammatory state can lead to higher oxidative stress, which will cause more DNA damage and a higher mutational load that place carriers of BC-associated gene mutations at a higher cancer risk.  Women at known high risk for breast cancer are often highly motivated to reduce risk.  In contrast with costly and invasive risk reduction strategies such as mastectomy, lifestyle changes such as exercise may help decrease breast cancer risk as well as risk of other life threatening diseases via a change in levels of inflammation.  This study assessed a panel of inflammatory biomarkers both before and after an aerobic exercise intervention over the course of five menstrual cycles in high risk, premenopausal women who participated in the Women In Steady Exercise Research (WISER) Sister study.  Participants were randomly assigned to either a control, low-dose, or high-dose exercise group.

We found a significant dose-dependent increase in levels of the pro-inflammatory biomarkers CCL2 (Ptrend=0.05), IL12 (Ptrend<0.001) and TNF\u03b1 (Ptrend<0.001). The exercise intervention significantly increased fitness capacity (Ptrend<0.001) and energy expenditure (Ptrend<0.001).  The intervention also significantly decreased total mass (Ptrend = 0.03), total fat mass (Ptrend =0.001) and percent body fat (Ptrend<0.001).  Changes in total fat mass and percent body fat were significantly associated with a decrease in IL10 levels for the control group only.  No other biomarker was significantly associated with a change in total mass, total fat mass or percent body fat.  Overall, participants in the study experienced improved body composition and energetic measures but increased levels of inflammation.  The majority of studies agree that increased physical activity and lower levels of inflammation can reduce a women\u2019s risk of developing BC.  Additionally, most studies have shown that physical activity is capable of improving levels of inflammation.  However, to our knowledge there has not been a study assessing how a dosed aerobic exercise intervention can affect levels of inflammation in a population of women at increased risk of BC.  The number of women at high risk of developing BC will continue to grow as new BC-associated genes are discovered.  Due to the increased level of inflammation following exercise reported here, future studies must focus on whether aerobic exercise is able to benefit these high risk women.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16639], "author_name_tesi": "Haley, Jeremy Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Haley", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Jeremy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen M Sturgeon", "Kathryn Schmitz", "Kristen H Kjerulff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen M Sturgeon, Thesis Advisor", "Kathryn Schmitz, Committee Member", "Kristen H Kjerulff, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["breast cancer", "high-risk women", "exercise", "inflammation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Template Replication of Nanomaterials", "id": "21942", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10053", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis focuses on one central theme, the template replication of nanomaterials. The first half of this thesis focuses on studying new properties that emerge in nanostructured materials prepared by existing template replication strategies. The second half of this thesis focuses on the development of novel strategies to synthesize nanomaterials by replication of nanoscale templates.\nChapter 1 of this thesis presents an introduction to the synthesis of nanomaterials by template replication. Top down and bottom up approaches are covered in this chapter. \nChapter 2 of this thesis presents the different techniques used to characterize the materials studied in this thesis.\nChapter 3 presents the optical properties of one-dimensional metallic gratings coupled to a one-dimensional photonic crystal. Light incident upon a periodically corrugated metal/dielectric interface can generate surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) waves. This effect is used in many sensing applications.  Similar metallodielectric nanostructures are used for light trapping in solar cells, but the gains are modest because SPP waves can be excited only at specific angles and with one linear polarization state of incident light.  Here we report the optical absorptance of a metallic grating coupled to silicon oxide/oxynitride layers with a periodically varying refractive index, i.e., a 1D photonic crystal.  These structures show a dramatic enhancement relative to those employing a homogeneous dielectric material.  Multiple SPP waves can be activated, and both s- and p-polarized incident light can be efficiently trapped. Many SPP modes are weakly bound and display field enhancements that extend throughout the dielectric layers.   These modes have significantly longer propagation lengths than the single SPP modes excited at the interface of a metallic grating and a uniform dielectric.  These results suggest that metallic gratings coupled to photonic crystals could have utility for light trapping in photovoltaics, sensing, and other applications. The metallic gratings used in this study were prepared by template replication process.\nChapter 4 in this dissertation presents data which demonstrates that the resonance frequency of multiple SPP waves can be tuned by varying the periodicity of the metallic grating. In this study only p-polarized incident light was considered in the visible and near-infrared regimes. When the absorptance was plotted against the angle of incidence, the excitation of an SPP wave was indicated by an absorptance peak whose angular location did not change with the number of periods (beyond a threshold) of the photonic crystal. A decrease in the period of the metal grating resulted in shifting the excitation of the SPP waves to smaller wavelengths. The metallic gratings used in this study were prepared by template replication process.\nChapter 5 in this dissertation presents a new method of fabricating wafer scale metallic gratings. By combining nanosphere lithography with template stripping, silicon wafers were patterned with hexagonal arrays of nanowells or pillars.  These silicon masters were then replicated in gold by metal evaporation, resulting in wafer-scale hexagonal gratings for plasmonic applications.  In the nanosphere lithography step, two-dimensional colloidal crystals of 510 nm diameter polystyrene spheres were assembled at the air-water interface and transferred to silicon wafers.  The spheres were etched in oxygen plasma in order to define their size for masking of the silicon wafer.  For fabrication of metallic nano-pillar arrays, an alumina film was grown over the nanosphere layer and the spheres were then removed by bath sonication.  The well pattern was defined in the silicon wafer by reactive ion etching in a chlorine plasma. For fabrication of metal nano-well arrays, the nanosphere monolayer was used directly as a mask and exposed areas of the silicon wafer were plasma-etched anistropically in SF6/Ar.  Both techniques could be used to produce sub-wavelength metal replica structures with controlled pillar or well diameter, depth and profile, on the wafer scale, without the use of direct writing techniques to fabricate masks or masters.\nChapter 6 presents a new method of preparing microporous titania particles replicated from Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) templates. Metal-organic frameworks provide access to structures with nanoscale pores, the size and connectivity of which can be controlled by combining the appropriate metals and linkers. Microporous titania replicas were made from the MOF template HKUST-1 by dehydration, infiltration with titanium isopropoxide, and subsequent hydrothermal treatment at 200 \u00b0C.  Etching of the MOF with 1M aqueous HCl followed by 5% H2O2 yielded a titania replica that retained the morphology of the parent HKUST-1 crystals and contained partially ordered micropores as well as disordered mesopores. Interestingly, the synthesis of porous titania from the HKUST-1 template stabilized the formation of brookite, a rare titania polymorph.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9751], "author_name_tesi": "Hall, Anthony Shoji", "last_name_ssi": "Hall", "middle_name_ssi": "Shoji", "first_name_ssi": "Anthony", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tom Mallouk", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "John V Badding", "Douglas Henry Werner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tom Mallouk, Dissertation Advisor", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Douglas Henry Werner, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Plasmonics", "Porous Materials", "Replication", "Metal Organic Frameworks", "Light Trapping", "Nanocasting", "Photonic Crystals"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Social Cognition of Rejected Status Students in Late Elementary School: An Examination of Low, Medium, and HIgh Social Prominence Subtypes\n", "id": "11308", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1071", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study examined the social network perceptions of fifth grade rejected students (N=723).

Local control has been undermined by consolidation reforms, however, centralizing governance under professional superintendents. Yet local control not only persists, but is assertively protected by communities, particularly in rural regions of the country. This dissertation examines how school boards enact local control today. Using a three article format, I examine who has control, how local control is enacted, and what the limits are to local autonomy. The study contributes to the fields of district governance, local control, and intergovernmental policy implementation. \nIn the first article, I address the contradiction of how communities perceive locally controlled school boards versus policymakers and educational researchers. Using a case study, I investigate three district school boards in Vermont, which are part of a regional supervisory union overseen by a superintendent and a central school board. Employing the theory of policy co-construction, I investigate how the district boards subvert statutes delegating governance, what accounts for variations in their adaptations, and how they affect board-superintendent relations. I find the central board and superintendent have limited authority, enabling district boards to negotiate greater autonomy. Boards\u2019 autonomy varies by their community capacity to take on additional responsibilities. Board-superintendent relationships, ranging from collaborative to contentious, also varied by community and board capacity. I explain how local capacity influences board autonomy and board-superintendent relations in locally controlled districts, which I illustrate in a typology. \nIn the second article, I build on my findings from Chapter 2 of empowered, autonomous school boards in Vermont to examine the relationship between schools and communities in locally controlled districts. Using a socio-cultural perspective, I assert that communities and schools are sites of mutually influential interaction. However, schools have strong institutional norms, necessitating deliberate practices to influence the technical core of instruction. To analyze effective democratic practices of boards, I use two exemplary case studies where locally controlled boards ensure alignment between community values and educational practices. Both boards use the school budget process as the primary mechanism of local control. The boards develop community trust by maintaining transparent communication and providing opportunities for community participation. The study identifies strategies boards in more restrictive settings can employ to strengthen democratic participation. \nIn the third article, I examine how local districts interpret and implement external policies, specifically No Child Left Behind (NCLB) accountability mandates. While researchers know there is significant variability of state-level enactment of assessments mandates, less is known about local district interpretation and implementation. Using a case study of three locally controlled districts, I investigate how district leaders implement and interpret assessment mandates. I use policy co-construction and sense-making to interpret leaders\u2019 decisions. I find districts had to comply with implementation, a clear limit to local control. Yet implementation was influenced by local capacity and will, creating variability of assessment procedures. District leaders\u2019 interpreted high-stakes testing as a hortatory tool that protects local control, both within the district, and from external state oversight. These findings contribute to accountability research by explaining how local leaders make sense of accountability reforms can subvert their intended value, as local districts use them as a hortatory tool to promote local values and needs. \nThe dissertation explains why and how centralization of board governance is resisted by communities, and what steps practitioners, researchers, and policymakers can take to ensure communities retain democratic voice in their school governance. The study concludes with an agenda for continuing research on locally controlled school boards.

Here we intend to provide information on how this electrolytic cell impacts the cycle\u2019s efficiency and electric energy requirements. Through a better understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of this electrochemical cell, the electric energy requirements needed for hydrogen production with this cycle can become available.\nChapter 1 focuses on the relationship between equilibrium thermodynamics of the electrochemical reactions and the cycle\u2019s efficiency. Using Gibbs energy minimization (GEM), thermodynamic speciation diagrams of CuCl(aq) and CuCl2(aq) were generated to provide insights into the electrochemically active species. Results from GEM were used to quantify the Gibbs energy, Enthalpy and entropy of the electrochemical reactions. Additionally, Gibbs energy values theoretically calculated were compared to those experimentally measured. Thermodynamic, voltage, current and overall efficiencies of the electrolyzer were quantified to include speciation effects and activity coefficients.  \nChapter 2 explores the electrochemical kinetics of the positive electrode using a rotating disc electrode (RDE) and the effectiveness of catalyst application techniques from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and full cell polarization curves. With the RDE, the positive electrode overpotential-current density relationship was defined. It was found that electrochemical kinetic parameters could be obtained for the positive electrode reaction on different catalyst materials with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and polarization curves. On both platinum and glassy carbon surfaces, the positive electrode reaction was very fast relative to other electrochemical reactions. Furthermore, removing platinum completely from the positive electrode had little effect on the polarization curves obtained from the full cell, whereas improving spray application technique significantly improved the performance relative to the painting technique.\nChapter 3 investigates the effects of concentrated HCl(aq) on the electrochemical kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction. EIS and LSV were used to define kinetic parameters of the electrochemical reaction for polycrystalline platinum. It was found that the overpotential \u2013 current density behavior of the reaction on platinum followed the generalized Butler-Volmer equation.\nChapter 4 presents a model to simulate the applied potential for the CuCl(aq)/HCl(aq) electrolyzer over a range of experimental conditions. The model presented here separates the potential contributions of the positive electrode, negative electrode and the membrane. Total applied potential was described using non-equilibrium thermodynamics, equilibrium thermodynamics and electrochemical kinetics. Using the information collected in Chapters 1-3 and some literature data, it was found that model simulations could match experimental data with only one adjustable parameter. Simulations of different values of active electrode area, ohmic resistance, and extent of CuCl(aq) conversion were performed. It was found that the extent of CuCl(aq) conversion and ohmic resistance, Rohm, strongly impacted the simulated Ecell value at high cell currents. Significant improvements to the electrolyzer performance could be obtained if Rohm was decreased relative to similar improvements in electrochemical kinetics or active electrode area. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11389], "author_name_tesi": "Hall, Derek M", "last_name_ssi": "Hall", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Derek", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Serguei Lvov", "Serguei Lvov", "Ljubisa R Radovic", "Michael John Janik", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Serguei Lvov, Dissertation Advisor", "Serguei Lvov, Committee Chair", "Ljubisa R Radovic, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CuCl HCl Electrolyzer", "Thermodynamics", "Kinetics", "Efficiency"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Species-specificity of three commonly used and two novel mosquito field-sampling devices\n", "id": "13886", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7424", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Effective sampling is a stepping-stone to efficient use of resources, targeted control efforts, and success in nuisance or vector mosquito management.

This dissertation is a series of investigations that create a clearer picture of the how the olfactory system that is used by these beetles to detect general odorants and pheromone components is constructed. Chapter 2 contains the results of neuroanatomical investigations of the male and female antennal lobe, in which I looked for possible sexual dimorphism that might explain any differences in male vs. female behavioral responses to sex pheromone components. Any sexually dimorphic glomeruli would be likely targets for pheromone-tuned OSNs.

These and other issues are closely related to immigrant settlement patterns across U.S. neighborhoods. Understanding immigrants&#8223; imprint on the residential landscape is thus central to broader debates over how immigration impacts American life and how immigrants fare in their new home. This dissertation seeks to address this important topic by providing a detailed, yet comprehensive account of new immigrants' residential circumstances. Specifically, I use neighborhood-level data from Census 2000 and household-level data from the American Housing Survey to explore patterns and correlates of residential segregation and attainment for ten new immigrant groups. In sum, I find that the assimilation of new immigrants is clearly underway: Greater socioeconomic resources and acculturation are associated with greater proximity to native-born whites, lower residential isolation, higher-quality housing, and better neighborhoods. On the other hand, my research also points to a rigid racial/ethnic pattern with Asian immigrants being less segregated and occupying superior housing and neighborhood environments than Latin American and Caribbean immigrants. The extraordinarily high levels of segregation for black immigrants are especially disturbing and indicate the continued relevance of the principle of black exceptionalism. I also show that the fairly high levels of immigrant group segregation in established metropolitan areas are being reproduced in new and nongateway metropolitan destinations. Despite some of these troubling patterns, my analysis generally suggests that immigrant segregation does not translate into poor housing and neighborhood outcomes. While I do find that the odds of homeownership are lower for immigrants in segregated contexts, and that segregation is consistently detrimental for Mexican immigrants&#8223; residential attainment, segregation tends to have no effect or exerts positive ones on other measures of housing and neighborhood quality. All in all, this research points not just to the challenges faced by new arrivals in American residential life, but also to the clear signs that new immigrants are participating in the American Dream.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4325], "author_name_tesi": "Hall, Matthew ", "last_name_ssi": "Hall", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barrett Alan Lee", "Barrett Alan Lee", "Gordon F De Jong", "Glenn A Firebaugh", "John Iceland", "Deborah Jean Roempke Graefe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barrett Alan Lee, Dissertation Advisor", "Barrett Alan Lee, Committee Chair", "Gordon F De Jong, Committee Member", "Glenn A Firebaugh, Committee Member", "John Iceland, Committee Member", "Deborah Jean Roempke Graefe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["housing quality", "residential segregation", "immigration", "neighborhood quality"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Beyond genome-wide association studies (GWAS): Emerging methods for investigating complex associations for common traits", "id": "26751", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11861", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci associated with human phenotypes. This approach, however, does not consider the richly diverse and complex environment with which humans interact throughout the life course, nor does it allow for interrelationships among genetic loci and across traits. Methods that embrace pleiotropy (the effect of one locus on more than one trait), gene-environment (GxE) and gene-gene (GxG) interactions will further unveil the impact of alterations in biological pathways and identify genes that are only involved with disease in the context of the environment. This valuable information can be used to assess personal risk and choose the most appropriate medical interventions based on an individual\u2019s genotype and environment. Additionally, a richer picture of the genetic and environmental aspects that impact complex disease will inform environmental regulations to protect vulnerable populations. Three key limitations of GWAS lead to an inability to robustly model trait prediction in a manner that reflects biological complexity: 1) GWAS explore traits in isolation, one phenotype at a time, preventing investigators from uncovering relationships that exist among multiple traits; 2) GWAS do not account for the exposome; rather, they simply explore the effect of genetic loci on an outcome; and 3) GWAS do not allow for interactions between genetic loci, despite the complexity that exists in biology. The aims described in this dissertation address these limitations. Methods employed in each aim have the potential to: uncover genetic interactions, unveil complex biology behind phenotype networks, inform public policy decisions concerning environmental exposures, and ultimately assess individual disease-risk.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11314], "author_name_tesi": "Hall, Molly Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Hall", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Molly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie", "Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie", "Santhosh Girirajan", "Scott Brian Selleck", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "George H Perry", "Catherine Mc Carty"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie, Dissertation Advisor", "Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie, Committee Chair", "Santhosh Girirajan, Committee Chair", "Scott Brian Selleck, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "George H Perry, Committee Member", "Catherine Mc Carty, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gene-gene interactions", "epistasis", "PheWAS", "phenome", "EWAS", "exposome", "gene-environment interactions", "complex traits"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EMOTION REGULATION, MULTIPLE RISK,\nAND EXTERNALIZING BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS\n\n\n\n", "id": "9721", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5558", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Children\u2019s skill at regulating their emotions is an important component of short- and long-term healthy development. Difficulties with emotion regulation are associated with behavior problems across childhood, beginning in the toddler and preschool years, and skillful emotion regulation appears to play a protective role for children at risk for the development of behavioral difficulties. The present study examined the links among multiple risk, emotion regulation, and externalizing behavior problems longitudinally in young children (ages 30 to 48 months). Risk was conceptualized as exposure to stressors, and both additive and cumulative approaches to assessing risk were employed. Exposure to higher levels of risk, as measured by both approaches, predicted externalizing behavior problem symptoms. Skill at emotion regulation inconsistently predicted externalizing symptoms. Finally, contrary to prediction, competent emotion regulation did not act as a buffer, moderating the link between risk exposure and behavior problems. Possible explanations for the unexpected findings regarding young children\u2019s emotion regulation are examined, and implications of the findings for the conceptualization and study of risk are discussed.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5549], "author_name_tesi": "Hall, Sarah Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Hall", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pamela Marie Cole", "Pamela Marie Cole", "Amy Dyanna Marshall", "Kristin Buss", "J Douglas Coatsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pamela Marie Cole, Dissertation Advisor", "Pamela Marie Cole, Committee Chair", "Amy Dyanna Marshall, Committee Member", "Kristin Buss, Committee Member", "J Douglas Coatsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["protective factors", "externalizing", "behavior problems", "cumulative risk", "risk", "emotion regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The contribution of an iron genetic modifier, HFE, to Alzheimer's disease\n", "id": "10189", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1728", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the human central nervous system characterized by loss of memory that leads to dementia. The pathological characteristics of AD include an accumulation of amyloid-\u00e2 (A\u00e2) plaques and aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau protein, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), throughout the brain. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain AD etiology including the loss of brain iron regulation. Among the areas investigated are the of variant forms of the HFE gene as a risk factor or disease modifier.  HFE is an iron regulatory protein that limits cellular iron uptake. A mutation in the HFE gene can result in a loss of function. Epidemiological studies have investigated an association between HFE polymorphisms and AD risk; however these studies are not all in agreement. In order to determine more clearly how HFE could impact neurodegenerative processes, experiments in this thesis were designed to investigate the cellular contribution of the HFE H63D polymorphism in proposed AD pathogenic pathways. We utilized a novel stably transfected human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell model expressing HFE polymorphisms for our studies. \nThe thesis focused on three main areas: 1) HFE and amyloid regulation, 2) HFE and tau phosphorylation and 3) HFE effects on potential drug treatment strategies in AD. To evaluate amyloid regulation, we determined amyloid precursor protein (APP) synthesis, processing, and cellular vulnerability to A\u00e2 toxicity in the presence of different forms of HFE. APP levels increased with HFE expression, although no effect of HFE variants was observed. There was no change in APP processing as determined by performing spectrofluorometric secretase-specific activity assays. We discovered that cells expressing the H63D variant are more sensitive to A\u00e2 peptide exposure determined by MTT assay [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide]. There was an up-regulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway as determined by increases in caspase-9 expression, caspase-3 activity, and early apoptosis based on detection of Annexin V. It appeared that these changes were a result of mitochondria dysfunction in the cells expressing H63D because we also observed an increase in Bax in the cellular mitochondrial fraction and cytochrome C levels were increased in the cytosolic fraction. Mitochondria dysfunction and oxidative stress can act as indirect mechanisms to impact tau phosphorylation. Tau phosphorylation is regulated by a homeostasis of tau kinase and phosphatase activity that can be impacted by cellular stressors. In cells expressing the H63D polymorphism, tau phosphorylation was increased at serine-residues implicated in NFT generation. There was no change in phosphatase expression in H63D cells; yet there was an increase in glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3\u00e2) activity as determined by measuring GSK-3\u00e2 phosphorylation at its serine-9 residue. The genotype associated alterations in GSK-3\u00e2 activity with HFE expression prompted us to investigate the role of a novel intracellular regulator of amyloid and tau phosphorylation; the prolyl-peptidyl cis/trans isomerase, Pin1. Oxidative stress has been shown to impact Pin1 expression and activity, thus we hypothesized that H63D cells would have altered Pin1 activity. Total Pin1 expression levels were not affected by HFE expression; however there was an increase in phosphorylation of Pin1 at its serine-16 residue suggesting a decrease in Pin1 activity in H63D cells. We also found that iron-mediated oxidative stress could increase Pin1 phosphorylation. \nOverall, these data suggest that gene-environment interactions are significant in elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets to improve disease outcomes. Independent of HFE status, we discovered that GSK-3\u00e2 could be impacted by cellular iron. Thus, increased dietary iron intake could result in even higher GSK-3\u00e2 activity in individuals carrying an H63D allele. GSK-3\u00e2 is involved in numerous cellular processes including, but not limited to: protein phosphorylation, mitochondria function, and apoptosis, which were impacted by expression of the H63D HFE polymorphism. These data suggest GSK-3\u00e2 as a potential pharmacological target that could greatly improve cellular function in AD patients, especially those carrying the H63D allele.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1714], "author_name_tesi": "Hall II, Eric Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Hall II", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "James Robert Connor", "Anne M Andrews", "Robert J Milner", "Jiyue Zhu", "Jack T Rogers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Dissertation Advisor", "James Robert Connor, Committee Chair", "Anne M Andrews, Committee Member", "Robert J Milner, Committee Member", "Jiyue Zhu, Committee Member", "Jack T Rogers, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["amyloid", "neurodegeneration", "HFE", "iron", "tau", "pin1"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Behavior of Volatile Organic Compounds Sampled in the Baltimore/dc Region During July 2011", "id": "16055", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7878", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ozone pollution is almost exclusively formed in the troposphere, and excessive mixing ratios occur over generally urban areas with high populations.

Mixing ratio and reactivity studies were performed to determine relative ozone production potential of the sampled VOCs and their sources. Two case studies for canisters samples collected at the Edgewood site were used to more thoroughly investigate the impact of different air mass sources on locally measured ozone mixing ratios. The air masses measured were found to be highly variable, with the balance of anthropogenic to biogenic species measured in an air mass changing rapidly over short time periods. A diurnal signal was also picked up in the reactivity measurements from isoprene, which contributed approximately 50% of the measured VOC reactivity in midday samples. The methods used in this thesis allow for a selection method to be developed where the most important VOC species are identified and used to focus a data set.

Atmopspheric benzene affects human health and welfare, and low level exposure (< 0.5 ppbv) has been connected to measureable increases in cancer rates. Benzene measurements have been increasing in the region of oil and natural gas (O&NG) development located to the north of Denver. High time resolution measurements of VOCs were collected using a proton-transfer-reaction quadrupole mass spectrometry (PTR-QMS) instrument at the Platteville Atmospheric Observatory (PAO) in Colorado to investigate how O&NG development impacts air quality within the Wattenburg Gas Field (WGF) in the Denver-Julesburg Basin. The measurements were carried out in July and August 2014 as part of NASA\u2019s DISCOVER-AQ field campaign. The PTR-QMS data were supported by pressurized whole air canister samples and airborne vertical and horizontal surveys of VOCs. Unexpectedly high benzene mixing ratios were observed at PAO at ground level (mean benzene = 0.53 ppbv, maximum benzene = 29.3 ppbv), primarily at night (mean nighttime benzene = 0.73 ppbv). These high benzene levels were associated with southwesterly winds. The airborne measurements indicate that benzene originated from within the WGF, and typical source signatures detected in the canister samples implicate emissions from O&NG activities rather than urban vehicular emissions as primary benzene source. This conclusion is backed by a regional toluene-to-benzene ratio analysis which associated southerly flow with vehicular emissions from the Denver area. Weak benzene-to-CO correlations confirmed that traffic emissions were not responsible for the observed high benzene levels. Previous measurements at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) and our data obtained at PAO allow us to locate the source of benzene enhancements between the two atmospheric observatories. Fugitive emissions of benzene from O&NG operations in the Platteville area are discussed as the most likely causes of enhanced benzene levels at PAO. A limited information source attribution with the PAO dataset was completed using the EPA\u2019s positive matrix factorization (PMF) source receptor model. Six VOCs from the PTR-QMS measurement were used along with CO and NO for a total of eight chemical species. Six sources were identified in the PMF analysis: a primarily CO source, an aged vehicle emissions source, a diesel/compressed natural gas emissions source, a fugitive emissions source, and two sources that have the characteristics of a mix of fresh vehicle emissions and condensate fugitive emissions. 70% of the benzene measured at PAO on the PTR-QMS is attributed to fugitive emissions, primarily located to the SW of PAO. Comparing the PMF source attribution to source calculations done with a source array configured from the literature returns a contradictory result, with the expected sources indicting that aged vehicle emissions are the primary benzene source. However, analysis of the contradictory result indicates that the toluene to benzene ratio measured for PAO is much lower than the literature values, suggesting that the O&NG source emissions have a lower ratio of toluene to benzene than anticipated based on studies of other regions. Finally, we propose and investigate an alternative form of the source receptor model using a constrained optimization. Poor results of the proposed method are described with tests on a synthetic testing dataset, and further testing with the observation data from PAO indicate that the proposed method is not able to converge the best global solution to the system.

Lygus feed by injecting salivary enzymes into plant tissue (reproductive structures and growing tips) through their piercing-sucking mouthparts, which eventually causes death and abscission of plant structures at the feeding site. Lygus are commonly controlled with pesticides, but are developing resistance to the most commonly used chemical controls. Novel controls, such as resistant cultivars, trap crops, and natural enemies, should be explored as sustainable alternatives to chemical spraying for Lygus. Here we examine basic aspects of plant defense (indirect and direct) against Lygus bugs in an economically relevant crop host (Medicago sativa) and a wild host plant (Melilotus officinalis), and examine chemically-mediated interactions between Lygus, an introduced parasitoid bio-control organism (Peristenus relictus) and a promising trap crop (Erigeron annuus) that could function as a component of sustainable control measures. Our results indicate that Lygus feeding induces volatiles and phytohormones characteristic of both pathogen and herbivore defense pathways, and that these aspects of the plant defense response vary by Lygus species and life stage, as well as among crop hosts. Our data are consistent with there being variation in the enzymes present in the saliva of different species/stages of Lygus, and further indicate that the plant-derived breakdown products of these enzymes may be capable of bypassing traditional herbivore defense pathways (e.g., JA induction) to directly elicit defense responses. We also found that E. annuus releases a complex blend rich in green leaf volatiles, terpenes, and other compounds, and that this blend is highly attractive to both female Lygus bugs as well as to female P. relictus parasitoids relative to VOCs being released from cotton plants. These results indicate that E. annuus has great potential for acting as a trap crop that can pull Lygus off of crop plants in addition to attracting and provisioning Lygus natural enemies (introduced Peristenus wasps).", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8104], "author_name_tesi": "Halloran, Sean Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Halloran", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Sean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "Shelby Jay Fleischer", "John Frazier Tooker", "David A Mortensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "Shelby Jay Fleischer, Committee Member", "John Frazier Tooker, Committee Member", "David A Mortensen, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lygus feeding", "plant-herbivore interactions", "chemical ecology", "herbivore induced volatiles", "trap crops"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Mechanical Response of Out-Of-Autoclave Complex Fiber Architecture Composites for Marine Structures", "id": "14482rth5095", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14482", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydrokinetic turbines have shown promise as a novel method for harvesting power from natural waterways. The customizability of these turbines allows for smaller turbine systems compared to large, geographically demanding hydroelectric plants. However, maintenance costs stemming from relatively short service lives of existing glass/epoxy turbine blades impede the growth of hydrokinetic power. In prototype blades, fatigue loading in salt water caused relatively rapid degradation and subsequent high maintenance costs. Thus, fatigue-resistant blades designed for multi-decade service life would lower the net cost of hydrokinetic turbine usage and increase the feasibility, and therefore growth, of hydrokinetic turbine usage. Furthermore, material systems chosen for hydrokinetic blade use must be studied in order to understand their behavior in long-term under-sea conditions.\nThis study researched the tensile-mechanical response of a quasi-isotropic woven and stitched laminate under quasi-static and fatigue loading at a stress ratio (R) of 0.1 and a frequency of 10 Hz. Some fatigue samples were fatigued until failure, while others underwent residual modulus and strength measurements. Both woven and stitched laminates were found to survive ten million cycles with a maximum stress of +13.75 ksi, but fail prior to ten-million cycles with a maximum stress of +18 ksi. In room-temperature ambient conditions, the polyester-stitched composite proved to have superior fatigue life only in long-life (>105 cycles) fatigue tests. Damaged, but not failed samples showed similar trends in that stitched samples would have more damage at lower cycle counts, but less damage at higher cycle counts compared to woven samples. However, there was more statistical scatter within the stitched specimens compared to woven specimens. Samples that were conditioned and tested while submerged in water had 30% reduction in tensile strength compared to the non-conditioned samples tested in ambient conditions. The partially saturated samples also showed damage accumulation and failure occurring nearly a decade earlier than the non-conditioned samples.\nThrough optical macroscopic and microscopic investigation, intralaminar cracks and delaminations were found to occur in damaged woven samples, while stitched samples showed higher densities of unconnected intralaminar cracks before failure. Delaminations were found in near-failure stitch-bonded samples, especially in those tested at higher maximum fatigue stresses. More intralaminar cracks were found within stitched specimens compared to woven specimens that had similar reductions in elastic modulus, although, stitched specimens showed greater strength retention compared to the woven specimens.

These technologies are essential components of next generation instruments that aim to achieve the RV precision necessary to detect low-mass planets. This instrumentation research is driven by the development of the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF), a near-infrared (NIR) Doppler spectrograph currently under development at Penn State that will detect terrestrial-mass planets orbiting nearby M-dwarfs. Furthermore, many technologies discussed will also be applied to the NASA-NSF Extreme Precision Doppler Spectrometer concept NEID, a Doppler RV instrument for the 3.5 meter WIYN telescope, slated for delivery in 2019. NEID is an ultra-stable, high resolution optical spectrometer also under development at Penn State.\n\nThis thesis describes new specialized optical fiber delivery systems, designed to significantly improve instrument illumination stability, modal noise suppression systems, which suppress mode interference in optical fibers and allow spectrometers to fully realize the exquisite precision of modern wavelength calibration sources, and new photonic calibration sources, which show significant promise as potential Doppler wavelength references. These technologies represent important steps in enabling next generation instruments to reach precisions sufficient to detect terrestrial-mass planets orbiting in the Habitable-zones of nearby stars. Improving measurement capabilities in both the optical and NIR is not only essential for enabling precision RV studies on a wide variety of stars, but can also aid in disentangling stellar activity signals from true reflex motion.

Current methods of modeling the flow field around these vehicles and their performance have proven to be lacking in regards to a design environment. High fidelity, unsteady solution methods are far too computationally and time expensive while simplified actuator disk models fail to incorporate the necessary physics of the shrouded rotor. To alleviate these problems, a computational method which couples a momentum source CFD code to a blade element theory rotor performance prediction code has been developed and validated. The coupled method was shown to have adequately resolved the dominate flow field phenomena in and around the ducts of the model, in particular the recirculatory, separation region over the front duct. Good agreement with experiment was found in the characteristics of both the inflow and outflow of the front fan in forward flight. The aerodynamic force predictions demonstrated the ability to adequately predict performance at low forward speeds and hover. At the highest advance ratio of 0.24, however, the prediction under-predicted lift by 30%.While, the coupled method was able to outperform the simplified momentum source approach and converge to a solution faster than a fully resolved rotor solution, improvements can be made. A more precise rotor model is required to improve the accuracy of the performance prediction.

Zeta-potential and viscosity titrations conclude that these polyelectrolyte complex coacervates are nearly charge-neutral, with similar stoichiometry regardless of the order of addition and that our coacervates carry a weak net negative charge. Swelling and rheological properties of the coacervates are studied at different salt concentrations in the surrounding solution. The enhanced swelling observed at high salt concentration suggests these coacervates behave like polyampholyte gels, with salt screening charge attractions. However, the stronger swelling at very low salt concentrations suggests the coacervates also act like polyelectrolyte gels, owing to their weak net charge. Linear viscoelastic oscillatory shear measurements indicate that the coacervates are viscoelastic liquids and that increasing ionic strength of the medium weakens the electrostatic interactions holding the polyelectrolyte network together, lowering the relaxation time and viscosity. We use the time-salt superposition idea recently proposed by Spruijt, et al. to access timescale ranges otherwise inaccessible, by constructing master curves for these soft materials. The effect of polyanion chain length is studied with similar swelling observed for all molecular weights, as functions of ionic strength. Linear viscoelastic measurements reveal that polyelectrolyte complexes constructed from higher molecular weight polyelectrolytes maintain constant crosslink density, but have more bridging between the polyelectrolytes, slowing their relaxation. This behavior can be described by a model, derived from the Yukawa potential for ion interactions that are screened by salt, imparting a salt concentration dependence to the relaxation times of the coacervate. Although swelling increases by a factor of 2.6 when salt concentration is changed from supernatant (cs = 0.09 M) to the highest salt concentration studied (cs = 1.3 M) our model ignores that concentration change and describes the relaxation time only in terms of ion interaction energetics. Fitting the model to the data suggests two results: 1) There are N = 5.5 associations that must be simultaneously broken for relaxation of chain segments; roughly corresponding to the number of positive or negative charges in one Kuhn monomer of each polyelectrolyte. 2) The degree of polymerization dependence of the relaxation time is n^1.9 which suggests the terminal relaxation of

flow stretch chains in a semicrystalline polymer melt, which results in an increase in the nuclei number density and a transformation of the crystal structure.\nThis flow-induced crystallization (FIC) phenomenon is explored in this study using highly isotactic polypropylene (iPP) samples.\nUsing one synthesized and five commercial linear isotactic polypropylene samples, we investigate the FIC behavior by imposing shear onto these samples in a rotational rheometer.\nEquipped with a good temperature control and flexible shear protocol, we apply different temperature and flow conditions.\nThe magnitude of the FIC effect varies with basic processing parameters (shear rate, specific work, crystallization temperature, and shearing temperature) and material properties (tacticity, molecular weight distribution, and particle concentration in the polymer).\nThe scope of this study is to systematically investigate the influences of these parameters on FIC.\n\nThe FIC effects that are investigated in this dissertation are: crystallization kinetics, persistence time of flow-induced nuclei, and crystal morphology.\nThe crystallization time was measured in the rheometer by monitoring the onset of crystallization after quenching samples sheared above Tm.\nThese samples were subsequently used to study their flow-induced nuclei persistence time and crystal morphology.\nThe lifetime of flow-induced nuclei was determined by measuring the time required to return from FIC back to quiescent crystallization using a differential scanning calorimeter.\nThe crystal morphology was imaged using polarized optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy.\n\nWe investigated the influence of specific work on the three FIC characteristics, and found three regimes that are separated by the critical work (Wc) and the saturation work (Wsat) thresholds.\nBelow the critical work threshold, the morphology is composed of mostly spherulite crystals, which keep a constant volume, and a small fraction of rice grain (anisotropic) crystals.\nThe number of rice grain crystals increases with specific work, speeding up the crystallization time of the semicrystalline polymer.\nAt critical work, spherulite formation stops, and the morphology consists only of rice grain structures.\nThis morphology allows the sample to crystallize at higher temperatures when cooling at 5 C/min, with the sheared sample crystallizing at 129C compared to the unsheared sample at 113C.\nIn addition, these rice grain structures can withstand significant annealing at elevated temperatures: for example, 2 days of annealing at 210C are required to fully erase these  metastable nuclei.\nFor Wc < W < Wsat, the rice grain number density increases with specific work, further strengthening the FIC effect.\nAt the saturation work threshold, the rice grain size, crystallization time, crystallization temperature when cooling at 5 C/min, and nuclei persistence time reach saturation and remain constant for all W > Wsat.\n\nSimilar to specific work, we find that the crystallization rate (i.e. nuclei number density) increases with shear rate up to a saturation shear rate of about 1 /s for most samples.\nAt this shear rate, only a very small minority of the longest chains (above 10^4 kg/mol) have Rouse times long enough to be stretched by the flow.\nFurther increases in shear rate above saturation shear rate have no effect on the crystallization rate.\n\nWe varied the crystallization temperature Tc after shearing, and found that the crystallization temperature increases the nuclei number density in the sample in the same way as it does during quiescent crystallization.\nRemarkably, the minimum crystallization time is essentially independent of undercooling, in the range of Tc we studied.\nThis strongly suggests that the maximum nuclei number density is driven by specific work, as flow likely causes a larger reduction in the nucleation barrier compared to undercooling.\nThe nuclei number density in the sample increases from ~10^16 m^(-3) to 10^18 m^(-3).\n\nShearing isotactic polypropylene at higher temperatures reduced the FIC effect after subsequent quenching.\nGenerally speaking, shearing at higher temperatures results in slower crystallization, but surprisingly, the influence of temperature is rather weak.\nFlow-induced crystallization persists even when shear is applied well above the equilibrium melting temperature (187C), finally weakening above the Hoffman-Weeks temperature (210C).\nThis is likely due to the long lifetime of flow-induced precursors (crystallize to form rice grains), which remain stable at temperatures below 210C and only start to disappear slowly in prolonged annealing at temperatures above 210C (diminishing the FIC effect).\n\nTacticity was found to govern the maximum nuclei number density in sheared samples; \nsamples with lower isotactic content show a stronger FIC effect.\nSimilarly, it was found that the concentration of particulates (mainly catalyst residue) are crucially important to FIC, samples with lower amounts of particles lowering the FIC nuclei number density.\n\nData shows that the rate at which the crystallization time changes correlates with the prominence of the high molecular weight tail.\nA sample with a higher molecular weight tail in its distribution exhibits a faster change in crystallization time as a function of specific work.\nSimilarly, increasing the molecular weight of the added component in a blend induces a larger change in the FIC behavior.", "semester_ssi":

challenging problem for years. Perpetrators have become skillful in masquerading their identity and launching various attacks on the Internet, some of which could be damaging and disruptive, such as Distributed denial-of-service(DDoS) attacks and Worm attacks. With the steady increase in the number of software vulnerabilities and the availability of sophisticated attack tools, it has become easy for \"hackers\" to gain/control access to many end-hosts all around the world, from\nwhich they wage all sort of attacks without getting caught. Moreover, the Internet routing infrastructure is stateless and based largely on destination addresses; there exists no official entity that police the Internet to ensure that the source IP address is correct. The potentiality of spoofing IP addresses has made communication running over stateless protocols (e.g., User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)) and many types of DDoS attacks untraceable.\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to explore the problem of attack attribution and to propose some plausible solutions that would render the Internet infrastructure more secure. We propose attack attribution solutions for both Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)attacks and Worm attacks. In the case of DDoS attacks, we propose a new deterministic packet marking scheme to trace back in realtime to the thousands of sources of DDoS attacks assuming that the attacking end-hosts use IP address spoofing. For Worm attacks, we propose the reconstruct the infection tree for TCP and UDP scanning worms from data gathered at network telescopes. Such information would also help in replaying the global spread of a worm and gather many forensics about the infected machines and the network they are attached to.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2425], "author_name_tesi": "Hamadeh, Ihab ", "last_name_ssi": "Hamadeh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ihab", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George Kesidis", "Chitaranjan Das", "John Metzner", "David Jonathan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George Kesidis, Committee Chair", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Member", "John Metzner, Committee Member", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["attribution", "packet marking", "ddos", "worm", "network security", "forensics"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "CONTINUOUS CO2 INJECTION DESIGN IN NATURALLY FRACTURED  RESERVOIRS USING NEURAL NETWORK BASED PROXY MODELS", "id": "dn39x152w", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12689", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "More than 60% of the original oil in place (OOIP) is left in the ground after the primary and secondary recovery processes. With the introduction of enhanced oil recovery (EOR), that number goes down to about 40% of the OOIP. Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection is one of the most effective EOR methods in naturally fractured reservoirs. The fracture network provides a faster means for fluid flow due to its high conductivity but it is also the cause of premature breakthrough of the injected fluids. However, if employed efficiently, fractures can help push the injected CO2 to the reservoir boundaries so that a large portion of the reservoir fluid interacts with the injected CO2. Zones swept by miscible CO2 reported the lowest residual oil saturation.\nContinuous CO2 injection is becoming more and more preferred to the popular cyclic pressure pulsing. Continuous CO2 injection has no down time and could potentially provide better CO2 interaction with the reservoir fluid which provides a higher recovery. \nIn this research, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to construct robust proxy models with highly predictive capabilities for naturally fractured reservoirs undergoing continuous CO2 injection. The main purpose of this research is to shed more light and understanding on continuous CO2 injection in naturally fractured reservoirs and provide a tool that empowers engineers to make decisions on the fly while evaluating uncertainty and mitigating risk rather than wait months or years to do so. \nIn light of the above, various ANN designs and configurations undergo development and evolution to ultimately be able to provide valuable insights regarding reservoir performance, history matching, and injection design for naturally fractured reservoirs undergoing CO2 injection. Initial ANN designs targeted specific reservoirs using specific fluid compositions from the literature. The designed ANNs were able to provide predictions with a low degree of error. ANN designs went over many complex adjustments, variations, and enhancements until final configurations were reached. The final ANN designs developed in this research surpass previously developed ANNs in similar projects with its capability to handle a huge range of reservoir properties, relative permeability, capillary pressure, and fluid compositions under uncertainty.\nThe reservoir simulation model used in this research is a two-well, two-layer, miscible compositional simulation model working in a dual-porosity system. Critical parameters affected the accuracy and predictability of the ANN designs and they were an essential part of the final ANN configurations. The parameters that a major effect on continuous CO2 injection are reservoir fluid composition, fracture permeability, well spacing, bottomhole flowing pressure (BHFP), thickness, and CO2 injection amount under miscible conditions had the highest impact on recovered oil.\nThe final ANN designs were encompassed inside a graphical user interface that equipped the ANN with uncertainty evaluation capabilities. The ease to use nature of the GUI allows anyone to use the developed ANNs in this research, as well as provide a simple intuitive interface to manipulate input data, run simultaneous sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. \nThe developed ANNs in this research bring us a step closer to achieving real-time simulation for naturally fractured reservoirs undergoing CO2 injection. The correlations embedded in the ANNs were able to overcome reservoir fluid, relative permeability, and capillary pressure limitations that existed in the previous ANN studies.

In order to understand the details of chemical and isotopic fractionation processes involving chemisorption and redox reactions, we have conducted laboratory experiments on reactions between SO2(g) and powdered activated carbon (AC; BET surface area = ~460 m2/g) at 200\u00b0 and 250 \u00b0C  in a specially constructed closed system. During each of the three series of experiments, which lasted for up to 480 hours, we monitored the changes with time in pSO2(g) due to adsorption/desorption of SO2(g) on/from the AC, and periodically sampled aliquots of SO2(g) for S isotopic analyses. The SO2-reacted AC was investigated for the chemical compositions using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), an elemental analyzer (EA), and sequential sulfur extraction by H2O, HCl, Cr-solution, and Kiba solution, and the different forms of S-bearing compounds were analyzed for 32S, 33S, and 34S abundance ratios. \nResults of experiments and analyses indicate that three kinds of S species were continuous incorporated in the AC during reaction with SO2(g) at 200-250 \u00b0C: (A) weakly adsorbed SO2 (i.e., SO2(w. ads)) which was in chemical equilibrium with SO2(g); (B) strongly adsorbed SO2 (i.e., SO2(w. ads)), which was degassed at 300-400 \u00b0C from the AC at the end of each series of adsorption/desorption experiments; and (C) non-degassable S compounds (i.e., S(NDG)). After reacting with a total of 10.97 mmoles of SO2(g), the AC obtained 0.31 mmoles of SO2(s. ads) and 1.20 mmoles of S(NDG). Approximately 60% of the S(NDG) occur as oxidized-S compounds (i.e., S-O-C compounds) that were extracted by water and recovered as BaSO3 (and/or BaSO4), ~20% as reduced-S compounds (i.e., S-C compounds) that were extracted by Cr-reducing solution, and the remaining ~20% as unidentified (but probably reduced) S-bearing) residual S-compounds that were extracted by Kiba solution. The sequence of reactions among these S-bearing clusters was estimated to be: SO2(g) &#8658; SO2(w. ads) &#8658; SO2(s. ads) &#8658; (S-O-C)AC &#8658; (S-C)AC, representing the trends of increasing S/O and S/C ratios of the AC caused by continuous oxidation of C to CO2. The bonding energy for the SO2(w. ads) was estimated to be ~17 kJ/mol. \nLarge kinetic isotope fractionations of sulfur isotopes occurred during the adsorption/reduction processes. Compared to the &#948;34S of co-existing SO2(g), the &#948;34S values of the oxidized S-bearing species increased to +4\u00b11\u2030 for SO2(w. ads), +7.3\u00b10.2\u2030 for SO2(s. ads) and +11.6\u00b10.2\u2030 for S-O-C species, but the reduced-S-C species (i.e., Cr-reducible S, and the residual S) are enriched in the lighter isotopes with the &#948; 34S values of -8.3\u00b10.2\u2030. The &#948;33S - &#948;34S relationships of the S species incorporated in the AC follow the normal (i.e., mass-dependent) isotopic fractionation, but their &#916;33S values are slightly positive (&#916;33S = 0 to +0.14\u2030). These small &#916;33S values are consistent with the prediction from the relatively large bonding energy for the SO2(w, ads). The preferential enrichments of heavier isotopes in the adsorbed S-O bearing species, and the preferential enrichments of lighter isotopes in the reduced S species during the reduction of oxidized-S species, agree with the theoretical predictions.\nBased on comparisons of our results with those of other experimental studies on TSR and the S isotopic characteristics of H2S (and other S-bearing compounds) in petroleum, natural gas, and some ore-forming solutions, we suggest the following: (1) The natural TSR probably occurred by solid C-bearing compounds (e.g., dead bodies of (micro)organisms and kerogen), rather than by gaseous, aqueous, or liquid C-bearing compounds. (2) The small isotopic fractionations between H2S and their source SO42- (i.e., &#916;34S = &#948;34SH2S \u2013 &#948;34SSO4 = -10 to 0\u2030) in petroleum and natural gas have been previously interpreted as a result of nearly-complete thermochemical reduction of SO42- in closed systems. However, the results of this study suggest that the small fractionations are the results of TSR involving solid C-bearing compounds.\nThe results of our study also suggest that the large AIF-S signatures (&#916;33S = -1.37 to +1.84\u2030) observed for SO42- in some air pollutants (Ding et al., 2006) were probably created by chemisorption isotope effects between coal and the SO2 generated by the burning of pyrite-rich coal. Because the adsorption energy for the surface S-O compounds varies depending on the physical and chemical properties of solid C-bearing compounds, as well as the S-O speciation, some kerogen in Archean sediments, at a particular maturation stage, may have had small adsorption energy to produce AIF-S signatures during TSR.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2381], "author_name_tesi": "Hamasaki, Hiroshi ", "last_name_ssi": "Hamasaki", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hiroshi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hiroshi Ohmoto", "Hiroshi Ohmoto", "Dr Yumiko Watanabe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hiroshi Ohmoto, Thesis Advisor", "Hiroshi Ohmoto, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Yumiko Watanabe, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sulfur isotopes", "adsorption", "activated carbon", "sulfur dioxide"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Evolution of Schoenberg's Klangfarbenmelodie: The Importance of Timbre in Modern Music ", "id": "16221", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8199", "abstract_tesi": "Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg is viewed today as one of the most influential and controversial figures of the twentieth-century musical landscape.

When a dCTP:rCTP competition reaction was performed with Y271G, the variant demonstrated a complete loss of discrimination between dCTP and rCTP, relative to WT. This strongly suggests that loss of electronegativity at 271 results in lower dNTP discrimination (Y271L), but the additional loss of size (Y271G) completely eliminates discrimination of sugar-modified dNTPs. Other family X polymerases, pol ? and ?, have a highly conserved glycine at a position homologous to pol ? 271. \n\tResidue Arg-253 lies at the junction of the 240-253-loop region of the palm sub-domain of pol ?. R253M is known to confer an AZT-resistant in vivo phenotype, and we confirmed this in vitro by steady-state kinetic analysis. To determine the function of position 253 in dNTP discrimination, we constructed and purified recombinant R253G, R253C and R253K. Pol ? variant R253G showed extremely low catalytic activity, implying that size plays an important role in stabilizing the junction of the loop. Variants R253M, R253C and R253K were 5-, 50 and 100-fold less catalytically active, respectively, with natural dCTP, relative to WT. The discrimination at the level of Km for rCTP incorporation by R253M and R253C were 2 to 3-fold higher than to WT, while that of R253K was 3- fold lower. Based on these results and computer modeling, we propose that the level of rigidity within the junction of the loop may be critical for incoming nucleotide discrimination by DNA pol ?. In addition, loop variants E249K and P242R were also examined. P242R is the only naturally occurring, coding region pol ? polymorphism identified to date in human populations. This is the first characterization of this variant to the best of our knowledge. We determined that Arg-242 behaves similarly to WT when discriminating AraCTP and 2\u2019FdCTP, implying that the flexible arginine side-chain may be held in a rigid conformation, mimicking the proline imine ring, in position 242. The mutation specificity for P242R was also identical to WT. Therefore, we hypothesize that patients with this polymorphism may not have any unusual phenotypes when treated with sugar-modified nucleotide analogues. We also established that the pol ? residues Arg-253 and Glu-249 are involved in base-modified nucleotide discrimination, implying that regions far from the active site may play a role in modified nucleotide incorporation within the DNA.\n\tWe conclude that pol ? active site position 271 has an electrostatic and steric mechanism for discriminating sugar-modified nucleotide analogues such as AraC and Gemcitabine. In addition, position 253 at the junction of the loop region may function as a structural \u2018gate\u2019 for incoming nucleotides. The higher the rigidity of this junction (due to a combination of hydrogen bonds and sulfide bridges), the better the polymerase becomes at discriminating modified nucleotides.

In 2013, the incidence of NEC in the NICU at Penn State Hershey Medical Center was 18%. NEC is characterized by inflammatory damage to the intestinal tissues. The mortality of NEC is estimated to be between 15-20 % of infants diagnosed with the disease. Additionally, the majority of NEC survivors suffer from long-term complications, such as short bowel syndrome and neurodevelopmental delay. Combinations of different diagnostic tests are used to identify NEC; however, these tests are ordered when NEC is already clinically significant. Nearly 2/3 of infants diagnosed with NEC will need surgical interventions including laparatomy, bowel resection and ostomy establishment. These interventions have their own specific complications such as short bowel syndrome and long-term use of total parenteral nutrition. This represents a huge financial burden on the health care system. Given the acute onset and rapid progression of NEC, a non-invasive predictive method to identify risk factors that predispose premature infants to NEC will facilitate the development of interventions prior to the presentation of disease. Such a predictive method will be critical in reducing morbidity and mortality.   \n      Recently, Paneth cell (PC) dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of NEC. PCs are highly specialized and granulated secretory cells, which reside at the base of the small intestinal crypts. PC granules contain antimicrobial agents, which are critical for microbial defense, and provide a host-friendly environment in the small intestine. PC granules also contain a large amount of zinc (Zn). Granular Zn prevents degradation of antimicrobial proteins such as \u03b1-defensins and stabilizes lysozyme in its monomeric, active conformation promoting appropriate microbial defense. More than 30 years ago Santulli et al. discovered the relationship between intestinal bacterial communities and NEC. Pneumatosis intestinalis, a radiographic finding in many cases of NEC, is the result of intestinal microbial dysbiosis, illustrating the role of the microbial community in NEC pathogenesis. Additionally, the presence of specific bacteria such as Klebsiella seems to be elevated in the bowel before NEC development. \nOur unpublished data indicate that the Zn transporter ZnT2 (SLC30A2), may be critical to Zn accumulation in PC granules and important for optimal PC function, as ZnT2 knock-out mice have defects in PC granule Zn accumulation, secretion and antimicrobial activity. We recently identified genetic variants in ZnT2, resulting in loss of function [2] and thus, these individuals may be at increased risk for enteric infections and inflammatory diseases that require coordinated secretion of PC granules (Podany et al, Submitted manuscript). Many of these variants occur in exons 2, 3 and 7, and affect ZnT2 function and Zn secretion.  In addition, numerous variants (A28D, K66N, Q71H, D103E, A105P, Q137H, T288S and T312K) display changes in the management sub-cellular Zn pools and Zn secretion causing \u201closs of function\u201d and \u201cgain of function\u201d in cultured cells. Interestingly, 2 variants (D103E and T288S) were found in ~12% of the study population and had a strong impact on mammary cell function suggesting that these defects are profound enough to influence the function of a secretory cell.\nThe objectives of this study were to determine if 1) variants in ZnT2 in premature infants are associated with alterations in gut microflora; and 2) if there is an association between variants of ZnT2 and the risk for NEC in premature infants. Our central hypothesis is that variants which result in the loss of ZnT2 function are associated with altered gut microbiota and NEC pathogenesis.  In order to test this hypothesis, 51 preterm infants between the gestational ages of 26-36 weeks were recruited from the NICU at Penn State Hershey Medical Center within 48 hours after birth.   DNA was collected by sterile buccal swab and the coding exons of SLC30A2 were sequenced.  In addition, stool was collected with a sterile applicator two weeks after feeding was initiated.  Fecal microflora was analyzed by 16S DNA sequencing.  Data on feeding, birth weight, growth, race, ethnicity, gestational age, use of antibiotics, length of stay, mode of delivery, NEC diagnosis and gender were collected. \nResults indicated that there is an association between variants of ZnT2 and intestinal bacterial colonization in preterm infants. The relative abundance of Enterobactericeae is increased in infants with C-terminal and/or multiple variations of ZnT2. However, only one case of NEC was identified in our study. Overall, our study suggests that variants in ZnT2 create a less diverse microbial environment which may lead to short- or long-term health consequences. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11246], "author_name_tesi": "Hamidi, Maryam ", "last_name_ssi": "Hamidi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Maryam", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shannon Leanne Kelleher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Maryam", "Final", "Thesis", "NEC", "project"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Maximizing the on-farm benefits of cover crops: Comparing management intentions and ecosystem service provisioning ", "id": "28685", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12111", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cover crops are gaining in popularity due to efforts from both conservation organizations and \nfarmers for the multiple ecosystem services they can improve.

Many organizations aspire to achieve sustained innovation, but find it difficult to accomplish. I employ both qualitative and social network methods to develop two empirically-grounded theory models. The first model describes how key constituent elements including identity dynamics and fluid organizing facilitate sustained innovation and shows how an organization might reconcile the dilemma of simultaneous flexibility and stability in pursuit of innovation. Prior research shows that organizational identity can foster innovation-inhibiting rigidities. In contrast, I found that interplay between organizational identity and members\u2019 professional identities facilitated fluidity and innovation by providing a dynamically stable cognitive scaffold that guided the co-evolution of structures and resources. The resulting fluid organizing process was crucial to sustained innovation. \n\nThe second grounded theory model explores processes involved in professional identity development among scientists in a multidisciplinary context. I consider the influence of social network relationships and the identity work processes invoked by scientists to manage relational plurality and the development of their professional identities. I document several tensions associated with developing professional identity, as well as three primary identity work tactics used to balance these prevalent tensions. My social network analysis reveals strong relational plurality dimensions which provide diverse resources for identity work. In this study I extend theory concerning professional identity development and demonstrate the importance of social networks to identity work. By connecting the (external) relational aspect of early career professional identity work to the (internal) intrapersonal aspects, I bring together the literatures on professional identity, identity work, and social network analysis and answer calls for greater exploration of the relationships among these concepts. In addition, this exploration of professional identity work demonstrates the import of individual professional identity development to organizational innovation, especially in science-driven fields. Finally, insights from this study into professional identity work in a multidisciplinary context may inform our understanding of the microfoundations of the process of professionalization and the formation of new professions.

However, the spatial distribution of information exchange loss across the entire brain remains elusive. In this thesis resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data was acquired in rats during wakefulness and graded depths of anesthesia induced by incrementally increasing the concentration of isoflurane. We found that, regardless of spatial scale, the absolute functional connectivity (FC) change was significantly dependent on the FC strength at the awake state across all connections. This dependency became stronger at higher doses of isoflurane. In addition, the relative FC change (i.e. the FC change normalized to the corresponding FC strength at the awake state) exhibited a spatially homogenous reduction across the whole brain particularly after animals lost consciousness, indicating a globally uniform disruption of meaningful information exchange. To further support this notion, we showed that during unconsciousness, the entropy of rsfMRI signal increased to a value comparable to random noise while the mutual information decreased appreciably. Importantly, consistent results were obtained when unconsciousness was induced by dexmedetomidine, an anesthetic agent with a distinct molecular action than isoflurane. These findings provide compelling neuroimaging evidence suggesting that the brain undergoes a widespread, uniform disruption in the exchange of meaningful information during AIU, and that this change may represent a common systems-level neural mechanism of AIU.

MCS in this region are known to be associated with African\nEasterly Waves (AEWs). The topography of eastern Africa, namely the Ethiopian\nHighlands and Darfur Mountains have been shown to play an intricate role in\nthe genesis of these waves through MCS initiation in that region. We investigate\nthe topographic influence on the formation of these systems using the Weather\nResearch and Forecasting model by recreating the atmospheric state over an eight\nday period for three cases with varying topography: realistic, half-height, and no\ntopography.

This research suggests that teacher accuracy in instructional decision making in large groups may be enhanced by using color coded response cards rather than white response cards.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1497], "author_name_tesi": "Hamlin, Dawn Winn", "last_name_ssi": "Hamlin", "middle_name_ssi": "Winn", "first_name_ssi": "Dawn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Special Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathy L Ruhl", "David Lee", "Charles A Hughes", "Dr Susan Faircloth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathy L Ruhl, Committee Chair", "David Lee, Committee Chair", "Charles A Hughes, Committee Member", "Dr Susan Faircloth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["signal detection theory", "response cards", "unison responding"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION FOR FINITE MIXTURE MODELS USING AN EXPONENTIAL TILT", "id": "11095", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6130", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The main purpose of this thesis is to introduce methodology to fit finite mixture models.  We propose a method where the component distributions are fitted using an exponential tilt model, in which the log ratio of the density functions of the components is modeled as a quadratic function of the observations. This approach has two key advantages.  First, except for the exponential tilt assumption, the marginal distributions of the observations can be completely arbitrary. Second, we have the advantage of having a likelihood.  In the multivariate case, a model selection method is introduced for identifying the number of component distributions in the mixture model when theory does not suggest it.  In addition, a likelihood ratio test, using the profile likelihood, is used to choose between a model that assumes the coordinates are conditionally independent and one that has blocks of conditionally i.i.d. coordinates.

The etiology of MS is unknown. However, epidemiological evidence suggests a combination of environmental and genetic factors.  No cure exists for MS.  Current FDA-approved therapies target limited aspects of the disease, are expensive, and have undesirable side-effects.  Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the most widely used animal model for MS.  EAE is a CD4+ T cell disease that can be induced in mice through immunization with a myelin antigen, such as proteolipid protein (PLP139-151) in EAE susceptible mice like the SJL/J-strain.  Modulation of the opioid growth factor (OGF)-opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) axis, by administration of OGF or low dose naltrexone (LDN), in both chronic and/or chronic established EAE diminishes disease severity and reduces the histopathological damage associated with the disease.  This holds promise for those patients who experience the progressive form of the disease; however, 85 percent of MS patients experience the relapse-remitting disease course.  It is unknown whether OGF and/or LDN will be an effective treatment option for RR-MS patients.  \nThe central hypothesis is that modulation of the OGF-OGFr axis alters the course of relapse-remitting EAE (RR-EAE).  The objectives of this research were to establish a working model of RR-EAE utilizing immunization of the SJL/J mouse with PLP139-151 and to assess the safety and efficacy of LDN or OGF when treatment is initiated at the time of induction or at the time of established clinical disease.  Behavior and morphology of glia, macrophages, and neurons were evaluated, as well as the effects of treatment regiments on CD4+ T lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS.\nThe first study established an animal model for relapse-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by immunization of SJL/J mice with PLP139-151. Treatment with OGF or saline was initiated simultaneously with immunization, and within 9 days, behavioral signs of RR-EAE were observed.  OGF-treated RR-EAE animals had less severe clinical disease than mice receiving saline and exhibited 66% reductions in median cumulative disease scores, as well as prolonged periods of remission and diminished number and length of disease relapses.  Neuropathological examination of lumbar spinal cord revealed reduced numbers of Iba-1 and CD3+ reactive cells, suggesting that OGF inhibited proliferation of microglia/macrophages and T lymphocytes, as well as decreasing the number of proliferating activated astrocytes (Ki67 and GFAP staining).  Areas of demyelination and neuronal damage were markedly reduced after the 55-day observation period. \nThe second study examined the therapeutic efficacy of OGF in an established RR-EAE model.  Two days following establishment of clinical disease, treatment with OGF or saline was initiated, and mice were observed on a daily basis.  OGF treated mice had markedly reduced clinical signs of disease over the course of 40 days.  OGF treatment increased the incidence and lengthened the time of remissions relative to saline-treated mice with RR-EAE.  OGF therapy also reduced relapses, and facilitated extended periods of mild disease.  Neuropathological examination of lumbar spinal cord after 40 days of treatment revealed decreased numbers of Iba-1 and CD3+ reactive cells, suggesting that OGF inhibited proliferation of microglia/macrophages and T lymphocytes, as well as decreasing the number of proliferating activated astrocytes (Ki67 and GFAP dual labeled sections).  Peptide treatment for 40 days diminished levels of demyelination in comparison to saline-treated mice with RR-EAE.\nThe third study examined modulation of the OGF\u2013 OGFr axis by low dose naltrexone (LDN) as a disease modifying therapy for established RR-EAE.  After two days of clinical disease, mice received LDN or saline for 40 days.  Mice were euthanized at study endpoints and spinal cords collected for neuropathological evaluation of glia, T lymphocyte infiltration, and demyelination. LDN treatment significantly reduced behavior scores across the 40 day observation period.  The number of remissions was increased in LDN-treated groups relative to controls.  A bimodal distribution of behavioral responses to LDN distinguished \u201cresponders\u201d from mice considered \u201cnon-responders\u201d that showed behavioral characteristics similar to saline-treated animals.  More than 60% of the mice responding to LDN displayed several days of remission.  LDN-treated mice also had reduced areas of demyelination and decreased numbers of macrophages/microglia and activated astrocytes, as well as reductions in spinal cord demyelination, relative to saline-treated controls.  \nThe fourth study examined whether OGF or LDN alter Th effector responses of CD4+ T lymphocytes within the CNS in established EAE.  SJL/J mice were immunized with PLP139-151 and treated with OGF, LDN or saline after the second consecutive day of clinical disease.  After five treatment days, EAE mice were euthanized and brains and spinal cords collected for intracellular staining.  Mononuclear cells were stained were surface stained with anti-CD4, followed by intracellular and transcription factor staining with antibodies for IFN\u03b3, IL-17, IL-4 and Foxp3 in order to assess the presence of CD4+ Th1, Th17, Th2, and Treg effector cells in the CNS.  Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that OGF and not LDN decreased CD4+ T lymphocytes present in the CNS of SJL/J mice with EAE at peak disease.  However, modulation of the OGF-OGFr axis did not result in changes to CD4+ Th effector cell responses.\nIn conclusion, the data from these studies demonstrate an active role for endogenous opioids in autoimmune diseases such as MS and EAE.  Furthermore, these results support previous research indicating that modulation of the OGF-OGFr axis, through either exogenous OGF or intermittent blockade with LDN, can be safe and effective treatment options for EAE and MS.  Of particular interest were the opposing effects of OGF and LDN on CD4\u00ac+ T lymphocytes present in the CNS of established EAE mice, and the lack of effect on different effector cell subpopulations.  These results add to the knowledge previously elucidated from studies using the chronic-EAE model, and have opened the door to ongoing research to discern the mechanisms behind OGF and LDN in animal models of EAE, and ultimately the pursuit of clinical trials on OGF and/or LDN for treating MS. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10878], "author_name_tesi": "Hammer, Leslie Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Hammer", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Leslie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia J Mc Laughlin", "Patricia J Mc Laughlin", "Ian Stuart Zagon", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang", "Hanspeter Waldner", "Timothy Cooper"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia J Mc Laughlin, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia J Mc Laughlin, Committee Chair", "Ian Stuart Zagon, Committee Member", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang, Committee Member", "Hanspeter Waldner, Committee Member", "Timothy Cooper, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Met-enkephalin", "multiple sclerosis", "relapse remitting EAE", "opioid peptides", "OGF", "OGFr"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Mississippian Construction, Labor, and Social Organization in Western Kentucky", "id": "6668", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5904", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the evidence for status differentiation between residents of the Annis Village, a single mound Mississippian site along the banks of the Green River in Butler County, Kentucky.  Excavations conducted by the Works Progress Administration (1939-1940) and Penn State (2002-2004) exposed over 7,000 m2 of the community, including the entire platform mound.  A total of 34 structures, three palisades, and numerous other features were excavated, and over 20,000 artifacts were found.  \nStatus differences are normally measured using elaborate burials, fancy artifacts, and monumental architecture.  However, most of these studies have focused on larger Mississippian sites that make up a proportionally low number of sites.  Smaller mound sites, such as Annis, are much more numerous and have great potential to contribute to a more full understanding of Mississippian sociopolitical complexity.  \n\nAt Annis, comparison of mound (elite) and village (non-elite) materials do not reveal significant differences, leaving labor investment in monumental architecture as one of the few distinctions available.  Using ethnographic and experimental data, I calculate the labor required to construct each stage of the platform mound, the structures on its summit, and the associated palisades, as well as the number of workers that would have been necessary to complete each task.\n\nThe results indicate that labor investment, while crucially important to Mississippian societies, was not overly taxing on the local population and could have been accomplished easily by a relatively small number of people in a reasonably short period of time.  Based on the lack of exotic items, I argue that the residents of Annis and other sites in the vicinity did not participate in a prestige-goods economy.

Text messaging may provide a method for continuing smoking cessation support and monitoring smoking status post-discharge.\nMethods: This is a randomized controlled trial of automated smoking cessation support on discharge as an adjunct to brief advice among hospital inpatients. Participants were inpatients who self-identified as tobacco users at the time of admission. Those who accepted cessation counseling as part of usual care were screened for study inclusion. Eligible participants smoked > 20 cigarettes in the 30 days prior to admission, were willing to give up all forms of tobacco, had a cell phone with them capable of receiving text messages, and were willing to send/receive text messages. Participants were randomized to receive weekly smoking status questions (control) or weekly smoking status questions plus daily smoking cessation tips (intervention). Text messages began the day the participant was discharged from the hospital and continued until phone call follow-up at one month post-discharge. Quit status was based on self-report seven-day point prevalence abstinence.\nResults: 140 participants, 70 receiving the intervention and 70 controls, were included in this analysis.

Employing a combination of semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and archival research, this work investigates the physical and symbolic constructions of the park, arguing that they have changed in line with larger neighborhood processes. Known at one point as NAYA Park, the space has been a site of contestation since around 2005, when those originally responsible for its construction were priced out of the neighborhood. Subjected to increased development pressures in an ascendant neighborhood, the park has continued to be used as a public amenity by some in the neighborhood, while at the same time remaining private land. Moving from hazard to amenity to contested space as the neighborhood moved from blight to redevelopment, spaces such as NAYA Park exist at an important intersection, providing much of the aforementioned benefits of a public park, while simultaneously being left to the whims of the private real estate market. Despite political ecology\u2019s traditional emphasis on environmental activism and site-level resource conflict, contestations over vacant lots, green space, and other forms of open space in the city remain under examined in the field. Case studies tend to either treat the city itself as the unit of analysis or predominantly deal with formalized forms of urban nature. Failing to see vacant lots and other undeveloped spaces as crucial spaces of urban nature not only misses much of the story of how both nature and capital is manifest and intersects in the city, but simultaneously glosses over the agency of local actors in shaping their communities.

They had varying degrees of experience of downshifting, came from and went to a multitude of different careers, and lived across the United States. They were asked questions about what leisure meant to them, and how leisure had transformed since their career change. These interviews were recorded, transcribed and read multiple times, to identify common patterns and themes and to develop answers to the research questions.\nThe results affirmed that leisure is a subjective word that contains numerous meanings for different people. There is considerable overlap between the general meanings of leisure that evolved from this set of participants and leisure meanings that have been described by leisure researchers previously, out of a downshifting context. A variety of transformations in leisure associated with downshifting emerged. Overall downshifting was instrumental in stimulating a whole spectrum of changes in the value of leisure. The data collected for this study suggests that downshifters partially regain the essence of leisure, according to the criteria set out by Juniu (2000). Discussion of pre and post-downshift leisure experiences confirmed Linder\u2019s (1970) theory that harried leisure detracts satisfaction from the overall experience of leisure.\nContinued research investigating transformations in leisure, work/leisure values, and lifestyles associated with downshifting is recommended.

However, the weather dependent reliability of wireless optical links makes it necessary to develop system architectures capable of providing reliable communications in various channel conditions. It has been shown that through diversity, performance of communication systems can be greatly improved. Third generation networks will be exploiting multi-rate diversity to enhance the provided quality of service. \nIn this dissertation, we investigate cloud obscured wireless optical links, and examine system performance enhancement through such channels using multi-rate communications, and provide two system architectures that provide multi-rate communications for wireless optical systems.\nChannel models for cloud obscured wireless optical links through Monte Carlo Ray Tracing simulations based on Mie Scattering formulation are developed. Based on the simulation results, empirical formulas for temporal channel models are obtained; which in conjunction with statistical cloud coverage data, show that considerable bandwidth is available; with an average of 32.5 GHz, 160 and 240 GHz in the low, medium and high altitude clouds, respectively.\nUsing the developed channel models, performance of fractal modulation in cloud obscured channels is investigated. It is shown that fractal systems provide higher reliability that conventional single rate square root raised cosine (SRRC) systems, achieving bit error rates as low as 10-9 in 1 Km length channels, with optical thicknesses as high 7.0.\nOptical pulse shaping is also investigated, where an optical pulse shaping technique that can provide arbitrary waveform generation is proposed, capable of eliminating space-time coupling without resorting to the conventionally used spatial filtering.\nThe results of the optical pulse shaping technique are used in developing all optical transmitter and receiver architectures, capable of multi-rate multi-wavelength communications. It is shown that the performance of short-pulsed multi-rate multi-carrier communications substantially out performs conventional fractal modulation techniques, achieving bit error rates as low as 10-9 1 Km length channels with optical thicknesses as high 10.0 for systems using SRRC pulse shaping, and optical thicknesses as high 18.0 for systems using Meyer wavelet pulse shaping.\nThese results combined, show that huge communication speeds at low bit error rates are possible through cloud-obscured channels. Multi-rate communications provide a simplified system architecture that is capable of providing reliable communications in adverse channel conditions. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [874], "author_name_tesi": "Hamzeh, Belal Yousef", "last_name_ssi": "Hamzeh", "middle_name_ssi": "Yousef", "first_name_ssi": "Belal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nadine Smith", "Shizhuo Yin", "Ruyan Guo", "Mohsen Kavehrad", "William Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nadine Smith, Committee Member", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "Ruyan Guo, Committee Member", "Mohsen Kavehrad, Committee Chair", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wireless Optics", "Free Space Optics", "Multi Rate Communications", "Cloud Modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "A BAYESIAN APPROACH TO FALSE DISCOVERY RATE FOR LARGE SCALE SIMULTANEOUS INFERENCE\n", "id": "7702", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "803", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microarray data and other applications have inspired many recent developments in the area of large scale simultaneous inference.

The traditional family-wise type I error rate(FWER), which is defined as the probability of at most one occurrence of type I error in all the tests, is over-stringent in this context due to the large scale of simultaneity. More recently, false discovery rate (FDR), was defined as the expected proportion of type I errors among the rejections. Controlling the less stringent FDR criterion has less loss in detection capability than controlling the FWER and hence is preferable for large scale multiple tests. From the Bayesian point of view, the posterior version of FDR and of false nondiscovery rate (FNR) is easier to study. We study Bayesian decision rules to control Bayes FDR and FNR. A hierarchical mixture model is developed to estimate the posterior probability of hypotheses.

Erythropoiesis, differentiation of multiprogenitor cells to red blood cells, serves as an excellent system to study the process to cellular differentiation, which requires precise and intricate transcriptional regulation. GATA1 and TAL1 are two key erythroid transcription factors (TFs) that form a multicomponent complex to regulate this process.

Here we applied high resolution ChIP-exo to GATA1 and TAL1 to study their positional organization and determinants of their binding during GATA1-dependent development in mouse. Two complementary methods, MultiGPS and peak pairing, were implemented to determine confident binding locations. While ChIP-exo and ChIP-seq showed substantial overlap in their binding locations, high resolution of binding reveals the homotypic clusters of GATA1 and TAL1 binding locations and the precise positional organization within the protein complex, which cannot be detected using ChIP-seq.

This thesis\nis focused on the selection of energy group structures for the reactor analysis of the\nPebble Bed Modular Reactor. \n\nEnergy group structure is simply defined as the discretization of energy into groups by the selection of energy boundaries.  Traditional reactor analysis requires a two-step process. The first step utilizes a cross section generation code which takes the material composition and geometry of a particular region and its given conditions, to produce cross sections. This part is sometimes referred to as the cell calculation. The second part of the process is the reactor level calculation and utilizes the computed cross sections from the first step to calculate overall reactor properties. \n\nIn this study, COMBINE6 was used for the cross section generation code and the Penn State nodal diffusion code NEM was used for the reactor analysis code. To arrive at an optimal group structure, many series of combinations of group structures were tested. Each set of results computed from the two-step process were compared with solution of a method independent of energy discretization, MCNP5, which is a Monte Carlo continuous energy code. MCNP5 is used as a reference because it generates a neutron transport solution using continuous energy cross sections and thus is a better representation of the physical system.

Hydraulic fracturing is the most effective technique of well stimulation in low-permeability reservoirs. The concept of hydraulic fracturing is to change the reservoir flow pattern by creating long and highly conductive flow paths within the reservoir. With a successful hydraulic fracture treatment, reservoir fluids can flow through the highly conductive proppant pack into the wellbore, rather than flowing through the low permeable reservoir rock. In addition, the flow can bypass the near-well damage zone. However, in some cases, the stimulation effectiveness is limited due to fracture damages. Weak proppant pack may deform or even crush under in-situ stress, resulting in decreased fracture conductivity. Only 30% of propped fracture length could be considered as effective length due to gel residue, even as low as 5%. Thus comprehensive studies of identifying and quantifying fracture damages are necessary.\nIn this research, we will propose both simple applicable analytical methods and complex numerical methods in identifying fracture damages.

A number of investigators have shown that iron and iron-related proteins (ferritin, transferrin, and transferrin receptor) are not uniformly distributed in the brain.  As shown in various research models, iron deficiency changes the distribution of various iron-related proteins to different extents.  While the iron-related protein responses to iron deficiency have been described, the mRNA expression of these proteins in the brain has not been determined.  The present studies were conducted to investigate the mRNA expression of iron-related proteins in the rodent brain and to elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying iron mobilization by these proteins during iron deficiency.  The overall hypothesis is that iron deficiency induces changes in brain iron, iron-related proteins and their mRNA and that these changes are heterogeneously distributed across brain regions.  These responses describe the adaptive mechanisms in place in the brain when experiencing dietary iron deprivation.\n     Twenty-one day old male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either an iron-deficient (3.5 mg Fe/kg diet) or a control diet (35 mg Fe/kg diet) for six weeks.  At the time of killing, iron status was verified.  Ferritin, transferrin, and transferrin receptor proteins were determined by ELISA, and the mRNA content and distribution were determined by Northern blot, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization.  Regression analysis was used to study the relationships among iron, iron-related proteins and their mRNA content in the brain.  ANOVA was used to determine significant differences in brain regional mRNA contents, iron protein contents, and iron contents between control and iron-deficient groups.\n    The first objective was to test the hypothesis that dietary iron deficiency affects the mRNA content of H and L ferritin in rat brain regions (i.e., hippocampus, substantia nigra, striatum, pons, cerebellum, cortex, and thalamus) which subsequently affects the content of H and L ferritin subunit proteins.  Results showed that the H to L ferritin mRNA ratio was 6:1.  The ratio was not affected by dietary iron deficiency in contrast to a different effect of iron deficiency on liver ferritin mRNA.  Iron deficiency changed neither the mRNA location nor the mRNA content of H and L ferritin in brain regions.  Iron deficiency reduced brain H ferritin protein concentration significantly in all regions, whereas it only reduced L ferritin concentration in striatum, substantia nigra, and pons.  The fact that iron deficiency had no effect on H and L ferritin mRNA content in contrast to the effect on the protein content indicates the predominance of post-transcriptional regulation of ferritin production in brain.  Importantly, the regional variation in  ferritin gene expression at the transcriptional level was not strongly dependent on local regional iron status, which suggests other roles for ferritin in brain biology.  \nThe second objective of this research was to test the hypothesis that iron deficiency affects transferrin, transferrin receptor protein, and their mRNA contents in rat brain regions.  The iron-deficient diet significantly decreased brain iron concentration (22% - 63%) and increased transferrin concentration (22% to 130%) in a regional specific fashion.  Iron-deficient rats exhibited significantly increased transferrin receptor levels in thalamus (74%) and cortex (40%).  In situ hybridization studies showed that transferrin and transferrin receptor mRNAs had complementary distributions in the brain.  Transferrin mRNA was most pronounced in corpus callosum, pons, gray matter of the cerebellum, lateral ventricles, caudate putamen, and thalamus.  In contrast, transferrin receptor mRNA was lowest in these regions and highest in cortex, hippocampus, and the white matter of the cerebellum.  Transferrin mRNA content decreased from 20% to 50% in all brain regions except cerebellum, while regional transferrin receptor mRNA content did not change in all regions except striatum in iron deficiency.  Regression analysis showed a lack of correlation between transferrin protein content and its mRNA content (r= 0.6, p<0.05), indicating that transferrin protein in some brain regions must be derived from other sources.  The opposite effect of iron deficiency on brain and liver transferrin mRNA expression suggests that liver could be the source of transferrin protein in the brain during iron deficiency.  This study suggests that transferrin and transferrin receptor respond to iron deficiency in a coordinated fashion, and one could imply that transferrin and transferrin receptor-mediated movement of iron in the brain is regulated by dietary iron status and transferrin uptake from the plasma. \nThe third objective was to test the hypothesis that iron-related proteins and their mRNA are expressed in the same type of cells in both control and iron-deficient rat brains.  The cellular distribution of iron, H and L ferritin, transferring, and transferrin receptor protein was determined by peroxidase anti-peroxidase immunohistochemistry.  The H ferritin protein was found in neurons and oligodendrocytes, while the mRNA was found in neurons, ependymal cells in the ventricle area, and epithelial cells in the choroid plexus.  The H ferritin protein in the oligodendrocytes may be related to iron transport in this type of cells.  The L ferritin protein and iron were found in the same types of cells, indicating an important role of L ferritin in long-term iron storage.  Iron deficiency did not change the types of cells containing H and L ferritin.  Transferrin protein was found in oligodendrocytes, epithelial cells in choroid plexus, and neurons, while its mRNA was found in oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells in ventricles, and epithelial cells in choroid plexus.  The data indicate that transferrin protein found in neurons may be translocated from other cells such as epithelial cells or ependymal cells which contain transferrin mRNA.  Iron deficiency did not change the cell types containing transferrin and transferrin receptor at either protein or mRNA level.\nIn summary, the results of these studies contribute the following findings to current understanding of brain iron metabolism.  1) The dynamics of the regulation of L ferritin and transferrin message differs greatly between the brain and liver.  2) The brain adapts to iron deficiency by increasing transferrin protein uptake from the plasma in contrast to increased de novo synthesis.  3) Ependymal cells in the ventricles and epithelial cells in the choroid plexus are important for iron uptake and the synthesis of iron-related proteins.  4) H and L ferritin not only play important roles in iron storage but also likely contribute to iron transport within the brain.  Overall, this  study helps to clarify the adaptive strategy the brain utilizes when experiencing an imbalance in iron requirements and iron supply.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3155], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Jian ", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Elliot Beard", "Jonathan R Day", "Byron C Jones", "James Robert Connor", "Michael Henry Green"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Elliot Beard, Committee Chair", "Jonathan R Day, Committee Member", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Michael Henry Green, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mRNA", "ferritin", "transferrin receptor", "brain", "iron-related proteins", "iron deficiency", "rat", "transferrin"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Effects of narratives in health communication: Does typicality matter?", "id": "hh63sv88v", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12748", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "      It is well known in psychology and communications that the typicality of individuals depicted in media messages could effect message interpretations and attitudes.

The effects of typicality cues in narrative messages, which deliver information about the typicality or representativeness of the narrative, have not been empirically examined either. The purpose of this dissertation is therefore three-fold. First, it examines whether the typicality of character in a narrative will affect individuals\u2019 responses. Second, it explores whether contextually-embedded typicality cues and character typicality cues will be similarly effective. Third, this study investigates the underlying mechanisms mediating the impact of narratives with character or cued typicality, which have not been fully investigated previously.\n      To accomplish those goals, a 2 (character typicality: typical vs. nontypical character) x 3 (typicality cues: typical cues vs. nontypical cues vs. no cues) between-subjects experiment was conducted, focusing on the risks of sun exposure without using sunscreen. Character typicality is the degree to which attributes of a character in a narrative are perceived to be present in the portrayal\u2019s real-world counterparts. Character typicality was manipulated according to the pretest procedures developed by Graesser (1981). Following the pretests, the typical and nontypical attributes were used to construct different characters in a narrative. Cued typicality was manipulated by the explicit statements within the narrative that described the character and the story as being typical or not. The study also had a condition without any cues. \n      The findings showed that a narrative with a typical character led to higher perceived realism, more positive attitude toward sunscreen use, and less message novelty than a narrative with a nontypical character. Narrative messages with no cues resulted in more positive message attitude than narratives with nontypical cues. Typical cues had more positive impact on issue attitude than nontypical cues. As for the interaction effects, the results showed that when the message had a typical character, narrative messages with no cues led to more transportation, higher identification, and more positive message evaluation than narrative messages with typical or nontypical cues. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12074], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Jiangxue ", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiangxue", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fuyuan Shen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fuyuan Shen, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Narrative", "Typicality", "Engagement", "Health Communications"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Not all advertisements are created equal: The role of construal level on hedonic and utilitarian attributes", "id": "27135", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11842", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current dissertation examines the ways in which utilitarian and hedonic attributes of a product/service in an advertisement can be effectively presented. Specifically, this dissertation identifies the effect of consumers\u2019 construal level (abstract versus concrete), framing (gain-framing versus loss-framing), and type of attribute (hedonic versus utilitarian) on their evaluation of products or services.  The four research questions are: 1) Under what conditions, would emphasizing hedonic versus utilitarian attributes be more effective in an advertisement? 2) Would an individual\u2019s construal level influence his/her evaluation of the product that emphasizes hedonic versus utilitarian attributes?  3) Would it matter whether the message was gained-framed or loss-framed? 4) What is the underlying psychological mechanism of this effect?\nThe results of the two pre-studies and two main studies demonstrated that consumer\u2019s construal level significantly influences how he/she evaluates a product/service with hedonic and utilitarian attributes.  In detail, consumers with an abstract mindset focused more on hedonic attributes (versus utilitarian attributes), and thus they perceived the product/service more positively when hedonic attributes were emphasized. However, this result was only significant when the hedonic attributes were framed as a gain.  When the attributes were framed as a loss, consumers with an abstract mindset did not favor the product/service that emphasized hedonic attributes (versus utilitarian attributes).  On the other hand, consumers with a concrete mindset favored more product/service that emphasized utilitarian attributes (versus hedonic attributes) framed as a loss.

Applications of such work focuses on the design and management of a transportation network, which include not only problems of adding/removing capacity by changing nodes and arc sets, but also the determination of piecewise smooth decision variables like prices, tolls, traffic signals, information accessibility, and other control variables associated with Stackelberg mechanisms and so-called second-best strategies.\n\nThe primary modeling paradigms employed by this dissertation are differential Nash-like games and differential Stackelberg games that are constrained by systems of (partial) differential algebraic equations. Such modeling paradigms capture several key elements of modern traffic networks including travel choices, demand evolution, vehicular flow propagation, as well as their economic, social and environmental impacts. The model of simultaneous route-and-departure choice dynamic network user equilibrium developed in the early 1990s has been extended in this dissertation to incorporate elastic travel demands and bounded rationality. The invocation of infinite-dimensional variational inequality and differential variational inequality formulations of Nash-like differential game allows existence, uniqueness, computability, stability and other qualitative properties of these models to be addressed and answered.\n\nA critical component of the Nash-like network congestion game is the so-called dynamic network loading (DNL) sub-problem, which aims at describing and predicting the spatial-temporal evolution of traffic flows on a network that is consistent with established route and departure time choices of travelers. Several traffic flow models, including the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards network model accommodating vehicle spillback, have been analyzed in depth along with their solution representation established and qualitative properties shown. The corresponding DNL models are expressed as systems of differential algebraic equations. Existence, uniqueness, and well-posedness of the DNL solutions are discussed in a qualitative way.\n\nAs applications of the established modeling framework, we present and solve several network design problems including congestion pricing and dynamic signal control, where traffic-derived emissions are modeled and constrained in a mathematically tractable way to assess environmental sustainability.

However, most composites suffer from the low breakdown strength and make the potential gain in energy density small. Here, a new chemical strategy is proposed that, through sol-gel reactions between ceramic precursors and functional groups at the end of the functionalized Poly(vinylidene fluoride -co- chlorotrifluoroethylene) chains, amorphous low permittivity ceramics was in-situ generated in the polymer matrix and cross-linked the polymer chains simultaneously. By carefully tuning precursors, the polymer/precursors feeding ratios, a series of nanocomposites were systematically designed. All the samples are comprehensively characterized and the structure-property correlations are well investigated. The optimal samples exhibit higher breakdown strength than the pristine polymer. The enhanced breakdown strength ascribed to low contrast in permittivity, great dispersion and improved electrical and mechanical properties. This newly developed approach has shown great promise for new composite capacitors.\nThe percolative polymer composites have recently exhibited great potential in energy storage due to their high dielectric permittivities at the neighborhood of the percolation threshold. Yet high energy dissipation and poor voltage endurance of the percolative composites resulted from electrical conduction are still open issues to be addressed before full potential can be realized. Herein we report the percolative composites based on ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene) as the matrix and sol-gel derived SiO2 coated reduced graphene oxide nanosheets as the filler. By capitalizing on the SiO2 surface layers which have high electrical resistivity and breakdown strength, the composites exhibit superior dielectric performance as compared to the respective composites containing bare reduced graphene oxide nanosheet fillers. In addition to greatly reduced dielectric loss, little change in dielectric loss has been observed within medium frequency range (ie. 300 KHz - 3 MHz) in the prepared composites even with a filler concentration beyond the percolation threshold, indicating significantly suppressed energy dissipation and the feasibility of using the conductor-insulator composites beyond the percolation threshold. Moreover, remarkable breakdown strength of 80 MV/m at the percolation threshold has been achieved in the composite, which far exceeds those of conventional percolative composites (lower than 0.1 MV/m in most cases) and thus enables the applications of the percolative composites at high electric fields. This work offers a new avenue to the percolative polymer composites exhibiting high permittivity, reduced loss and excellent breakdown strength for electrical energy storage applications.\nFlexible piezoelectric materials have attracted extensive attention because they can provide a practical way to scavenge energy from the environment and motions. It also provides the possibility to fabricate wearable and self-powered energy generator for powering small electronic devices. In the dissertation a new composite including BTO 3D structure and PDMS has been successfully fabricated using the sol-gel process. The structure, flexibility, dielectric and piezoelectric properties have been well studied. The new material shows a high g33 value of more than 400 mV m/N. Moreover, the durability of this composite has been confirmed by cycle tests even though the BTO structure falls apart into small pieces in the PDMS matrix. The unique morphology of the composite allows the broken piece to connect with each other to generate power under stress. This work also opens a new route toward flexible piezoelectric composites. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9878], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Kuo ", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kuo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qing Wang", "Michael T Lanagan", "Qiming Zhang", "Zoubeida Ounaies"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qing Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member", "Zoubeida Ounaies, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanocomposite", "P(VDF-CTFE)", "ferroelectric", "piezoelectric", "sol-gel", "energy storage"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Influence of Cultural and Chemical Management Strategies on Annual Bluegrass Populations on Golf Course Putting Greens.", "id": "15457", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7832", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.; ABG) is widely adapted to most growing environments and is often considered a weed on creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.; CBG) golf course putting greens.  Undesirable characteristics of ABG include its light-green color, prolific seedhead production, shallow root system, high susceptibility to various pathogens and poor tolerance to extreme temperatures (Vargas and Turgeon, 2004).  Although various strategies have been implemented to eradicate ABG, its control has proven elusive.  Recent interest in a programmatic approach to suppressing ABG has been gaining popularity among golf course superintendents throughout the United States and golf courses in Europe and Australia.  Generalities of this program include: 1) low seasonal nitrogen (N) rates; 2) the use of Class B plant growth regulators (PGRs); and 3) routine applications of iron sulfate.  Additional commonalities of the program include minimal disturbance to the soil profile, routine sand topdressing, relatively low mowing heights and limited phosphorous fertilization.  The claimed benefits of the program include reductions in ABG populations and disease incidence and severity.  The impact of these strategies on the short and long-term health of the turfgrass system remains unknown.  A two-year field study was initiated to evaluate the influence of N rates (24 or 108 to 147 kg N ha-1 year-1), PGRs (trinexapac-ethyl, flurprimidol, and none) and iron sulfate rates (0, 12, and 49 kg Fe ha-1 application-1) on ABG populations.  Annual bluegrass populations were influenced by varying chemical and cultural management practices.  In general, ABG populations were lower when treated with low seasonal N rates, flurprimidol and high rates of iron sulfate.  Although the impact of these programs on disease activity was minimal in 2010, turfgrass receiving lower seasonal N rates generally had less dollar spot throughout 2011.\nIn addition to the cultural and chemical management programs for suppressing ABG, new herbicides continue to be introduced.  Limited information on the efficacy of these products on suppressing diverse biotypes of ABG typically found on golf courses is available.  A second objective of this thesis was to evaluate the ability of commercially available and experimental herbicides to control a variety of ABG biotypes.  A pot study was conducted to evaluate the ability of amicarbazone, methiozolin and bispyribac-sodium to suppress 30 to 31 annual and perennial biotypes of ABG.  Control of ABG with amicarbazone was rapid and generally, all biotypes were suppressed within 3 to 6 weeks after the initial application.  A slower suppression of ABG was observed when ABG was treated with methiozolin and bispyribac-sodium.  While amicarbazone and methiozolin generally provided nearly complete control of all ABG biotypes evaluated in this study, variation in ABG suppression was exhibited with bispyribac-sodium.  In areas where ABG populations are low and/or where rapid suppression is desired, amicarbazone may be utilized.  In situations where ABG populations are relatively high, methiozolin or bispyribac-sodium may allow for a slower conversion to a more desirable species such as CBG.   \nBased on results, the manipulation and suppression of ABG may be achieved through a combination of chemical and cultural practices.  The long-term impact of these non-traditional programmatic management programs, however, remains unknown.  Additionally, the safety and field efficacy of relatively new herbicides must be evaluated to ensure the safe use of these products on desirable turfgrass species grown on golf courses. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7763], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Kyung Min", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "Min", "first_name_ssi": "Kyung", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Edward Kaminski Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Edward Kaminski Iii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Annual bluegrass", "Creeping bentgrass", "Trinexapac-ethyl", "Flurprimidol", "Iron sulfate", "Amicarbazone", "Methiozolin", "Bispyribac-sodium"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Understanding the application of mobile technology in local community contexts", "id": "27244", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12170", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the impacts and consequences of information and communications technology in local communities through theoretical and practical approaches has long been studied.

First of all, mitochondria are the main source of energy for the eukaryotic cell.  Mitochondria produce more than 90% of the energy used by mammalian cells in a process referred to as oxidative phosphorylation.  This demanding mechanism requires a lot of proteins, which are nucleus-encoded, synthesized in cytoplasm, and imported into mitochondria.  However, it also requires 13 mitochondrial-encoded proteins.  Mitochondria have their own 16.5 kb circular genome (mtDNA) and ribosome to translate these 13 proteins.  Even though mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (55S) differ from bacterial (70S) and mammalian cytoplasmic ribosomes (80S), many of the mitochondrial ribosomal proteins have bacterial homologs and similar functions.  Some of the mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, which have no homologs in bacterial ribosomes, are involved in the process of apoptosis.  Therefore, mitochondrial ribosome is essential not only for the translation of 13 proteins for energy production but also the regulation of apoptosis. \nHere, two regulatory mechanisms involved in mitochondrial functions by mitochondrial ribosomal proteins were investigated; energy production by OXPHOS and apoptosis.  First, we reported that the presence of different splice variants of MRPS29, which contained an uORF in the 5'-UTR in humans and the expression of MRPS29 could be translationally controlled by the uORF found in the 5'-UTR.  Data presented in this thesis also suggest that reduction in MRPS29 expression by uORF may inhibit MRPS29-induced apoptosis.  Therefore, the presence of uORF-MRPS29 mRNAs in human potentially indicates a new mechanism for regulation of apoptosis.  \n  Another regulatory mechanism via post-translational modification has been revealed by studying mitochondrial ribosomal L7/L12 stalk region.  The mitochondrial ribosomal protein L10 (MRPL10) was identified as a major acetylated protein in the mitochondrial ribosome.  We also found that ribosome associated SIRT3 was responsible for deacetylation of MRPL10 in a NAD+-dependent manner.  A mechanism by which the mitochondrial translation is regulated by reversible acetylation is proposed.  Increased acetylation status of mitochondrial ribosome in SIRT3 knock-out (Sirt3-/-) mice enhanced MRPL12 binding to the ribosome and recruitment of elongation factors to increase translation.  On the other hand, over-expression of SIRT3 reduced the translation and MRPL12 binding to ribosomes by deacetylation of the mitochondrial ribosome.  Therefore, acetylation of MRPL10 due to inhibition of SIRT3 could enhance its interaction with MRPL12, resulting in increased MRPL12 binding to ribosomes and the recruitment of elongation factors during translation.  These findings constitute the first evidence for the regulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis through the reversible acetylation of the mitochondrial ribosome and identified MRPL10 as a novel substrate of NAD+-dependent deacetylase, SIRT3.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4380], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Min-Joon  ", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min-Joon ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Emine Koc", "Emine C Koc", "Hasan Koc", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Teh Hui Kao", "Seogchan Kang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Emine Koc, Dissertation Advisor", "Emine C Koc, Committee Chair", "Hasan Koc, Committee Chair", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Seogchan Kang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["translation", "mitochondria", "apoptosis"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on Misallocation and Productivity", "id": "18920", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9017", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "CHAPTER 1: Plant-Level Worker Flows and the Losses from Financial Frictions\nBuera and Shin (2013) (BS) study the effect of financial frictions on total factor productivity\n(TFP). To do so, they develop a growth model in which output is produced by producers with heterogeneous productivity and there are entry and exit of producers. Their financial frictions are in the form of a collateral constraint, so that the amount of capital which\nproducers can rent in the capital rental market is limited to some multiple of producers\u2019\nindividual wealth. But plant-level worker flows predicted by their model are not consistent\nwith data on such flows. In this paper, I recalibrate the model to match these additional\ndata. The main finding is that TFP effect of financial frictions is smaller under the revised\ncalibration. For the tightest collateral constraint (a producer can only employ the capital he owns), TFP is 5.6% lower than in perfect capital market, while it is 15.9% lower for the replication of BS calibration.\n\nCHAPTER 2: Capital Account Openness and the Losses from Financial Frictions\nThe goal of this paper is to isolate the role of openness to international financial markets\n(capital account openness) on the total factor productivity (TFP) effect of financial frictions. To do so, I formulate a model in which individual households are either workers or entrepreneurs, can only save in the form of capital, and entrepreneurs are subject to a collateral constraint. Using this structure, I compare two steady states of a calibrated model\nnumerically: one in which the capital rental rate must clear a domestic capital rental market\n(closed economy), and one in which that rate is given by the world (small open economy).\nThe model predicts that a small open economy is affected less by financial frictions than\na closed economy: for the tightest collateral constraint, TFP in a small open economy is\nonly about 1% lower than in the economy without a collateral constraint, while it is 15%\nlower in a closed economy. TFP losses in a small open economy reflect factor misallocation\namong incumbent entrepreneurs (intensive margin), not distortions along entry-exit\nmargin, whereas for a tight financial frictions, there are distortions on both intensive and entry-exit margins in a closed economy. Using macro data, I find that a 1% rise in openness is associated with 0.196% decline in the effect of financial frictions on TFP. Running the same regression on subsamples, I also find that this empirical result mainly comes from a group of low income countries.\n\nCHAPTER 3: The Losses from Tax-type Distortions in a Model with Innovation\nIn this paper, I assess total factor productivity (TFP) losses from tax-type distortions. To do so, I introduce firm-specific tax-type distortions into a model like that of Luttmer (2007) and Atkeson and Burstein (2010), both of which have firms entering and exiting and engaging in costly process innovation that raises the probability of receiving higher future productivity. Then I compare the TFP gain from removing the tax-type distortions in this model with the TFP gain from their removal in a static model like that of Hsieh and Klenow(2009). The main finding is that both kinds of models make the similar prediction for the gains from removing the distortions. This happens because removing the distortions in the first kind of model gives rise to two offsetting effects on the incentive to engage in costly process innovation: the absence of distortions increases that incentive, while the induced greater entry increases competition and, thereby, reduces that incentive.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8852], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Minsoo ", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Minsoo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil Wallace", "Saroj Bhattarai", "James R.

The focus of our experiments is placed on surface systems involving weak adsorbate-surface interactions, in order to observe subtle chemical and physical effects resulting from the competition between weak forces.  This is demonstrated with a first set of experiments comparing the physical behaviors of C2N2 and CS2\u00a1\u00aatwo linear quadrupolar molecules.  We show that although the physical properties of the two molecules are comparable, their overlayer structures on Au{111} differ greatly due to the surface reconstruction.  Based on our measurements, we confirm that molecular aggregation depends on the delicate balance between intermolecular interactions and the adsorbate-substrate interactions.\n\nWe also investigate the phenomenon of substrate-mediated interactions that involve weak electron-scattering adsorbate species.  Firstly, we induce adsorbate-substrate interaction between the two-dimensional gas phase CS2 with the Au{111} substrate by manipulating the tunneling conditions.  In so doing, we show that the surface states involved in the adsorbate-substrate interactions are close to the surface Fermi energy level.  Secondly, we use a combination of time-lapse imaging with digital tracking to calculate the magnitude of substrate-mediated interactions for a physisorbed benzene overlayer at a coverage of 0.9 ML on Au{111}.  Focusing on the two-dimensional desorption of the benzene molecules, we find an exponential relationship between the number of nearest neighbors before desorption and the desorption occurrence.  Based on these measurements, we use an Arrhenius-like approach to calculate the magnitude of substrate-mediated interactions.  The subtle effects of these close-range substrate-mediated interactions are apparent over the \u00a1\u00b0pinwheel\u00a1\u00b1 structured benzene overlayer, as time-lapse images reveal benzene cascade motions.

BIDs are self-financing public service delivery mechanisms.  BID managers levy assessments on all property owners in their designated areas once they are established and use the money to deliver services in them. BIDs have become popular means to address the free-rider problems in local economies. They have become an increasingly popular topic of study among scholars. \nIt has been suggested that BIDs could be effective mechanisms for preventing and reducing crime in their designated areas. So far, only a few researchers have investigated the impacts of BIDs on crime outcomes. A major limitation of previous empirical studies is that they did not investigate the dynamic relationship between BIDs and crime. In other words, they did not consider the possibility that the previous rates of crime could affect the current BID establishment and crime rates. \nThe purpose of my dissertation is to investigate the impact of BIDs on crime rates in the city of Philadelphia using panel data from 1998 to 2009. I examine particularly the dynamic relationship between the existence of a BID and crime rate. I factor in the possibility that the current BID establishment is influenced by previous levels of crime rate; this approach can improve estimating the causal effect of BIDs on crime rates. More specifically I address the dynamic panel bias, which has been neglected in the previous studies, by using the Anderson-Hsiao estimators.\nOverall, I found in my analyses that BIDs are effective in reducing a limited number of crime outcomes. I found a negative association between BIDs and the aggravated assault rate, showing that an approximately 26% reduction in the aggravated assault rate was due to the existence of a BID in an area. I also found that areas with five years or less of BID operation were 26% lower in the aggravated assault rate in comparison with non-BID areas.\nThe results of my dissertation indicate that crime reduction cannot be achieved simply by establishing a BID in a neighborhood. The results may indicate that understanding the area around BID neighborhoods and their relationships with BIDs, and the structure and implementation strategies of BIDs, are more important for crime reduction. This is an important issue that warrants further investigation as it can provide valuable information for local governments and neighborhood property owners in managing and redesigning BIDs to be effective urban mechanisms to reduce and prevent crime.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12664], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Sehee ", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sehee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Goktug Morcol", "Goktug Morcol", "Jonathan Lee ", "Steven A.

With the development of option markets, various types of options have been created to meet the needs for different investors. The prices of most options do not have a simple closed form solution and efficient computational methods are needed to determine them. The Monte Carlo method has increasingly become a popular computational tool to price complex financial options and the most famous least square Monte Carlo method has been widely used in financial industry since Longstaff and Schwartz created it in 2001. They showed that the Monte Carlo method is a simple yet powerful approach for approximating the values of prices and Greeks for complex option types. \nIn this thesis, one type of exotic options, the American-Asian option, is priced by a modified least square Monte Carlo simulation method. This modified approach generates initial asset prices randomly from a carefully chosen distribution and obtains a regression equation for different initial values. This equation can be differentiated analytically to estimate the Greeks, which are very helpful to understand risk sensitivities of options. The Binomial tree method is used as a control method to compare the performance of this modified approach. The extension to multi-dimensional cases is also discussed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7760], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Shiguang ", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shiguang", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Ventura"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Ventura, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["American-Asian option pricing; Least square method"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "TOWARDS A SOFT-MOLD BASED HYBRID FIBER FORM DEFINING APPROACH", "id": "12426xuh117", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12426", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fiber composites have been widely used in aeronautics, sailing, and other industries. Recently they have re-emerged as building materials, which are worth investigating their potentials and alternative approaches of the shaping process. The problem with fiber-based structures is that fiber composite manufacturing relies heavily on shaping through traditional molds usually made of EPS foam. These molds are expensive, non-flexible and non-reconfigurable.\n\nIn this thesis, I propose a soft mold based hybrid form defining approach. This approach focuses on force-induced forms and addresses molding issues. The soft mold is created by a layer of fibers and a framework that can shape the entire fibrous structure through its flexible surface. The hybrid fiber system is comprised of frameworks for a static system and patterns for a form-active system. I test this research vision through the following steps: 1) reviewing shaping process of fiber composites and molding systems in fibrous architecture; 2) investigating the inherent material capacity especially the tension and compression in tensile surfaces; 3) developing fiber based soft molds as flexible molding systems; and 4) prototyping with different soft mold based surfaces through analogue material experimentation. The contributions of this thesis include: 1) proposing a reconfigurable and deformable soft mold to shape fibrous surfaces; and 2) establishing a hybrid fiber system that can shape multi-directional curved undulating surfaces through pre-tensioned fibers.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14028], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Xiao ", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiao", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Felecia Ann Davis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Felecia Ann Davis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["soft mold", "reconfigurable", "form-force", "undulating surface", "pre-tensioned fibers"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "an analytical model for simulating the critical behavior of elastomeric seismic isolation bearings", "id": "19386", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9338", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Elastomeric bearings are one type of seismic isolation devices widely used in practice.

Semi-empirical bearing models that are able to simulate the critical behavior have been developed and shown to simulate the experimentally observed response of elastomeric bearings with reasonable accuracy. However these models rely upon numerous empirical parameters that must be experimentally calibrated and/or have complex solutions making the models impractical for design purpose. \nThis study aims to evaluate existing semi-empirical bearing models to elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) leading to critical behavior and to use this knowledge as guidance for the development of an improved analytical model for simulating such behavior that does not rely upon experimentally calibrated parameters.
