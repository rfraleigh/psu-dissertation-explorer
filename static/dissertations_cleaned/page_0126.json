The central objective of this dissertation is to explore rich physical phenomena that originate from the interplay between crystalline symmetry and topologically non-trivial electronic band structure in quantum materials. In particular, my research focuses on (1) the role of mirror symmetry in determining the helicity of topological surface states in HgTe, HgS and NaBaBi (Chapter 2); (2) circular photogalvanic effect induced by helical spin texture of topological surface states in Bi2Se3 (Chapter 3); (3)\ntopological mirror superconducting phases in half-Heusler compounds (Chapter 4); (4) topological nonsymmorphic superconducting phases (Chapter 5); and (5) the quantum anomalous Hall effect in Mn doped InAs/GaSb quantum wells (Chapter 6). \n\nOne salient feature of topological insulators is the helical spin texture of topological surface states. The first principles calculations show that the helicity of spin texture for the upper Dirac cone of topological surface states is left-handed for Bi2Se3 and HgTe and right-handed for HgS and NaBaBi. In this study (Chapter 2), the topological meaning of the helicity of surface state spin texture is extracted by relating it to the mirror Chern number, a topological invariant that is protected by mirror symmetry. A direct physical consequence is the existence of gapless states at the interface between HgTe and HgS which possess opposite helical spin textures. A systematical study of the role of helical spin textures in circular photogalvanic effect in topological insulators is also carried out (Chapter 3), aiming at providing a theoretical understanding of a recent photocurrent experiment in Bi2Se3 films.\n\nThe study of the interplay between crystalline symmetry and topological states not only provides insights into the topological nature of surface state helicity in topological insulators but also can lead to new topological phases. In my study, new topological superconducting phases that are protected by certain crystalline symmetry are proposed and studied. Particularly, I investigate (1) the possible existence of topological mirror superconductor phases in half-Heusler materials YPtBi or LuPtBi, in which superconductivity is found to coexist with nontrivial band structures (Chapter 4); and (2) a classification of topological nonsymmorphic superconductors that are protected by glide symmetry in the BdG symmetry classes D, BDI and DIII (Chapter 5). We hope these theoretical studies will provide guidance for the experimental search of topological crystalline superconductors.

Specifically, the dissertation addresses (1) the rural-urban wage gap among women in the U.S., (2) unemployment transitions of low-income persons in the nonmetropolitan U.S., and (3) the influence of the employment rate in the explanation of the relative decline in welfare receipt between immigrants and U.S. native-born individuals after welfare reform.\n\nThe first study utilizes Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data to evaluate possible reasons for the persistent rural-urban wage gap for women over the 1985-1992 period in the United States.  The paper adopts the general equilibrium model of interacting regions as a starting point, then uses two-step panel data estimations that allow consideration of explanations including rural-urban differences in observed individual characteristics and work-related characteristics, and at the same time control for both unobserved differences in natural amenities and productivities and for the potential effects of endogeneity and/or sample selection bias in hours worked.  The paper finds that significant rural-urban female wage differentials exist for many groups even when controlling for cost-of-living differentials, indicating that the functioning of rural and urban labor markets are different in the United States.\n\nThe second study analyzes the labor market outcomes of unemployed low-income persons across metro and nonmetro U.S. labor markets.  Using matched data from the March Current Population Survey Annual Demographic Files from 1988 to 2002, this study examines the transition probabilities of unemployed persons living in poor/near poor families; in poor, single-parent families; and in families receiving welfare.  The employment transitions are estimated for movement into different labor force states in a discrete choice model framework using multinomial probit models.  Two measures of employment status \u2013 monthly labor force status and yearly labor force status \u2013 are used to capture the concept of unemployment with different time frames.  To supplement the transition analysis of employment outcomes, the paper also examines the distribution of earnings of those unemployed low-income people who found employment, by rural and urban location.  The study finds that there are differences in the likelihood of leaving unemployment for rural low-income persons compared to urban ones, by both monthly and yearly labor force status measures.  Based on the monthly labor force status measure, rural low-income unemployed residents are generally more likely to find part-time jobs than their urban counterparts in transitions out of unemployment.  However, given the yearly labor force status measure, the paper finds that greater persistence exists in part-year or seasonal unemployment for rural low-income unemployed persons than urban ones.  Rural low-income unemployed workers are generally more likely to remain unemployed over time.  Further, for rural workers who found employment the next year, their hourly wages and earnings are generally lower than their urban counterparts even after they have gotten better jobs.\n\nThe third study attempts to explain the apparent differences in use of welfare between immigrants and U.S. native-born individuals after welfare reform.  The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), enacted August 22, 1996, significantly limits federal means-tested benefits to legal immigrants who have not become U.S. citizens.  This research addresses the observed differences in the declines in welfare use rates by immigrants as compared to U.S. natives by examining the relationship between welfare use and employment by nativity differences and by gender from 1993 to 2002 using simultaneous-equation techniques.  In part, differences in the rates of decline in welfare use since PRWORA result not only from changes in the \u2018rules\u2019 for qualifying for welfare, but also from differences in changes in employment rates.  The paper tests the hypothesis that the observed post-welfare reform decrease in welfare participation rates among immigrants and natives is conditional on changes in their employment rates.  The study finds that the decisions relative to welfare participation and employment are negatively related and jointly determined for most welfare programs.  Moreover, the study shows that the employment rate can explain around one-third of the greater relative declines among immigrant men compared to native men in welfare receipt in the post-PRWORA period.  However, the employment rate can only explain a small part of the relative declines in welfare use rates among immigrant women compared to native women in the post-reform period.  Finally, the study finds that nativity differences in welfare participation rates among immigrants and natives are sensitive to the unit of analysis (e.g., at the individual as compared to the household level).  This analysis is based on data from the March Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplements (formerly Annual Demographic Survey) 1994-2003. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5048], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Qiuyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qiuyan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics and Demography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis", "Leif Jensen", "James Samuel Shortle", "Mark Hayward", "Stephen Michael Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis, Committee Chair", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Member", "Mark Hayward, Committee Member", "Stephen Michael Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["welfare reform", "unemployment transitions", "rural-urban wage gap", "rural labor markets", "immigrants and welfare", "low-income workers"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "PERK eIF2alpha kinase regulates cell proliferation, insulin synthesis and secretion in pancreatic beta cells", "id": "21417", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9767", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "        Insulin synthesis and secretion, as well as cell proliferation are under tight regulation in pancreatic \u03b2-cells to maintain glucose homeostasis. Dysfunction in any of these aspects leads to development of diabetes. PERK (EIF2AK3) is essential for normal development and function of the insulin-secreting \u03b2-cell. Genetic ablation of PERK in humans and mice results in permanent neonatal diabetes featuring insufficient \u03b2-cell mass, impaired insulin synthesis and ablated insulin secretion. However, previous attempts to identify the primary functions of PERK were confounded by those severe abnormalities within PERK-deficient \u03b2-cells. Here, I used a newly developed and highly specific inhibitor of PERK to determine the immediate effects of acute PERK activity inhibition. Stimulated subcellular Ca2+ signaling and insulin secretion in human and rodent \u03b2-cells was found to be rapidly reduced as a consequence of acute inhibition of PERK. These PERK-dependent dysfunctions stem from alterations in store-operated Ca2+ entry, sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase activity, and possibly some of the transient receptor potential channels. I also found that PERK regulates calcineurin, and pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin results in similar defects on stimulus-secretion coupling. My findings by using PERK inhibitor demonstrate that PERK acutely regulates \u03b2-cell Ca2+ signaling and insulin secretion.\n        In addition, I used an alternative strategy to identify the primary functions of PERK by examining mice with one copy of the loss-of function Perk mutation (Perk heterozygous mice). Longitudinal studies were conducted to assess serum glucose and insulin, intracellular insulin synthesis and storage, insulin secretion, and \u03b2-cell proliferation in Perk heterozygous mice. I found that Perk heterozygous mice first exhibited elevated proinsulin synthesis, changes in ER chaperone expression, and enhanced insulin secretion during neonatal and juvenile development, followed by enhanced \u03b2-cell proliferation and a substantial increase in \u03b2-cell mass at the adult stage. These effects of Perk heterozygosity are opposite to what has been learned from previously studies using Perk knockout mice and therefore suggest an inverted U-shaped dose effect on insulin production and secretion with half-dosage (Perk heterozygotes) defining the maximum. Moreover, because commonly used sensitive markers for ER stress were not differentially expressed in Perk heterozygous mice, these PERK-dependent differences are not likely to entail the well-known function of PERK in ER stress response.\n        Taken together my thesis work suggests that PERK has two major functions in the pancreatic \u03b2-cells: 1) acutely regulating insulin secretion through modulation of Ca2+ dynamics in a calcineurin-dependent pathway; and 2) impacting proinsulin folding and quality control in a longer-term through modulation of ER chaperone expression. These two major functions of PERK coordinate with each other and influence whole-body insulin production and glucose homeostasis.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9517], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Rong ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Richard W Ordway", "Gong Chen", "Melissa Rolls"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener, Dissertation Advisor", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Chair", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Gong Chen, Committee Member", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PERK eIF2alpha kinase", "Ca2+ dynamics", "insulin secretion", "insulin biosynthesis", "diabetes", "ER stress", "beta cell proliferation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The relationship between maternal allostatic load and demographic characteristics within different ethnic populations and different federal-level poverty groups", "id": "24831", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10992", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Background: The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between maternal allostatic load, a measure of the cumulative toll of chronic stress, and demographic characteristics within different ethnic populations and different federal-level poverty groups, which provides some foundational research prior to investigating the association of maternal allostatic load with the outcome of a subsequent pregnancy.\n\nMethods: This study is a part of a large study conducted by the Community and Child Health Network (CCHN). The CCHN allostatic load data set includes 10 objective biomarkers taken at the T2M visit (six months postpartum) and the T3M visit (12 months postpartum) for the mothers. The linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze the differences of all maternal allostatic load variables between the T2M visit and the T3M visit. Next, principal component analysis was applied to summarize the variability across maternal allostatic load variables in different ethnicity and poverty level groups and to do variable reduction. Finally, regression analysis was invoked to determine the relationship between maternal allostatic load variables and demographic variables within different ethnicity and poverty level groups.\n\nResults: From the linear mixed-effects regression analysis, there were significant differences on total cholesterol between the T2M visit and the T3M visit in poor Hispanic group (Difference=-9.9, SE=4.6, p=0.03), in the rich White group (Difference=-8.5, SE=3.7, p=0.02), and in the middle White group (Difference=-29.9, SE=7.2, p<0.0001). Principal component analysis identified two principal components of the biomarkers of maternal allostatic load. The first principal component was total cholesterol and the second principal component can be explained as a weighted average of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. The comparisons of each allostatic load variable between different groups by ethnicity and poverty level at the T3M visit showed the only difference of mid-arm circumference between the middle Africa-American group and the middle White group after performing Hochberg step-down procedure (Difference=8.6, 95% Confidence Limits: 3.8-13.3, p=0.0004). The group wise comparisons of overall allostatic load variables at the T3M visit showed no statistical significance.\n\nConclusions: There were no differences on most allostatic load biomarkers among 18 to 40 years old women within different ethnicity and poverty level groups while accounting for education, recruitment location, and age as covariables. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10572], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Rong ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rong", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vernon Michael Chinchilli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["allostatic load", "demographics", "ethnicity", "federal-level poverty"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EVALUATION OF MARKETING LEADERSHIP IN ORGANIZATIONS", "id": "8522", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5426", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The overarching objective of this thesis is to develop insights into whether marketing (sales) executives have an impact on organizational outcomes.

Furthermore, multiple response teams, which own different resources, need to collaborate to determine tradeoffs among competing resource needs to reallocate such resources.  The challenge of this collaborative resource reallocation is further complicated by the fact that each team may not have complete information about other teams\u00a1\u00af resources and the utility of their tasks. This limitation makes it difficult to assess tradeoffs among resource needs of different teams.\nIn order to solve such problems, this research developed team-based software intelligent agents to collaboratively adapt existing plans for resource use by consistently reallocating the limited resources among distributed tasks. Based on an innovative multi-agent teamwork model called R-CAST (RPD-enabled Collaborative Agents for Simulating Teamwork), this research developed a framework for collaborative plan adaptation under resource constraints. The framework addresses the challenges mentioned above in three ways. First, it extends R-CAST with explicit representation of resources and related reasoning algorithms about resources. Second, it uses a combinatorial auction mechanism to enable agents to exchange utility information regarding competing needs of bundled resources, so that agents can reason about resource tradeoffs for effective reallocation of scarce resources. Third, the framework implements an algorithm for an agent to assess the opportunity cost of offering a resource bundle that has already been assigned to a task. The algorithm considers alternative ways to accomplish the task, the utility of such alternatives, and associated costs for obtaining required resources.\nIn summary, the work presented in this thesis facilitates distributed teams to reason about tradeoffs among competing requests for resource bundles by exchanging relevant information through combinatorial auctions. Experimental results have suggested that this research can significantly improve the utilization of limited resources in adapting plans to the dynamic situation.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5451], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Rui ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Yen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Yen, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["resource", "collaboration", "agent", "plan adaptation"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "GEOMETRICAL MAGNETIC FRUSTRATION AND DEMAGNETIZATION OF ARTIFICIAL SPIN ICE", "id": "7509", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5363", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ice is a common material that has unusual properties. The hydrogen ions in ice keep in disordered states even at the extremely low temperatures. Thus ice has the so-called zero point entropy. The disordered states in ice are a consequence of geometrical frustration, a fascinating phenomenon that attracts not only considerable interest in basic physics but also provides a novel platform for important applications, such as data storage and neural networks.\nGeometrical frustration also occurs in magnetic materials, in which the geometry of an ordered lattice prohibits simultaneous minimization of all magnetic interactions. Spin ice is a class of geometrically frustrated materials in which the magnetic ions mimic the frustration of hydrogen ion positions in frozen water. However, such chemically synthesized materials put severe limitations on probing the individual magnetic ions and tuning the magnetic interactions.\nWe used electron beam lithographic patterning to create square arrays of single-domain permalloy (Ni0.8Fe0.2) nanomagnets in which the dipolar interactions displayed two-dimensional frustration analogous to spin ice. Magnetic force microscopic (MFM) images of individual magnetic moments directly displayed the local accommodation of frustration. We saw both ice-like short-range correlations and an absence of long-range correlations, behavior which is strikingly similar to the low-temperature state of spin ice. \nThe second part of this thesis is about our investigations on demagnetization on the nanometer scale. We studied demagnetization protocols for artificial spin ice by rotating it in a changing magnetic field. To demagnetize the sample, we find that the most effective demagnetization is achieved by not only stepping the field strength down while the sample is rotating, but by combining each field step with an alternation in the field direction. By contrast, linearly decreasing the field strength or stepping the field down without alternating the field direction leaves the arrays with a larger remanent magnetic moment. These results suggest that non-monotonic variations in field magnitude around and below the coercive field are important for the demagnetization process.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5357], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Ruifang ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ruifang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter E Schiffer", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Nitin Samarth", "Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter E Schiffer, Committee Chair", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["geometrical magnetic frustration", "spin ice"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "READING NEWS ON SMARTPHONES: HOW DO MOOD, MODALITY INTERACTIVITY, AND NEWS STORY LENGTH INFLUENCE USER ENGAGEMENT?", "id": "13713rxw274", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13713", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reading news on smartphones has become a primary activity among smartphone users.

Because both fructose and AA are naturally present in, or are added to, many juices (e.g., apple juice), it is desirable to retain these compounds during UV processing. Therefore, the overall objective of this thesis is to study the mechanism by which fructose accelerates the loss of AA under these conditions.\n\tThe first objective was to confirm that fructose increases the degradation of AA when exposed to UV light in a model apple juice (0.5% malic acid, pH 3.3).  A collimated beam-batch UV system (254 nm) was used in these experiments.  In agreement with an earlier study, fructose increased the degradation of AA exposed to UV light while having no effect on AA degradation in the dark. I further confirmed that there is a positive association with UV-induced AA degradation and fructose concentration, up to 10% fructose.\n\tThe second objective was to determine if fructose acts as a reactant or catalyst during UV degradation of AA.  In addition to measuring AA loss, fructose concentration was measured during UV treatments.  Despite significant losses of AA in samples containing 0.255 and 51.0 g/L of fructose, no significant (p>0.05) reduction in fructose levels was observed after up to 12 hours of UV light treatment.  This suggested that the fructose molecule does not react directly with AA, but instead acts as a catalyst.\n\tThe third objective was to measure H2O2 and free radical generation produced by fructose treated with UV light.  Among three sugars tested, 17x more H2O2 was produced in the presence of fructose compared to glucose after 100 minutes of UV treatment.  In a separate experiment, in which H2O2 was added to AA solutions at levels similar to that produced by fructose in the previous experiment, I found that the degradation reaction occurred during UV light exposure, but not in samples held in the dark. I proposed that UV induced homolytic scission of H2O2 occurs leading to formation of reactive radicals that catalyze AA degradation.  \n\tThese three objectives confirmed my hypothesis that the accelerating effect of fructose on UV-C induced ascorbic acid degradation occurs through catalytic formation of hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species derived from fructose.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9271], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Serena Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Serena", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luke F Laborde", "Ryan John Elias"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Luke F Laborde, Thesis Advisor", "Ryan John Elias, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ascorbic Acid", "Vitamin C", "UV", "Ultraviolet light", "Fructose", "Degradation", "Apple Juice"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "VORTICAL FLOW DYNAMICS AND ACOUSTIC RESPONSE OF GAS-TURBINE SWIRL-STABILIZED INJECTORS\n\n", "id": "6010", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6033", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present research focuses on a time-accurate numerical simulation and analysis of the vortical flow dynamics and acoustic characteristics of gas-turbine swirl-stabilized injectors with different swirl numbers.

The swirl number not only affects the time-mean topology of the flowfield, such as vortex breakdown, but also strongly influences the dynamic evolution of the flowfield and acoustic resonance mode of the chamber. \nAfter validation, the analysis is implemented to study the vortical flow dynamics in a gas-turbine swirl-stabilized injector as the second part of the present effort.  In this flow configuration, air is radially delivered into the injector through three sets of swirl vanes, which are counter-rotating with each other.  Several instability modes with well-defined frequencies, such as vortex breakdown, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in both the streamwise and azimuthal directions, helical instability, centrifugal instability, and their interactions/competitions, are observed in the flowfields.  The flowfield is well organized at a low swirl number, and the vortex shedding due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is the dominant mechanism for driving flow oscillations.  The flow structure, however, becomes much more complex at a high swirl number, with each sub flow regime dominated with different frequencies and flow patterns.  \nThe dynamic response of the injector flow to externally imposed oscillations is examined over a broad range of forcing frequency from 400 to 13,000 Hz.  The response can be conveniently characterized in terms of the acoustic admittance and mass transfer functions at the exit.  Results can be used as an inlet boundary condition in analyzing the combustion instability characteristics of the main chamber.  The influences of external excitations on the injector mean flow structures and turbulence properties appear to be limited.  However, the unsteady flow evolution in the injector, such as the instantaneous mass flux and pressure distributions, are significantly modulated in both the spatial and spectral domains.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6025], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Shanwu ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shanwu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "James Gordon Brasseur", "Vigor Yang", "Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "James Gordon Brasseur, Committee Member", "Vigor Yang, Committee Chair", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Swirling Flows", "injector dynamics", "POD", "mode competition", "large eddy simulation", "mode competition", "acoustic admittance", "acoustic respons", "Kelvin-Helmholtz instability", "vortex breakdown"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF POLYURETHANE IONOMERS", "id": "12206", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6034", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Applications such as lithium ion batteries and actuator membranes of ionconducting\npolymers usually require both mechanical strength and ionic conductivity\nsimultaneously. Throughout this thesis, PEO-based polyurethane ionomers are explored\nfor achieving both good mechanical strength and high ionic conductivity. Polyurethane is\nan interesting material because it can have coexisting a mechanically strong hard phase\nand a fast relaxing soft phase, which can potentially have high conductivity. Anionic\ngroups carboxylate and sulfonate are attached on the polyurethane chain either in the hard\nsegment or soft segment to prepare single-ion conducting polyurethane ionomers that\nallow only cations to move under an applied electric field. Morphology, mechanical\nstrength, ionic conductivity, thermal and dielectric properties are characterized to develop\nthe structure-property relationships of these polyurethane ionomers.\nCarboxylate-based polyurethane ionomers are prepared by using a low molar\nmass carboxylate diol that places the caroxylate groups in the hard segment. The effect of\nthe counterions, from small sodium ions to large ionic liquid type counterions, is studied.\nIt is found that with ionic groups in the hard segment, polyurethane ionomers do not\nmicrophase separate into hard and soft phases even with a 40wt% hard segment content.\nThe glass transition temperature Tg decreases with increasing cation size because the\ndistance between cation and anion increases and the Coulombic force decreases. The\nionomers with lower Tg show a much higher ionic conductivity (up to 5 orders of\nmagnitude) and the ionic conductivity is strongly coupled to polymer segmental\nrelaxation. However, the modulus is also reduced because these ionomers do notmicrophase separate and it is also found that more than 50% of the counterions are\ntrapped in the hard segment and never conduct.\nPolyurethane ionomers with sulfonate groups in the center of the soft segment are\nalso synthesized by placing the sulfonate between poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacers. It\nis found that with sulfonate groups in the soft segment and long enough PEG spacer (Mw\n> 600), the polyurethane ionomers can microphase separate if there is more than 20wt%\nof hard segment, achieved by incorporating butane diol chain extender. The microphase\nseparated ionomers are solids with modulus ~ MPa up to 200oC. We observe a lower soft\nphase Tg (~ 5oC independent of hard segment content) and higher ionic conductivity, are\nalso detected compared to ionomers with carboxylate groups in the hard segment. The\nionic conductivity is again found to strongly couple with polymer segmental relaxation.\nBy placing the ionic groups in the soft segment, the problem of many ions being trapped\nin the hard segment is solved and all cations can respond to an applied electric field and\ncontribute to ionic conductivity.

A drop test setup, coupled with a high speed camera, was developed to conduct time-resolved studies on the pre-ignition, ignition and post-ignition events during the drop-on-pool impingement interactions of two hypergolic liquids. Thin-wire thermocouples were used to trace the temperatures of the liquid reactants as well as the gaseous products formed during the pre-ignition process which has a very short time scale. In addition, a confined interaction setup, coupled with rapid scan Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, was developed to study the gaseous species evolved from the early reactions that occur upon the mixing of small quantity of liquid hypergols. \nOne major objective of this research is to develop an understanding of the pre-ignition reactions between the oxidizer nitric acid (HNO3) and two target fuels: monomethylhydrazine (MMH), one of the most well-known hydrazine-based fuels, and N,N,N,\u2019N\u2019-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), which may be one of the most promising alternative fuels. This is also a part of an effort to provide experimental support for the MMH-RFNA and TMEDA-RFNA mechanisms that are being developed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL).  \nA three-stage hypergolic ignition process was revealed by both the temperature measurements in the drop tests and the pre-ignition products analysis in the confined interaction experiments. In the first stage, condensed-phase reactions take place between MMH (or TMEDA) and HNO3 upon their contact to form corresponding nitrate salts. The temperature at the interface between the two liquids increases rapidly to their boiling points due to the exothermic nitrate formation reactions. In the second stage, gas-phase reactions occur between the vapors of MMH (or TMEDA) and HNO3 to form a particulate aerosol which is mainly composed of nitrates products. In the third stage, secondary reactions are activated when the temperature of the gaseous and aerosol species increases to a critical point. Rapid heat release from the secondary reactions leads to an ignition in the gas phase. The early species (or pre-ignition products) formed in the three stages were analyzed by rapid scan FTIR spectroscopy and possible reaction pathways were proposed in this work.\nTwo energetic nitrate compounds, MMH\u20222HNO3 and TMEDA\u20228HNO3, were synthesized from corresponding hypergolic pairs MMH/HNO3 and TMEDA/HNO3. Both of these two energetic nitrates have a stoichiometric F/O (fuel-to-oxidizer) ratio, thus can be treated as monopropellants. The combustion and thermal decomposition of these two compounds were studied in a strand burner and a confined rapid thermolysis (CRT)/FTIR setup, respectively. Combustion studies on these compounds provided first-hand burn-rate data for future use in premixed combustion modeling of the hypergolic pair MMH/HNO3 and TMEDA/HNO3. The decomposition reactions of these nitrates should also be considered as an important part in the MMH-RFNA and TMEDA-RFNA mechanisms.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8898], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Shiqing ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shiqing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stefan Thynell", "Richard A Yetter", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "James Hansell Adair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stefan Thynell, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hypergolic propellant; Monomethylhydrazine; Tetramethylethylened"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS AND BIOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF HETEROTRIMERIC G PROTEIN IN ARABIDOPSIS\n", "id": "7799", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6557", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Heterotrimeric G proteins are recognized as important signal transduction molecules in all eukaryotic organisms from yeasts to humans. Compared to mammals and invertebrates, simplicity of G protein gene family in Arabidopsis provides a unique advantage for investigating its functions in various aspects of different physiological processes. Extensive studies in the last 10 years have shown that the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein is involved in a transducing a variety of signals, including light, hormones, biotic and abiotic stressors.\nFirst, we analyzed the functional roles of heterotrimeric G protein in Arabidopsis oxidative stress responses to ozone (O3). Arabidopsis thaliana plants of homozygous gpa1-4 (G&#945; null mutation) are less sensitive to O3 damage than wild-type Columbia-0 plants, whereas agb1-2 (G&#946; null mutation) plants are more sensitive to O3 damage than wild-type Columbia-0 plants. The genes encoding the &#945; and &#946; subunits of the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein are differentially expressed in the course of the oxidative stress response to O3, suggesting that they play different roles in the plant\u2019s O3 responses. The first peak of the biphasic oxidative burst elicited by O3 in wild-type plants is absent in both mutant plants, suggesting that the first peak of the oxidative burst requires both &#945; and &#946; subunits or the intact heterotrimeric G protein. The second peak is missing in gpa1-4 mutant plants, but is normal in agb1-2 mutant plants, suggesting that the second peak of the oxidative burst requires only the &#945; subunit but not the &#946; subunit.\nThus, the opposing O3 phenotypes and the differential ROS production patterns between gpa1-4 and agb1-2 mutant plants indicate that the &#945; and &#946; subunits play separable roles in cell death associated oxidative stress response to O3.\nSecond, we analyzed the functional role of heterotrimeric G protein of Arabidopsis unfolded protein responses to Tm. Seedlings of agb1-2 mutant plants with a null mutation in the gene coding for the &#946; subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein are more resistant to growth inhibition by the protein glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (Tm) than wildtype plants and gpa1-4 plants with a null mutation in the gene encoding the &#945; subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. Leaves of agb1-2 mutant plants exhibit markedly less cell death after Tm treatment than those of wildtype plants. The transcriptional response of agb1-2 mutant plants to Tm is less pronounced than that of wildtype plants. On the other hand, AtrbohD (AtrbohD null mutation) and AtrbohD/F (AtrbohD and AtrbohF null mutation) mutant plants show more cell death in response to treatment with Tm than wildtype plants and AtrbohF (AtrbohF null mutation) mutant plants. The protective role of the endogenous ROS elicited by Tm treatment against Tm-induced cell death is also seen using ROS scavengers. Moreover, the transcriptional responses are delayed by the pretreatment with ROS scavengers.\nA majority of the Arabidopsis G&#946; protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is degraded after Tm treatment, while G&#945; protein is not. Collectively, these observations indicate that the G&#946;&#947;&#61472; complex, not G&#945;, plays an important role in cell death associated with the unfolded protein response in Arabidopsis. Moreover these\nobservations imply a direct role for both ROS and G protein signaling in the UPR.\nTo elucidate the mechanism of G protein signaling transduction, we characterized the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein complex. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and co-immunoprecipitation, we show interaction between the &#946;1 and &#947;&#61489; subunits and&#61472; between the &#945;1 and &#946;1&#947;&#61489;&#61472; subunits of the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins in plant protoplasts. We report that both the G&#945;&#61489; and the G&#946;&#61489; subunits are associated with macromolecular complexes in plasma membrane fractions. We estimate the size of the G-protein-containing plasma membrane complex to be approximately 669 kD based on blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the heterotrimeric G protein is present in a complex with other proteins. We find that G&#945;1 is present in both the large ca. 669 kD complex and in smaller complexes in plants homozygous for the agb1-2 G&#946;1 null allele. Deletion of the G&#946;1 interacting domain in G&#945;1, ahG&#945;1, abolishes normal function of G&#945;1 in the oxidative stress response to ozone, suggesting the interaction between G&#945;1 and G&#946;1&#947; complex may be required for transmitting the O3 signal in plant cells. Treatment of the plasma membrane fraction with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an important signaling molecule, results in the partial dissociation of the G&#945;1 complex. This observation suggests direct or indirect activation of G protein signaling by ROS in the oxidative stress response.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6555], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Shiyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shiyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ming Tien", "Teh Hui Kao", "David Scott Gilmour", "Sarah Mary Assmann", "Nina Fedoroff", "Alan G Jones"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Member", "Nina Fedoroff, Committee Member", "Alan G Jones, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HETEROTRIMERIC G PROTEIN IN ARABIDOPSIS"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Peptidylarginine deiminase inhibitors regulate autophagy of human cancer cells and inflammation response of immune cells", "id": "21302", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9714", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In cancer cells, tumor suppressor genes are frequently silenced by enzymes that catalyze epigenetic histone modifications. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), an enzyme that converts Arg or monomethyl-Arg to citrulline in histones, is markedly overexpressed in many human cancers. Previously, researchers in in our lab have found that PAD4 counteracts the function of protein arginine methyltransferase; and thus, alters the transcription status of p53 target genes, suggesting that PAD4 is a potential target for cancer treatment. Furthermore, PAD4 is expressed in neutrophils, and is essential for NET formation induced by bacteria and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this dissertation, I will report the inhibition of the growth of cancer cells by the novel PAD inhibitors my colleagues and I generated. Among those with low micromolar IC50, YW3-56 induced p53 target gene SESN2 (sestrin 2, a negative regulator of mTOR signaling); and thus, inhibited the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway in p53 wild type osteosarcoma U2OS cancer cells. In U2OS cells, PAD4 functions as a co-repressor of p53 to regulate SESN2 expression. However, YW3-56 inhibits the growth of diverse cancer cells in a p53 independent manner. In the p53 mutant breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, YW3-56 triggers a type of cell death distinct from apoptosis, one that shows mitochondria depletion, mTORC1 inhibition, and blocking of autophagy. I investigated the mechanism underlying the growth inhibition effect of YW3-56 in the MDA-MB-231 cells and identified ATF4, a transcription factor in the ER stress pathway, as the novel transcription regulator mediating SESN2 expression. Using YW3-56 as a query tool, I found that ATF4 WAS required for YW3-56-induced SESN2 expression. Forced expression of ATF4 was sufficient to activate SESN2. With the detection of the ATF4 binding site on SESN2 promoter region, we identified the ATF4-SESN2 transcription circuit as a novel link between the ER stress and the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, YW3-56 treatment triggered ROS accumulation in MDA-MB-231 cells, and the YW3-56 induced ATF4 target gene expression was ROS dependent. This finding suggests that ROS might active other factors that cooperate with ATF4 for transcription regulation. In nude mice xenograft experiments, we found that YW3-56 was effective in inhibiting the growth of tumors derived from the MDA-MB-231 subline 1833TR cells. Its antitumor efficiency also correlated with the gene transcription profiling featured a significant induction of SESN2. Taken together, ATF4-SESN2 circuit could be a potential therapeutic target for p53 mutant cancers.

The task is challenging as it requires not only extracting domain concepts from educational content but also identifying the semantic relations among them. \n\n\nThis thesis proposes to perform concept map extraction from high-quality academic resources, such as textbooks and research papers, inside of which more meaningful structures and semantics can be leveraged.

To resolve this, we perform joint optimization for concept extraction and prerequisite relations identification using rich book structures. In the last work, instead of only being interested in the prerequisites, we aim to extract a concept map with multiple types of relationships, such as ``is-a' and ``has-part''. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art concept map extraction result on concept maps, manually created from six textbooks.\n\nLastly, this thesis performs some pilot studies on using the automatically extracted concept map for educational purposes.

As a multi-subunit membrane pigment-protein complex, many factors affect its assembly. Among them three [4Fe-4S] clusters are functionally and structurally essential. Any single cysteine ligand change would result in reduction or complete loss of PS I complex in cyanobacteria. Fe-S cluster assembly is a complicated bioprocess involving several protein factors. So far three Fe-S cluster assembly pathways have been identified, namely NIF, ISC, and SUF. Cyanobacteria are distinguished from other organisms in regard to Fe-S assembly, as it contains four nifS-like homologs representing three possible pathways. slr0387 and sll0704 are iscS-like homologs (ISC), slr0077 is sufS-like homolog (SUF), and slr2143 does not belong to any known Fe-S cluster assembly pathway so far. To investigate which one is involved in Fe-S cluster assembly in PS I, two strategies were applied to start study on the regulation of Fe-S cluster assembly into PS I. 1), pseudorevertant screening of C14SPsaC mutant in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to find regulators of Fe-S cluster assembly; 2), molecular and genetic manipulation on homologous genes encoding components of known Fe-S cluster assembly pathway. For the first strategy, sll0088 was found to be involved in the assembly of C14SPsaC mutant protein into PS I complex by pseudorevertant screening. Amino acid sequence alignment of Sll0088 homologs indicated that Sll0088 contains an HTH DNA binding domain and a unique cysteine motif CX12CX13CX14C. In almost all cyanobacterial genomes sequenced so far, sll0088-like gene is located immediately upstream of a suf gene cluster and divergently transcribed. To investigate if it encodes a transcription regulator, the sll0088-like gene in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was insertionally inactivated. RT-PCR analysis showed that the four suf genes organize as an operon and their transcription was up-regulated in sll0088-like inactivation mutant. sll0088-like was thus renamed sufR (suf repressor). SufR also has other regulons, such as slr0387 (iscS homolog), which is down-regulated in sufR inactivation mutant. SufR protein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified. EPR and M\u00f6ssbauer studies indicated that reconstituted SufR is a [4Fe-4S] protein. The ratio is one Fe-S cluster per dimer. Amino acid substitution study suggested that the 1st, 2nd and 4th cysteine residues in the cysteine motif provide ligands to Fe-S cluster. Replacement of the 3rd one with either serine or glycine resulted in neglectable EPR signal changes and thus this cysteine may not participate in Fe-S cluster ligation. The reconstituted Fe-S cluster is oxygen sensitive. Physiologically, SufR protein may use [4Fe-4S] cluster as a sensor to respond to oxidative stress and iron deficiency, as under both conditions the suf genes were derepressed. The SufR protein was also found to be distributed into two compartments by immunoblot analysis, the majority exists in the cytosol, about one third associates with the thylakoid membrane, suggesting that SufR might be multi-functional. Function of the membrane-bound SufR remains unknown. For the second strategy, we focused on an fdx (ISC) homolog, slr0148 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. It was identified to be the fdx homolog of ISC Fe-S cluster assembly pathway based on amino acid sequence similarity and the finding that recombinant protein can coordinate a [2Fe-2S] cluster. To further demonstrate that slr0148 is the Fdx component of ISC machinery, the slr0148 gene was insertionally inactivated and growth phenotypes of slr0148 mutant was compared with those of slr0387 and sll0704 inactivation mutants under standard, high light, low temperature, and Fe limitation conditions. Their transcription under these growth conditions and oxidative stress condition, together with that of the other two nifS-like gene was also investigated by RT-PCR. We found that the four nifS-like genes were differentially expressed under various conditions, clearly indicating that each NifS-like or in combination played a leading role under certain stress conditions. slr0148 was reported to be involved in a large gene cluster spanning from slr0144 through slr0152 by microarray analyses. Our RT-PCR data indicated that this gene cluster forms a large operon spanning from slr0144 to slr0151. We further confirmed the microarray finding that genes involved in this operon were down-regulated in response to high light, cold shock, H2O2 treatment, and Fe starvation, although there are a few variations in regard to certain genes under some conditions. Functions of the overall gene cluster might be related to photosystem I assembly/turnover. Based on these studies, we concluded that SUF plays a major and essential in Fe-S cluster assembly in cyanobacteria, and ISC is only a backup pathway.

These bulky biomass crops need to be densified in order to reduce costs associated with storage, handling, and transportation.  \n\nHowever, over densification may cause a waste of energy and money. A reasonable volume reduction is needed for an efficient production of bulk densification. In this study, the values of volume reductions were suggested considering various biomass crops and harvesting times. \n\nThe energy consumption of compressing baled biomass with 170 kg/m3 initial density has been studied. However, the energy consumption performance with an initial density lower than 170 kg/m3 biomass material is still unknown. In order to scale up the curve, loose biomass material needs to be tested.\n\nFive cuboid compression chambers with different dimensions were used to test the energy consumption of compressing bulk biomass and to determine the impact of compression chamber size on the energy consumption of compressing bulk biomass materials. The result could also scale up the curve of energy consumption vs. chamber size. Biomass crop samples were collected from fields and cut into different lengths before tests. Crop samples with a certain cut length were filled into a chamber with the same initial bulk density, which were around 40 kg/m3 to simulate the bulk density of windrowed crops in the field.  The relationships between specific energy consumption and compression chamber size were determined. Results indicated that larger compression chamber had significant lower specific energy consumption during the bulk compression process. \n\nThe particle length and particle orientation were also considered while testing on the energy consumption during compression process. Particle lengths indicate the cut length of biomass crop samples. Crop samples were cut into different lengths referred to as particle sizes. For each compression chamber, crop samples were divided into three groups according to the cut length and orientation methods. Group 1 crop samples were cut into the same length with the width of the compression chamber, and all crops were laid flat and arranged parallel to a sidewall of the chamber.  Crops in the group 2 had the same length, but they were randomly laid flat into the chamber.  Crops used for Group 3 were cut into 50-mm (2-in) long pieces, and they were also randomly laid in the chamber. Groups 1 and 2 were used to examine the effect of arrangement methods on the compression process. Groups 2 and 3 were designed to study the effect of particle size on the compression process. Results demonstrated that the parallel arrangement method needed less compression energy; and the biomass with shorter particle sizes had higher specific energy consumption than those longer ones. \n\nThe harvest season of energy crops was also considered as a factor which could impact on the compression energy consumption. Test results indicated that there was no energy consumption difference between 2013 fall and 2014 spring harvested switchgrass.

Autonomous nano- and micromotors have attracted the attention of the scientific community since the initial discovery of the catalytically powered motion of Au-Pt bimetallic nanowires in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution. This particular nanomotor system operates by a self-generated electric field (self-electrophoresis) through asymmetric surface catalytic reactions. However there are two challenges that greatly limit the use of such nanomotors in biological systems: low energy conversion efficiency and poor bio-compatibility of the fuel and the propulsion mechanism. The goal of my research projects is to address these challenges by modifying existing and discovering new nano- and micromotor systems.\n\nChapter 1 provides a general overview of the research field of nano- and micromotor, the challenges within this field, and a concise description of the research projects discussed in this dissertation.\n\nChapter 2 in this dissertation is dedicated to addressing the issue of the low energy conversion efficiency of the Au-Pt nanomotors, which is estimated to be on the order of 10^-9. Four stages of energy loss are identified. A 10^-3 energy is lost due to the non-electrochemical decomposition of H2O2 at the Pt end of the Au-Pt motor, and another 10^-3 energy loss can be partially attributed to the fast diffusion of protons. The electrophoretic propulsion mechanism is found to be intrinsically inefficient, contributing to another 10-3 energy loss, while the electroosmotic flow near the charged substrate further slows down the motor. Efforts are made to improve the energy efficiency. Replacing platinum with the less catalytically active ruthenium increases the energy efficiency, and confining the proton flux with a tubular structure is also a promising way to improve the energy efficiency of catalytic motors. These two modifications combined improved the energy efficiency of bimetallic nanomotors by a factor of 12. A numerical model based on COMSOL multi-physics package provides useful information, and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. The energy efficiency of a few other nano- and micromotor systems is also discussed. A better understanding of the energy loss of nanomotor systems sheds light on future designs of more efficient nanomotors.\n\nThe dynamic interactions and particle assembly phenomena in the bimetallic catalytic nanomotor system are investigated in Chapter 3. Au-Pt nanomotors in H2O2 solutions were found to form doublets and triplets of staggered shapes. A combination of asymmetric pumping and electrostatic interactions between charged ionic clouds around the nanomotors is proposed to explain the binding between two bimetallic nanomotors and the staggered shapes of these doublets. The spontaneous rotation and disintegration of these doublets are attributed to an asymmetric distribution of forces. In addition, bimetallic nanomotors can attract charged microparticles to form close-packed aggregates through electrophoretic attraction. The electrophoretic migration of these charged tracer particles near nanomotors is found to agree qualitatively with simulation results. The effect of particles assembly on the motion of nanomotors is also characterized and discussed.\n\nIn Chapter 4 a new propulsion mechanism for autonomously moving metallic nanomotors is described and discussed. Ultrasonic standing waves operating in the MHz frequency range can be used to levitate, propel, rotate, align and assemble metal microrods (2-3 \u00b5m long and ~300 nm diameter) in water. A self-acoustophoresis mechanism based on the shape asymmetry of the metal nanowires is proposed to explain the axial propulsion of the rods. Furthermore such acoustic nanomotors interact with HeLa cells and with polystyrene microspheres in different ways. The significant binding between metallic microrods and HeLa cells in an acoustic field is attributed to a combined effect of colloidal aggregation at high ionic strength and specific binding on the cell surface. When incubated with gold microrods, HeLa cells show substantial uptake of these gold rods, which remain active inside the cells when exposed to ultrasonic standing waves. The ultrasonically driven movement of the metal microrods and their interactions with live cells open up the possibility of driving and controlling metallic nanomotors in biologically relevant media.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8257], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Ayusman Sen", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Jun Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Chair", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Jun Huang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanomotors", "Numerical simulation", "Energy efficiency", "Ultrasound", "Particle interactions", "Self-assembly"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Performance criteria for control charts", "id": "19935", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "9425", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "% Place abstract below.\nWithin the manufacturing process, Statistical Process Control (SPC) is a powerful collection of problem-solving tools useful in both achieving process stability and improving capability through the reduction of variability. SPC is applied in order to monitor and control a process so that the process can make as much conforming product as possible with a minimum of waste. Arguably, control charts are the most successful tool in SPC procedure. If control chart analysis indicate a stable process, then data from that process can be used to predict the performance of the process in the future. If the monitored process is found to be not in control, analysis of the chart can help determine the sources of variation. Identifying sources of variation will reduce degraded process performance.\n\n\nIncreased demand for control charts has led to more effective use of statistical methodologies, thus improving the quality of a product or a process. Researchers have made great efforts in the advancement of control charts. However, when two or more control charts monitor the same manufacturing process, comparing the control charts becomes a key issue. The performance of control charts is typically evaluated by run length distributions. The run length distribution of a control chart is the probability distribution of run length, which is the number of samples that need to be taken before the chart signals the change in the process.\n\n\nDifficulties exist in the comparison of control charts when using run length distribution as a criterion. For example, it is hard to determine whether a distribution is better than another graphically. Therefore, Average Run Length (ARL), which is the mean of run length distribution, has been accepted instead. However, using the first moment to summarize the entire distribution seems questionable.\n\n\nIn this thesis, we first address whether or not traditionally used ARL can be considered a sufficient criterion. Research results indicate that using the average to present the entire run length distribution is not only less informative, but can also be misleading. Second, we investigate meaningful methods for comparing control charts. Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) is proposed here as a single-number criterion for the performance of control charts. CRPS is applicable when the run length distributions of two compared control charts are independent. The newly proposed score captures the distance from the distribution to zero. As it is shown in this thesis, CRPS could be considered as an ideal measurement when comparing the performance of control charts. The newly proposed score involves straight forward computation and is easily interpreted.\n\n\nWhen comparing the performance of control charts, dependency between the control charts is often overlooked. We have developed a procedure to solve this issue. Paired comparison is proposed in order to directly calculate the probability of which control chart detects the change earlier. The proposed method no longer treats the run length distribution independently, as it is taking the joint run length distribution into consideration. Paired comparison would increase statistical power due to the reduction of potential confounding errors. The proposed procedure is also easy to understand and simple to generalize to any control charts comparison, while taking the dependency into consideration.\n\n\nExamining SPC applications over the past decades, there has been a great demand for a profile control charts. Here the quality of a process or a product is described and summarized by a profile between a response variable and one or more explanatory variables. Monitoring such functional profiles has been a rapidly growing field due to increasing demands. However, the goodness-of-fit for the functional profiles (i.e., how well the model fits the profiles) has not been given proper attention. The project in this thesis intends to explore a method to monitor the goodness-of-fit for profile control charts before using the chart to monitor other features of interest.\n\n\nIn summary, we believe this thesis has solved the issue of how to compare the control charts for different cases. We anticipate that the proposed methods will be useful and meaningful for SPC applications, so that in the future there will be powerful performance criteria available for comparing control charts. We hope that this work will contribute to the development of quality improvement in the field of manufacturing.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9219], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "Le Bao", "Murali Haran", "Russell Richard Barton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Dissertation Advisor", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Chair", "Le Bao, Committee Member", "Murali Haran, Committee Member", "Russell Richard Barton, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Average Run Length", "Continuous Ranked Probability Score", "Functional data", "Goodness-of-fit", "Paired Comparison."]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Regional Estimates of Net Ecosystem-Atmosphere Exchange of Carbon Dioxide over a Heterogeneous Ecosystem\n", "id": "6701", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6626", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    The net ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) is estimated over a mixed forest ecosystem in the 40\u00d740km^2 region centered at the WLEF tall tower in northern Wisconsin. Flux aggregation and the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) budget methods are used. CO2 fluxes measured at three levels of the WLEF tower are decomposed in the growing season to infer the CO2 fluxes for six stand types based on a stand level classification scheme in the tower footprint area. The flux footprint models, vegetation map and eddy-covariance data are combined to estimate the optimal solutions for the parameters in two ecosystem models for each stand type. The results show differences in the parameters and fluxes among the different vegetation classes that are consistent with general expectations for the respective stand types. The inferred fluxes are compared to observations from two stand-level eddy-covariance flux towers, implying that the six stand classification scheme is insufficient to capture all variability in stand characteristics relevant to CO2 exchange. Significant uncertainty in aggregated fluxes exists due to the classification schemes used. In the calculation, a new approximate analytical model is introduced to predict the footprint for flux measurements of passive scalars in the lower part of the mixed layer. An analytical footprint model under the idealized convective boundary layer is adjusted by comparing its solutions to those from a Lagrangian stochastic model with more realistic meteorological conditions. \nThe ABL budget method is used to infer regional NEE by using the vertical profile of CO2 mixing ratios measured at the WLEF tall tower. The estimated regional NEE is close to that measured at the highest level of the WLEF tower in the day. In the nocturnal boundary layer, the cases when the atmosphere is very stable or nearly-neutral are screened out due to possible systematic errors. Regional NEE is generally bounded by the current tower measurements. To estimate the effects of horizontal advection on daytime NEE estimates, a water vapor constraint is introduced, where the range of the effects of horizontal advection of CO2 is estimated by the measurements of the spatial distribution of water vapor. The horizontal advective flux of CO2, a function of wind direction, is estimated to be smaller than 10-20% of the surface flux in our budget calculation on temporal and spatial scales of one hour and 40km.\nRegional NEE estimates from the two methods are compared with each other and with those reported in the literature. In the dormant season, differences among all estimates are relatively small so that NEE measured at the WLEF tower might be an acceptable approximation of NEE in the region (10^3 km^2) and even in a larger region (10^4 to 10^5 km^2) on annual or longer time scales. This, however, is not true in the growing season. The cumulative regional NEE values are -103\u00b150 and -175\u00b160 gC m^-2 in 2000 and 2003, respectively, suggesting that the region is a net sink of CO2. Those values are significantly different from those measured at individual towers. It is inappropriate simply to extend fluxes measured at individual towers to a larger region.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6624], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Weiguo ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Weiguo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis", "John Corry Wyngaard", "Toby Nahum Carlson", "Andrew Mark Carleton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis, Committee Chair", "John Corry Wyngaard, Committee Member", "Toby Nahum Carlson, Committee Member", "Andrew Mark Carleton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aggregation", "regional carbon flux estimates", "atmospheric boundary layer budget", "footprint modeling", "flux footprint decomposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "An investigation of online health support groups: Effects of narrative exposure and social support on the experience of sympathy, self-disclosure and cognitive changes", "id": "11133", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6560", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Online health support groups have been increasingly recognized as useful mediums to communicate health information. Previous studies have found that the use of online health support groups is positively related to psychological and physical well-being. However, little research has been conducted to explain why these benefits happen. This study examined how hypothetical first-time users would respond to messages in an online support group about college stress as an attempt to explore why the online health support group participation is related to many health benefits. \n\nPersonal stories and empathic messages have been identified as two major genres of messages that people could encounter in online health support groups. An experiment with a 2 (narrative exposure) X 3 (social support) factorial design was conducted to examine how people process these messages. Guided by narrative persuasion theories, narrative engagement including transportation and character identification were previously hypothesized as mediating mechanisms of information processing. However, these hypotheses were not supported. Rather, indirect relationships were found between message exposure and changes in health attitudes and behavioral intentions via sympathy. In addition, the study found that exposure to personal stories and observations about how other people provide support encouraged participants to form their own narratives using the support frame, which was also related to positive persuasion outcomes.\n\nThese results demonstrate the potential value of using online health support groups in daily life.

Our lab has established an excellent C. elegans model system to study the developmental roles of NAD+ biosynthesis. Mutation in the C. elegans nicotinamidase PNC-1, the first enzyme in NAD+ salvage biosynthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) causes a spectrum of developmental defects, which are separately related to the PNC-1 biological function of NAM clearance or NAD+ production. \nIn my study, I investigated the tissue specific defects on muscle functions, fat metabolism and gonad development caused by defective NAD+ biosynthesis. Because the live bacterial diet provides NAD+ precursors and possibility NAD+ to support C. elegans growth, the NAD+ biosynthesis defective pnc-1 mutants are more susceptible to dietary changes, and low quality diet induces abnormal fat accumulation and exacerbates gonad developmental delay in pnc-1 mutants.\nI used a metabolomics approach to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effect of defective NAD+ biosynthesis on global metabolism. Although blocking NAD+ salvage from NAM only moderately depletes NAD+ in pnc-1 mutants, it leaves a broad impact on metabolism. Metabolomics data have shown that glycolysis is defective in pnc-1 mutants, which as works of my colleagues pointed out, may be an underlying cause of pnc-1 gonad developmental defects.   \nBesides NAD+ salvage biosynthesis from NAM, salvage from nicotinamide riboside (NR) and de novo NAD+ biosynthesis from tryptophan also contribute to building the NAD+ reservoir in C. elegans. Interestingly, a key enzyme in the de novo NAD+ synthesis pathway is absent from C. elegans genome, nonetheless, metabolites in de novo pathway functions as NAD+ precursors in promoting gonad development. Although endogenous NR salvage and de novo NAD+ biosynthesis are not the major NAD+ source in C. elegans, their activities are important for body wall muscle functions when NAM salvage is compromised.\nIn summary, my work has expanded our knowledge of how NAD+ biosynthesis regulates physiological processes via modulation of NAM and NAD+ levels. I have demonstrated the tissue specific contributions made by different NAD+ biosynthesis pathways. The established metabolomics profile of pnc-1 mutants provides insights into its influence on global metabolism, and my work will help to decipher how metabolic perturbations lead to developmental and physiological consequences.

The validity and efficacy of the strategy are demonstrated by footprinting a labile repressor bound to its operator. Investigation of the inter-nucleosome linker regions in several types of repressed domains has revealed different degrees of protection in cells, relative to isolated nuclei.

The computational complexity of the language measure algorithm is polynomial in the number of DFSA states. An online parameter identification procedure is presented for computation of the language measure parameters.\n\nA discrete event behavior-based multi-robot system has been designed and constructed to validate the language measure theory and its applications to supervisory control in the discrete-event setting. Each robot is equipped with multiple sensors and multiple actuators. The interactions between the robot(s) and the (possibly) dynamically changing environment are characterized by discrete-event and continuous models, and the design and analysis of the robotic system are presented in both continuous-time and discrete event domains. The robustness and reliability of the controlled behavior is guaranteed in the continuous-time domain. For example, visual servoing is applied to robot navigation during `emph{approaching target}' and the vector field historgam (VFH) method is used for robust `emph{obstacle avoidance}'. The discrete event interactions between behaviors are formulated as a supervisory control theory problem, where multiple supervisors are synthesized and implemented online for robot control under different specifications.

Zinc deficiency affects the\nepiphyseal growth plate and thereby impairs longitudinal bone growth in humans and\nanimals. In a zinc deficient state, the width of the growth plate is narrowed and the\nstructure is histologically abnormal. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms for\nthe effects of zinc deficiency on bone formation have not been well-defined.\n     The first objective of this thesis was to investigate the effects of zinc deficiency\non chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in the epiphyseal growth plate\nof juvenile chickens. Newly hatched broiler chickens were fed either a low zinc (10 mg\nper kg diet, or 10 ppm) or a zinc adequate (68 ppm) soy protein-based purified diet. Cell\nproliferation in the growth plate was evaluated with BrdU labeling technique. Apoptosis\nwas assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end\nlabeling method. The results showed that, as early as day 3 of the study, zinc deficiency\nsignificantly inhibited chondrocyte proliferation in the growth plate. Premature\ndifferentiation also occurred in chondrocytes of the proliferative zone, as indicated by\nimmunostaining for osteonectin, a marker for chondrocyte maturation. Furthermore, zinc\ndeficiency caused apoptosis of growth plate chondrocytes. These effects were primarily\nmanifested in the areas remote from the blood supply. In addition, in situ hybridization\nshowed that collagen II mRNA was uniformly decreased in the growth plate due to zinc\ndeficiency. Immunostaining of local growth factors PTHrP and IGF-1 did not reveal any\ndifferences between zinc deficient and adequate tissues at the early stage. By day 7 of the\nstudy, severe growth plate lesions, characterized by reduced cellularity, abnormally\nshaped cells and apoptotic bodies, were formed in areas remote from blood vessels.\nCollagen II mRNA, PTHrP and IGF-1 were greatly reduced in the lesion. However, the\ngrowth rate and food intake of zinc deficient chickens were not different from that of the\ncontrols during the 7 day experiment period. Therefore, zinc deficiency affected\nchondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis independently from long-term\neffects on nutrient intake.\n     The second objective of this thesis was to investigate the influence of maternal\nzinc deficiency during lactation and dietary zinc treatment after weaning on the\nlongitudinal bone growth of young growing rats. Sprague-Dawley dams were fed either a\nzinc-adequate (34 ppm zinc) or a low zinc (4 ppm zinc) purified diet throughout lactation.\nAfter weaning at 22 days postpartum, pups received dietary treatment for another 16\ndays. Pups from zinc-sufficient dams were fed the zinc-adequate diet (Control), while\npups from zinc-deficient dams were divided into 3 groups: one group received a low zinc\ndiet (2 ppm zinc) and the other two groups were fed the zinc-adequate diet with (pair-fed)\nor without (ad libitum-fed) food restriction. Maternal zinc deficiency significantly\naffected the growth of suckling pups. At age of 21days, the average body weight, femur\nlength, and femur dry weight were 30.1 g, 16.0 mm, and 47.4 mg for the pups from zinc-deficient\ndams, respectively, and 56.5 g, 18.9 mm, and 76.3 mg for the pups from zinc-sufficient\ndams, respectively (p<0.05). Furthermore, dietary zinc deficiency after\nweaning completely prevented growth in pups from zinc-deficient dams. Growth of pair-fed\nanimals was also severely impaired. In contrast, the growth rate of ad libitum-fed\nanimals was similar to that of the control animals. At the end of the study, femur length,\nfemur dry weight, and the width of tibial growth pate were significantly lower in zinc-deficient\nand pair-fed rats as compared to ad libitum-fed and control animals. No\nhistological differences were observed in growth plates between zinc-deficient and pair-fed\nrats. In conclusion, maternal zinc deficiency during lactation and dietary zinc\nrestriction after weaning severely impaired the longitudinal bone growth of young\ngrowing rats.

Deregulated expression and/or activation of the Ron receptor has been observed in a variety of pathogenic conditions including cancer, therefore understanding the molecular mechanisms governing Ron receptor activity is of great significance. Recently, the juxtamembrane domain of RTKs has gained increasing attention because of its significant but diverse regulatory role in receptor activation. The studies described herein demonstrate that the juxtamembrane domain of Ron is a crucial regulator of receptor activity. We have identified several critical regions in the juxtamembrane domain which collaboratively mediate Ron receptor autoinhibition. We have characterized the functionally important interplay among different protein segments, and proposed a molecular model of the autoinhibited and active Ron structure. These studies provide a better understanding of the mechanisms governing Ron activation, which will lay the groundwork for the development of novel clinical approaches for the treatment of Ron-related human malignancies. \nAlthough the sequence and structure of the juxtamembrane domain vary greatly among RTKs, a central role for tyrosines in the juxtamembrane domain in regulation of receptor activity has been demonstrated in a number of RTKs. However, unlike other RTKs described to date, tyrosines in the juxtamembrane domain of Ron are inconsequential for receptor activation. Rather, we have identified an acidic JM-C region in the juxtamembrane domain which plays a central role in Ron autoinhibition. We propose that the JM-B region where the tyrosines are located modulates Ron activity indirectly by affecting the steric configuration of the JM-C region.  \nThe JM-D region at the C terminus of the Ron juxtamembrane domain is relatively conserved between family members, and crystallographic studies show that it forms a helical structure in the vicinity of the \u03b1C helix in the kinase N lobe. We have uncovered potential hydrogen bonding linkages between the charged residues in the JM-D and the \u03b1C helix. We propose that these interactions inhibit receptor activity by stabilizing the distorted conformation of the \uf061C helix in the kinase domain. Interestingly, we have also uncovered an essential role for the JM-D helix in promoting receptor activation. We propose that the structural integrity of the JM-D helix and van der waals contacts between hydrophobic residues in the JM-D and the \uf061C helix are indispensable for the kinase activation. As far as we know, this is the first example of a juxtamembrane domain which contributes to both receptor autoinhibition and activation. \nInterplay between the juxtamembrane domain and the kinase domain of Ron is not limited to direct contacts. Studies of the Met and the murine Ron receptor have demonstrated a critical role for the homologous residues of Y1198 in the Ron kinase C lobe. Here we highlight the necessity of an intact Y1198 for Ron activation and show that release of the autoinhibition mediated by the juxtamembrane domain overcomes the essential role of Y1198 in Ron activation. These data suggest that the primary role of Y1198 in the kinase domain is to alleviate the autoinhibition imposed by the juxtamembrane domain.\nBased on experimental data and crystallographic studies of Ron, we have developed a novel and comprehensive molecular model for the role of the juxtamembrane domain in mediating Ron activation. In this model, the JM-C region primarily coordinates with protein segments around the active site including the \u03b1C helix, P loop and activation loop to promote the stabilization of Ron in the autoinhibited state. The JM-D region, by forming intensive contacts with the \u03b1C helix, is a crucial mediator of both the receptor autoinhibition and activation. We propose that phosphorylation of Y1198 facilitates movement of the \u03b1C helix and the closely associated JM-D helix, which in turn promotes displacement of the JM-C region and consequent realignment of the active site for kinase catalysis. \nTaken together, the work presented in this dissertation has unveiled a novel mechanism by which the juxtamembrane domain regulates Ron receptor activity. Our studies also provide a new perspective regarding the regulation of RTK activity by precise utilization of conformational plasticity and the functional cooperation of different protein segments, and may provide a platform for development of the next-generation anti-cancer therapies.

Vertical arrays of Si nanowires with radial p-n/p-i-n junctions decouple the light absorption direction and photogenerated carrier collection direction, which enables the use of lower-quality Si materials without sacrificing device performance. Moreover, vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) technique offers the possibility of growing Si nanowires on inexpensive substrates such as glass or metal foil instead of crystalline Si substrates, which can reduce the cost of Si-based solar cells. The radial junction dark current plays an important role in the photovoltaic performance of these devices because Si nanowire arrays have significantly larger electrically active junction area relative to illuminated area of the solar cell. Previously reported Si nanowire solar cell devices suffer from the high dark current, low open circuit voltage, and low energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms responsible for the high dark current in radial junction Si nanowires and to develop strategies to improve junction properties through optimization of the VLS growth and shell coating processes. \nThis thesis reports on the electrical and photovoltaic properties of individual radial junction Si nanowire devices to evaluate the effectiveness of different nanowire VLS growth and shell coating conditions. A process was developed to fabricate radial p+-n+ and p+-i-n+ junction Si nanowire devices that combines deterministic bottom-up assembly of individual nanowires with conventional top-down device nanofabrication. The effect of the metal catalyst, coating morphology and shell layer passivation were investigated in this research. \nIn chapter 3, VLS growth using Al as catalyst was used to synthesize the p-type Si nanowires. Radial junctions were formed by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) of n+ or i-n+ Si layers on the p-type nanowires. In chapter 4, p-type nanowires were synthesized by VLS growth using Au as catalyst. The n-type shells were deposited by LPCVD at different growth temperatures to investigate the effect of coating morphology and pretreatment conditions on the electrical properties of the junctions. In chapter 5, radial heterojunction with intrinsic thin-layer (HIT) nanowire junctions were formed by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of amorphous hydrogenated Si (a-Si:H) i-n layers on Au-catalyzed VLS-grown p-type wires. The electrical properties and photovoltaic performance of devices fabricated from individual radial junction nanowires were evaluated by current-voltage (I-V) measurement in the dark and under Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) illumination. Variable-temperature I-V measurements were used to analyze the mechanisms responsible for the dark current and to determine the conditions that produce the highest quality radial nanowire junctions for photovoltaic applications. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10115], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Xin ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Douglas Henry Werner", "Tom Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Dissertation Advisor", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Member", "Tom Mallouk, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Radial junction", "silicon nanowire", "Vapor-Liquid-Solid growth", "Al catalyst", "Au catalyst", "Heterojunction thin intrinsic layer"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECT OF SPATIAL SEGMENTATION ON SAFETY PERFORMANCE FUNCTION MODELING", "id": "13766xxw15", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13766", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Building predictive models called safety performance functions (SPFs) is important for the study of roadway safety.

While this approach limits in its ability to improve model transferability, it does help to characterize the extent to which segmentation approaches affect conclusions drawn from the models. In the clustering step of this approach, roadway segmentation is based on a weighted distance between adjacent segments.

Specifically, the effective cleaning and sanitizing of milking system is essential to ensure the dairy product quality and safety. To achieve that, the cleaning and sanitizing of milking system on a dairy farm after the milking event are completed using a highly automated procedure referred as \u201ccleaning-in-place (CIP)\u201d. The chemicals used in the milking system CIP, however, are potentially hazardous to the farmers and the environment. Therefore, novel approaches are needed to solve this problem and further investigate the approaches to optimize the CIP process including investigation of the mechanism of milking system CIP. \nElectrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water is an emerging technology for cleaning processing systems in the food industry and as a cleaning and disinfecting agent. By electrolyzing dilute sodium hydroxide solution within an electrolytic chamber separated by a membrane, acidic EO water and alkaline EO water are generated simultaneously. Previous studies in our lab had already demonstrated the efficacy of using EO water as a potential alternative for the milking system CIP on a lab scale pilot milking system. Using EO water is cost effective once the EO water generator is purchased. Most importantly, it is environmentally benign as compared to the concentrated hazardous typical CIP chemicals.\nBuilding on past studies, this dissertation focused on further evaluating the application of EO water through a real world farm trial and conduct the operational cost comparison between using EO water and conventional chemicals for the milking system CIP. Additionally, another potential alternative to apply EO water was investigated, by combining alkaline and acidic EO water to formulate a blended EO water solution to conduct a one-step CIP on a lab scale pilot milking system. Moreover, a systematic study was carried out of the raw milk deposit removal mechanism during the alkaline and acidic EO water CIP and the optimized blended EO water one-step CIP process by mathematically developing deposit removal rate models for each CIP cycle. \nIn this study, the real world validation of applying EO water on a commercial dairy farm was conducted and the operational cost was compared with that of using the conventional CIP. Results showed that using EO water CIP was performance wise comparable to using the conventional CIP but with a lower operational cost (25%). Additionally, an optimization process was performed to determine the optimal condition for the blended EO water one-step CIP on a lab scale pilot milking system. The optimal condition was found to be a cleaning time of 17 min, a starting temperature of 59\u00b0C and an acidic EO water percentage of 60% in the blended EO water solution to achieve a 100% CIP performance. When comparing the CIP performance of using the optimized blended EO water and the commercially available one-step CIP chemicals, results showed that using the optimal blended EO water solution was as good as the commercially available one-step chemicals and the operational cost of using the optimal blended EO water CIP was only about 20% as compared to the commercial one-step CIP. Moreover, the contribution of each CIP cycle to the entire milking system CIP process was studied on a stainless steel surface evaluation simulator by developing deposit weight based mathematical mechanistic models. A set of raw milk deposit removal kinetic models were developed and validated firstly for the alkaline and acid wash CIP process. Results showed a substantial amount (more than 90% of the initial deposited soil) of deposit removal occurrence during the initial warm water rinse cycle and a two-stage zeroth order deposit removal during the alkaline wash and acid wash cycles. Based on the proposed models, a 55% reduction of the original CIP operational time was achieved, and this is essentially important from an energy saving aspect. To further explore the raw milk deposit removal mechanisms under different CIP conditions, similar experiments were also conducted for the optimal blended EO water one-step CIP and the corresponding models were developed and validated. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the remaining deposit morphology visually on the specimen inner surface. The SEM micrographs served to better understand and explain the deposit removal process during CIP. \nIn conclusion, this study validated the potential application of alkaline and acidic EO water on commercial dairy farms and investigated another possible one-step CIP method on a lab scale pilot milking system with success. Additionally, from the developed raw milk deposit removal models for the CIP procedures, a shortened operational CIP time duration was achieved. It was found that the raw milk deposit removal behaved differently under differently CIP processes, and the contribution of the initial warm water rinse cycle is of great significance in the raw milk deposit removal. Therefore, it is concluded that EO water can be applied as alternative milking system CIP solutions. This project made an effort to answer some fundamental questions for dairy farmers and industries to make an informed decision.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10688], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Xinmiao ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xinmiao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Virendra Puri", "Ali Demirci", "Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Robert F Roberts", "Robert Edwin Graves"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Virendra Puri, Dissertation Advisor", "Ali Demirci, Committee Chair", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Member", "Robert F Roberts, Committee Member", "Robert Edwin Graves, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water", "milking system", "cleaning-in-place (CIP)", "blended EO water", "one-step CIP", "milk deposit removal"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Protecting software from attack and theft via program analysis", "id": "9726", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6713", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Along with the rapid developing software industry and the advent of the Internet, attack and theft are becoming two serious threats to software and software community. Although some attack or theft detection approaches have been proposed, these approaches are limited to meet several highly desired requirements. For example, both attack and theft detection approaches should be resilient to code obfuscation techniques; attack detection approaches should detect new or unknown attacks; software theft detection approaches should be able to detect software component theft.  \n\nIn this dissertation, several new program analysis techniques, which meet these key requirements, are proposed to detect attack and theft. First, a novel program analysis technique called code abstraction is proposed which is a generic method to separate code from data. Based on this technique, an attack detection system called SigFree is designed and implemented. SigFree is signature free, thus it can block new and unknown attacks. Detection effectiveness and performance are evaluated in experiments and the applicability of SigFree is discussed.  Second, a static taint and initialization analyses based approach is presented. Compared with existing\nstatic analysis approaches developed for the same purpose, the new approach is the first one that can detect attack code obfuscated by self-modifying and indirect jump, and a more comprehensive static analysis solution in defending against advanced obfuscation including anti-signature, anti-static-analysis\nand anti-emulation code obfuscation. \nFinally, a system call dependence graph based software birthmark is proposed to identify software theft. A dynamic analysis tool which generates system call dependence graph at run-time is designed and built. We demonstrate the strength of the birthmarks against various evasion techniques, including those based on different compilers and compiler optimization levels as well as state-of-the-art obfuscation tools. Unlike the existing works that were evaluated through toy software, we evaluate our birthmarks on a set of large software. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6709], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Xinran ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xinran", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu", "Sencun Zhu", "Peng Liu", "Guohong Cao", "Zan Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Chair", "Peng Liu, Committee Member", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "Zan Huang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["software security", "software plagiarism detection", "malware detection", "program analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "SPARSE RECOVERY OF TIME-VARING STREAMING DATA USING HOMOTOPY METHOD", "id": "26506", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11308", "abstract_tesi": "Many existing algorithms for regularized least square regression assumes that the true parameters to be stable and not change with time.

For more than a decade, the dominant way for finding exoplanets was using precise Doppler spectroscopy to measure the radial velocity (RV) changes of stars. Today, precise Doppler spectroscopy is still crucial for the discovery and characterization of exoplanets, and it has a great chance for finding the first rocky exoplanet in the Habitable Zone of its host star. However, such endeavor requires an exquisite precision of 10-50 cm/s while the current state of the art is 1 m/s.\n\nThis thesis set out to improve the RV precision of two precise Doppler spectrometers on two 10-meter class telescopes: HET/HRS and Keck/HIRES. Both of these spectrometers use iodine cells as their wavelength calibration sources, and their spectral data are being analyzed via forward modeling to estimate stellar RVs. Neither HET/HRS or Keck/HIRES deliver an RV precision at the photon-limited level, meaning that there are additional RV systematic errors caused by instrumental changes or errors in the data analysis. HET/HRS has an RV precision of 3-5 m/s, while Keck/HIRES has about 1-2 m/s. I have found that the leading cause behind HET/HRS\u2019s \u201cunder-performance\u201d in comparison to Keck/HIRES is temperature changes of the iodine gas cell (and thus an inaccurate iodine reference spectrum). Another reason is the insufficient modeling of the HET/HRS instrumental profile. While Keck/HIRES does not suffer from these problems, it also has several RV systematic error sources of considerable sizes. The work in this thesis has revealed that the errors in Keck/HIRES\u2019s stellar reference spectrum add about 1 m/s to the error budget and are the major drivers behind the spurious RV signal at the period of a sidereal year and its harmonics. Telluric contamination and errors caused by the spectral fitting algorithm also contribute on the level of 20-50 cm/s. The strategies proposed and tested in this thesis will improve the RV precision of HET/HRS and Keck/HIRES, including their decade worth of archival data.\n\nThis thesis also documents my work on characterizing exoplanet orbits using RV data and the discovery of HD 37605c.

Analyzing such on group discussions boosts our understanding of the impact of OHCs as well as the different characteristics of support-oriented interactions. This thesis describes four computational studies that analyze the relationship between linguistic alignment, a universal communication phenomenon, and social support. \n\nFirstly, we introduce a communication phenomenon, linguistic adaptation. Linguistic adaptation in web-based communication means people tend to adjust their language use to one another both in terms of word choice and sentence structure. So far, our understanding of the relationship between linguistic alignment in social support-oriented conversations and its possible connection to member benefits is limited. We quantify linguistic alignment in an OHC at two language levels: word choices and syntactic rules. Our finding results show alignment at both lexical and syntactic level, while the speed of the decay on linguistic adaptation is much slower than previous corpus studies. These different patterns not only can be potentially revealed through alignment theories, but also help researchers understand the unique function of OHCs, i.e. exchanging social support. \n\nAs support seekers play a key role in support-oriented conversations, we focus on how community members provide support to support seekers. We construct a computational model analyzing linguistic alignment between support seekers and support providers in OHCs. Surprisingly, our finding results show that lexical alignment and syntactic alignment have distinct correlations to the support functions. This result makes potential theoretical progress, revealing the relationship between different levels of linguistic adaptation. It also motivates further research regarding potential refinement of computational linguistic theories, such as the Interactive Alignment Model, in other web-based conversations. \n\nWe further analyze how support providers adapted to each other in such interactions. Specially, we study whether latter social support providers are influenced by early support providers. From the theoretical perspective, as adaptation can occur at lexical, syntactic and pragmatic levels, relation between alignment across multiple levels is neither theoretically nor empirically understood. Thus, in this study, we develop a computational model predicting the support choice given the message from early responders using linguistic alignment measures. We find that community members align on social support type. Also, lexical adaptation, not syntactic adaptation, reliably indicates emotional support. These findings can help us understand linguistic signature of different types of social support, as well as the interactive alignment theory.\n\nFinally, we introduce linguistic adaptation phenomenon into a causal relationship inference framework, probabilistic Kripke structure, quantifying the effectiveness of emotional support. We further analyze the framework by examining prima facie causes, and their significance. The result presents that replies with positive sentiment and high alignment score are consistently prima facie causes of resulting positive sentiment of the thread initiator, which means that linguistic adaptation is a temporal causal factor for high level communication.\n\nOur research makes a potential theoretical progress of the mechanism of linguistic adaptation, especially in web-based conversations.

By weaving the original program with Turing machine components, program control flow graph and call graph would become more complex. Moreover, due to the computation complexity of a Turing machine, program execution flow would become much more complicated and resilient to advanced reverse engineering approaches through symbolic execution and concolic testing.\nA prototype tool based on the proposed technique is implemented. Comparing with previous work, the proposed control flow obfuscation technique bears three distinct advantages. 1). Complexity: the complicated implementation of a Turing machine makes it hard for attackers to understand the program control flow struc- ture. 2). Universality: theoretically, Turing machines can encode any computation. The obfuscation is built on top of the LLVM intermediate representation so the application scope is broadened to almost every language with an LLVM front-end compiler. 3). Resiliency: our obfuscation is shown to be very resilient to advanced analysis tools. We have evaluated the method in terms of functionality correct- ness, potency, resilience, stealth, and cost, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed technique can obfuscate programs in stealth with good performance and robustness.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15160], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Yan ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "first_name_ssi": "Yan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dinghao Wu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dinghao Wu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Software Security", "Control Flow Obfuscation", "Turing Machine"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Integration and Characterization of Silicon Nanowire Field Effect Devices\n\n", "id": "7313", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6934", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ability to engineer materials at the nanoscale utilizing a combination of controlled nanomaterial synthesis and self-assembly methods offers the potential to create new electronic devices with improved performance and functionality. Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) provide an ability to utilize the fundamental electronic building blocks that have been developed over a half-century of semiconductor technology and flexibility to integrate a wide choice of materials on a silicon platform. Moreover, semiconductor NWs could be used as an excellent model system for answering fundamental questions related to semiconductor device process integration and electrical transport at the nanoscale. In this thesis, my work on integration and characterization of silicon nanowire (SiNW) field effect (FET) devices is presented. This work provides a basis for understanding process integration and electrical transport in ultra-scaled devices.\nFirst, we describe the synthesis of SiNWs using an Au-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth technique. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies indicate that the SiNWs have single crystal cores that are sheathed with a 2-3 nm thin amorphous native oxide. We developed a general integration process to electrically address individual SiNWs in a global-back-gated test structure with four top-side electrodes. The electrical measurement results of four-point resistance and gate-dependent conductance demonstrate that trimethylboron and phosphine can be used as a source of boron and phosphorus for in-situ p- and n-type doping of SiNWs during VLS growth, respectively.\nSecond, we utilized thermal oxidation of SiNWs to form Si core/SiO2 shell NW for fabricating top-gated SiNW FET devices. Structural characterization on thermally-oxidized SiNWs shows that the interface between the Si core and oxide shell is smooth and the oxide shell is uniform along the length of the NW. The field effect measurements show that thermally-grown oxide shell is suitable for use as the gate dielectric in the top-gated SiNW FET device structure, which has better device properties and stronger gate modulation than the global-back-gated test structure. Furthermore, the large hysteresis commonly observed in the subthreshold properties of the global-back-gated test structure is significantly suppressed in the top-gated FET structure. Both p- and n-channel top-gated SiNW FET devices were demonstrated, which facilitates fabrication of complementary SiNW FETs.\nThird, we successfully synthesized axially-doped n+-p--n+ SiNWs by sequential introduction of n- and p-type dopant gases during VLS. TEM studies show that the length of each segment is well controlled and the transition between n+ and p- is sharp. The characteristics of FETs fabricated using these SiNWs resemble conventional n-channel Si-MOSFETs, which indicates inversion-mode operation with dominant electron transport. Control samples with different S/D configurations fabricated using a global-back-gated FET structure confirm that there is no deleterious n-type overcoating along the p- segment. These results demonstrate the potential to use SiNWs for future nanoelectronic device application or as a model system by engineering the doping profile during VLS growth and taking advantage of various gating structures.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6931], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Yanfeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yanfeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Suzanne E Mohney", "William Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermal oxidation", "silicon nanowire", "field effect device", "vapor-liquid-solid"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Varying-Coefficient Models: New Models, Inference Procedures, and Applications \n", "id": "7602", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6794", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " Motivated by an empirical analysis of a data set collected in the field of ecology, we proposed nonlinear varying-coefficient models, a new class of varying-coefficient models.

To assess the finite sample performance of the proposed procedures, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies to assess the finite sample performance of the procedures. By Monte Carlo simulation, we empirically show the Wilks' phenomenon valid for the proposed generalized likelihood ratio test. That is, we empirically show that the asymptotic null distribution has a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom which do not depend on the unknown parameters presented in the model under the null hypothesis. As new applications of varying coefficient models, we applied some existing procedures for some financial data sets.

While research on molecular motors and artificial muscles has resulted in a number of breakthroughs, one of the most promising recent directions has been the discovery of free-moving catalytic motor systems. Catalytic motors have the potential to operate with a variety of possible fuel-catalyst combinations. In this thesis we report mechanistic studies of catalytic motors that use hydrogen peroxide and other fuels, as well as the observation of pairwise motor interactions in fuel-containing solutions.\n\nIn the mechanistic study, we developed a mixed potential model for the hydrogen peroxide bimetallic nanorod system. This analysis can correctly predict the relative speed and direction of different metal pairings. We applied the same method to the hydrazine fuel system and catalytic micropumps, and those experiments supported a similar electrokinetic mechanism for those systems also. Control experiments with catalytic nanorods that had low electronic conductivity also supported the electrokinetic mechanism.\n\nTo expand the application of catalytic nanomotor systems and to further understand scaling effects we fabricated bimetallic catalytic motors by lithographic methods. These experiments showed that catalytic motors still function in the 10\u00b5m size range and that electrokinetic propulsion is still dominant over inertial mechanisms. Some differences in behavior were observed that may be attributed to artifacts of the fabrication process, such as poor electrical contact between components of the bimetallic motors and poisoning of catalytic surfaces. Lithographically fabricated chiral bimetallic designs led to successful fabrication of rotary motors, which are interesting for the observation of pairwise motor interactions and collective phenomena..\n\nOne of the interesting extensions of catalytic rotor research is the possible interactions and dynamic assemblies brought about by microscale rotating objects, which should operate on different principles compared to centimeter-scale rotary motor systems. We designed and fabricated fast-spinning catalytic rotors based on bimetallic nanorod designs, and our observations have shown various types of interactions between spinning rotors in close proximity, which may be due to a number of different effect. We then constructed a magnetic rotational system involving ferromagnetic nanorods and compared them with the catalytic micro-rotors. Interactions between rotors were again observed, and the potential exists for the formation of dynamic ordered matrices.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6794], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Yang ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Ayusman Sen", "Mark Maroncelli", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Chair", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanofabrication", "electroanalysis", "colloidal science", "microfluids", "microscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "single qubit addressing", "id": "28062", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12289", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Quantum computing--still in its infancy--is approaching a first functional prototype.

Specifically, the first essay investigates the relationship between the use of various types of hog contracts and the performance of the spot market when information asymmetries exist with regard to observability of product quality.  This essay contributes to the existing literature by embedding a principal-agent model of processor-producer behavior within a general equilibrium model of the hog market.  Different from the results in most past studies, this essay concludes that contract supplies raise the expected spot market price and reduce the variance of spot market price under a formula-price contract.  Moreover, this essay finds that both a formula-price contract and a cost-plus contract offer a greater profit to processors and a greater expected utility to growers relative to fixed-price or market-price contacts.  The second essay discusses efficiency of broiler contracts out of concerns of growers\u2019 dissatisfaction with the existing relative-performance contracts.  Specifically, this essay compares various relative-performance contracts with fixed-performance contracts in a dynamic setting, and discusses improvements of the static mixed-type relative-performance contract.  Various theoretical specifications justify the superiority of relative-performance contracts both in a static setting and in a dynamic setting when common shocks dominate idiosyncratic shocks.  In addition, a static two-pooled-tournament relative-performance contract is shown to improve both the processor\u2019s and the grower\u2019s welfare relative to the static single-tournament relative-performance contract.  The third essay investigates the role of growers\u2019 reputation when an agricultural processor designs optimal incentives for better quality products in a two-period dynamic contract.  In a dynamic model with no commitment by both parties, reputation effects embodied in the processor\u2019s posterior probability assessment of the grower\u2019s types (using Bayes\u2019 rule) reinforce the potential well-known ratchet effect.  Based on the optimal dynamic contract with no commitment, the processor offers a direct reputation reward to the grower contingent on his past performance.  This essay demonstrates that the optimal dynamic contract with a reputation reward would outperform contracts where no reputation reward is offered.   \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6870], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Yanguo ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yanguo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Jaenicke", "Spiro E Stefanou", "James William Dunn", "Kalyan Chatterjee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Chair", "Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Member", "James William Dunn, Committee Member", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["relative  performance contracts", "agricultural contracting", "dynamic contracts"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Relationship among Parental Involvement, Socioeconomic Status, and Children's Academic Achievement in China", "id": "26542", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11717", "abstract_tesi": "Using the China Family Panel Studies 2010 wave, the current study examined the associations among parental involvement, socioeconomic status (SES), and academic performance (measured by word recognition) of children age 10 to 15.

At low swirl level, vortex breakdown occurs on the axis, which refers to the formation of a free stagnation point or a recirculation zone on the axis of flow with significant streamwise vorticity. At high swirl level, flow is characterized by a columnar flow reversal driven by centrifugal force. The connection between these two kinds of flow reversals is a critical issue.

However, it is a challenging work to analyze gene expression across two-dimensional spaces, time and environmental state. \n\n\nIn this dissertation, we develop a functional clustering framework based on a mixture model to analyze time-course gene expression. The mathematical aspects of gene expression dynamics have been captured by Legendre polynomial and the impact of environment on gene expression has been considered jointly. We outline a number of quantitative testable hypotheses about the patterns of dynamic gene expression in changing environments and gene-environment interactions causing developmental differentiation. The method is illustrated with simulation studies and application on a real data set from a rabbit hemodynamic study.\n\n\nIn addition, we propose two models for inference of GRN based on gene expression. We reform the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model for identification of GRN to overcome its limitation that evenly spaced measurements is required. The reformed model can accommodate to any possible irregularity and sparsity of time-course expression data by adaptively fitting gene expression curves, followed by a step of interpolating data at missing time points before conducting of DBN analysis. We also develop an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to reconstruct GRNs based on functional clustering of genes. A set of ordinary differential equations are constructed to quantify the dynamic of GRN and the regulatory effects including positive and negative regulation are identified in a regression setting by using Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD)-based variable selection. Both GRN models are equipped with unique power to integrate gene expression data from multiple environments and, therefore, provides an unprecedented tool to elucidate a comprehensive picture of GRN.

The experimental conditions for flames were set at three equivalence ratios (\u03a6) of the fuel jet\u2014\u03a6=\u221e, \u03a6=6, and \u03a6=2\u2014to simulate the soot-rich zones in gas turbine engine combustors. The combination of laser extinction and laser-induced incandescence (LII) was applied to obtain the spatial distributions of soot volume fraction quantitatively. \u201cSmall aromatics\u201d and \u201clarge aromatics,\u201d containing 1-2 aromatic rings and 3-4 aromatic rings respectively, were detected by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). A special configuration of thermocouple probe was developed to obtain the temperature distributions in the soot-free regions of the flames. Experimental results indicated that the PAH and soot from all paraffin fuels are similar, but PAH and soot of the aromatic fuel were much larger than for the paraffin fuels. The amount of soot was found to be higher in aromatic flames than in paraffin flames by a factor of between 2-4. The maximum LIF signals from both small and large aromatics along centerline were found to be approximately ten times higher in the aromatic fuel than in paraffin fuels. Similar results, especially soot volume fraction distributions, was found between JP-8 and the m-xylene/n-dodecane fuel.  \nThe experimental results were compared in detail to simulation results provided by Dr. Katta of Innovative Scientific Solutions, Inc.  Basic consistent distribution trends for each fuel mixture were established with the simulation results. Similar qualitative distributions of soot volume fraction and semi-quantitative LIF signals from aromatic species as well as temperature were found for flames burnt with all fuel mixtures, even though the simulation always displayed large areas of soot and aromatics existing regions. The maximum soot volume fraction along centerline in flames was estimated with values similar to experimental data for paraffin fuels. Several potential explanations were produced for the significant discrepancy of soot distributions in aromatic flames between the simulation and experimental data. Other simulation results, including the distributions of OH and rates of soot nucleation, soot surface growth, and soot oxidation were presented to gain insight into the reasons for the discrepancies between the simulations and the experiment. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11002], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Yefu ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yefu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Litzinger", "Robert John Santoro", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Donald Richards"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Litzinger, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member", "Donald Richards, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fuel", "molecular structure", "co-flow laminar flame", "soot", "aromatic species", "LII", "LIF", "laser diagnostics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "STRUCTURE EVOLUTION, DIFFUSIVITY AND VISCOSITY OF BINARY AL-BASED AND NI-BASED METAL MELTS: AB INITIO MOLECULAR DYNAMICS STUDY", "id": "16083", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8078", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the structure evolution, diffusivity and viscosity of Al80Ni20, Al80Cu20, Al1-xZrx (x=0.4, 0.5. 0.6 and 0.67) and Ni1-xWx (x=0.1 and 0.2) melts through ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) at different temperatures, providing fundamental information in characterizing the glass formability.\nThe structure evolution is characterized in terms of pair correlation function, structure factor, coordinate numbers, Honeycutt-Anderson bond pair and Voronoi polyhedra.

In terms of coverage, they are dramatically different from traditional sensor networks. However, most existing works on sensor networks have been using relatively simple models to characterize coverage and few results can be used to solve the coverage problems in camera sensor networks. One unique property of camera sensors is that different cameras from different positions can form distinct views of the object, and a good coverage often demands views from all around the object. This distinction makes the coverage verification and deployment methods designed for traditional sensor networks unsuitable. Also, as the sensing range of a camera sensor is not disk like but directional, it may steer around to monitor different areas, which brings more flexibility in coverage but also more complex in designing a good scheduling protocol. Meanwhile, emerging applications such as mobile image sensing that is based on camera sensors need to be carefully studied.\n\nThe main purpose of this dissertation is to address new challenges in the coverage problems of camera sensor networks and provide deep insight into many other related issues. First, we define a new coverage model called full-view coverage, which precisely characterize the uniqueness of coverage in camera sensor networks. Under this framework, we design a series of efficient methods for coverage detection, camera sensor deployment (in both random and deterministic environment), and provide rigorous analysis on the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.\n\nSecond, we extend our research into the scenario of barrier coverage. Two important types, i.e., weak barrier and strong barrier coverage have been redefined with the consideration of the aforementioned features of camera sensors. In both cases, the object traversing a monitored field are guaranteed to be detected by the camera sensor networks on its face. While strong barrier coverage allows more flexibility on how the object chooses its path and facing direction, weak barrier coverage demands less camera sensors. For both cases, novel algorithms are proposed to find and construct camera sensor barriers, and the performance is validated by rigorous theoretical analysis and simulations.\n\nThird, we show how to schedule a camera sensor networks with steering capability to minimize service delay (gap). The problem studied is a generic case where directional sensors like cameras can steer around and periodically cover different targets at different time. By driving directional sensors rotate and cover multiple areas, the sensing range can be expanded and the total number of sensors required can be reduced. The proposed optimization problem is proved to be NP-hard and both centralized and distributed protocols are proposed with proved performance bound.\n\nFinally, we expand our study into an application of camera sensors by considering smartphone image sensing. Photos obtained by smartphone users can assist in situations like disaster recovery. A critical challenge here is the mismatch between the huge amount of available photos at the user end and the limited communication and computation resource to transfer to and process the crowdsourced photos at the server. A key is to utilize the metadata associated with each photo including the smartphone camera's parameters and other geographical information, and model the photos' usefulness by utility, similar but more flexible than the original full-view coverage model. Optimization problems regarding trade-offs between resources and photo coverage are introduced and efficient solutions are proposed. Performance of the solutions are rigorously proved. Furthermore, a testbed evaluation and extensive simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8668], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Guohong Cao", "Thomas F Laporta", "Robert T Collins", "Xiaolong Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Dissertation Advisor", "Guohong Cao, Committee Chair", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Member", "Robert T Collins, Committee Member", "Xiaolong Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["camera sensor", "coverage", "network protocol", "mobile sensing", "optimization", "scheduling", "algorithms"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A FIRST-PRINCIPLES STUDY OF STACKING FAULTS AND LONG PERIODIC STACKING ORDER STRUCTURES IN MG AND MG ALLOYS", "id": "19843", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9331", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since the main challenges in developing Mg alloys are to increase their strength, ductility, as well as stability at high temperatures, it is crucial to understand the fundamental properties which affect their mechanical properties.  Formation of stacking faults is fundamental in deformation of materials with the hcp structure such as Mg and Ti alloys, affecting core structures and the mobility of dislocations, twinnability and ductility, and creep rate.  Moreover, long periodic stacking order (LPSO) structures, such as 6H, 10H, 14H, 18R and 24R, play significant roles in enhancing the mechanical properties of Mg alloys and have been largely investigated separately.\n\nIn the present work, contributions of stacking faults, LPSOs and alloying elements to the formation energy, elastic, electronic and phonon properties of Mg and Mg alloys are investigated through the first-principles calculations.\n\nIn pure Mg, the connections among stacking faults and LPSOs are discussed.  Three typical basal-plane stacking faults, i.e. growth fault (I1), deformation fault (I2) and extrinsic fault (EF), are investigated, showing that the stacking fault energy increases in the order of I1 < I2 < EF.  Moreover, through the electron localization morphology, electronic structures of these three stacking faults are revealed in terms of deformation electron density (\u0394\u03c1) and electron localization function (ELF).  These results yield a quantitative description of charge transfer between atoms in and out of the stacking faults.  We also obtain a brief physical correlation between stacking fault energy and the difference of \u0394\u03c1 and ELF between the fault planes and the non-fault planes.  Furthermore, through detailed investigations of deformation electron density, we show that the electron structures of 10H, 14H, 18R and 24R LPSO structures in Mg originate from those of deformation stacking faults in Mg, and their formation energies can be scaled with respect to formation energy and the number of layers of deformation stacking faults, while the electron structure and formation energy of the 6H LPSO structure are between those of deformation and growth stacking faults.  The simulated images of high resolution transmission electron microscopy compare well with experimental observed ones.  In the end, effects of fault layers in SFs and LPSOs on the local phonon density of states and vibrational entropy are discussed together with their specific electronic structures.\n\nIn the binary Mg-X alloys, contributions of 17 alloying elements to the energy and the bond structure of growth, deformation and extrinsic faults are investigated.  In view of electron localization morphology, the bonding structure of Mg around the fault plane can be recognized as the HCP-FCC transformations in short-range.  Together with the specific electron structure of each alloying element, it has been confirmed that bond strength of the fault planes are strengthened by FCC-Al and HCP-Zn since tetrahedrons around alloying elements have more electron density.  Taking Gd and Y as examples, their interactions with faults layers of 6H and 10H LPSO are presented in view of excess energy and deformation electron density.  It has been determined that (i) with the addition of Gd and Y, the excess energy of 6H and 10H can be decreased significantly, indicating that the formability of 6H and 10H LPSO will be increased in Mg-10RE (wt %) alloys; (ii) Gd and Y prefer to occupy the position in fault layers of Mg-10RE with 6H and 10H LPSOs; (iii) since the excess energy will be close to and smaller than that of the pure, the atomic array model can be used in Mg-10Y with 6H and 10H LPSOs, while the atomic cluster model can be used in Mg-10Gd with 6H and 10H LPSO and (iv) the bond strength of the basal plane characterized by \u0394\u03c1 is strengthened around the RE effect zone, while that of prismatic and pyramidal planes will be weakened caused by the electron redistributions effected by the contributions of RE and LPSOs.\n\nIn the ternary Mg-TM-RE alloys, contributions of alloying elements and fault layers to the energy, electronic structure and elastic properties of 6H and 10H LPSOs are discussed through our proposed atomic array/cluster model.  In the view of excess energy, the energetic favorable configurations of the 6H LPSO in Mg98Zn2, Mg98Y2 and Mg97Zn1Y2 (at %) have been estimated via first-principles calculations.  Through the formation of an atomic array of Y forming with Zn occupying its 1st nearest neighbor, the ductility of Mg97Zn1Y2 will be increased and the ratio of B/G is increased from 1.95 of Mg to 2.09.  According to the energetic favorable structure of Mg-10Gd with 6H and 10H LPSOs, effect of TM elements, such as Zn and Zr, on their formability in Mg-10Gd-TM alloys has been estimated.  With the addition of Zn and Zr, the excess energy of the 6H and 10H LPSOs can be decreased significantly when forming the cluster between the TM and Gd, indicating the formability of 6H and 10H will be increased in Mg-Gd-Zr and Mg-Gd-Zn alloys.  Thus, with the addition of TMs into Mg alloys with LPSOs, the excess energy will be reduced to make the structure more stable than Mg alloy without TM.  In view of the deformation electron density and electron localization function, the strengthen mechanism of alloying elements in the Mg alloy is that the basal plane of Mg is strengthened due to the formation of stronger chemical bond between the atomic array and Mg matrix.  With the addition of TMs into Mg alloys with LPSOs, the excess energy will be reduced to make the structure more stable than that of without the TM in the Mg alloy.  \n\nThis work enables quantitative investigations of effects of alloying elements on the properties of Mg alloys.  The understanding of stacking faults and LPSO structures in Mg enables future quantitative investigations of effects of alloying elements on properties of LPSO structures and Mg alloys.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9135], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu", "Zi Kui Liu", "Long Qing Chen", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Suveen N Mathaudhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Suveen N Mathaudhu, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stacking fault", "Long periodic stacking order (LPSO)", "Deformation electron density", "Atomic array/cluster"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Laboratory Estimation and Modeling of Apparent Permeability for Ultra-Tight Anthracite and Shale Matrix: A Multi-Mechanistic Flow Approach ", "id": "13928yyw5108", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13928", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Gas production from unconventional reservoirs such as gas shale and coalbed methane (CBM) has become a major source of clean energy in the United States. Reservoir apparent permeability is a critical and controlling parameter for the predictions of shale gas and coalbed methane (CBM) productions. Shale matrix and tight anthracite are characterized by ultra-tight pore structure and low permeability at micro- and nano-scale with gas molecules stored by adsorption. Gas transport in shale and anthracite matrices no longer always falls into the continuum flow regime described by Darcy\u2019s law, rather a considerable portion of transport is sporadic and irregular due to the mean free path of gas is comparable to the prevailing pore scale. Therefore, gas transport in both anthracite and shale will be a complicated nonlinear multi-mechanistic process. A multi-mechanistic flow process is always happening during shale gas and CBM production, including Darcy viscous flow, slip flow, transition flow and Knudsen diffusion and their proportional contributions to apparent permeability are constantly changing with continuous reservoir depletion. The complexity of the gas storage and flow mechanisms in ultra-fine pore structure is diverse and makes it more difficult to predict the matrix permeability and gas deliverability. \nIn this study, a multi-mechanistic apparent-permeability model for unconventional reservoir rocks (shale and anthracite) was derived under different stress boundary conditions (constant-stress and uniaxial-strain). The proposed model incorporates the pressure-dependent weighting coefficients to separate the contributions of Knudsen diffusion and Darcy flow on matrix permeability. A combination of both permeability components was coupled with pressure-dependent weighting coefficients. A stress\u2013strain relationships for a linear elastic gas-desorbing porous medium under hydrostatic stress condition was derived from thermal-elastic equations and can be incorporated into the Darcian flow component, serving for the permeability data under hydrostatic stress. The modeled results well agree with anthracite and shale sample permeability measured data.\t\nIn this study, laboratory measurements of gas apparent permeability were conducted on coal and shale samples for both helium and CO2 injection/depletion under different stress conditions. At low pressure under constant stress condition, CO2 permeability enhancement due to sorption-induced matrix shrinkage effect is significant, which can be either clearly observed from the pulse-decay pressure response curves or the data reduced by Cui et al.\u2019s method. CO2 apparent permeability can be higher than He at pressure higher than 1000 psi, which may be resulted from limited shale adsorption capacity. Helium permeability is more sensitive to the variation of Terzaghi effective stress than CO2 and it is independent of pore pressure. The true effective stress coefficient can be found two values at low pressure region (<500 psi) and high pressure region (>500 psi). The negative value indicates Knudsen diffusion and slip flow effect have more impact on apparent permeability than Terzaghi stress at low pressure. \nAdditionally, laboratory measurements of gas sorption, Knudsen diffusion coefficient and coal deformation were conducted to break down the key effects that influence gas permeability evolution. Adsorption isotherms of crushed anthracite coal samples was measured using Gibbs adsorption principle at different gas pressures. The adsorption isotherm result showed that the adsorption capacity at low pressure changes with a higher rate and thus brings a significant sorption-induced rock matrix swelling/shrinkage effect. And the isotherm data are important inputs for the Darcy permeability models. The latter was coupled in the apparent-permeability model as the Darcy flow component which involves the sorption-induced strain component. Diffusion coefficients of the pulverized samples were estimated by using the particle method and was used to calculate the effective Knudsen permeability. The Knudsen diffusion flow component in the proposed apparent-permeability model was constructed by transforming Knudsen mass flux into permeability term and used to match the effective Knudsen permeability based on diffusion data. Increasing trends for all results were performed during pressure drop down in the result plots. And the modeling result showed very good agreements with them, giving a solid proof of the availability of Knudsen diffusion component as part of the proposed model. The results of a series of experimental measurements of coal deformation with gas injection and depletion revealed that the coal sorption induced deformation exhibits anisotropy, with larger deformation in direction perpendicular to bedding than those parallel to the bedding planes. The deformation of coal is reversible for helium and methane with injection/depletion, but not for CO2. Based on the modeling results, it was found that application of isotropic deformation in permeability model can overestimate the permeability loss compared to anisotropic deformation. This demonstrates that the anisotropic coal deformation should be considered to predict the permeability behavior of CBM as well as CO2 sequestration/ECBM projects.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15316], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shimin Liu", "Shimin Liu", "Derek Elsworth", "Zuleima T.

The ground deformation, caused by caving of the ground behind longwall panel can generate large horizontal displacements and complex stress change in subsurface rock above and to some extent below the coal seam. The deformation and variation of the stresses in subsurface rocks can trigger ground movement which causes casing failure, and thus interruption in operation of the well, need for shutting down the well for repair, or permanent abandonment. Either way, the wellbore failure imposes economic losses to gas well operators while posing a safety risk to miners and mining operations as the gas could be released in underground workings. Thus, it is critical to study the ground movements caused by longwall mining and characterize the parameters related to the mining process to evaluate the changes in ground stresses / strains in different layers to evaluate the wellbore stability under such conditions. The main propose of this study is to develop a general casing design guideline in such areas that can withstand the potential deformations and assure wellbore stability. \nTo estimate the variation of stresses and strain in the ground surrounding the longwall panel finite element analysis modeling was used.  The model included the geometrical design of the longwall panel including the depth, length of the panel, proper size pillars for a three entry system that is comparable to the current and future practice in south west Pennsylvania as well as West Virginia and Ohio.  The model simulated the complex ground condition associated with longwall mining areas and quantified the factors affecting the wellbore stability, such as induced stresses and ground movements. \nThe output of the numerical modeling of the longwall mining and related stress and strain calculation for the pillars and upper strata was used for developing a proper casing design according to API guidelines.  The results indicate that the controlling parameter in wellbore stability is horizontal strain, and resulting deformation and ground displacement at certain depths above the coal seam. The modeling of the coal seam at depths of 100, 200, and 300 m shows that the maximum horizontal stress occur at X, Y, Z m above the coal seam, respectively.  The magnitude of the maximum horizontal strain was estimated to be around 10-2, corresponding to displacement of about 100mm per 10 m long casing.  Total deformation of about 250-350 mm was also estimated based on the modeling but the values used for design purposes was restricted to 100 mm due the lack of field observation of such high values of horizontal deformation.  The review of literature shows that despite possibility of high horizontal displacement in such scenarios, the observed values in the field are typically within 150-200 mm even in extreme conditions and mostly below 100-150 mm.\nA casing design model based on spreadsheets was developed to carry out appropriate combination of casings.  The design procedure was based on API guidelines and Pennsylvania department of environmental protection (PA-DEP).  The wellbore completion was then performed using the values of strain and deformation obtained by the ground modeling. The output of the program included a wellbore completion design for 5 layer casing design, which included the collar, water, two layers of protection and the production casing to assure stability of the wellbore casing after mining activities.  The results were compared to the current practice in wellbore design in south-west PA and the designs proved to be compatible.

The first chapter examines the ability of government bond fund managers to time the market, based on their holdings of Treasury securities during the period 1997-2006. We find that, on average, government bond fund managers exhibit significantly positive timing ability at the one-month horizon, under a holdings-based timing measure. In particular, fund managers specializing in Treasury securities are more likely to better time the market than general government bond fund managers. We also find that more successful market timers tend to have relatively higher Morningstar ratings, larger fund flows, lower expense ratios, higher Sharpe ratios, and higher concentrations of holdings of Treasury securities. \n\nIn the second chapter, we study whether mutual fund managers successfully time market liquidity.  Using a model assuming that fund managers attempt to maximize fund shareholders\u00a1\u00af utility by timing market exposure, we motivate liquidity timing from the fund manager\u00a1\u00afs perspective.  Fund managers reduce market exposure in illiquid markets and increase market exposure in liquid markets.  Relative to survivors, the negative performance of non-surviving funds is emphasized when the model includes market wide liquidity indicating that liquidity timing is an important component in evaluating the performance of active fund managers.\n\nIn the third chapter, we study the dynamic relation between aggregate mutual fund flow and market-wide volatility. Using daily flow data and a VAR approach, we find that market volatility is negatively related to concurrent and lagged flow. A structural VAR impulse response analysis suggests that shock in flow has a negative impact on market volatility: An inflow (outflow) shock predicts a decline (an increase) in volatility. From the perspective of volatility\u00a8Cflow relation, we find evidence of volatility timing for recent period of 1998\u00a8C2003. Finally, we document a differential impact of daily inflow versus outflow on intraday volatility. The relation between intraday volatility and inflow (outflow) becomes weaker (stronger) from morning to afternoon.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6793], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jingzhi Huang", "Jean Helwege", "James Alan Miles", "Quang H Vuong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jingzhi Huang, Committee Chair", "Jean Helwege, Committee Member", "James Alan Miles, Committee Member", "Quang H Vuong, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Market Liquidity", "Portfolio Holdings", "Government Bond", "Market Timing", "Mutual Funds", "Market Volatility"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DEVIANCE AND TRANSGRESSION: \u201cMONSTRUOUS\u201d BODIES IN\n NINETEENTH CENTURY WOMEN\u2019S FICTION  \n\n\n", "id": "12156", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6935", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates how representations of disabled figures function in nineteenth-century women\u2019s novels. From a feminist perspective, considering Disability Studies in socio-cultural and literary contexts, I examine four works of fiction to probe the relation between and among representations of disability, gender and women\u2019s writing. My corpus includes Anatole (1815), Olivier ou le secret (1822), Monsieur le Marquis de Pontanges (1835) and Laide (1878), written respectively by Sophie Gay, Claire de Duras, Delphine de Girardin and Juliette Lamber. The goal of this project is to show that the transgressive potential of the disabled body operates as a destabilizing element that challenges the so-called norm in terms of body, sexual relationship and narrative structure. By incorporating in their writing the disabled figure\u2014bearer of corporeal deviance, women writers transfigure the social reality and question the hegemony of the \u201cnormate\u201d that excludes disabled people as well as women. In this sense, the representation of disability should be considered as a strategy of emancipation that women writers incorporate in their writing activity.\n Since the 1970s, although much research on women\u2019s literature explores how difference and identity are represented in such politicized constructions as gender, race and sexuality, feminist criticism has generally overlooked the physical or mental otherness we think of as disability that women writers evoke in their works.

This study conducted interviews with solar PV practitioners representing various business sectors, and performed a time and motion study on large-scale projects to identify key actors that affect PV installation costs. This data enabled the identification and assessment of key factors such as crew sizing, tool/equipment selection, prefabrication and PV module size, which contributed to the design of an analytical tool for the planning of large-scale solar PV projects. 3D computer simulation tools embedded with schedule data (4D simulation tools) are proposed to assist communication and visualization of plans and planning decisions.  The analytical tool supports the evaluation of project specific variables which need to be reconciled in the planning process.

Techniques used in Lean Production in the AEC Industry and Short Interval Production Schedule are presented to demonstrate the opportunity in optimization of the installation procedure of large-scale PV projects through selection of various module dimensions. An example of application of the analytical tool is presented in which the impact of using large-format PV modules is compared with using normal-sized PV modules during on-site installation of a large-scale PV system.

The relative high dielectric constant (~4.2) and high breakdown strength (800MV/m) yield the released energy density as high as 12J/cm3 at room temperature. TGA and dielectric measurement show the material has a good thermal stability up to 200oC. High temperature characterizations demonstrate the material has a high breakdown strength (>500MV/m) and high released energy density (>6 J/cm3) even at high temperatures such as 180oC. \nThe properties of aromatic polyurea films highly depend on the composition ratio between two monomers, diphenylmethane-diisocyanate (MDI) and diphenylmethane-diamino (MDA). MDA-rich polyurea has been reported to exhibit a dielectric constant as high as 15 with low loss to temperatures above 150oC. Surface morphology study with SEM and AFM revealed that the apparent high-k in MDA-rich polyurea films originates from the non-uniformity of its thickness and erroneous interpretation of the data rather than from its intrinsic properties.  \nThe new P(VDF-HFP) 10wt% copolymer exhibits a high transverse piezoelectric response with both high piezoelectric d31 (d31=43.1pm/V) and electromechanical coupling k31 coefficients (k31=0.187) under quasi-static condition.

These methods, which include MAP and MMSE-based \ndecoders, estimate the sequence of encoded source\nsymbols based on statistical knowledge of both the channel and the\nencoded source.   Generally, these techniques are based on a Markov model\nfor the quantized source and, thus, on a hidden Markov model for the source-channel\ntandem.  The number of states in the hidden Markov\nmodel, and thus the computational and storage complexities, grow \nexponentially with the order (K) of the Markov model, i.e., the\ncomplexity order is O(N^{K+1}T), with N the number of source quantization levels\nand T the length of the data sequence.  Thus, to retain implementable\ncomplexity, low order models (K=1,2) are typically used, at the expense\nof model accuracy. \nIn this thesis, we propose methods to bridge the performance-complexity\ngap, i.e. to provide solutions that give better \nperformance than a low order decoder while incurring only modest\nincreases in complexity.  We first propose using improved iterative scaling(IIS) algorithm\nto learn the maximum entropy a posteriori probability from a large group of pairwise constraints.\nThis significantly reduces the training set size required in direct model learning via frequency counts to avoid the overfitting problem.\nHowever, the high computational complexity is still unavoidable with high order model.\nTherefore, we suggest using neighboring noisy symbols in conditioning to incur only modest computational complexity increase compared to a low order model.\nWe further applied the idea of using IIS to approximate high order conditioning in conditional entropy constrained encoding context.\nWe then propose a second approach.\nThis second decoding approach consists of two stages: 1) low order JSC \ndecoding, followed by 2) a linear FIR filtering of the JSC decoded\nsignal.  The linear filter is chosen to provide an optimal (least\nsquares) estimate of the original source.  This approach provides an\napproximate way to increase the effective order of the decoder, yet\nwhile retaining quite manageable complexity.  The new approach is\ndemonstrated to significantly improve upon standard MMSE-based \nJSC decoding performance, both for the case of nonpredictive source coding\n(e.g. vector quantization) as well as for predictive source coding (DPCM).   \nIn our third approach, we tried to model the source sequence as a hidden Markov model whereas\na Markov model is commonly used.  This approach provides a source model which achieves\ninfinite memory while a Markov source model only has finite memory.\nThis translates to lower source entropy and better decoding performance compared to a SAMMSE decoder with comparable\nmemory complexity, although our computational complexity is higher.\nAs an extension, we also tried to model the source data as Markov random field with our sequence based mean field annealing method as the joint source channel decoder.\nThis method relaxes the independence between pixels assumptions in the standard mean field\nannealing by assuming the independence is only between the rows of a image.  By introducing more dependency between symbols into our source model, we further\nutilize this dependency to combat the noisy channel.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6868], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Yu-wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yu-wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Jonathan Miller", "John F Doherty", "John Metzner", "Natarajan Gautam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Jonathan Miller, Committee Chair", "John F Doherty, Committee Member", "John Metzner, Committee Member", "Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["high order", "joint source channel decoding", "Markov model", "reduced complexity", "bridging techniques", "overcome model overfitting problem"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Essays on Credit Risk and Corporate Governance", "id": "15128", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7577", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis seeks to understand the driving factors behind the 2007 and 2008 financial market turmoil by considering two aspects: the behavior of the management and liquidity risk.

In Chapter 5 I investigate the intercalation of hexagonal boron nitride and graphite using Bronsted acids such as H3PO4. DFT calculations show that dipolar interactions between acids molecules and the 2D sheets drive the intercalation process.\n\nIn Chapter 6 I study stripe patterns of W and Mo atoms in triangular monolayers of WxMo1-xS2 alloys. DFT calculations suggest that stripe ordering is kinetically driven, governed by fluctuations in local thermodynamic conditions during growth. In addition, I show that the striped phase alloy is electronically isotropic but vibrationally anisotropic, due to the nearly-identical electronic properties but very different atomic masses of Mo and W.\n\nThe third part is devoted to computation of vibrational and optical properties of molybdenum and tungsten disulfides. In Chapter 7 we investigate the optical signatures of defect-bound excitons in monolayer WS2. I show that the optical transitions between the highest valence band and mid-gap states introduced by sulfur vacancy defects have finite transition matrix elements. These results agrees with the measured photoluminescence spectra of monolayer WS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition, where spatially resolved photoluminescence at low temperatures revealed two bound excitons. To explain the anomaly in the thermal activation energy of the bound exciton, we propose that excitons are bound to negatively charged defects where two channels of radiative recombinations are allowed.\n\nChapter 8 focuses on intervalley scattering processes in monolayer MoS2, as probed by resonance raman spectroscopy, where the incident laser energy is varied across the A and B excitonic levels. We focus on two Raman peaks that are dispersive, a clear signature of second-order processes involving intervalley scattering. Using group theory and DFT calculations, selection rules are established for intervalley scattering processes \nmediated by acoustic phonons. \n\nIn Chapter 9 I investigate Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) in monolayer WS2.  Its second order nonlinear susceptibility is nearly three orders of magnitude larger than other common nonlinear crystals. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the origin of the large nonlinear susceptibility lies in resonance enhancement and sharp features in the joint density of states.\n\nIn the final part, I explore possible methods of manipulating the geometry and grain texture of 2D materials. In Chapter 10 I show that when an atomically thin two-dimensional crystal grows on a substrate of non-zero Gaussian curvature, it can develop finite-length grain boundaries that terminate abruptly within a monocrystalline domain. By properly designing the substrate topography, these grain boundaries can be placed at desired locations and at specified misfit angles, as the thermodynamic ground state of a 2D system bound to a substrate. New properties specific to certain grain boundary geometries, including magnetism and metallicity, can thus be engineered into 2D crystals through topographic design of their substrates.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12648], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Yuanxi ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuanxi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado", "Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi, Dissertation Advisor", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Chair", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["two-dimensional materials", "density functional theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "MECHANISTIC STUDY OF ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE AND NEUROD1-MEDIATED IN VIVO CELL CONVERSION", "id": "15287yuw136", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "15287", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nerve injury often results in the disruption of neuronal circuits and loss of neurological functions [1]. However, adult mammalian brains lack self-repair capability [2]. While a small subset of neural stem cells have been discovered in the adult brains, they are not sufficient to repair damaged brains. [3].\nBesides injuries of the CNS, neurodegenerative disease can also damage the brain functions and severely impact the quality of life of patients. Particularly, the Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is now the 6th leading cause of death in the United States [4]. AD is typically characterized by abnormal molecular and cellular changes such as accumulated extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, neurodegeneration, activated astrocytes and microglia, and enhanced immune responses. In addition, behavioral changes involving learning and memory deficits are also observed in AD patients. The lack of effective therapies places a heavy burden on society, with increasing urgency to find a solution due to an extended life span in modern society [5, 6].\nCurrent explorations of potential therapeutic methods cover multiple directions: (1) Amyloid-\u03b2 or tau antibodies; (2) in vivo cell conversion; (3) cell transplantations; (4) small molecule cocktail intervention; (5) deep brain stimulation; (6) innate inflammatory regulation. However, Amyloid-\u03b2 or tau antibodies faced a series of failures in clinical trials that has shaken the foundations of the \u201camyloid theory\u201d and \u201ctau theory\u201d. Therefore, great efforts need to take place on the investigation of the other potential strategies for an effective AD treatment.\nRecent studies [7], including our own, demonstrated that astrocytes can be directly converted into functional mature neurons in vitro [8, 9] and in vivo [8]. Ectopic over-expression of the cell fate determinant transcriptional factors and small molecule cocktail application, therefore, serve as promising strategies for possible in vivo interventions for AD. \nHere we report the short-term and long-term beneficial effects of NeuroD1-mediated astrocyte-to-neuron conversion in the brain of an AD mouse model 5xFAD. The reactive astrocytes can be effectively converted into morphological and functional mature neurons within one month. The short-term beneficial effects of NeuroD1-mediated cell conversion include the amelioration of abnormal hypertrophic reactive astrocytes, reversal of neuronal loss by regeneration of new neurons, together with reduced intracellular amyloid-\u03b2 peptides. Long-term beneficial effects include an increased neurites such as axons and dendrites and augmented synaptic density, well-preserved myelination, and better integrity of blood vessels in the AD mouse brains. \nTo achieve a more comprehensive therapy for AD, we also tested the effectiveness of a small-molecules cocktail to promote adult neurogenesis in AD brains. Our observation revealed a novel chemical drug recipe as a potential candidate for treating AD. \nBesides the development of the two potential therapeutic strategies, our mechanistic research on the AD mouse model revealed that GAD67 may be involved in the modulation of the pathological procession of A\u03b2. Therefore, GAD67 may serve as a new drug target for future clinical study.\nIn summary, our work has investigated the beneficial effects induced by a novel technique of ectopic over-expression of NeuroD1 in focal region of the AD mouse brain for in vivo reprogramming of reactive astrocytes into functional neurons.

The recent development of advanced oxidation (AO) technologies offers these foundries great opportunity to achieve both pollution prevention and material conservation. An AO system (Sonoperoxone\u2122, Furness-Newburge, Versailles, KY) has been incorporated into the conventional foundry process on 22-30 production line that together have the capacity to manufacture about 10-15% of the cast iron in America. The AO systems condition the water that is used in the molding process by coupling ozone, hydrogen peroxide, ultrasonics, and (optionally) underwater plasma. The AO process can reduce air pollutant emission by 20-75% and diminishing clay and coal consumption by 20-35% in these foundries. While the empirical effects of AO on pollution prevention and material conservation have been known for several years, the mechanisms behind these effects are not well understood. In that light, this research appraised the fundamental engineering and science underlying the AO process, and sought to better understand the mechanisms by which the AO process diminished the air pollutants and raw material consumptions. \nIt was discovered that AO processing greatly enhanced the reclamation of clay and coal from baghouse dust. The ultrasonic component of the AO processing effectively separated the clay and coal particles from the sand fines, thus allowing the clay and coal to be recycled for reuse. The ultrasonics also considerably decreased the particle size of the clay by delaminating the clay into more discrete platelets; and this improved the bonding efficiency of a given amount of clay. Surface elemental analysis revealed that AO processing effectively displaced pyrolytic residues of carbonaceous additives that typically accumulated on the clay surface. This restored the damaged foundry properties of the clay and decreased the requirement of new makeup clay addition. \nAO processing was found to considerably affect the pyrolysis behavior of the coal composition of the green sand. The AO conditioned coal released less mass and emissions than the non-AO conditioned coal during pyrolysis. In addition, more activated carbon was generated from the coal when AO processing was employed in the casting process. Both the AO-enhanced activated carbon generation, plus the AO-incurred clay surface cleaning provided the AO conditioned green sand with higher pore volume, and thus higher adsorption capacity for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The results reported herein conformed to full-scale foundry empirical finding that when AO is used, foundries need less makeup clay and coal addition through each casting cycle, and they release less air emissions.\nThe author also appraised the emissions character of several carbonaceous additives that could be use in green sand foundries. Of the three coal types evaluated, anthracite released fewer volatiles than did lignite or a highly volatile bituminous coal (seacoal). Cellulose released considerably more volatiles than any of the coals when it was flash pyrolyzed in a Curie-point pyrolyzer. However, when cellulose was gradually heated, it released far fewer volatiles. This means that if cellulose were to be used in a green sand mold, it would release volatiles where they are needed at the molten metal-mold interface, but volatiles would not be released much at further distance from this interface that gradually heats. This characteristic of the cellulose offers an important opportunity for the foundries to diminish their air emissions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6873], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Yujue ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yujue", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon", "Robert Carl Voigt", "Sridhar Komarneni", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon, Committee Chair", "Robert Carl Voigt, Committee Member", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["advanced oxidation", "green sand foundry", "air emission", "clay", "coal"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Analysis of Transient Phenomena in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells\n", "id": "7049", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6933", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dynamic characteristics of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC) are of paramount importance for the automotive applications, given the rapid variation of loads.  First, a three-dimensional single-phase transient model is developed, based on the constant-flow assumption, to study the transient dynamics of PEFC operations.  To justify the validity of the constant-flow assumption, a complete single-phase model, fully coupling the flow, species transport and electrochemical kinetics, is presented to explore flow physics in a PEFC.  Comparison of the numerical results demonstrates that the constant-flow assumption is valid with the maximum error of 14%.  \nIn addition, various time constants are estimated for important transient phenomena of electrochemical double-layer discharging, gas transport through the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and membrane hydration/dehydration.  It is found that membrane hydration/dehydration occurs over a period of 10 seconds, the gas transport of 0.01-0.1 second, while the double-layer discharging is negligibly fast.  The numerical results show that the time for fuel cells to reach the steady state is on the order of 10 seconds due to the membrane hydration/dehydration.  In addition, a step increase in the current density leads to anode dryout due to electroosmotic drag during transients, while it takes several seconds for water back-diffusion and anode humidified gas to re-wet the anode side of the polymer membrane.  The anode dryout results in a substantial drop in cell voltage and hence temporary power loss. Under extreme situations such as dry anode feed, large step-increase in the current density and/or lower temperatures, the cell voltage may even reverse, resulting in not only power loss but also cell degradation. \nTo extend the work to two-phase transients where liquid water appears and drastically alters the dynamic behaviors of a PEFC, a steady-state model fully coupling the two-phase flow, species transport, heat transfer, and electrochemical processes was first developed to predict the liquid water distribution and flooding under non-isothermal conditions.  Water condensation or evaporation and its impact on the PEFC operation are fully accounted for.  A theoretical analysis is presented to show that in the two-phase zone water transport via vapor-phase diffusion under the temperature gradient is not negligible and comparable to the water production rate in PEFCs.  The ensuing heat pipe effect increases about 15% thermal conductivity in the GDL. \nFinally, based on the non-isothermal two-phase analysis at steady state, a transient model further considering various transient terms is developed to study the dynamics of GDL de-wetting and its impact on PEFC performance.  It is found that the de-wetting of fuel cells by dry gas is characterized by several regimes of different time constants.  These regimes can be defined fundamentally by through-plane drying versus in-plane drying as well as the differing water diffusivity between the anode and the cathode.  The differing time constants of various de-wetting regimes also impact the evolution of cell voltage due to the Ohmic loss in the membrane.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6930], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Yun ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Vigor Yang", "Matthew M Mench", "Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Vigor Yang, Committee Member", "Matthew M Mench, Committee Member", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer electrolyte fuel cell", "fuel cell", "transient", "dynamic response", "computational model", "energy conversion"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Study of Iron Carburization in CO-based gas mixtures \n", "id": "7698", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6983", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Experiments were conducted using resistance a relaxation method to study iron carburization for different temperatures and gas-phase mixtures compositions.

In numerous investigations of the postural control system, it has been found that, the coordination and control of posture and balance is simplified by employing different strategies for postural stability.  For example, strategies may utilize the ankle joint alone (i.e., inverted pendulum model), ankle-hip coordination (i.e., double inverted pendulum model) or multi-joint synergy (i.e., multi-linkage model).  Even though the postural control mechanism has been comprehensively documented by investigations of EMG, kinematic and kinetic data, there are limited data on the investigation of the inter- and intra-foot coordination dynamics in quiet stance.  \nThe primary focus of this dissertation is on the center of pressure (COP) foot coupling under the varying mechanical and task constraints induced by different stances.  We investigated: 1) how foot position and asymmetrical body weight distribution interact to influence postural control and inter-foot coordination; 2) the effect of foot position and orientation on the body weight distribution and the foot coordination dynamics of standing postures; and 3) the influence of a shortened support surface together with its orientation on the COP coordination in quiet stance. \nThree experiments were conducted that manipulated foot position, foot orientation and the base of support properties in quiet standing.  The following conclusions have been reached from the analyses of the individual foot COPs and the coupling between COPs: 1) The time evolutionary properties of the inter-foot coordination dynamics revealed patterns of \u201cstable\u201d but \u201cflexible\u201d control of the postural system as a function of foot position and orientation.  In particular, the staggered stance represents a \u201chybrid\u201d blend of the properties of the side-by-side and tandem foot position in both linear and nonlinear analyses.  2) Foot position played a more important role than its orientation in channeling the inter- and intra-foot coordination dynamics.  When the postural stance was challenged by the limitation of the base of support (side-by-side and tandem stances), the COPs in the unstable plane (inter-foot coordination) were predominantly involved in postural control.  In contrast, when standing posture was not challenged by the support boundary (staggered stance), the COPs of the more loaded foot (intra-foot coordination) dominated postural stability.  3) When the shortened base of support was oriented along the horizontal axis, the four COP time series revealed a parallel contribution indicating an inter-dependence of the inter- and intra-foot coordination.  When the shortened support area was positioned along the longitudinal axis, the COPs in the sagittal plane (inter-foot coordination) displayed a more significant contribution to postural stability. \nMultistability exists at different levels of the motor control hierarchy (Braun and Mattia 2010; Kelso 2012).  The \u201cphase wandering\u201d of the inter-foot coordination dynamics presented in Experiment 1 reflects the multistability properties of the postural control system.  The phase synchronization of the COPL\u2014COPR coupling characterizes the capability of the self-organizing system to retain its intrinsic attractive states (i.e., stability) whereas the phase transition specifies the escape or de-affiliation tendencies of the system from an attractive steady state.  Overall, our findings support the proposition that postural control is achieved through the foot coordination dynamics and the asymmetrical body weight distribution.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8644], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Zheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell", "Karl Maxim Newell", "Semyon Slobounov", "John Henry Challis", "David Russell Hunter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell, Dissertation Advisor", "Karl Maxim Newell, Committee Chair", "Semyon Slobounov, Committee Member", "John Henry Challis, Committee Member", "David Russell Hunter, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Foot coordination", "Postural control", "Quiet standing"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF DC-TO-DC CONVERTERS AS DISCRETE-TIME PIECEWISE AFFINE SYSTEMS\n", "id": "22484", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9880", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A boost dc-to-dc power converter has been among the application examples in several recent publications on stability analysis of piecewise affine systems (PAS).

(1952) received a patent for their development of an oil recovery method by CO2 injection.  Since then, CO2 flooding for secondary and tertiary oil recovery has developed greatly leading to more incremental oil recovery worldwide due to high displacement efficiency and low cost.  Thus far, gas flooding is the most widely used EOR methods even over thermal methods, primarily because CO2 is able to develop multiple contact miscibility with light crude oil at relatively low reservoir pressures.  CO2 flooding also has the potential for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by subsurface sequestration of CO2.\n\nMany papers have reported that minimum miscible pressure (MMP) decreases with a reduction in temperature.

We have performed waterflood and CO2 injection at two different temperatures, one below the initial reservoir temperature and the other one equals to the reservoir temperature.  The results show that performing a waterflood at cooler temperatures rather than performing the waterflood at reservoir temperature can lead to substantial cooling and improved incremental recovery (about 15 to 23% OOIP with cooling versus 4 to 22% without cooling for homogeneous reservoirs with no heat gain from the surroundings).  When heterogeneity and heat transfer with surrounding formations are considered, the incremental oil recoveries are substantially less, although still significant.

The chemistry involves a chain transfer reaction to a styrenic derivative (St-f), with or without hydrogen during propylene polymerization, using an Exxon-Hoechst C2-symmetric catalyst (rac-Me2Si[2-Me-4-Ph(Ind)]2ZrCl2/MAO complex) or a Mitsubishi C1-symmetric catalyst (Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind(2-Me-4-Ph-4HAzu)HfCl2 with MAO or trialkylaluminum-treated clay). In the presence of the Exxon-Hoechst catalyst, the propylene propagating chain-end engages in a facile consecutive chain transfer reaction, reacting with St-f and then with hydrogen, with high catalytic activity under the proper reaction conditions. The polymer molecular weight is proportional to the molar ratio of [propylene]/[St-f]. A silane protecting group in St-NSi2 or St-OSi unit can be hydrolyzed in an acidic solution during the sample work-up step to obtain desirable i-PP polymers, such as i-PP with a terminal NH2 or OH group, in one pot. Despite the low concentration, the terminal functional group is very reactive and can serve as an active site for many applications. One example was shown in a chain extension reaction (coupling reaction) with polycaprolactone (PCL) in solution to form PP-b-PCL diblock copolymers that are very effective compatibilizers in PP/PCL polymer blends. \n Unexpectedly, a Mitsubishi C1-symmetric catalyst exhibits significant polymerization activity even in the absence of hydrogen, indicating that the trialkylaluminum may participate in chain transfer to p-MS (p-methylstyrene) terminated propagating chains. In the case of polymerization using MAO as a cocatalyst at 55oC, the addition of hydrogen increases the activity and regulates the polymer molecular weight. The chain-end structure is solely terminal p-MS. When TEA (triethylaluminium) -treated clay is adopted as an activator and carrier at the optimal polymerization temperature of 75oC, the high concentration of hydrogen suppresses catalytic activity. The chain ends consist of predominately terminal p-MS and a small amount of unsaturated end groups. A higher p-MS concentration or introduction of hydrogen eliminates the undesirable unsaturated chain ends.\nFurthermore, we also study a new chemical route to prepared side chain functionalized polyolefin, especially the desirable MA (maleic anhydride) -modified PE and PP polymers with well-controlled molecular structures. The chemistry involves a post-polymerization process using borane/O2 stable radical initiators to create polymeric radicals that are simultaneously stabilized by in situ formed *O-BR2 stable radicals. The dormant polymeric radicals do not undergo undesirable side reactions (crosslinking and degradation, etc.), but can react with maleic anhydride. Some MAH-modified PP polymers with high molecular weight and controlled MAH content have been obtained. They have been proven to be the effective compatibilizers to improve the interfacial adhesion in the PP/Nylon 11 blends.\nIn a different approach, when dealing with fluoropolymers, a modified iodine transfer polymerization (ITP) method was also developed, based on the combination of a specific radical initiator (2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile, AIBN) and a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process involving two iodo-compounds, i.e., a,\u00f9-diiodoperfluoroalkane (I-Rf-I) and mono-iodoperfluoroalkane (Rf-I). We take advantage of the inactive radicals, created by the decomposition of AIBN, which readily react with the iodo-compounds (chain transfer agents). Pure telechelic fluoropolymers with almost all the polymer chains containing two terminal iodo groups have been synthesized. Using diiodoperfluoroalkane as the chain transfer agent is more effective than mono-iodoperfluoroalkane. In turn, the reactive terminal CF2I groups can undergo facile ethylenation to convert to relatively stable CH2I group or readily transform to imidazolium ions that are very effective in forming fluoropolymer/clay nanocomposite. \nOne major application of functional polyolefin and fluoropolymers is the preparation of exfoliated polymer/clay nanocomposites. The process involves melt or solution blending using functional polymer as a surfactant, namely, chain-end functionalized polypropylene containing a terminal hydrophilic functional group (NH3+) and a high molecular weight hydrophobic polymer chain. The chain-end functionalized polypropylene exhibits very high surface activities and results in an exfoliated clay interlayer structure, even with pristine clay minerals without any organic treatment. Furthermore,  this exfoliated clay structure maintains its disordered state even after further mixing with neat (unfunctionalized) polypropylene that is compatible with the backbone of the chain end functionalized polypropylene. Mechanical property evaluation shows the addition of PP-t-NH3+ in the system remarkably enhanced flexural modulus. These experimental results demonstrate the advantage of chain-end functionalized PP in the formation of an exfoliated clay layer structure and lead to the proposition that the terminal hydrophilic NH3+ functional groups anchors the PP chains on the inorganic surfaces via ion exchange, and that the hydrophobic high molecular weight and semicrystalline PP chains are repelled from the inorganic surfaces and exfoliate the clay platelets.\nThis chain-end functional polymer technology was extended to fluoropolymers, and we have prepared a new family of fluoropolymer/clay nanocomposites that exhibits an exfoliated and uniformly dispersed clay structure in a polymer matrix. The process involves a specific interfacial reagent-chain end functionalized fluoropolymer containing an unperturbed hydrophobic and oleophobic fluoropolymer chain and a terminal functional group, such as Si(OEt)3, OH, imidazolium, or sulfonium ions. The terminal functional group can anchor fluoropolymer chain to the clay surfaces between interlayers, either by a chemical bond (such as a Si-O-Si bond), strong interaction (such as hydrogen bonding and ion-ion interaction) or ion-exchange with cation (Li+, Na+, etc) located on the surfaces between the clay interlayers. On the other hand, the rest unperturbed high molecular weight hydrophobic and oleophobic fluoropolymer chain, disliking the hydrophilic clay surfaces, exfoliates the clay layer structure and maintains this disordered clay structure even after further mixing with a neat (unfunctionalized) polymer that is compatible with the backbone of the chain end functionalized fluoropolymer.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6979], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Zhiming ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhiming", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tze Chiang Chung", "Evangelos Manias", "Ian Roland Harrison", "Ayusman Sen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tze Chiang Chung, Committee Chair", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Chair", "Ian Roland Harrison, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polyolefins", "fluoropolymer", "nanocomposite", "metallocene catalyst"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Modeling Wind Turbine / Tower Interactions within an Actuator Line Model", "id": "26600", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11215", "abstract_tesi": "The wind turbine tower causes time-varying turbine blade loads and wake behavior; however, the interactions of the turbine blades with the tower are not accounted for in state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamic simulations of wind plants.

Austenitic stainless steels have high strength and ductility, as they tend to undergo a strain-induced martensitic phase transformation with plastic deformation.  The thesis focuses on quantifying process-microstructure-multiaxial mechanical property relationships in additively manufactured 304L austenitic stainless steel (SS304L) and developing a physically-based plasticity model for this material that relates microstructural phase transformation to macroscopic mechanical properties.  \nThe effect of processing parameters on microstructure and mechanical properties was studied using pure SS304L walls.  A grain growth model was used to describe austenite grain size as a function of processing parameters and location.  A Hall-Petch relationship was used to explain the effect of austenite grain size and morphology on yield strength.   \nThe effects of chemistry, stress state, and texture on martensitic phase transformation were investigated using walls made using a mixture of SS304L powder and iron powder.  As the concentration of elements that increase the stacking fault energy of austenite decreased, the austenite stability decreased, and the propensity for martensitic transformation increased.  \nMultiaxial mechanical tests, including uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression, pure shear, and combined tension and shear, were performed on the material.  As the primary texture resulted in a higher driving force for martensitic transformation under uniaxial compression than uniaxial tension, the rate of phase transformation was higher under uniaxial compression, which contradicted the trend in texture-free materials.  \nA macroscopic plasticity model is proposed to describe the multiaxial plasticity behavior for the material.  This model makes use of a chemistry-, stress state-, and texture-dependent martensitic transformation kinetics equation to incorporate the effect of martensitic transformation on mechanical properties.  The plasticity model was implemented into a finite element code, and calibrated and validated using experimental data.  The good agreement between simulation and experimental results under the stress states studied indicates the model is able to describe and predict the multiaxial mechanical behavior of additively manufactured SS304L.

My research focuses on estimating the frictions that impede commodity trades and knowledge transfers across countries, and quantifying the consequences of policies that aim to lower these frictions. In both chapters, I build and structurally estimate multi-country general equilibrium models, conducting policy experiments based on these models. However, they emphasize different economic forces that affect the implications of trade and multinational production liberalization.\n\nChapter 1\nMultinational firms play a crucial role in international trade and production. I develop a new general equilibrium model that characterizes multinational firms' export behaviors and quantify their implications for trade and welfare. The unique feature of this model is that it allows a multinational affiliate's export cost to each market to depend on how close this market is to its production location (gravity) and to its headquarters (headquarters gravity). I show analytically that in existence of headquarters gravity the standard gravity equation is not enough to characterize trade flows across countries. The model delivers structural gravity equations that allow me to estimate headquarters gravity from Chinese firm data. The estimates suggest that multinational affiliates face much lower export costs to markets closer to their headquarters. I then calibrate the general equilibrium model to the world of 2001 with 28 major economies. The model fits the multinational firms' exports well both in firm-level and aggregate data. Counterfactual experiments show that if foreign affiliates in China have the same export costs as Chinese firms, Chinese manufacturing exports in 2001 would decrease by about a quarter. Furthermore, I show that ignoring headquarters gravity would substantially bias the estimates of welfare gains from multinational production. Finally, I demonstrate the usefulness of my model in quantifying the impacts of regional trade and investment agreements and the spillover effects of domestic policies.\n\nChapter 2\nI introduce locally external economies of scale in production into a standard multi-country general equilibrium model with trade and multinational production (MP). I provide sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium. The model shows that both the elasticity of trade flows with respect to trade costs and the external economies of scale in production are crucial for the welfare implications of trade and MP liberalization. Via the lens of my model, I separate the external economies of scale from comparative advantage using the event of China joining WTO as an instrument. Counterfactual analysis shows that with stronger external economies of scale in production developing countries specalized in production gain more from MP liberalization.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11975], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Zi ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Ross Yeaple"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Ross Yeaple, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multinational firms", "export", "welfare", "external economies of scale"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "First-Order Methods for Large Scale Convex Optimization", "id": "13485zxw121", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13485", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The revolution of storage technology in the past few decades made it possible to gather tremendous amount of data anywhere from demand and sales records to web user behavior, customer ratings, software logs and patient data in healthcare.

Mathematical programming is an essential tool within these fields, and especially for data mining and machine learning, and it plays a significant role for data-driven predictions/decisions and pattern recognition.\nThe major challenge while solving those large-scale optimization problems is to process large data sets within practically tolerable run-times. This is where the advantages of first-order algorithms becomes clearly apparent. These methods only use gradient information, and are particularly good at computing medium accuracy solutions. In contrast, interior point method computations that exploit second-order information quickly become intractable, even for moderate-size problems, since the complexity of each factorization of a n \u00d7 n matrix in interior point methods is O(n^3). The memory required for second-order methods could also be an issue in practice for problems with dense data matrices due to limited RAM. Another benefit of using first-order methods is that one can exploit additional structural information of the problem to further improve the efficiency of these algorithms.\nIn this dissertation, we studied convex regression, and multi-agent consensus optimization problems; and developed new fast first-order iterative algorithms to efficiently compute \u03b5-optimal and \u03b5-feasible solutions to these large-scale optimization problems in parallel, distributed, or asynchronous computation settings while carefully managing memory usage. The proposed algorithms are able to take advantage of the structural information of the specific problems we considered in this dissertation, and have strong capability to deal with large-scale problems.

In Pennsylvania alone, it is estimated that over 2,500 miles of stream have been impacted by AMD.  Acid mine drainage is formed when sulfide-containing minerals are exposed to air and water, with pyrite (ferrous disulfide) being the most problematic. The sulfur in pyrite oxidizes first to produce sulfuric acid so that emergent mine drainage has high concentrations of Fe(II) and acid. Fe(II) is soluble at low pH, but when mine drainage enters neutral stream waters, the Fe(II) oxidizes chemically to form insoluble iron (oxy) hydroxide precipitates which have a characteristic yellow color. AMD- impacted streams therefore are highly acidic and their streams beds are coated with \u2018yellow boy\u2019 precipitates which smother aquatic organisms. \nThe overall goal of this research is to develop indicators for effective Fe(II) oxidation during passive AMD remediation, which would help mitigate pollution of waterways by AMD. Most passive treatment systems involve passing AMD across limestone beds to neutralize the acidity. However, these systems become inefficient when the treatment bed becomes coated with metal hydroxide precipitates, a condition known as \u201carmoring.\u201d Biological low-pH iron removal from AMD before neutralization could minimize armoring in these passive systems.  Since members of the Acidithiobacillus genus are the bacteria most frequently implicated in low-pH iron oxidation in AMD, the objective of this study was to develop a molecular tool for assessing the relative abundance of acidithiobacilli in AMD under different environmental conditions. Specifically, a functional gene assay for the iron oxidase enzyme known to be present in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was tested on AMD sediments incubated under different growth conditions.\n\tTwo AMD sites in Northern PA with similar mine water and mineralogical characteristics but contrasting rates of microbial Fe(II) removal were identified for this study; one exhibited a high rate (Gum Boot) and the other a lower rate (Fridays-2) of Fe(II) removal. We compared iron oxidase gene copy numbers in sediments incubated in ambient air with sediments exposed to different gas compositions. Primers specific for the iron oxidase gene, designated iro and found in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, were used with Q-PCR to determine iron oxidizing gene copy numbers in the sediments. \n\t This study showed that the iro gene assay could be used to differentiate Fe(II)-oxidizing communities in AMD sediments incubated under contrasting growth conditions. Specifically, our results from incubation trials using sediments from the two experimental sites indicated that microbial populations capable of Fe(II) removal were abundant at both sites, despite contrasting removal rates in the field.  Furthermore, AMD sediments from the Fridays-2 site, which showed low Fe(II) removal rates in the field, were capable of higher rates in the laboratory when provided with the right growth conditions. Our findings with the iro gene assay also indicated that other iron-oxidizing bacteria which do not possess the iro gene appeared to be responsible for a significant amount of Fe(II) oxidation.\nThe findings of this study suggested that the iro assay is useful in understanding microbial community structure and composition of AMD-impacted sites and for tracking changes in iron oxidizing genes under different environmental conditions.  Our improved understanding of microbial communities at Gum Boot and Fridays-2 could be important for remediation of other sites with similar characteristics. Knowing the community composition could aid in selecting suitable solid phase amendments to stimulate remediation. Since communities may also respond to variations in AMD flow rates, altering residence times could be another way to enhance microbially mediated low-pH Fe(II) removal at AMD sites.\n \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4964], "author_name_tesi": "Wanjugi, Pauline Wanjiru", "last_name_ssi": "Wanjugi", "middle_name_ssi": "Wanjiru", "first_name_ssi": "Pauline", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Maryann Victoria Bruns"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maryann Victoria Bruns, Thesis Advisor", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["acidithiobacilli", "iro", "iron oxidation", "Acid mine drainage"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE IMPACT OF TRANSLUCENT FABRIC SHADES\nAND CONTROL STRATEGIES ON ENERGY SAVINGS\nAND VISUAL QUALITY\n", "id": "10016", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5030", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Translucent fabric shades provide opportunities for building occupants to control sunlight penetration for heat reduction, thermal comfort, and visual quality. Regulating shades affects building energy and can potentially reduce the size of mechanical cooling systems. Shades are not normally included in energy model studies during the design process, even though shades potential impact energy use. This is because the occupants normally leave shades closed a large fraction of the time, but models are generally performed with no shades. Automatic shade control is now available, so it is necessary to understand the impact of shades on visual quality and their energy saving potential in order to optimize their overall performance. There are very limited studies that have address shades and their integrated performance on energy consumption and visual quality. Most of these do not reflected modern shade types and their application.\n\nThe goals of this study are: First, to determine the impact of shades on total, heating, cooling and lighting energy savings with different design and operation parameters.  Second, to study and develop different automatic shade control strategies to promote and optimize energy savings and visual quality.\nA simulation-based approach using EnergyPlus in a parametric study provide better understanding energy savings under different shade conditions. The parametric runs addressed various building parameters such as geometry, orientation, site climate, glazing/shade properties, and shade control strategies with integrated lighting control. The impact of shades was determined for total building and space heating, cooling and lighting energy savings. The effect of shades on visual quality was studied using EnergyPlus, AGI32 and DAYSIM for several indices such as daylight glare index (DGI), work plane illuminance, luminance ratios and view. Different shade control strategies and integrated lighting control were considered with two translucent fabric shade colors.\n\nThe results clearly show the benefit of automatic shade control strategies with integrated lighting control over a condition when shades are closed all day. The main contributor to the total energy savings is from lighting energy savings, followed by cooling energy savings. Shades provide greater benefit in a hot climate and in a moderate climate than in a cold climate. Different control strategies provide savings in the range of 7-35% for annual total space energy with higher savings with light colored shades. Control strategies of shades should be selected and optimized based on climate, orientation, window area, and window/shade properties. High performance glazings, when equipped with shades, show lower energy savings when compared to standard glazings. High transmittance/reflectance shades, such as white shades, perform better than dark shades in most of the cases due to higher lighting energy savings obtained with the automatic electric lighting control and the resulting cooling energy savings from rejection of some solar energy and a reduction in the heat from lights. A South orientation showed the least benefit of automatic control of shades when compare to other orientations due to the large fraction of time shades are required to provide visual comfort. Under automatic shade control, energy savings are higher the more often the shades can be raised. The different automatic control strategies present tradeoffs between energy savings and comfort.\nWith regard to visual quality, daylight quality assessments on view, glare, luminance ratios, and UDI can be used to assess shade control strategies. Automatic shade control can increase the number of view hours while controlling sunlight penetration. With automatic shade control, more daylight hours can be provided within the beneficial range of 100-2000 lux compared to shades that are closed all day. For a person facing the window, discomfort glare is likely to increase the more often the shades are raised. Keeping the shades down ensures an acceptable glare condition, but limits energy savings.  Luminance ratios are another metric that can be used to assess shade performance. With white shades, the luminance ratios between the task and proximate surfaces are improved. Dark shades help improve the luminance ratios between the task and distant surfaces. When the shades are left open, even with no direct sunlight in the space, task to window luminance ratios will often exceed 1:10.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5006], "author_name_tesi": "Wankanapon, Pimonmart ", "last_name_ssi": "Wankanapon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pimonmart", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard George Mistrick", "Richard George Mistrick", "James Freihaut", "Loukas N Kalisperis", "William P Bahnfleth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard George Mistrick, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard George Mistrick, Committee Chair", "James Freihaut, Committee Member", "Loukas N Kalisperis, Committee Member", "William P Bahnfleth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["automatic shade control", "fabric shades", "lighting control", "daylighting", "glare control", "luminance ratios"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Peer-mediated Constant Time Delay to Teach Content Area Vocabulary to Middle School Students with Behavior Problems", "id": "9497", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5174", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vocabulary knowledge is essential for reading comprehension and general academic success for all learners.

The hyporheic zone has been referred to as the stream\u2019s liver because of its ability to process pollutants in a zone of extensive biogeochemical activity. Despite the clear relationship between hyporheic exchange and numerous ecosystem services, the distribution of these services (a function of the hyporheic flowpath network itself) remains unknown.  Common techniques to quantify hyporheic exchange rely on solute tracers, where downstream observations are used to infer transport processes occurring upstream.  This type of inverse modeling suffers from a lack of physically meaningful parameters, lack of spatial resolution (i.e., providing only reach-average parameter sets), and results that suffer from a window of detection problem (i.e., the inability to quantify flowpaths at a spatial or temporal scale greater than some threshold, which is itself a function of the experimental design).  Direct observation in subsurface monitoring wells provides spatially discrete subsurface measurements, but lacks an extensive spatial coverage.  Monitoring wells characterize only those flowpaths that directly intersect the well.  Three-dimensional modeling of flow and transport is possible, but model validation and calibration are data intensive, and may not capture heterogeneity that exists in natural systems.\n\nThis thesis presents work using electrical geophysical methods to overcome the limitations of traditional characterization methods.  The first study provides a proof-of-concept in the use of electrical resistivity imaging and electrically conductive tracers to quantify hyporheic exchange.  This study demonstrates the ability to quantify physical characteristics of the hyporheic zone through time and discusses the uncertainty in the method.  Results demonstrate that not only does the spatial distribution of tracer concentration change in the hyporheic zone through time, but the physical size of the hyporheic zone is temporally variable.  The second study demonstrates the use of geophysical imaging to characterize subsurface flowpaths that might be otherwise undetected using traditional geophysical study.  The third study includes four replicate solute injections completed during baseflow recession in a headwater stream.  This study suggests hyporheic exchange is highly variable as a function of catchment wetness, expressed by baseflow.  The fourth study presents a numerical study developed to test the use of temporal moments in characterizing subsurface solute transport processes.  Results of this study suggest temporal moments of both solute concentration and electrical resistivity can be used to characterize solute transport processes.  Finally, the fifth study applies temporal moment analysis to time-lapse electrical resistivity images collected in the field.  This study demonstrates the distributed analysis of physical transport processes in the subsurface.  This body of work establishes electrical resistivity imaging as a tool to quantify stream-hyporheic interactions in the field, and represents a substantial advance in our ability to observe coupled surface-subsurface processes in-situ.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [375], "author_name_tesi": "Ward, Adam Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Ward", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael N Gooseff", "Michael N Gooseff", "Kamini Singha", "Peggy Ann Johnson", "James Michael Hamlett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael N Gooseff, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael N Gooseff, Committee Chair", "Kamini Singha, Committee Member", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member", "James Michael Hamlett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogeology", "geophysics", "hydrogeophysics", "hyporheic", "water quality"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Content Knowledge and Classroom Inquiry Style:  Factors Influencing Inquiry-based Science Teaching Practice of Elementary Student Teachers\n", "id": "8396", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "363", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This comparative case study explores the interface between substantive content knowledge (SCK) of science concepts and inquiry-based teaching of those concepts through fine-grained examination of the inquiry-based science teaching practice of three elementary student teachers who shared the same year-long elementary teacher internship program within a professional development school program involving a major northeastern university and a neighboring school district, and whose student teaching contexts were very similar, including teaching the same unit on light and sound at the same elementary school.  \n\tFour elements were determined individually and analyzed cross-case for the three participants: 1) specific problematic content knowledge-related teaching events that arose during inquiry-based teaching of specific concepts of sound and light, 2) the nature of the three student teachers\u2019 substantive content knowledge (CK) of those concepts examined in terms of depth, interconnectedness, organization and understanding of importance of underlying concepts, 3) their individual classroom inquiry style (CIS) described in terms of eight emergent aspects and representing consistencies in the way individual participants implemented classroom inquiry for teaching multiple science concepts, and 4) their orientations toward teaching science (OTS).   \n\tKey findings indicate that 1) The majority of problematic events exhibited by the three participants related to choosing and implementing important learning goals;

Therefore, in the eastern U.S.A., the identification of factors leading to successful oak regeneration is an area of considerable interest.

Oaks are found in forest canopies across the site quality range; however, the greatest overall growth is found on high quality sites. We investigated if survival and growth of northern red oak seedlings is influenced by lithology by comparing sites with different soil properties. To do so, experimental plantings, were established on soils that vary in both chemical and structural properties having derived from three different geologic formations: sandstone (Tuscarora), shale (Juniata), and shale/sandstone colluvium (Clinton) in Pennsylvania\u2019s Ridge and Valley physiographic province. Over a four-year period, we monitored seedling survival, height, ground-line diameter, and number of leaves. When compared to seedlings growing on sandstone and sandstone/shale colluvium-derived soils seedlings on shale-derived soils had higher survival; however survival over the measurement period declined similarly (p=0.832). Repeated measures analysis indicated that seedlings on sandstone soils were taller than those on shale after four years (p=0.003), while diameter of stems at ground level was similar (p=0.235). Growth of seedlings on sandstone was consistently greater than growth on shale and shale/sandstone colluvium soils for height, diameter, and number of leaves. Higher root electrolyte leakage on these sites may have been due to low base cation to aluminum ratios on shale and shale/sandstone colluvium soils and resulted in stress of seedlings.

A latent-class model (LCM) with covariates is used to separate hunters by their attitudes toward deer hunting, deer damage, and their role as managers of the deer population.  The results indicate that hunters can be separated into general attitudinal categories which wildlife management agencies should consider when designing harvest allocation schemes.  The second essay investigates the feasibility of nonlinear pricing for deer harvest tags which is incentive compatible with hunters who vary by their willingness to pay for tags.  The same hunter survey data from Pennsylvania is used in an ordered probit model to estimate hunter demand for three hunter categories.  A subsequent nonlinear programming model allows a social-welfare comparison between the current licensing system and improved pricing schemes.  The results indicate that welfare improvements of up to 10% are possible.  The third essay investigates the specific policy option of paying hunters to harvest antlerless deer as an incentive.

This study uses data from Projects 1 and 4 of the MIDUS II to examine age and gender differences in using food to cope, how using food to cope is related to global health and weight-related health, and if age or gender moderate the associations.  Principal components analyses and a series of hierarchical linear regressions are used to answer the research questions.  The results of the analyses indicate that using food, as a distinct dimension of coping, is as prevalent as problem-focused and emotion-focused coping, and predicts poorer health.  Younger individuals use more food to cope than older individuals and women use more food to cope than men.  Age and gender interact, as well, and women decrease more steeply than men in their use of food to cope over the lifespan.  Problem-focused coping predicts better self-reported physical health, lower BMI and fewer high-risk markers of metabolic load.  Emotion-focused coping predicts poorer self-reported physical health.  Using food to cope predicts poorer self-reported physical health, greater BMI, weight fluctuation and percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin, and more high-risk markers of metabolic load.

Crop-weed competition causes an overall crop yield loss of 12% annually, costing farmers around $15 billion dollars.  Conservation of weed seed predators may help reduce weed infestations. This practice consists of enhancing populations of natural biocontrol agents that helps limit weed abundance. Ground beetles are one such biocontrol agent. Harpalus pensylvanicus and Amara aenea are omnivorous ground beetles that occur naturally in Pennsylvania and in the Northeast. These beetles are known to feed on weed seeds of species frequently found in Pennsylvania farm fields. Successful integration of seed predation as a weed management practice requires the incorporation of \u201csuitable\u201d cropping systems at specific times throughout the growing season.  By evaluating seed preference, beetle activity density and their relationship to crop phenology and timing of weed seed rain, the importance of weed seeds as a food source to H. pensylvanicus\u2019 survival and its potential impact on weed seed abundance and weed management can be assessed.  This study investigated the 1.) feeding preference of H. pensylvanicus when presented with three common summer annual weeds and its preference for fresh and aged giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Herrm.) seed, 2.) H. pensylvanicus and A. aenea activity density and seed predation in six cropping systems, and 3.) measured giant foxtail seed rain and evaluated the coincidence of giant foxtail seed rain with H. pensylvanicus activity density.\n\nWeed species seed preference experiments were conducted using giant foxtail, common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medikus). The seed age preference experiment focused on fresh and field aged giant foxtail seed. H. pensylvanicus consumed giant foxtail and common lambsquarters seed, but not velvetleaf seed.  When given a choice amongst the three weed species H. pensylvanicus preferred seeds of common lambsquarters and giant foxtail equally over velvetleaf seed. H. pensylvanicus consumed both newly dispersed and field aged seeds but when given the choice, preferred newly dispersed seed. This result indicates H. pensylvanicus would likely target newly dispersed weed seed rather than older seed in the seed banks.\nThe activity density of Amara aenea (DeGeer) and Harpalus pensylvanicus (DeGeer) was monitored during the summers of 2004 and 2005 in five cropping systems and sweet corn (Zea mays L.) having different crop species and levels or timing of soil disturbance. Seed predation was assessed from June to September in three of the five cropping systems in 2005.  In 2004, A. aenea had peak activity density in the beginning of July in a brassica/buckwheat/brassica cover crop rotation. A. aenea was not detected in 2005. H. pensylvanicus activity density peaked in early August both in 2004 and 2005. H. pensylvanicus activity density was unaffected by cropping system early in the summer; however, soil disturbance in the five cropping systems may have influenced beetle activity density in the fall. Cropping systems with little to no soil disturbances had equal or greater activity density than frequently disturbed treatments. This suggests that H. pensylvanicus may not tolerate one cropping system better than another, but may tolerate specific crop types or practices during specific times of the year. Results from the sweet corn (which followed the cropping systems) suggest that the previous year\u2019s crop may not negatively affect activity density in that field the following year. Seed predation rates in the two cropping systems averaged between 38 to 63% and rates in the sweet corn averaged between 38 to 61%. Peak seed predation rates in the two cropping systems occurred in early spring and in August while peak seed predation in the sweet corn peaked towards the end of July. \n\nGiant foxtail seed dispersal was evaluated by seeding on four dates approximately 10 days apart from mid May to mid June and measuring dispersed seed from August through October. H. pensylvanicus activity density was monitored using pitfall traps in foxtail plots over a 72h period. Sampling occurred from June to October. Dispersed seed was quantified every 10 to 14 days and beetle activity density was monitored on 72 hour intervals. In 2005, giant foxtail seed rain began in mid August and ended in late October.  The total amount of seed collected over this period averaged between 12,000 and 18,000 seeds/trap.  Peak seed rain occurred in early October at the two locations. In 2006, seed rain began in late August and did not peak until the Oct. 19 collection, then quickly declined. H. pensylvanicus was most abundant in August. In the foxtail plots in 2006, beetle activity density was more constant with a spike in late August with fewer beetles captured in October and none in November.\n\nH. pensylvanicus activity density does not appear to have coincided with the production of giant foxtail seed in Pennsylvania. Other research has suggested large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis) and fall panicum (Panicum dichotomiflorum) may be better candidates (Brust, 1994) as well as yellow foxtail (S. glauca) (Curran, unpublished).These findings suggest that giant foxtail seed may not be a key food source for the survival of H. pensylvanicus in the Northeast, especially in tilled cropping systems. However, H. pensylvanicus may prefer and may have coincided with other annual weed lifecycles.  Additional research should focus on the phenology of weeds and the timing of weed seed rain in relationship to this and other potential weed seed predators.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4156], "author_name_tesi": "Ward, Meredith Jo", "last_name_ssi": "Ward", "middle_name_ssi": "Jo", "first_name_ssi": "Meredith", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Curran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Curran, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["biological control", "beetle", "management", "weed", "Ecological", "seed predation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Turbulence Intensity Similarity Distribution for Evaluating the Performance of a Small Wind Turbine in Low Wind Speed Regimes", "id": "27277", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11603", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Field tests from June 2013 to September 2014 on a Skystream wind turbine in a turbulent environment (at the Sustainability Experience Center on the Pennsylvania State University\u2019s main campus) were used to study the impacts of turbulence intensity on power performance. Representations of the power curves for small wind turbines do not currently account for impact of turbulence. The study examined the influence of turbulence intensity on the deviations in power output, commonly experienced by small wind turbines, as compared to published power curves such that more accurate predictions in performance can be made for future small wind projects. The first aspect of this study analyzed the turbine\u2019s performance at its location with respect to manufacturer specifications for the Skystream 3.7. The wind speeds were measured via anemometers on the tower at two different heights in compliance with International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards, and were extrapolated to hub height via the Power Law. The data at each 3 s time step were collected via meteorological packages for temperature, air density, pressure, wind speed\nand direction as well as power output from the turbine. This data was then averaged and binned for 1 min intervals. One-minute averaged data was used to explore the distribution of turbulence intensities experienced in wind speed\nbins of 5.00\u00b10.25, 7.50\u00b10.25, and 10.0\u00b10.25 m/s. The resulting turbulence intensity distributions have a similar distribution across these wind speeds and thus it was compared to four common statistical distributions: Weibull (\u03b1 = 2, \u03b2 = 0.11), Gamma (k = 12, \u03b8 = 0.014), Normal (\u03bc = 0.1889, \u03c3 = 0.067), and Exponential (k = 5.2). A goodness of fit study was conducted, finding that a Gamma and a Normal distribution were each the statistically well correlated (with R^2 values ranging from 0.983 to 0.991 and 0.979 to 0.989 respectively). However, based on a visual inspection of the two distributions compared to the tested wind speeds, the Gamma distribution was determined to be the best fit. This finding constitutes a more elegant approach to empirically adjusting power curves for turbulence intensity than has been suggested by previous studies, as well as using a 1 min averaging scale to obtain a better sample of the wind speed and turbulence intensity data experienced at the site and a better representation of the power performance on a more relative scale to the turbulence itself.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11107], "author_name_tesi": "Ward, Nicholas John", "last_name_ssi": "Ward", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan W Stewart"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan W Stewart, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Energy engineering", "small wind turbine", "turbulence intensity", "power performance", "distributions"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "AN INVESTIGATION OF FACULTY INFLUENCE ON PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES AFFECTING THE PERSISTENCE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AT PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY\n", "id": "10965", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5511", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The study investigated the relevance of psychosocial variables as they relate to the persistence of African American students at a predominantly white university (PWU). Although it is difficult to measure persistence (i.e. the desire and action of a student to stay within the system of higher education from beginning through degree completion), this study ranks African American undergraduate student perceptions regarding non-faculty and faculty influenced factors that arguably helps or hinders persistence. Repeated themes arose from the literature review that identified salient factors associated with African American undergraduate student persistence at PWUs.\n \nThe study analyzed the responses of 327 web survey participants. The population of interest is African American undergraduates attending The Pennsylvania State University. The target population was asked to rank the levels of importance placed on psychosocial factors of persistence as perceived by them. The study found that psychosocial variables are significant contributors to the persistence and retention of African American students at PWUs. However, the results do not support that African American undergraduate students at PSU have expectations that are significantly motivated by culture or are significantly affected by perceptions of prejudice and racism as the literature may suggest. \n\nAccording to Berlak and Moyenda (2001), it is widely accepted that teachers of color are fundamentally better equipped to provide culturally relevant curriculum and instruction to students of color. However, the study concludes that faculty behaviors that may be more supportive of African American students are not exclusive to African American faculty. Moreover, the results show that the nonacademic entry characteristics of African American students may have greater effect on their persistence than their social-communicative exchanges at PWUs. For example, students from higher socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds more than likely have already acquired or are more easily able to adopt characteristics that are ideal for persistence (e.g. commitment to personal goals, biculturalism, and intrinsic motivation) than students from lower SES backgrounds. Therefore, it is recommended to consider within group distinctions when conducting racial, ethnic, and cultural related studies in an effort to obtain a more comprehensive assessment of the role of various factors on persistence outcomes. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5502], "author_name_tesi": "Ward, Shakoor A.", "last_name_ssi": "Ward", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Shakoor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edgar I Farmer Sr.", "Edgar I Farmer Sr.", "Robert W Clark", "William J Rothwell", "James B Stewart"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edgar I Farmer Sr., Dissertation Advisor", "Edgar I Farmer Sr., Committee Chair", "Robert W Clark, Committee Chair", "William J Rothwell, Committee Member", "James B Stewart, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["African Americans", "psychosocial variables", "student persistence", "faculty influence"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The broad applicability of adoptive immunotherapy in cancer: optimization through host conditioning and target selection", "id": "26450", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11498", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) holds the potential to cure advanced cancer through selective elimination of tumor cells with cytotoxic T lymphocytes, yet this approach has shown strong clinical efficacy in only a few cancer types. Improving adoptive immunotherapy for solid tumors requires a clearer understanding of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the characteristics of effective tumor targets.  To assess the efficacy of applying ACT and whole body irradiation (WBI) conditioning to solid tumors of distinct tissue origin, we treated mice bearing established SV40 T antigen-induced, autochthonous prostate or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors with the same protocol. The results demonstrate that WBI-enhanced ACT targeting the immunodominant Site IV epitope of T antigen was insufficient to regress tumors in either model. However, we discovered that treatment of established prostate tumors with a second round of WBI-enhanced ACT regressed established prostate tumors through an IFN\u03b3-independent mechanism, indicating that the first round of immunotherapy substantially changed the TME to promote an anti-tumor response. In contrast, treatment of pancreatic tumors with T cells targeting Site IV could not be optimized to drive development of an effector T cell population or eliminate disease. Instead, tumor regression required targeting the subdominant Site I epitope, and application of both WBI and an agonist anti-CD40 antibody to overcome the suppressive TME. Tumor regression was associated with infiltration of the pancreas by PD-1lo donor T cells capable of producing IFN\u03b3, indicating that the TME\u2019s suppressive networks were sufficiently disrupted to prevent exhaustion of donor T cells. Incomplete differentiation of Site IV-specific T cells in mice bearing pancreatic tumors may be explained by decreased availability of Site IV in vivo, since priming of Site IV-specific T cells in vivo required higher amounts of T antigen-expressing cells than did priming of site I-specific T cells.  Analysis of peptide-MHC binding demonstrated that the Site I peptide exhibited greater relative affinity for MHC than Site IV peptide.
